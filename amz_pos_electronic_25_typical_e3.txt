Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought one, two and three of these in the past few years. i bought this one for my son to use at home. it works great, and he can watch his TV, play games etc, and his computer does not get overloaded and he has more free space for the game he likes to play. and it also has a bluetooth so that he can connect it to his iphone and play some games. he loves it. ive had a couple of others, and i dont know how the people that sold them to me could not see that there are only so many places that you can sell this kind of device to. IVE SEEN THIS PRICE BEFORE ON A DEAL AND I WANTED TO BUY IT AGAIN!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This is a good product I purchased this to use on my Macbook Pro. This works great. It is lightweight, compact and works great on my computer. The price is good too. I would definitely recommend this product.  Thank you for sharing this great product with us, The Epson P300. We use it in our office and it has become our new favorite product to use. , I am a techy and this is the best portable bluetooth keyboard that I've found for the Mac. The ergonomics of this keyboard are so much better than a standard keyboard. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6s Plus!!!! This device is a perfect phone for the price. The best phone ive ever had. My friend and i used to have a iphones 6 plus. It was better than the 6 but still a good phone. The 6s plus has more storage and better specs. The only thing i miss about the 6s is the camera. I dont want to pay extra to have the same camera. Also the iphons 6s and iphon 6 is a bit bulky and heavy. Also i wish the buttons and the earbuds came with a case. So my rating is 5/5
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this item to replace a broken LCD. It works just as well, if not better. I have used it to watch my television and the videos I buy from amazon. The pictures are clear and crisp. I am not sure why Amazon doesn't sell the same product but I'll deal with that in another review. The only con is the remote does not have the ability to set the time or change the channel but that is not a deal breaker. I use it on the set top box in my TV and my PC. I really like it. I do have to say that I have seen other reviews that state that this is a very slow device. I had the remote for a while and I can tell that it has a much faster response time. I like that it is small enough to easily take along with me on vacation or for the job.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My wife bought this about 2 years ago. I have to say that the unit works great. We had a very bad experience with our previous electric fireplace. I was very disappointed that we were required to pay a monthly fee to keep the furnace running. This unit is so much better. We are having problems with our fireplace being too hot and not being able to put it out with the smoke alarm. I wish I would have bought this when it was available.    Rated 1 out of 5 by Bob from Does not work with electric fireplace I have a large gas fireplace that I purchased with a built in furnace. I had to replace the furnace when it failed. The replacement came with a furnace switch that works fine for the gas fireplace. The new furnace switch is not an electric furnace switch and cannot be used with the electric fireplace (or any gas fireplace). The furnace switch was not available at the store and the store had no idea how to connect it to the furnace. It did not come with a manual. It is an electrical switch with a switch. It also has a power switch which is a dead end. The store will not take my return or replace it if it is the same model as the faulty one. I bought a new one but I will never buy one of these again. The old one was about a thousand dollars less.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is excellent and very clear, especially when you are driving, but a few notes are a bit too loud for my taste. I would have preferred a little more bass to balance out the treble, but I do think it is still a great purchase for the price. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device  :    I did not find this product to be very pleasant to listen to. The bass is not balanced, the sound is harsh and not very musical, the trebles are too sharp and the highs do not come through well enough. The only reason I gave this 5 is because I have not been able to adjust my music to be better balanced in the trebly range. If this was a bit lower I would give it 4 or even 3 stars. Overall   A good electronic gadget for the money. This device works very well. If you are looking for a cheap sound device this is a good one to get. I recommend this device for its very good sound and good features.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent device, and has exceeded my expectations. I had a very limited knowledge of electronics and the computer science of the microcontroller, but this is the first time I have used a real microcontroller that is more than an IC. It does what I expected it to do: give you the same kind of basic functions that I use on my own. I have no complaints about this device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this device because of the price. I like the fact that the button is not located at the top of the phone, but at the bottom. I also like that you can press the phone hard with one hand while holding the tablet, and still have the screen readable. I do wish that the screen is larger though, as it doesn't fit my hand very well, and the screen gets dirty pretty quickly. I will say that the device is not water resistant, and I would not recommend it as a phone holder because it is so heavy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________________________________________ This device works really well. It is easy to use and the buttons are easy to press. The sound is excellent and the display is bright. I was able to use the microphone and the speaker at the same time with ease. It took me a while to figure out the menu system, but after a while I figured out how to use it. The only thing that is missing is a back button, but it can be programmed to do that in the future.

Top mh1750 Post subject: Re: Amiga 500's vs Amiga 1200's on the market Posted: Thu May 01, 2004 11:30 am Thu May 1, 200411:30 pm I think there are other questions that can be asked regarding the comparison between the 500 and the 1200.   1. Is the Amiga 1000 a better machine than the Amigas 500 and 1200? I mean, if I was to compare the 1000 with a 1200, the 1000 would be at least twice as fast and have a greater RAM capacity.  , it is a very important aspect. There are no major differences between the 1000 and the 500/1200, but, if we want to compare them, we have to keep in mind the following aspects:   - The Amiga 2000 had a slower CPU (1.6 MHz) than the 500, but it had better graphics (8-bit color). I am not sure about the graphics of the Ami 1000, but the Amic 1000 had better hardware. The Amigaos 500 had a 3 MHz CPU, but had better audio/video capability than the 1000.   the Amida 1200 had a 2 MHz CPU and 16k of RAM. The 1000 and 1200 have similar specs, but only the 1200 has better video quality than the other two.   and the Amidabas have a better video card.  . I don't think the Amas are very good for casual gaming. It seems the Amastas have more problems with gamecube compatibility.   to conclude, I am still interested in a new Amiga.   of the two machines, I'd say the Amadasa 1200 is a little better in general, and that is why I am giving the Ama 1000 a good score for the purposes of the comparison.   (I'd give the Amatias a good rating if they had better video cards, but I don´t have any. The video cards are okay. If you don´te have one, you might have to use a TV set for it.)   But if you really want to get the most out of your Amiga, the Amaga 500 is definitely the way to go. I would say it is the machine to get if you want to use it for serious gaming, but that doesn´t mean that you should
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great device for a great price. I am very happy with this purchase. Great value and service:    This is my first purchase with a major electronic company. I was extremely impressed with the service and quality of the items that were delivered.   My biggest concern with my previous purchases with Amazon is the fact that they don't ship until several days after I purchase the item.  This was resolved with this order, as it was a gift, and it was shipped to my house.  Great for students who are learning programming:      It was a great gift for my son. He loves learning programming and was really excited to have a tablet to do it on.  I was also able to customize the software to my own needs, as the tablet is only 4GB so it will only run a certain type of software. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works perfectly. I got the original design and the one with a little more storage capacity but the size is the same and the audio quality is perfect. I can plug in a portable MP3 player and still have enough storage for my records and I can also get a lot of music on the go without it draining my battery. I'm so glad I bought this product!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Just what I was looking for I have used these in my RV for several years now and have been very pleased with the sound quality and overall performance. I am a fan of the iPod touch and I really wanted a device that was going to fit into my travel bag but would also have the same great sound quality I have come to love from the iPod. This is perfect!

It works as advertised and is so easy to read. It does the job it is designed for.  5 out of, 5 from Great for the price. Works great, very easy to setup, no calibration needed. Great for anyone wanting a portable light that's easy on the eyes and that has a lot of light output.  the light comes on strong and is very good quality for the money.  and the light lasts a long time  4 out of5 by KK from This light is awesome! Very bright, small and compact. I love this little light!  3 out of4 by JK from Very nice light for the $$ This is an excellent portable light. It has a decent battery life and a nice white glow. It only has two modes, but the brightness is great. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it's small, light weight, and easy to conceal. It may not be the most durable light, but it's cheap and it will last a long, long time. I bought one just to use for travel and I have yet to use it. I'm still thinking about getting one for my bedroom so I can use it at night.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this to replace my old one because the old one is broken and I was afraid of getting the same problem. The sound quality is amazing, but the volume control is too loud. I was able to adjust it down to a reasonable volume but still would be better if it could be adjusted from the front. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I will buy this again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the second time I have bought this item from this company. I have used it on my new home tv as a second computer monitor. I also have used this as a monitor for a computer and a printer, I would highly recommend this product, the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the box is a little heavy for the size.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I'm very happy with this item. I've used my ebay account to purchase it. It arrived very quickly and works great. I have a friend who works for the government, and they had been using an iPhone for a while now. They love their new iPhone. They are both in the military. The only drawback to this product is the fact that there is no built-in flashlight. You must plug in a 3.7V lithium ion battery. The light comes on quickly, but I find it hard to get it to stay on all the time. The battery lasts for a good 8 hours of heavy use. This is great for my friend. I hope they make a lighter version in the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I got this about a year ago as a gift for my husband. He's a professional photographer and uses it as a secondary device when he travels. I can only think of a couple times he's had to carry it around the house, but I have no doubt that his other gear will take a beating without it. I'm very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it to anyone who has a need for a small electronic device that can be carried around easily.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had the product for a month and I really like it. The sound quality is amazing and the size is perfect. It's a great product that really makes it easy to carry around and get work done.   The only thing that I don't like about the device is the fact that the cable is hard to pull out. You really need to use a screw driver to remove it. This is one of the few that is hard (for me) to pull apart. I just use a paperclip to push it out.   and that's about it for the review!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I bought this because my laptop computer has been broken for several months and I wanted a better keyboard. The key switch is nice, the switch feels like it would last a long time, and the software is easy to use and looks nice. I bought a few more keyboard switches and this one seems to be the best one. I have a HP laptop and the keyboard is a bit too small for my tastes, but I have the same keyboard on this one. Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase and the price is very good. I also recommend that you buy a wireless mouse, because I like using my laptop while I am away from my computer, and this mouse allows me to do that easily.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the idea of having a separate power supply for my laptop and phone. The extra space is great, and it seems like a very solid design. The only thing that doesn't sit well is the fact that the charger is the same size as the laptop, so the battery is always at the bottom of the charger. The phone charger isn't bad either, but the laptop charger is really a good size, and would make a great addition to my computer desk.   Would I recommend this to a friend:   If you're in the market for a good, cheap and sturdy USB power supply, I would definitely recommend this unit to you. I haven't had any issues with the unit so far, and have had it for around 4 months. It is solid, and has a good quality construction. It will last you for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had the H5 and the H6 for a while now. I had the 4100 on the old Macbook Air. I was using a USB to ethernet adapter. The H5 is amazing. It has more RAM, better video, faster internet, and it has USB ports on the front as well. It is very easy to setup. It's a very portable device. I also bought the H2 because it was on sale for $39 and I thought it was a good value for the money. It comes with all the cables you need, a screen protector, and the power supply. It works great. I recommend it to anyone that needs a high end computer for a good price. I will buy another for a friend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is the best portable charger I have ever owned. It is a bit noisy, but that is to be expected with a cheap charger. I also have an old charger, and that one is just as good. I wish they made a charger with an auto shut off feature, like the old Samsung chargers did.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I received this item in a timely manner. I am using it for the first time to get internet. It's very easy to setup and use. It works well. I would buy it again if needed. I did have to buy a new power cord as the one I got was already cracked. However, all in all I am very pleased with this purchase.  Write a negative review about the product: -------------- I bought this item from ebay.com. They shipped it to my address and after about 4 days the package was damaged. The package was also double boxed with no shipping box. I also had the problem of the device not working properly and the screen being unreadable. I contacted the seller and he said that he had shipped it from another location. I asked him about the double box and he claimed that the box was defective and that the return label had been cut off. He did not answer my questions about the damage and the defective box. He then called me back to apologize but when I asked what he was going to do about it, he said he did not have a way to fix it. This is the second time that I had to return this item. The first time I returned it to the seller who refused to return it. I have also returned the item to the ebay site. I do not recommend this seller.    Overall: ------------ I bought a new laptop in September 2011, and had no issues with it until my last two months of use. The screen was very very very bad and was barely readable. I bought the best I could and I was able to get the screen to work but the battery life was terrible. Then I found this item and I'm so happy with the price and the quality of the item. It is a good item, it was well worth the money I paid.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I love the speed of this product, but it does not give me the same sound I am getting from the original Yamaha RX-V675. The new model is way too quiet and lacks in dynamics. I wish I could get the old model back but I cannot.  Best of the Best This is the best sound I've ever heard from a Yamaha! The clarity of the highs, bass, and mids is incredible. It's like having your head pressed up against the sound stage of a concert hall! The sound is clear and detailed, and is not boomy or fatiguing at all. The bass is the most important thing to me, but this unit is pretty good as well. This is by far the best system for playing music, and the sound quality is so good, you can play on it for hours on end without any fatigue. The only down side is the fact that the unit is quite expensive. I was very skeptical about the quality of the speakers, but I think I found my new system.  in a nutshell: If you are in the market for a very nice sound system that you can use for long periods of time, this is your unit. I highly recommend this product to anyone!

I used it to record the amount of food and drink I had in the refrigerator for the day. I was able to do it with my hands and I had no issues. It's really easy to use and set up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because I wanted a wireless remote for my cell phone but had heard a great story about this one from a friend. I was skeptical about the fact that it worked on both my cell phones and a laptop but was impressed by the quality of the product. I got the remote for only $5.99 and was really surprised to see that it works on both cell phones. I like the fact it's waterproof as well. This remote works with the phone and computer. I haven't had any problems with the remote but I will say that I recommend using it with a battery back up. It seems like a very nice remote and I'd recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  I bought this to replace an old one I had for many years and it was great! It has an on and off switch for all the various modes you can change on it. The only problem I had was the battery life was only 30 minutes which is very short. But it did a very good job of saving me from having to have a spare battery on hand. The remote works very well, even with a battery pack.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, February 22, 2014  Excellent product  by A Customer from San Jose CA USA  Pros: works perfectly. . ,  Cons: only lasted a month.  (it is not a good idea to leave it in standby while on the road, I just switched it off).  Review: It works great and is very easy to use.  a minor issue is the remote does not come with it, I bought one at another site and have yet to get a remote from this company so I may have to return that one to get one.  the only issue I had with it was the batteries lasted only 30 min.  at least I got a year out of mine.  or I may just have to wait for a recharge.  be aware if you use it while on a trip that you can easily have the battery drain to zero if you are on the go.  of course I was not able to use the battery for the remote at the same time so it could not do both at the time. so I would recommend if you have the remote to use it with the battery pack so you can keep both.  and another minor issue: the remote is very hard to press to the left side because of the angle of the button. so if you want to press it to the right side you have to press a bit harder. but overall a good product. :)  Good product  the good, but...  By Paul from Bakersfield CA USA. - January 31, 2014 I've been using my remote for years and I love it. I only wish the battery lasted as long as my old one. I do wish the remote came with the batteries, but that's just a minor quibble.  is it a good choice?  View All Customer Reviews
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.......................................................................................This was my first purchase from Kangertech and I have to say, they were awesome. I got this kit because of a recommendation on a fellow member of a vape forum. I've had the original flavor from the vapesupply website and thought that it was good but nothing that you could't find at your local vape shop for a much cheaper price. This kit replaced that and gave me a taste that was great! This is definitely going into my rotation now. Thanks Kangertoys!  My first mod I have been vaping since 2013 and I am so happy to have found Kanger. I love the way the tank looks and how the atomizer looks so it doesn't look cheap and it's really good tasting. The only bad thing is the fact that it's very hard to get juice out of the tank but overall, its great!  and so far so good, this is my first mod and I got the coil mod to replace a cigmod that I had. I have tried all kinds of e-juice and I like this one the best, it's a little bit weaker than other ones but I don't mind, its just better for me.  Best E-juices I've tried. I received the starter kit for my boyfriend, he's a regular vaper. He got the kit on Monday and we went to his job and had some great times together vaping. I ordered the kit because I want to share my experience with other vapers who may be thinking about this product. The kit was well packaged and came with the kit, 3x tank, 2x coil, a nice bottle of juice and an additional bottle of e juice. The coil mod looks very nice and it was easy to assemble. The coils are long enough to give a good hit, and the tank has a nice size to fit in my pocket. The tank has nice airflow so there is no leaking. I will definitely order more products from Kangers in the future. I was very impressed and highly recommend the product. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you.  a little disappointing. I am extremely pleased with this purchase, however the taste was very, very off. It was like a very watered down, bland e-liquid with a really, really light taste. I'm not sure if the flavor is from the coil or the atomizers, or the flavor itself. I do like the taste of the flavor
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using the ez-o-matic since the day it came out and i have to say it is one of the best purchases i have ever made. I used to be an avid audiophile who listened to many different types of music but since I've discovered the e-z-matic I've found I can listen to just about any music i want and the sound is as close to my headphones as i can get. I use it in a stereo set up with my headphones and an mp3 player, and it works very well. The only issue i have is with the battery life which is a bit short. I'm sure there are a lot of other people out there that have this problem but for me, it seems to be a lot more pronounced than most.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device :  The first thing that i want to say is that i have no idea why people are giving this device such a bad rating. For the price you can't beat it. However, if you do not have the budget to get something better (which is not easy to find these days) you may want to give this one a pass. I have a hifi setup that i used to get and use for years and still like the sound. I just wanted to let people know that they can get just as good of a sound out of a $60 device as the one in this review.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The unit worked great for the price. The only thing I can say is that the speaker volume is a bit loud and the sound is somewhat muffled, but I'm pretty sure it's because the unit is a portable and there's no built in amp. I'm going to use this as a backup to my iPad when I need to use it on the road. I'd recommend this unit to anyone looking for a small and portable computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- This is a good thing. This is the first time I'm having to buy a separate device for a friend who had a bad experience with my previous one. The product works perfectly and is worth the price.  What do you think? Should I buy the Smartphone version? Yes - I would buy this again. I like the fact that you can have it on me and not have to use a case.  a lot of people like the idea of having a smartphone on your wrist. I have to have one but it takes a lot longer than it should. I don't know if it's a good idea.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used the Pico 3 for years. I am very satisfied with the quality, and ease of use. It has worked flawlessly with every camera I have tried, and with every lens that I've tried, including the expensive and much less reliable Canon and Nikon lenses. I use a very wide lens, which works with this device just as well as the much more expensive Canon. It is easy to mount to the lens, and very stable. The only thing that could be better is the ability to control shutter speeds. I do not understand why Canon does not allow you to select the speed at which you want the lens to open, and for how long. If you want a very fast aperture, you must change the speed control on your camera to stop down, which takes a bit of practice, and I did not understand that until I started using the P3. But if you want an open aperture, but a slower shutter speed, you can change the aperture control to "stop down" to f/5.6, and then the shutter speed can be set by the camera to any speed you want. The P3 allows you to do that, and does it very well.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: nikitos

This monitor is a very good value for a lot less than a comparable 40-inch monitor. The price is not too bad and the picture is fantastic. The viewing angle is good, but I found it difficult to read text on the screen at an angle. There are no problems with the display and the sound is adequate. If you are a graphics artist or gamer, you should be able to appreciate this monitor. If not, then you might not find much value in it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the e-cigarette for a couple of months now, and i really like it. i'm very happy with my purchase and the service i received from the vendor. i would highly recommend this product.  I am a smoker and my husband is a non smoker. We both enjoy e-cigs. We decided to try this one, because my husband has tried other brands and found them unsatisfactory. I found the product to be very pleasant. It tastes like a cigarette, and is smooth, with a nice vapor. The battery lasts a long time.  and the price is so reasonable for a good quality product. The e-liquid was very good and they even sent me a replacement if I needed one. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love my iPad 2, and the new iPad mini. I have been using my iPad for work and pleasure since it came out, and it has become my primary computer. The new models are thinner and lighter, which make them easier to use, and have great software and games. I also like the battery life and the great new keyboard that came with the iPad 2. I was originally looking at the new model of the iPad mini and decided to go with the new version instead. I still love my iphone and my  iPad, but the new models look and feel so much better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Excellent purchase and very good quality --------------- The sound quality is amazing --------------- No glitches --------------- Very fast shipping --------------- I will order from you again ---------------  I purchased this product about a month ago. I'm using it for a hobby of recording video and I love it. I bought the sound quality was amazing. I was surprised with the price too.  Rated 4 out of 5 by kjw7 from Good, but has issues This is a good sound recorder. But the sound has some issues. The microphone that comes with it is very small and flimsy. It tends to fall out a lot and sometimes won't come back into place. Also, the volume control can be difficult to use sometimes because it is quite sensitive to the adjustment. Lastly, there are no buttons on the side of the unit so you need to use the volume button to adjust the volume.

It's a good looking laptop, but it's also got a lot of power. I'm not going to use this laptop all the time, but when I need it, it's pretty good. I use it mostly for a lot work, such as video editing, photoshop, and web page layout.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound is great. I like the EQ feature. I don't think you should have to listen to your music through headphones when you're traveling. I'm a commuter and I need my ears to be able to hear my music and get some peace. I've never been able to get good sound in the subway.   It is definitely loud in the car.   in a good way.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________ The new Sony Walkman X is the greatest audio device I have ever owned! I have had the previous generation for almost 5 years and this one is just as good as the previous model! It has been on a mission to find the best sounding audio devices and it found it! I can't even begin to tell you how pleased I am with this device! I love my new Walkman and the best part is that I never have to worry about it going out or being damaged. I have it in a little white Sony Walkmans that I bought for my son's room and they are just as nice as the one I am having. ______________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.................................. I just purchased this device as an inexpensive way to add a little entertainment to my room. I'm so glad I did! The sound is crystal clear, and the volume is right where I need it. The controls are easy to operate, and there's no flinching on the screen when you turn it up. It also doesn't have a built-in speaker, but you can connect an external speaker and it works fine. Overall a great purchase.   The sound is very clear, I can't get over the clarity. The sound was better than the other sound I've purchased.   (Posted on 3/2/2011)  Great little speaker This is a great little speaker, I have one in my studio that is perfect for me and it's pretty big, this one is about the size of a regular CD player but smaller. It's a little loud but I'm sure that's just the way it is. I have the sub woofer that comes with it, it's a decent one, but not great. I use it for some background music for my band's shows and I think it works great. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the subwoofer comes with a small cable, I'm just not sure it would work well with a big speaker like this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________ The price for this device was very good, very well made and works very well. I just received mine a few days ago and I'm so impressed. I was looking for a good quality digital audio interface, that can be used for studio or stage recordings. I found it here. I would recommend it to anyone who needs an excellent quality interface.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Nice device, great value I've been using an Audio Technica ATR2292USB 2 channel digital audio recorder for some time now and I have to say, the ATR has never disappointed me. I like the convenience of having it on the desk and the ease of use. The quality of the sound is very good and it is easy to use. I'm looking forward to using the USB 2 for recording and mixing my vocals and guitars, and the interface is also great for editing. I recommend this product to anyone looking for something that will last for many years to come. ,, my only complaint is that there is no USB port to charge it. You have to use an AC adapter for that. I also wish that the interface had an option to record via mic/line, but then you're going to have to take the battery out. Otherwise it's an excellent product. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This unit is a wonderful value. I've used it for several years and it works very well. I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an inexpensive, very easy to use portable, yet powerful unit. I have found that the unit has a fairly high output for its size and price. It has a very low input impedance, which is perfect for portable use. I'm very happy with this unit.

If your looking for a media player that plays most audio formats, this device is a great one. I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Great purchase, I have several of these, but this is the one I use most. I use my i3, i5, and i7 laptops to do many things at once. The touch screen is great, and my touch pad is pretty good too. I also love that you can have the keyboard and touch pad on the top of the laptop. Very nice touch screen. My only gripe is that the USB port is a bit annoying to use, but I just put a small strip of conductive tape over the port to help.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave from Excellent I've had the T450 since late 2016 and I love it. I've used it in both of my offices with no problems and it's still going strong. I don't have a computer for everything, so this makes it easy to connect all of my laptops to my workstation. The laptop is fast and powerful, so there's never a moment where I don`t have everything I need. I have it connected to a desktop and an XBox One so I can stream to both.  of the top five, I'll go with this one.  a must buy I've tried and used many of the laptops that come in the other review sections and I still use my old Dell T430. I love that the Dell laptops are small and easy to carry around. I'm on the fence about whether I should get the T530 or the T460s. I like that the T440s is cheaper than the T430 but has a lower resolution screen and less memory. I wish it had more memory but I also want to be able to have two full size hard drives so it can be my main system for my business. The T430 has been my go to computer for almost a decade. I can't imagine having to buy a new laptop and buying an old one. I bought this one to replace my T430 which has been replaced a few times. This laptop is a joy to use. It's a pleasure to have everything connected to my computer, which is my primary computing device. The only thing I'd change is that I'd like to see an option to buy memory on the side of the screen so I could have more than 4GB, but that's just me. I'll still be buying this Dell for years to come.

Now the HP dvd player is working just fine. Thanks HP

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【K3】 (The best)  by Mark S. from New York, NY USA  Pros: The most responsive mouse I've used. It has a very light weight and feels very comfortable. The scroll wheel feels very smooth and responsive. Very quiet, no click noise when moving. I can comfortably use it all day, and even on long flights. The battery life is excellent. I highly recommend it.  Cons: None.  the only complaint I have is the fact that the trackpad can only scroll up and down a small amount.  in general this is a good product that is worth buying.  of course the software is still buggy as it is in most of the android devices, but I'm still very satisfied with the product and the software as well. . ,,,,  Review of the K3 by Mark S from New Yorker  This is the first mouse I have ever used that is more accurate than the mice in the same price range.   I was surprised by the accuracy, as I thought most mice on the market were way over-sensitive. The only problem with this mouse is that it can only move left and right a little. This makes it hard to get precise movements when you are trying to move an object across a room.  : The only con I had was the scroll wheel was a little noisy, but not much. I don't think it would bother me if I didn't use this mouse very often, but for me it is a little annoying to be constantly moving my mouse back and forth.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to take along for a trip in Alaska in the dead of winter. The batteries last a long time. I'm surprised I didn't get a better price on the used unit I bought from Walmart for $20.  Best value on a small battery for an ice axe - February 18, 2016 - February 19, 2016 Anonymous Reviewed By: Bought this to use with a smaller, ice axe-type device (not a pry bar) that I bought. I use it with my other tools in my pack. It is very lightweight, small and very reliable.  in the hands of an experienced archer this axe is very effective and durable, a good price for a good axe.  on a snowshoer this axe was very effective, but I had to sharpen it because of the small sharpening stones. the sharpening was not easy with only one tool. . This axe is a great buy! It is compact and is extremely light. I am looking forward to buying more to use for other purposes as well. ,  , and this axe's construction and construction materials are top notch. This is an excellent tool. I have purchased several of these axes from Snow Wolf and they all work flawlessly and the quality is excellent. I recommend these axes highly to all.    ,,,,  I recommend this axe to any archer. The axe is compact enough to carry in a pocket or small bag. The aluminum shaft is easy to sharpe and the grip is excellent for the hands. The grip is also a good size and provides a comfortable grip when holding the axe in your hands. I like that this axe can also be used as a prying tool with the small, yet sharp, stones. The blades are also very durable and will not dull as quickly as some other axes. I've had mine for a couple years and it still performs flawlessly.  the price is great for a quality axe, great value for the money.  The axe itself is very light weight and it has a lot of uses for a very small, lightweight package. I also like the fact that it's small and portable, but with the use of the sharpener you can sharpen the edges on the sides. The handle is the best part of the axe because it's very comfortable to hold. I would definitely recommend this product.  to help a new archer out this is a good product to buy
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality of this speaker is very good, but the sub woofer is a bit weak for a 2.1 system. This is a really nice speaker, but is the subwoofer too weak? It's very difficult to get a clear sound from the sub when you have the speaker at full volume, and even worse, when the speaker is off! I recommend the Rane AV300 subwoofers if you are looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, subwoosh with lots of power. I am using mine in my system and am very pleased.  I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend this product to anyone.

I have used an iphonelove i phone for years. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it has a tiny little screen compared to the iPhone. I like the music player and the phone app. The speaker is weak but is better than no speakers. The charger is a little small and doesn't fit in my pockets very well. But I've had it longer than the iPhone and it still holds up.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Good for my small needs. I use it for a few hours at a time. I have a 3D printer which needs some attention and the G-spot stimulator is perfect. The only thing that I wish it had is a larger battery. But the features it does have are very good. I am a little bit of a gadget snob but I think this will be the last time I buy anything from the company.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My favorite thing about this product is the build quality and the price point.   I have an iphone 4 which is more of a "traditional" cellphone but the iphones 4S has a better sound and is easier to use.  It is smaller, lighter, more portable and has a good camera.  I am a musician and a musician needs a great sound system.  The iphona 5 is an excellent sound system for music.  My only gripe is that I wish there was an additional battery pack on the bottom of the unit.  Other than that, it is a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ I was a bit skeptical when I got my G7 Cube, but it's a wonderful cube and is a bit bigger than I thought it would be. The cube is quite smooth, and it feels good in the hand. The only issue I have is that the sticker design is pretty weak and you can see a lot of it sticking out of the cube. I would probably get another one but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get this one to be as sturdy. The price is a little high compared to other cubes, but I think it's worth it if you like the look and feel of a good G-cube.  1 of 1 customers found this review helpful Excellent Cube I really enjoy my G5 but was looking for something a little different. The G7 was perfect! I really like the size and feel and the stickers are awesome. The rubber is a tad more tacky than the G5. The lube is the same as the G7 too, and that's just awesome. I recommend this to anyone who wants a great cube for a decent price. The stickers are also a bit better than the plastic ones. Definitely recommend this cube to anyone looking for a good quality cube at a reasonable price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Sound Blaster ZxR-3 is a really good and efficient sound card. It is extremely stable, doesn't get noisy and is very quiet. I have a PC with this sound card installed and I have yet to hear any noise.  I have had to use a couple of cheap external USB sound cards but they still have the same problems with sound. _____________________________________________________________ Check out my YouTube channel!  Please subscribe to my channel for more videos and other reviews! _____________________________________________________ The Soundblaster ZxX-8 is the best sound card I've ever used, especially the sound quality! I bought this for my new computer because I have my old computer, the old Soundblasters, which is only good for some games on Windows.    I bought the Zx8 because I can play most of my computer games on my iPad.  I like the ZX-x8 better than the sound card that came with my old PC.  I love the Z-8 so much because it is so easy to use and so much better than my old sound card for playing games.  The Z-xX8 is so much easier to use than the old soundcard because it has a built in sound card!   The old sound cards were made by the company that was later bought by Microsoft.  And the old ones weren't that great to begin with!  The Zx-xx8 has a lot more features than my older sound card but I still use my old one for some computer games. The ZX8 has so many features that I can't even list them all here.  This card is amazing!  It is the most perfect sound card you can buy!  If you're looking for a high quality sound card, the Z8 is it!  And if you're trying to save money, I can see no better sound card than this one!  I have used the Z9, Z10 and Z20 sound cards and they have all been very good, but the Z20 was a bit on the noisy side, but not as loud as the Z X8.  If your looking for the best, this is it!!  And you get all the features that other manufacturers don't have.  My only suggestion is to get the 8 pin to 6 pin adapter.  That will save you a lot of money and will make it easy to upgrade the sound board
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! I have used a different one from a different brand before and I am a bit nervous to try the new one out because I've been burned on them. But after using it for a while, I'm happy that it's working. And I'm glad I have another one to share with my friends who like electronic devices too. It's a good little device that I think I'll keep for the time being.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Gail from Not the best I'm not a fan of the "push to talk" feature. I can't speak to the battery life, but I do think it is pretty noisy for the price. I have been using it since it was first released and it is very noisy even when turned off. I just bought a new laptop, so this is the second laptop I'm going to buy from Ting. This time, I'd like to wait to buy it until after I finish the purchase, as the first one I got was defective. The first thing I did when I got the first laptop was to use my phone to "lock" the screen. This is an important feature, as my wife doesn't like me texting and when I'm on my own, she can see my face and sometimes even my words. If you're not concerned about "push-to-talk" features, this is a decent price for a good quality device. I really like Ting's service. They were very prompt in responding to my order. The price was good and shipping was free. I will continue to shop here and recommend it to friends who are looking for a new device to replace their old one. , and I like the fact that it has the capability of talking back to you when you call, so you can communicate without taking your eyes off the road. It is also loud enough to get your attention even when you're driving, which is very important for a phone.

The case is not that great though and there is a very tiny gap for the micro usb to stick out the side of the unit. I'm happy with the purchase and my only regret is that I don't have this unit in my office.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Does the job I am a sound engineer and I have used this to connect a couple of audio interfaces and the sound quality is good enough. The main downside is that you need to be a little more careful in placing the wires in order to avoid a short. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this after looking around on line for the best electronic timer I could find. I have always liked the simplicity of a timer, but wanted one that was as good as possible. This is it. I can set it for different amounts of time, and adjust the interval as well as the timer to my liking. It is very easy to use, and the quality is very good. The only thing I would change about it is that I wish it had a little bit more capacity. It has a 5 year warranty. It works great.

I would recommend this product for a beginner to get started with a microcontroller and a web interface.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************** I bought this as a Christmas present, and it was perfect. The battery lasts longer than I thought it would. The controls are nice, and there's an app for that. I've also used it to play my music in the car and it works great. I was going to buy a separate iPod dock for my car, but I was able to make a custom one for about $15 using the parts that came with this dock.  Good but not as good as the iMac: ********* I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. It has the power of the i Mac and the convenience of a bluetooth keyboard. The screen is bright and bright. The sound quality is decent, though it's not very good. I would have preferred a larger screen, and a blu ray player.

The user interface is intuitive, the text is very clear, and it's really easy to navigate the library. I've found that if I have multiple devices, I can get by with one of the devices because it's more than sufficient. It's worth the price too!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought this thing a few months ago to replace a broken TV. It works perfectly. No more cable box or antenna. It is so simple and has a very bright display. This is a great deal! ---------------  Product: Yes, it works fine. I needed a portable TV/DVD player and I was looking for something with a good picture. I decided on the apple TV/ DVD Player, but the reviews for it were not good. I have a brand new Apple TV and it works perfectly and looks great too. I am not sure if the price is right, but this is a nice alternative. I do not like the remote, but at least I am able to play movies from the DVD player on the tv. ---------------
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I was using my old LG T3 mini from 2005. After several months of using it to connect to my tv to watch movies, I got a newer model from an online store. I have not used the new model but it seems to be a better device. I also bought a new TV set from another company which is great. I really like the new tv set. It is better than my old one and the best part is that I get a good price for my new tv. It seems to have a much better picture and sound than the old tv. I do not use the tv much because it is so good.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:

I have never had such great results with battery life and charging. I'm an amateur photographer but my cameras have become quite a pain to use. This charger makes them work just fine and this charger will be in my tool kit for years to come.  Rated 5 out of 5 by R. from Excellent product This is the first charger that has done it for me in my years of using chargers. I use my laptop as a camera as well as a wireless computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use a Koss PortaPro (KP) 3.5mm plug adapter and have been using it to connect my Koss Audio Technica MP3 player to my iPhone 5s for several years now. The adapter works great and the audio quality is fantastic. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the adapter is quite a bit more expensive than the Apple Lightning cable and the only reason it's not five stars is that it's a little thicker than I would like it to be. Other than that, it's perfect and the quality is better than you'd expect from a $15 adapter.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I just bought this and i love it! It's so light. I've never been able to find a good wireless keyboard, and this is the best. i'm typing on it almost every day now. It's the only keyboard that i have ever used that can make my laptop run faster. The keys are nice and smooth, and the mouse buttons work great. I also love the light. It doesn't take much to turn this off or on.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Michael from This keyboard is so great! It is so comfortable, and i've used other keyboards and none of them have lasted long. I can type at my office almost without stopping. The only thing is it does not have a mouse button on the right side, so if you have a right handed person, you will have to adjust your grip to compensate for the thumb. Other than that, it is so good and so much better than the laptop. I have bought 2, and it has lasted a year. I highly recommend this keyboard!  Review of DJM-S1000 Wireless USB Keyboard from EAGLE  This product is a great value and the quality is top notch. The keyboard is very light and the USB is very quick. The one thing to note, is that the left mouse button is not functional. The left button is used to select a folder or to enter text in the field at the bottom of the screen. The right mouse button can be used to scroll up and down or enter text. I don't know if the button is only left for the left hand or if it is for both hands. I would love to see a wireless keyboard with a mouse function but this one is functional.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I have this as my primary keyboard. I have two computers with different brands and have always used the same one. I bought this as an upgrade to the one that came with my other computer. I've had it a few weeks now and have to say I'm happy with it. I was worried about the cable length since it's the same as the one I already have. However I found that the cable was about as long as I wanted it to be so I didn't worry about it being too short. The layout is a little different than my other keyboard and I like it. It is much easier to type on than my old one and I've already made a few new friends that use this keyboard. If you are looking for a nice electronic keyboard I would suggest this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________. This is the first device i have used in a very long time. I have used my old one for a very short time and it had a short circuit and burnt out the battery in the process. This one is much more durable and is very well built. The only issue is that it is so much bigger than my old phone, so i have to hold it like this with my right hand and it takes a while to get it off. I am really pleased with the battery life. Also the price is really great. _______________  Review of DJI Phantom 3 Professional Quadcopter by DJIUSA on April 26, 2015. DJI has done it again with this new quadcopter. The Phantom 3 Pro is a beast of a quadcopters, it is a lot more powerful than the previous version and is capable of filming video in 4K. This new version of the Phantom 3 is also waterproof and has a new camera system. The video quality is amazing, it shoots 4K at 30fps and the camera is capable at 720p at 30 and 60fps. The price is great too, at $799 you are not going to find any better quality for the money. If you are looking for a drone this is definitely worth checking out, it also has a battery life of over 4 hours and you can get the Phantom 4 Pro which has a better camera system for more money. I recommend this quadcopTER to anyone looking to get into the world of aerial photography, it has everything you need to get started. It is a very powerful drone that is extremely easy to fly and control, I would highly recommend it. DJI USA

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* This product is very easy to use and set up, I got the wireless bluetooth version which is more expensive but it has a better range, and is better quality. I would buy it again for sure. I am happy I got it. *****  How is this product different from the original Bluetooth headset? I bought this because my bluetooth headset was in the trash, and I wanted a new one. The product looks very similar to the original, so I was hoping that the battery life would be longer. But I have not had any problems at all with this one. I have only had it a few days but the battery has not died yet. I can also tell the difference because the original is made of plastic, and this one is metal. The original is very light and easy to carry around, the new one is not. It takes up way more space in my bag, and the buttons and volume control are on the side of the unit. The buttons also don't work when the battery is running out.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! This is a very good product. I like how the battery has a built in charger so you don't have to mess around with a power outlet.

I don't know why they didn't make it a universal charger or something.

I just got the keyboard and the mouse today and they are both amazing. It's a real pleasure to use. The only problem I have is the memory card slot on the side is very hard to get into. I don't have a lot of space in my computer but I have to plug the memory in just right. I think it should have been built into the machine.

Yes No Wednesday, September 13, 2016  Works as described  by David from Las Vegas NV USA  Pros: Light, durable, good sound quality  Cons: None  Review: I had been waiting for a good portable DAC for a while, and this one was the best deal on Amazon. I was looking for a portable DAC that could handle a good bit of music (I'm an audiophile and it takes a lot of headphones to get the best sound out of my Sony MDR-V6), but it also sounded great. I could plug in my iPod and listen to the music in my car, or on my computer. , I am very happy with this purchase.  the only thing I wish it had was a mic. I am trying to use the computer speakers, but I need to do it outside. 's mic quality is just okay. the noise reduction is good, but not perfect. Overall, I would buy this again.  a very light portable DAC with a great sound quality. . -David  Did you find this helpful? 4 of 4 Found Helpful  Randy from  7  Reviewed by:from USA. on 4/25/2016

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The device is easy to use and has good range, which is a bonus. I've also been able to find some useful apps on this device that were not available from the Apple store or Google Play. Write a negative review about an electronic device  :    I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I like the idea of a remote, but not a remote that is so small that it is hard to use. I wish there was a way to add additional functions to the remote.  It would be great if they could add a digital camera function.  Write an honest review about your experience with a device:     I was not impressed with the performance of the remote, and I wish it would come with a USB adapter so that I could connect it to my computer.   I'm a beginner to electronic devices.  I purchased the Remote Control for my iPhone.  The device has good features, and the remote does have a very nice design.  However, the remote is very small and hard to maneuver.  It is easy for my younger sister to hold it with one hand and manipulate it with the other.  My older brother has a similar remote but is much smaller and easier to handle.  As a beginner, I would recommend purchasing the remote if you have an iPhone. I would also recommend purchasing a USB cable if you do not already have one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!   This was a great purchase. I am so pleased with the ease of use of this device. I have it connected to my computer and have been able to do a lot of things I had thought I couldn't do. I can now get up from my computer desk and move around without having to reach for a mouse and mouse pad. The buttons are very easy to use and the volume controls are very good. It is very quiet, and it is very durable.   I have just received the Bose QuietComfort 20. The unit arrived within 3 days of purchase. The case is nice, but the box is a little flimsy. It looks like the packaging could have been better. The speaker/mic/remote/power cord all fit neatly in the box. The only thing that seems like a little loose is the power cord. The cord is in a pretty good position and should not have come loose when I placed it in the case. I don't think the cord was going to come loose without me pulling it out.   and the only thing i dislike is that the case comes with a power cord that is not included. the cord itself is about as long as the power cable but a little short. I think if you are looking for a case and want a long cord, look elsewhere. Overall a good buy.   is a great product. i am very happy with it. the only complaint i have is the fact that there is no power cord included.   "Great sound with a very small package." -- John G.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using the V-USB for about a month now. It is a good size and works well. I haven't had any issues with the cable, the buttons, or the USB ports. The only thing I don't like is that there is no indicator light when you are not charging the phone, and there is nothing on the side of the phone to tell you how much power you have left. The battery is a decent size, so if you are constantly charging, it's a great value. I love the design of this USB charger. The buttons are a little bit large but not enough to bother me. There are 3 USB ports on this charger, but they don't connect to the phone. So you are left with a USB-C connector on the end of the cable. This means that you will have to purchase a USB adapter to use this USB-A charger with a phone. I have used the USB-to-C cable that comes with the VX100 to charge my phone, but that cable doesn't connect easily to a phone because it is too long. It doesn't fit very well in the phone or the adapter that comes on the V100. If you are trying to charge a phone, I would recommend this cable. If not, just get a USB to C adapter. I really like the fact that the cable doesn`t have to go through the phone (as you can see in my photos). I also love the fact this USB port connects to the USB power port on my computer (as seen in my picture below). This means you can charge both your phone and computer at the same time, which is great. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

If you need a laptop for work then this is a great purchase. I purchased this to replace an old Dell Inspiron, but the new model is better. I was initially disappointed that the new Dell had a lower-resolution display. After a week or so, I got used to it and I actually prefer it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this device to replace my old, poor quality "Battlestar" which was giving me serious pain. This device is so much better. I am using the "Lapis" now and love it!  Good product: I use the device for the last 5 months. I use it for my eyes. It is so light and works like a charm.  This product has become part of my daily routine: I have been using this for a few months now, and I absolutely love it. It has a very comfortable, soft touch, and is very comfortable to use for prolonged periods. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it has a tendency to fall out of my face and the charging case is a bit too small for the size of the device.  and it is just the best : I've been using the BV (lapsule) for the past few weeks and I can honestly say it is the best product I have used. It's soft and easy to use, and it does what it claims to do. I'm not sure if I'll ever use anything else from this company.  the best: I've tried many different types of lip balms and this one has been the best I have tried. , I love this lip balm and have been purchasing it from you guys for years. I have a very dry and sensitive lips, but have to be very careful to not over use lip balme. The BV is great for keeping my lips soft and moisturized, but if I am going to put on any kind of lotion, I use a lip balmer instead. I've used the Bv for years and love my BV and my lip balmo. This is my favorite lip balmm. It works well and doesn't break me out. 1 of the best lip balmis I've ever used : I really like this lipbalm. It does what its advertised to do, moisturizes my lips. It comes in a small bottle, but I use 3-4 of them at a time. I also love the small plastic case, which makes it easy to carry around. I do have to say, however, that the lip balmal is a little too light for me. The color isn't really "peachy", but it's a nice pink. It would be great if it was a bit more pinky. I can't speak

I also like the weight of the unit as I have been using the one that is larger in the past and not liking the size. I'd rather use it as a small backpack with an external battery and an external charger. The only thing I don't like about this one is the microphone. I have the v1 model and I have a really good one, but this one isn't very good and it's loud. I use a good mic and I prefer the larger one but this unit has the microphone on the back and it doesn't work as well. Overall, it's a good unit and I'd recommend it.

I was in the process of getting a new computer, but this is much better than my old one. I love the music program. I think this is a very good value.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best of all times. I am always looking for the best technology. I bought the SONOS 3D surround sound and a 3d sound bar to go with it. My son and I both love it. It has taken our whole house to a whole new level.  The best sound bar I've ever heard. The sound quality is amazing. The surround sound is amazing too.  I have a stereo system, which is a Sony DSP receiver and a Sound bar. I had the idea to get this sound bar, because it sounds so good on a stereo. My only con is that it's a bit hard to set up, but that can be fixed with a good video tutorial. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. "The best of all time"
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great sound, great look, nice buttons. This is a very good product for the price. It is a little bulky but worth it. It works really well with a stereo, I would like to see a USB port for charging as it is very heavy.  It is not an ios device and does not work on my ipod touch. I bought it to replace a faulty iphone. It was a very smooth operation, the only problem is that the power button is hard to find. I would recommend this to everyone and a must buy for the cheap price. Write a negative review about an awful electronic device  :   This is the worst iphony I have ever seen.   I wish I could take it back to Apple and get a full refund for my money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have owned a few different models of this, but the current model is the best value.  The speakers are very loud, and are much better than I had expected from such a low price.    The battery life is great, and the battery indicator LED lights up in a bright light. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a good thing that a device of this type is now available for the home, but I would not be so sure that it will ever catch on. If you want a digital camera that you can take anywhere, you can get one now. It is a very nice camera and you get a good image quality and the only problem is that the battery life is short. If I were a betting man, I would say that within a couple of years this will be the most popular electronic camera on the market.  As of now I will continue to use my SLR and will probably get a digital camcorder in the next couple of months.   I really enjoy this camera and it is a nice size for its size. I like the fact that you don't have to be a professional photographer to use it.  It is easy to use and has a great image quality.

I love the fact that I can plug in my cell phone, my ipod and my tablet all at the same time.

Yes No Tuesday, September 04, 2014  Nice little gadget, but needs a good case  by Chris from San Antonio TX USA  Pros: Compact, convenient, very portable.  I like that it's compact and convenient to carry. I use mine on a daily basis in my office. The battery life is pretty good. .  a good small portable unit  Cons: If you have the case it's a bit flimsy and a bit loud.  (i.e., it's too loud to be heard by anyone in the room when not in use)  Overall: I have used my ______________ several times, and have found it to be a very good portable unit. I do think it could be a little bigger and louder, but that's a small complaint for a device this small and this portable. It's great for on the go, and I'm happy with my purchase. ,  Review: I like the fact it's small, but I also have one that is twice as big. The _______________ has no case. I find it quite annoying to be carrying two chargers in my handbag and not have a case to put them in. But, it's good as it is. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the sound of the unit isn't as good as I would like. It sounds a little "loud".  I like the device itself. It does what it's supposed to do, which is to give you an easy and convenient way to recharge your cell phone and ipad while on the move. It is also easy to charge the battery while on your travels. I like it so much I plan on buying another one just to keep in my backpack. : I think I'd be happier with a larger case for the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the moksha 1 for a month now. the moksa 1 is very sturdy, durable, and easy to use. i can carry it anywhere i want and the only con i have about it is that i wish the moka 1 would come with a usb cord and charger. but other than that its a great product and a great value.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from great product this is a great unit and a lot of fun to use  5 out of 6 by Anonymous From great to great I bought the moku 1 about 3 years ago. I have always used the moko brand and the mocap style of dance. I like the idea that you can change settings, add new effects, and even set the mocha's to run on your computer. This is one of the best dance machines I've ever seen. The moka software is fantastic, and the machine is very easy to set up. I really recommend it, especially if you like mocaps. The only thing that might be a bit annoying is the fact that it takes up two USB slots. The software doesn't offer a way to store settings, and you have to buy a USB cord for every machine you use. Otherwise, it's a great dance machine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality on the Tascam DR-40 is really good.  You will not have to change your music a lot as long as you use it on quiet/low volume, and it has a great range of sound.    I do not hear the need for a subwoofer, but I have it connected because I have the subwoofers on my main system.    The software is easy to use.  If you can find the volume control to be on the back of the unit, you can adjust it in the software.  This is a very good subwooper.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* I've had this device for about 3 weeks now, and I'm pretty happy with it. The thing does what it says it does and does it well. I can get a good signal when I'm using the wireless antenna, and it does work well for my use case. My only gripe is the battery life is not great. I've only had it for a week, so I can't comment on the longer run times, but I've noticed I usually have to plug in a battery charger after it's been on for a few hours. Also, there is a lot of vibration when the wireless device is connected, but it's so minimal that I don't feel like it's going to bother me. The one negative I have is that the battery isn't removable. It's a really good product, and even though it's not really a problem, I think it's worth mentioning. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and recommend it to anyone looking for a solid device to use with a wireless antenna.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** I purchased this item on a whim one day. I was just going to purchase a different product for my kids (as I do with everything). I'm so glad I did. The kids love it. They play with it, use it and have been asking me for the remote. It's so easy to use and I've been able to control it from the TV. I love the fact that it has 3 different functions - music, games and TV. They even got into a little "game" on one of the games (it's just a simple "chicken" thing). It's a great value! I'm very pleased and will recommend this product to my friends.

I have had it for almost 2 years now and I've had it a lot of time, it's never failed me on a charge, even when the power supply died (which was a first). I also like the ability to connect it to a car and charge while at the same time have the lights on so that I can be sure that it's charging.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:...............................................  It works well. I got this for my wife to help with the computer stuff. The only issue I have had with it is that it doesn't always show up when you need it and you have to go online to check on the status. But that can be solved by just pressing the power button a couple of times.  Write a negative review about an unsatisfactory electronic device :...................................................  I purchased this to have a way to listen to music and use a laptop simultaneously. The device is great but it doesn.t work as I expected. After about a month I bought another one for my laptop and now I have a problem with the laptop. I was not able to play any audio file from the device on the laptop even though I set it up. I have tried changing the device, the cable, the speakers, the laptop, everything and I can't seem to get the device to work properly. I also had to turn on the bluetooth so that it could work. Now I am stuck with two devices I don't know how to get to work on my laptop. The warranty should be extended to cover this problem. The company that I bought this from, I will not be purchasing anything from them again. They were very nice and I had a great experience but I will only purchase from another company if it is a better company that cares about their customers. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  this is one of the best things i have seen in a long time.  Its like the computer that came with the phone in the late 80s, but much much better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The only reason i gave this a 4 star is because the battery life could be a little better, but the device works great. The device is small and light, and the price is very reasonable, i gave it a 5 star rating just because of the battery. I use it in my studio to capture sound, and have been using it for the past two years. I also use it with a mic stand to record guitar and bass. It has been my goto recording device ever since i first purchased it. The only thing i would change is the battery, but that is pretty minor since the device is still in excellent working order. I highly recommend this product!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works great for video recording I use this to record video. It's small and lightweight. I used to use the Zoom H4N but it was too expensive for the quality I got from the HD-SDI connector. I like the fact that the HDMI connector is not a separate port. It means I don't have to use a separate monitor to view the video. I find that the included cable is a little short but the plug is long enough for most applications. I can't comment on the reliability because I've not had a problem. The main thing I would change would be to have the HDMI cable longer. The cable that comes with it is the shortest of any HDMI cable I've used and doesn't go to the back of the device.  Review of DJI Mavic Pro With Accessories for DJI Phantom 2 Professional The DJI Inspire 1 was the first Phantom 2 Pro that I had flown in the United States. The Inspire1 came with an SDI/HDMI cable that wasn't long enough to reach to the camera. I was able to use an extension cord to extend it to the other side of the Inspire2, but I really didn't want to spend that much on a second Phantom 2. The DJICloud 3 has a very good quality control unit, but unfortunately I could not get it to work with my Phantom 2 for any reason. I have had problems with the DJI Go app and had to send it back to DJI. The quality of the control unit is good. The buttons are easy to press, and when using it in tandem with the controller, you can really see how good it is. The build quality is solid, and I love that it has a rubberized coating on the buttons

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   "I have an old desktop and this unit works perfectly."  What we like:  - Easy to use  Concerns:  a - the touch screen is not the most responsive (in my experience), but I think the touch sensitivity can be improved.  b - it does not support any audio output (no speaker or microphone), so you have to use a separate USB to DAC/AMP/speaker cable to get the sound out  c - the unit is really heavy  Other Thoughts: .  a: I think you get what you pay for. The price is very reasonable, but it seems like this is the only option for most users. A nice looking device with a good build.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've bought a few of these from this company. They work great, have a long warranty and are very well made. I've owned a number of different brands and this one is by far the best. I would not recommend this for a beginner or anyone that wants a great sounding system for the money. You need to get some decent sound insulation, it does have a very high impedance which can be a problem if you're a power user. I'm just looking to get my system set up and am very pleased with the quality of this product.  Did you find this helpful? 2 of 2 Found Helpful  Linda  5 / 5  Reviewed by:from CA. on 5/19/2015
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is awesome!  My only complaint is that the power supply has been getting bad recently, but other than that, great purchase! I bought this in order to replace a defective laptop.  It's awesome.    The sound quality is really good, and I love the fact that it has a headphone jack.  The only problem I have is that sometimes the screen will go out.  It takes about 5 seconds to turn the machine off and on, but then I have to turn it back on.  Otherwise, the system is awesome. This is my second PC, I'm an audio engineer.  I bought this as a replacement for a laptop I had that was having serious problems with its sound.  This thing is perfect, no complaints. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been a faithful user of the Logitech F310/F315 mouse since 2007. I use it at work for the precise navigation of large workbooks. It works flawlessly with all kinds of software. My only complaint is that it has a "squeak" when typing on it, but I have tried several things to make it quiet, and none of them worked. I'm not sure if I just don't get the squeak or if it is a software problem. The best gaming mouse for the money:   I've had a Logitech G-series mouse for years. The G402 is an excellent mouse for gaming. It's smooth, quiet, durable, and ergonomic. It has a light sensor which makes it easy to use at night, when you need to be more alert. Best of all, the mouse has a USB adapter that lets you connect it to your computer's USB port so you can use it as a peripheral while playing games on your computer. You can also connect it via USB to a desktop PC for use as a mouse. I love it so much I just bought a second one for myself.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only thing I would have changed is the "POWER" button, I could have made it a "OFF" button if I had known that it was an AC adapter, but I have no other AC adapter so I use it for my computer.

It has very low power draw (and only uses 4.5 watts on my mako which is amazing), a small size, and a decent volume for a single device.

I would not purchase the HD if it didn't come with an external mic. I have been using the same external mic for the last 6 years and have yet to have a problem with it. The only negative I have is the remote has to be used to control the unit, if you want to use it as a receiver, you will need a remote. I also have to be careful not to hit the volume too high because I have a hard time hearing things in the car. Overall a great purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a great addition to the computer library, a great device for the home lab and a great tool for the research group. I have been using it for several months and have been very impressed with it. I purchased the SABRE SYS-20 as a replacement for the old SABR machine, and it is a fantastic replacement. I had been using a standard 2-port SABER P1S, but the SABLE P1s offer a number of additional features. I love that you can control all of the software features with the push of a button and that I can have my files on the P1 without having to transfer them to a laptop or desktop system. The P1's are compact, have an LCD screen, a USB port for connecting to my PC, and even come with a power supply to power up my workstation. My only complaint is that I wish that it came with the VGA port that is on the other models. I use my VGA-equipped P1 to play back video and still photographs. With the P4P, I had to buy an additional adapter for that to work. I did not have to buy a new P1 because I already had a 2-Port SABRES SABEN P1 for that. The one problem that I have had with my P1 is that it is not able to read any of the files I have put onto it. The screen appears to be fine, but I have not been able to see the files on it. I hope that the Sable P1 will become a standard product, and I would recommend that any computer lab or home lab use one of these.

The software is very simple, but you can adjust all of your settings, such as the volume, the display, and the USB port. I'm also very pleased with the software that is available to use with the P3S-40, the P7P-30, and other P1 machines. You can use any of these with the SAGES P

Very good game! -Cedric  I just want to say I love my game. It has great graphics, music, and I really like the story line. I was a little disappointed the first few races, but after the first time i won i just kept going! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because i wish it would have had more different race tracks and more types of vehicles. I wish i could have bought a second game for the price, I really enjoy the first game and this one could be great.  This game is fun for those who want a little bit more than just the racing. Great graphics, fun music, a story, and great game play. It is also a good game for anyone who just wants a good time.  (Posted on 4/26/2011)  Nice fun game with fun racing and a good storyline. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The SRS is an amazing piece of technology.  It works and it works well.  This is the perfect case for your SRS.    It's easy to take apart and take apart again.  I just use my phone and computer and use this case.  It does its job well. Pros:  - The case is very well built and designed - This case is easy to use and easy to change out - I like that the screen doesn't have to be turned on for the screen to function, but it is still a great idea.  The case does not have a power button or any buttons for changing settings.  You can turn the screen on and off as you please.  When the screen is off the case has no buttons or power on and turn buttons, so you can only adjust the screen brightness.  This works great because you don't have a huge amount of time to adjust the brightness on your device.  Also, this case has a very good screen.  While I can't speak to how it will be for people who have a very dark screen, I have had no problem seeing the screen.   Cons:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this as a replacement for my broken original Sony Walkman. The audio quality is the same as my original, but the CD player is so much nicer to use. The volume control is a little fiddly, but it works. It's also a little harder to change the station than the original Walkman, but then you're used to that by now. Overall a good product. Posted by: David at 06:09 PM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I got this product to make my iPod less annoying. This is the best iPod Dock I've ever seen. It's made out of high quality plastic and it is lightweight, sleek and durable. I love that it's wireless, which I've never found on any iPod Dock. I have an iPhone 5S and this is the only thing I've tried so far that has made the iPod feel like it's connected to the phone. If you have an iPod that you don't use very much, this is a good one to get. I would definitely recommend this product! *****  Rated 5 out of 5 by J from Great I am a professional in the field of law enforcement and the iPod dock fits perfectly in my bag. I was looking for a small, durable, wireless dock to hold my ipod and my work computer. This one is great. It is built solidly, has a sturdy handle and looks great in my vehicle.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using this  machine for about a month.  The first time I used it I didn't use it very long, but the second time I did, I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the  model  because of the battery life.  The battery is rated at  2 hours.   This  has a battery life of about 1 1/2 hours  of continuous use.  For a light use, this machine is pretty good.  This machine is very easy to use. It  will not  overheat  or  burn  your hands.  It  is very compact.  Because of the small size, it  doesn't  take up much room in a pocket.  If you use it on a regular basis, it won't  take up a lot of space either.  Although this machine does not have the ability to print in color, it will print in black and white.  There  are some very cool features.  First,  it  has    3  inch   laser   that  gives  very   clear   lines.  A great feature to me is the ability   to   create   custom   fonts   from the screen.  Also, it has a laser printer for printing a full page.  So far,  my   favorite   feature is the screen that  lenses the screen to make it easy to see what you are printing.  My favorite feature is that it can print in 2 different resolutions.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is awesome! I have a few other electronic devices, but this is by far the best, and most versatile. I use it for music production, voice over work, video editing, and a few more. The sound quality is outstanding. The controls are great too. If you like to use your computer for a computer, this will suit you just fine. If not, you can always use a computer as a sound device if you like. This thing is just a pleasure to use. This review is of a similar item, but not exactly the same. This was purchased by a friend who wanted something that would be used at home and on the road. I have used the same unit for about a year and it works great for the music I make, the audio is very clear. The only thing I would like to see is a bit of a light in the back of the unit so that I can see what is going on at a glance, but overall I'm satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just received my iFruit. I've always wanted an electronic device like the iFruits and iSticks but the price is outrageous.  My first iFury i bought it for $120.   I paid $50 for the iStick and $30 for the IFruit but I got both.  I'm happy with both. I got the iDock to replace my iMac.  It's a little more compact than the iMac and I can't wait to get more apps. I am very impressed with the iLoud.  The volume is more than enough.  After trying to play some songs on my iPhone 4S, I found the iMic and iDot to be more accurate and loud.  iFuv2 and iFurious are the best of the iCade line.  If you want a great music player, you have to buy these.  A good music player is a must for the Mac, especially the i7 version.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- --------------------------- I've had this for about a month now, and I've already found a few uses for it. I love the fact that the screen is very bright. I like the fact the screen does not flicker. I also like that the buttons are very easy to use. The batteries last forever. I find that the battery life is better than the original iPod Touch I had (3 months) because I'm still using it to listen to music and movies on my computer. The fact that it has an SD card slot and has a headphone jack is great. I'm not the best typist, but with the built in dictionary app, I'm able to write at a much better speed than I could with the original one. The best thing about this product is that it's very easy for the user to update the app and change the language of the iPod. Also, it comes with a few games that you can download from the internet, so it's really easy to just start listening to music from the store and do whatever you want. Overall, I like this product and I'm sure it will last a long time.  Rated 5 out of 5 by JK from Good product for the price This product has everything I need in a mobile device: a large screen, a micro SD card, microphone, and speakers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********I really like this device and can't believe that it is so cheap. It is really easy to use, just plug it in, and it works. I like how it's a lot smaller than my other mp3 players. I just purchased the 3rd one and they will be gone in a year. Great job guys. I've been a musician for almost 15 years and I don't have to worry about being up all night trying to find my music because my mp3 player is on a USB drive and plugged into the wall. ***********The only thing I dislike about this player is the battery life. I am a big listener so I like to have my mp4 player in my bedroom. However, when I go to bed I have to keep waking up to listen to my mp files. The battery is too short and the player is too small for that. I love this product and I will be buying a 4th one. ******************I just got my second mp3 Player from you. I have a friend who has bought several of these players and is one of the best in his class. He has his own music collection and I can see his music being played at a party. I would not have thought that a little USB stick with a bunch of music could play my music and I would have thought twice about buying this product. ************ I have used your mp player twice now and the first time I played a couple of songs and I had it connected to my laptop and when I went to plug it into my speakers I could not hear anything. When I switched it off I could hear my music. Now I don' t know why I did that but it worked fine so I would suggest that if you have this player connected to your laptop, make sure that you put it on the lowest volume setting. The player is very small so it's easy to keep out of the way. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a headphone jack. I don t have any of the cables you have for the other players I have and I think I will just use my earbuds. But I do like that it has a USB connection so I don 't have to plug into my laptop when I am using it. *************************************************** ***************I purchased my first mp3 Players on line from a local electronic store and I was extremely happy with the sound and the speed with which it played.

I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a solid device for the price.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Phone! I was pleasantly surprised to find this phone when it was back in stock! I had been using a Galaxy S4 and it was a bit on the bulky side. I got the samsung galaxy s6 edge and was impressed with the size and weight. I wanted a slim phone and was worried about having to use a case. After using it for a week, the case is just fine! The camera is excellent! I love that I can now take pictures while driving and the audio quality is perfect. The best feature for me is that you can turn off the fingerprint scanner and you don't need to have the phone in your hand to unlock it. I wish the camera was a little better. The battery life is good but I can't complain too much because I'm only using it one time a day. I am still in the process of adding a couple of apps but I love this phone.  The only thing I would change about this phone is that the fingerprint sensor is really, really bad. It is very easy to skip a fingerprint and I've lost a few over the years. It took me forever to figure out how to enable the scanner and make sure the sensor wasn't on a curved edge.  the fingerprint reader is really really bad! I have a Samsung galaxy s5 and it's pretty bad. The Samsung Galaxy s6 doesn't have this problem. It's not perfect and it still skips a lot but it's better than the s5. I've been using the s6 for about a week and have only had it for 3 days. I can say that the phone works great! I'm very happy with this purchase. I was excited when I saw that it was still in stock, I was so happy!

Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Steve - Verified Buyer I have had a problem with my new Dell laptop which had a bad memory chip. I sent it to Dell and the guy in the store said he was going to replace it. The day he came to install the memory chip, he said he had found a dead memory chip and was going replace it with a new one. The next day he said that he replaced it with the same one. So now I have a Dell with the memory memory chip dead and a dead one. They can't even tell me why it died. It is a computer with all the bells and whistles.  I have been using my Dell since I bought it for a friend. I got the computer on a sale at my local computer store. The screen was horrible at first, but I kept it anyway. The speed was great and the speed improvement over my old Dell was phenomenal. I finally bought this one at my work and I can't believe how much better it is than my old one. I love it.  and i just bought the first model of this computer and now I'm very excited to buy another one for my daughter to play with. I just bought a brand new computer and it's really fast and reliable, I have no problems with the screen or the speed at all. I will probably buy another model. The service was very good, I sent mine back for repair and they did an excellent job on it. It's a very great computer and a good deal. I'd recommend this computer to anyone who needs a good computer for the price. I have had problems with my Dell computer which had the bad memory. I tried a new RAM and then a new CPU. I called my local Dell store and they said they couldn't do anything. I emailed them and they sent me a new memory, and the new CPU and the old RAM. Now I'm a satisfied customer. I recommend it. And, the service was super!  I'm so glad I decided to get this

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:....................................................... This is my second (and possibly last) purchase of this item, as it's the first I've ever had to replace. I've owned the first one for many years and it's a good device for its price range. The build quality is fantastic and the sound is wonderful. I don't know if I'd pay a lot more for the same thing. My only issue is the fact that the power button on the top of the device can sometimes get pushed accidentally while using it. The bottom does have a little rubber bump to prevent it from doing so. I still use it though. I hope this item is here to stay and that other people enjoy using it as much as I do.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great sound and great value! The sound quality of this is superb and it has a nice warm sound to it. I have been using it on my desk for over a year now and it works great.

My computer's sound card is the same one used in my older computer and these make the computer sound better than my old one. I also like the fact that I can use my PC on a TV without the sound being muffled. *********  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The keyboard is a great size and easy to type on. I have a mac and a PC and the only thing that is more annoying to me is that the PC keyboard has no function keys. I like the size of this keyboard and the light that it gives. The only thing I do not like is that it is not a mechanical keyboard but a membrane. I do have a mechanical one and it is great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the DMP-6 and I am very happy with it. It is a very simple and very efficient device. I like the fact that it allows you to use your mobile phone and tablet and it is easy to use. It also allows you the use of your PC. This device has made my life easier and is the best for small businesses. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a simple device that is easy and can do everything.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s   Great device. Good camera, good speed, and good price.   I bought the ipod 5 and it works great. I use it to listen to music and to do my homework   My iPhone 5 was a gift for my mom and the phone worked well from the day it came. It is very easy to use. It has great video and photo quality. I love it and am recommending it to others.     great iphones. great iphon 5   Very good camera, great quality, great price. I'm using it with my iPod Touch 5. I've only used the 4s. I think it's a great value.  :)   The ipod 4s has an awesome camera that comes with the best video quality on the market today. The phone is very good, but i would like to have a little bit more storage on it so i can have more apps.  -   :D   This is the best iphonelife I have ever had. It shoots great videos, it's light and very simple to use and use with a bluetooth headset. It even comes with a wireless charging plate. I would buy this again and again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an awesome device, the sound quality is great. The fact that it's battery powered is great, as I usually have to plug it in every few hours. The buttons on the controller are great and you can adjust the volume for each channel and set it to silent if you don't need to use headphones. The battery life is pretty good, about 8 hours and can be charged over night. This is my first audio controller and I really enjoy the quality.  No Was this rating helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the rx-11a for a while now and i am very happy with the product. it's very compact and i use it for everything and the audio quality is excellent. ive had a few problems however with the battery life but other than that i am extremely satisfied with the purchase. ****************************** *BEST BOTTOM LINE DEVICE* *************************   5.0/5 - Excellent for the price!   I am very pleased with my new receiver and audio equipment. I have the RDA-11A. I was so impressed by the build quality and the quality of the audio that I decided to purchase another one and got the RX-11B. The quality and design of the RX-11 have made it my primary device to date. It is a pleasure to listen to the sound and the power is plenty. I like the fact that it has a switchable filter setting which I can use on either side of the output. The battery life is a plus for me as I tend to use my receiver for a good amount of time and use the receiver for extended periods of time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm a pretty technical person, and I have a computer with a dual-core processor and an AMD graphics card, and a Blu-ray burner. I also own a couple of these, and they have served me well. I use them for watching movies, playing games, and downloading movies from the internet. This is a decent piece of kit for the money. I do have a couple things that I would change about the unit. The first is the "Quick Start" software. There are two options, and you must pick one. The quick start option lets you connect a keyboard and mouse and load up a game, but there is no way to choose which one. I guess the point of this is to have an all-in-one solution that you can plug in a controller, but you can't really choose which is going to be the best. I just use my keyboard and a joystick. It's a lot of fun. The second thing that bothers me is that there is only one USB port on the back of the unit, which means you can only plug in one device at a time. The PS2 controller plugs in, and everything else (and the computer itself) disconnects from the USB port. This means you have to plug the controller into the computer first, and then plug in the computer to the PS2 (and everything else). The PS3 controller does not have this problem. This one small thing makes me very unhappy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this thing because I wanted to get a little bit more performance out of my laptop. I have a Core 2 Duo laptop and it would not play any CD's or play mp3's at a decent bit rate. I tried everything from hard drives to usb sticks to the sony drive but it would just play the audio. I then tried to hook it up to my new iMac mini and it played music perfectly. I like that it has no moving parts and the only parts that are moving are the power and reset buttons. It is really easy to use and a little noisy but I just use my phone or headphones when I want to listen to music.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4. The phone is nice and small, but the quality of the screen is not as good as the phone of the same size, the camera is good, but not good enough for the price and the battery is not rechargeable. The battery is good but i have to get a charger every few days.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from A Must Have For The Price I bought this about a month ago and have been using it almost every day. I am an experienced cell phone user and have owned other phones before, but this phone is the first I have purchased that is truly well made and easy to use. I've had it about a week and I've only been using the phone for about two days and I'm already using it so much that it has become my daily driver. The features are good and the design is attractive, so I highly recommend this phone.  is the best I have ever had I use this phone almost every single day and I have never experienced a problem with this phone not working as it should. It is so well built and so easy to take care of. I highly suggest this phone to anyone who wants a great cell phone for a good price.  in my opinion this is the top of the line.  and my phone is running flawlessly and it has been my daily carry phone for over a month. I use the phone almost daily and I am so happy with my purchase I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat.  "This is a great phone... " I bought my first iPhone about two years ago. It was a great device and the features are amazing. The price was a bit high, but I didn't know then how much better it would be. The iPhone 4S is amazing. It's so much better than the iPhone 3G, 3GS, or 3GS XL. The screen is so much bigger and the processor is faster than the 3G. The camera is the same as the 4S, but it has more megapixels. The speed is faster too. I'm still a big fan of the iPhone but I am glad I finally got a newer iPhone. The iPhone 4 is a good device. It doesn't have a camera that's as good or as good looking as the cameras on the other three models. However, it is still good enough. I have to say that I like the larger screen size. It fits in my hand well. The quality of this phone
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is the best device for the price you can get!!! I would buy it again and again!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by TheBaker from Perfect for the Home baker This is a great set for any baker looking for a reliable and portable bread machine. I use this in the bakery when making bread. The controls are easy to use and the dough comes out great. It makes a perfect dough with a crisp crust. It does have a few flaws, such as the bread does take longer to rise than my bread machine at home. Also the dough bowl is a bit small for my liking, but I don't think that matters for a bread machine, as it is designed for small bakeries and can be modified with different sized bowls to fit smaller sizes. The mixer has a little more noise than my home machine, but other than that, this is a fantastic machine.  Review of DJ-3200BPRX-2 Review by Dave B.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought the iMac in late October 2007. It was not only my first iMac but my first Apple computer. I was a very happy customer. It ran well. It had a big screen, an amazing keyboard and mouse, and it was very affordable. In the summer of 2009, my iMac got a black screen with a white text. I called AppleCare and they replaced the screen. I am very happy with my purchase. My only concern is that the Apple Store does not have the Apple logo on the bottom of the screen anymore. If you buy a new iMac, don't get the white screen! It was a good product, but not the one it once was.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob in NY from A Great Computer. I have owned an iMac for over 5 years now and still have no regrets about buying this model. The only downside to the i Mac is the battery life. The iMac uses a 3-cell battery. However, i have had a lot of success with the 4-cell batteries from a different brand. I get at least a month of battery life before a replacement battery needs to be replaced. I would recommend this computer to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great device. It has been my main electronic device for a few years. I was skeptical about purchasing a new device because of the price and the lack of power. I am very happy that I chose this over a new computer. I use it to play games, watch movies, listen to music and it has a good quality sound. It is extremely easy to install and takes only a minute to set up. My only complaint is the fact that I have a 2 year old at home and he is still using a computer. So far, he has not complained. The device is durable and doesn't have any problems with it. This is definitely a device that I will be keeping in my collection for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for over a year now and it still works and is working as it should. I have had my eurorack system for about a year and the only problem i had was that it would only play music from my ipod and i dont own an ipod...now that i have an ipad i bought this and it works perfectly and the sound is amazing. It is a nice device for the price. I wish they would do a better job of cleaning the power supply...it smells of electrical fire after a while and it makes a noise when it gets hot.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********************I purchased this device on my own, and have to say that I am very impressed. It has been working flawlessly. It was easy to set up, and I am impressed that the instructions are well written and easy to understand. It comes with a 2GB micro SD card, and a power adapter. The power adapter plugs into the wall, so you do not have to connect the power supply yourself. I have the computer connected to the computer port on the bottom of the unit. The USB port has a USB type-C port, which means that it can take either USB-C or USB-A devices. I'm not sure what the difference is between the two, but I use a USB-M and USB-S device for my keyboard and mouse, so I can't complain about the port type. I also have a wireless keyboard and mice that are both USB-powered. I do not use the mouse that comes with the computer.The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because the unit does not come with an HDMI cable, which I wish that it did. However, it is included in the box.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________   I purchased this device because I had an old one in need of repair. This is the first electronic device that has truly given me back my ability to play the bass guitar. It's been a week and I've had a great time with this instrument. I can get a bit sloppy at times but that's how I play. The controls are intuitive and the sound is wonderful. I'm not a bass player but I've already decided that I'm going to purchase another for the studio and also have a couple for my home practice. I highly recommend this device.  The only reason why I give this device 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish that the battery would last for a week. I don't really have any other complaints other than the battery dying. It should last a good while but I'm only using it 2-3 times a day. I wish it would last a week, especially with the way the volume changes and the effects on the guitar come in. The effects are also very useful. I like to add a bit of reverb and echo to the end of my song when I'm recording. That's a big bonus. :)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an amazing tool, and for those who need a little help with their typing, this is the perfect tool to have. It has a very smooth touch screen, and the screen does not heat up as quickly as it's supposed to, which is nice. I love the size of it, and it has a great built in keyboard, which was not present on other types of touch screens. It's very easy to type on. If you're looking for a good one to get for free, this would be a great one. If I were to recommend this to a friend, I would give it a 5.5 out of 5. If it was a bit more expensive, I'd give it an extra 5.0, because it's a very good one, but it's cheap enough that you don't need to worry about it's quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! Excellent device! It is so quiet that I use it at night to listen to music and it does not disturb the neighbors and is very easy to operate and clean. This is the best way to listen when I am on the go. I am going to buy another one. I would recommend this product!  I am very happy with this product. I do not listen to heavy metal but I do listen to a lot of music. This has been a very good earbud. I have had them for a few weeks now and am very pleased with them.  This is the one that's the best. I use them at night. I love them. They are so easy to use and very quiet. I like the way they fit in my ears. They really are very quiet, they don't give the same sound as my earbuds. . ,  The best earbudding earphones. I really like them. I used to use my phone to listen at home, so I can not get good sound on my phone and the sound is too much. I want to know if you can make good sound with these earphones, so i can listen at work. I bought these earbudders and they are great. They have a nice sound with good bass. I listen to hip hop music, and they fit great in my ear. I get more sound out of them than my ear buds do. The cord is also shorter than my phone cord so it doesn't get tangled up. I can't say much else about them, except they are a nice product.  a must buy for any musician who plays in the background or who does not have good earphones for the job  A very nice earbuzz. I've used them for 3 months and really like the sound. I also like the fact that I can use them during the day. I live in an apartment and my neighbors are always in the kitchen so I use these to listen in the living room when I'm there.  as others have said, this is a very quiet earbug and is extremely portable. I wear them in my bag, under my hat, and all around the house. This really is a perfect earbundle!  a very nice product, good sound and a very small package, the only problem i have is that it doesn''t have a clip so if i get out of the car i can''t fit it
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for about a month now. i like the size and the price, but one thing i dont like is the power supply. when i turn it on the power light goes off for a few seconds then starts working again. this doesnt happen when i use my old power supply, but maybe that's just a coincidence. i'm using it for music and TV. i dont get much use out of the tv, but i do use it for listening to my ipod while i do other things on my computer. overall, this is a good buy if you like the look and size. i wish the speakers were better but other than that it is a nice little player.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from I like the sound, especially for the price. I was using my old Sony XB-70 and my old one broke down a few months ago. This one works great with my XB10 and XB70. The speakers are a little tinny but they still sound good. They do not last as long as my old ones but I still like them. . I have the XB3 (Xperia Z1) and this one is great. The only thing is the sound is tinny. I would recommend this one over the XA-M2. The XA was just so loud and clear that you can really hear everything. This just doesn't compare. The best value for the money is the Sony XA1.

The only thing I did not like was the way the mic on the D7000 is set up. I like having the mic closer to my mouth and not so far away, and I don't know if that's what you wanted to hear on the track. However, the D700's mic is far better. It's great for vocals. Also the D800's are great for studio work and that is what I use my D700 for.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great device but very difficult to use - I purchased this product because it is one of the most expensive options out there. But I have been using it for over a year now and I have had zero problems with it. I use it for reading ebooks and reading e-mails and magazines. But the only issue I have is that it is difficult to change batteries. You must insert the batteries in the wrong order or the batteries will not be in the right place. It has a built in battery charger that is not a good idea. But otherwise I highly recommend this product and will keep it for a long time. I'm giving it four stars because of the charging problems.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:...........................................  The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a solid flagship phone that is perfectly fine as a flagship phone.  I own both the Galaxy S4 and S5 and have both been very good devices. -The S4 has a better screen and camera than the S5.  a. The S4's screen is brighter, has better viewing angles, and the camera is more accurate than the HTC One M8's camera. b. The fingerprint sensor on the S4 is better than the fingerprint sensor in the S6. , but I found the fingerprint reader on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to be better. It has a more accurate and faster fingerprint reader than the one on the Note 4. I think that is a great improvement.  is the phone for me:..........................  If you are looking for a great phone, I'd recommend the Samsung S5, it's a very good phone and I recommend it to anyone who likes the Galaxy series. If you are interested in a mid-range phone or budget phone, it would be better to buy the S3 than the Note. I would recommend the Galaxy Note 3 as a good phone if you want a great screen and a fast camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had the Pico for about 2 months now, and have found it to be a useful and accurate laser pointer.  It is very easy to use, and has a very good output (much higher than the other laser pointers I've had).  The only complaint I have about this product is that it is a little bit hard to use at times.    I had a similar device and was very happy with it, so I'm a little skeptical about the Pio but will give it a try.    If you're considering purchasing the Pino or any of the other devices mentioned here, I would recommend getting a good quality model (which this one is) because the cheapo ones (like the ones pictured) don't really do a good job of accurately and precisely pointing the laser pointer where you want it.

The apps are great for getting the information you need quickly and easily. The screen is clear and bright. The touch screen is good but not perfect. The only real negative is that the speaker on the back of the unit does not work very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was just looking for a small, quiet, cheap and light weight battery pack that would do a good job in my EDC. I was looking for something that was small and light. I did not want anything big and heavy. I saw that these are not cheap batteries, they cost about $7. I bought 3 packs for $7, which is great considering the price. I just wish that they were a bit more sturdy than the cheap looking ones that are sold on eBay. It is not that these batteries are bad, they just seem to be cheaply made. They have a good amount of life in them, but they still have a lot of life left in them and you will not need to replace them often. I have about 100 hours of normal use out of these batteries and they have been running fine. I can't say that these will last forever. I wish the life expectancy was a little better, but overall they are good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works as advertised, and the sound is great.  I like the design of it. ______________________________________________________________ Excellent product and price  This is the first headphone I have bought, and I can't believe I waited so long to buy it. This is the very best headphone I've had so far, and they are the perfect size.  It is perfect for music, and works as well as other headphones I've bought.   This is a great headphone.  I have two of them, one is a little small (I need to go up a size), but works well.  The sound is good.  They're comfortable and well made.  My only issue is the cord.  A lot of people complain about it getting tangled up in clothes, but it isn't a big deal.  But it's just not very comfortable.  Good headphones, but a cord issue The cord is a real issue, I have one of the small ones that is just a bit loose, but is fine.  When you get the larger one, it's a real struggle getting it in the case and keeping the two parts together, so you have to unplug it from the USB cord. That's not a big problem, it is what it is.  Another thing that might be a big issue is that the headphone jack on the device is not in the same position as it is on other headphones, the other headphone has the jack at the back, this one has the same hole in the back that the other one does.  This is a big complaint for me, but for the price I can live with it. Good headphone but cord issues  I am extremely pleased with this headphone. The sound quality is outstanding.  For the price it is well worth it. The cord issue is a major flaw, I would highly recommend getting a replacement. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a lot of love for this device. I have a Mac Pro that is very fast and efficient, and my MacBook Pro is not. With this Mac Pro you can load a lot more software on it, it has USB 3.0 so you can charge your phone faster, it is more battery friendly. With the USB 2.0 I had a hard time charging my phone, the Mac Pro had to be in sleep mode to charge, but this USB 3 doesn't have this problem. Also it is much lighter than the mac pro, I only have to carry the thing in one hand and it is lighter and smaller. I bought it about a year ago and I love it! I love my new Mac Pro and I think it will last me a long time. Write a negative review about an excellent electronic device :  For the money, this is a very good device, I have no complaints. The only thing I wish is that it had a USB 3 port, and the headphone jack would be good for a small computer like my iPad. If you like:    This is a great product. If you don't like it, you probably should have read the reviews.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is not as simple as other products. There are so many things to do with it and it's good to use. I use it for my TV. I also use it to watch movies, listen to music and read the newspaper. I am not a computer person but I am learning more about it every day. I'm happy with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just bought a Korg MicroKorg X5 to replace my Korg KX5. This is a very nice piece of gear and is a fantastic upgrade from the KX3. I am very happy with this purchase and will use it a lot. It is very easy to use and has excellent sounds. If you are looking for a good keyboard with a lot of character, the MicroKORG is a great choice. You can find a lot more reviews on this site.

I was really pleased to find a cheap monitor that could be connected to a desktop. The quality is very good and the screen looks bright and sharp.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned an iphone 6 for about a month now and ive gotten a ton of use out of it and it's really easy to use. the touchpad is nice and has all the necessary buttons. the phone camera is a bit of a pain in the ass, but i understand that. the battery is great and i'm very pleased with my purchase and i think this is a great phone to buy!  No, it's not my favorite. But I've been using it since last year and I'm very satisfied. I use it mostly for work as a personal device as well as a business phone. I don't use it much for texting, though.  Excellent! I bought this about a week ago and I am really impressed with the phone. The design and construction of the phone is very well done. The buttons are responsive and work as intended. The battery life is amazing. I have the 3G model and it lasts for a long time. :) Great phone! The build quality is superb. The screen is bright and easy on the eyes. The phone is really lightweight, but that's a good thing. The only thing I don`t like about it is the fact that the fingerprint reader does not work on the iPhone 6. The other reviews that said that it did work with the iPhone6 are correct. But if you want a phone that will fit in your pocket, this is not the phone for you. I also wish it was a bit thicker but then again, the phone I have is the same size as the other one that i bought. The quality is the best I have seen and the price is reasonable. . Good phone, but... I bought the 4S for my wife's birthday and she absolutely loves it. She has two other phones, but the S is the only one she uses for work. It is really good for everything except texting. The software updates are great but the phone has to be unlocked in order to use the software update. And that is a hassle to do. Overall a great buy. But, the software updates and phone unlocking are a bit annoying. So for the price, it really depends on what you are looking for. I really like the screen and the screen is a nice one. The sound quality is excellent. The speakers are loud. The keyboard is very good. I would say that I am happy with the hardware. I am not a fan of the software and the unlocking process

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** This was the second time I have bought this product. I have owned a Mac mini 3 and a Dell laptop. I was so happy with the Mac mini 4 and thought about purchasing it as well, but then I read this review and it was really good. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it does not have a USB Type-C port for charging. I am still waiting for the USB Type C port on the Dell, so I can charge my other Apple devices. This is a really good device. It does everything it promises to do. It is well built and reliable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I bought a new TV about 3 months ago, and it's been great, but I don't like the way the remote is designed, it's not adjustable for my head position, but that's just personal preference. I wish there was an option for a different remote, maybe a "flat" remote that's easier to grip, like the Sony's, but at least there's an option. The TV's very easy to set up and use, the TV itself is very good. The only complaint I have is that I'm not sure how to turn off the motion detector, but if anyone knows, please let me know.

I can stream my favorite music on my TV using Spotify, play my phone and play my computer on the same screen. I love that I can turn off my TV and turn on my PC at the same time. The only thing I can say is that the battery is small and it's a bit hard to power on and off, especially if you have to use your mouse.  Product Rating: 5 out of 5-stars.  and the price was great  Pros: easy to setup and very affordable  Cons: small and hard to use for some people,  Review: I bought this product as a replacement for my wireless bluetooth keyboard which was getting very old. I had a couple of problems with it, however, it is very simple to set up and works very well. The one thing I have found is that it has a very small battery, and for some reason I can only charge it for about a half an hour before the battery dies. Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I will definitely purchase again. -Sandy  Customer Testimonials
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using this thing since it came out a year ago. It has a good amount of power, is reasonably light, and is pretty easy to use. It's great for small projects. I can't really say anything bad about it. It is just a bit on the heavy side for my tastes, but it is a good all around device. I have a feeling that the price has gone up since it was introduced. I'd suggest picking one up if you can afford it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________  I purchased this a couple of years ago and I really enjoy using it. I have been using it for about a month now and have found that it is great for writing notes on the go. The fact that it's an electronic device also means that it doesn't use batteries like the pen. I can keep it charged up all day. The pen is a little stiff to write with but you don't really notice because of the fact that the pen itself is so small and lightweight. It's also nice that you can write on it while it's charging. It is nice that it uses an actual ballpoint instead of a stylus.  No complaints: _________________________  and to be honest: ______________________________________  The pen is great, but the ballpoint works much better.

The packaging was very good, but they didn't include any documentation, and it took me over 4 weeks to get a replacement because of the original shipping time. The company doesn't seem to be very responsive either. I would suggest you go through the website and check the shipping time to get an idea of how quickly you should expect your order to arrive.  I have to say the customer service is really great! I'm having problems with my Samsung laptop. I really like this drive but Samsung needs to take care of their laptop people. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** This is my second Apple Watch and it's great! I like it. The design is very sleek and easy to use. It has great battery life and I like how I can keep it in my pocket so I can use it anytime. I wish it was a little more durable but it works. I also appreciate how easily you can add your own music on the watch, which is very handy. I like that I can customize the watch by using a special app that allows me to change the face and watch face colors. The screen is very bright and clear, which makes reading in the dark a breeze. I've been using it for a couple of months and I love it. It's great for exercising or watching a movie on a plane ride. I don't think I'll ever need another watch again.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Saffi from Great watch! I purchased the Watch 2 about a month ago. The first watch that I had purchased was a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. I found that the screen on the S6 was too small. I have the watch 2 and it is a perfect fit for me. I'm in between sizes but I have a 5" wrist. The watch is very comfortable to wear and the design is sleek. I love that I do not have to look down at my wrist to see my notifications or read my watch face. The second time around I bought the Watch 3 but found that I prefer the larger size on the Watch 4. I am very pleased with the quality and the functionality of the Watch. I recommend it to all. .  to the reviewer who had a problem with the charger for the Watch - I had to replace the charger as the one I received didn't work. I had a good experience at walmart with the sales person. He helped me locate the right charger for my Watch and even helped me select a good one. The Watch arrived on time, was packaged very well and arrived safely. It came with the Apple charger (not included), the charger cable, a manual and a case that I don;t have to take off for charging. I will be ordering from walmart again. I didn't have any problems at all with the watch. Purchasing online: I purchased my watch on a Friday night and had it in the mail on Monday. It was fast and very easy to put together. The packaging was very well done and the watch came in a nice box with

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "I bought a new computer (Macbook Air) that has a great screen (1366x768 pixels) but the sound quality is awful. I am in a small apartment with 3 other people and the sound just isn't loud enough to listen to. I wanted something that would help me with my work. This is my second iMac. I bought the iMac (mid-2010) to use with my old Macbook Air but the screen quality is terrible and the computer gets very hot. I'm just disappointed in this product. I will be looking for a new one soon."  "It is not my fault that I bought a Macbook. But I am a professional musician who uses his iMac as a MIDI controller, as a sequencer and to record and mix his guitar, and all of this without problems. I got this iMac to be a nice little work machine for my work and it's not good enough for my needs. I've tried many of the cheaper computers but they are just as hard to use and I hate that I have to use my expensive Apple to work. I really wanted this computer to be my little workstation."

The battery life is fantastic. I use my Sony A6500 on a tripod and the battery life with this and my A6510 is almost identical. The screen is bright, clear, and has a high contrast ratio. The noise from the microphone is much reduced. I would recommend this unit. It's a solid performer.

The only thing I wish is that there was a way to get him to move around in the 3d world. The physics and the physics of the game make the experience a lot of fun. The game is very good and I have been playing for about a month now and my son has never played a game like this. I love it and I wish there were more games like this that he would get in the future.  I think I will play more and more of this game.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************** This was the first time I have used a high end music player that was well made. It has a nice quality sound, with a good range of settings. I highly recommend this player! ************************* I was using my iPod Classic with my iPhone, and I realized that I couldn't get the music to play through my iPhone with headphones. So I decided to buy this player to play the iPod Classic and my iPhone through one player. I am so happy that I did! I bought the same model that I bought for my iPod. The quality of this player is so great. I have owned other players in the past, and they never lasted very long, and the batteries died within a few weeks. But this one has lasted all this time, with no problems. The batteries last about a week. And the sound is great. It plays all the songs I have in my iPod, with the exception of some of the newer ones. The iPod and iPhone are the only things I use this for. And for the price, it is definitely worth every penny. I will be purchasing the next one I see in the store. ********************** This is a very good and durable player. The buttons are easy to push and the controls are easy enough to use. This player can be used with a variety of devices including MP3 players and iPods. It is very quiet and the volume control is good enough for my needs. I also like the size of the player, which is great for traveling. ********* This is the best and most convenient music player on the market. It comes with a lot of features and a great price. It's very portable and I like that I can charge it with a USB cable. The sound is good, but if you want to hear the original sound you can find a good quality sound recorder on the internet. The controls are simple but the interface is very intuitive and user friendly. *************** I have bought several other products from Sound Magic and have always been very satisfied with the products and the service I received. I was very excited when I found out that I could have a good portable music player for my iPad. When I saw this, I was a bit hesitant, but I knew I had to get it because the sound quality is so good. It can play the mp3 and other music files, but there is only about 2-3 hours of music stored on it, so you will want to bring a backup of

I will never buy another one of these.  the klacker I bought for the first time had a small crack in the plastic cover and the cable snapped off, I didn't want to risk buying a new cable and so decided to send it back and get a different one, it arrived with a broken cable, but I thought it would have been better if it came with a repair kit as the new one I received did not have one.  and then the klock I received in the mail had a hole in the middle of it, this happened after a month, the next day I received a replacement, still no replacement. I bought a new klackers, but it's still broken. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to have a backup in case my laptop got a virus, and I don't have a computer, so this was perfect for me. I can easily download files, do internet stuff on it (as well as a couple of things I do on my laptop, like the video games I play, the internet, etc.). It's light weight and very portable. The one thing I don' think is great about this is that you can't play video games. The only games I can play are those on my phone, and those have to be on my computer to play them. The camera is ok, but not great. It's ok for taking pictures, but I can't do much with it because it doesn't record video. Overall I love my new computer, I think I will use it for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this thing for about 2 years now and its awesome. the only reason i can give it 5 stars is because the battery is very weak and is only good for about 6 months of use. but the device itself is very nice and i love the ability to charge it off of my laptop.  I like it: I like the small size. I've used it to read email and browse the internet, but it is not really great for browsing the web.  in terms of a computer: the only problem I had was with the battery. I had to use a cable and then the battery didn't last long. it was still okay for the price.  "it works but i wish there was a button to turn off"  Great device! Love this device. I really like the fact that you can charge your phone while it is in the case. This is a must have for any Android device. -I can easily read a book in the dark without having to flip the screen on and off  -The battery is good but you have to charge the device regularly.  the device does not have a USB port so you have no option but to use your computer  The case is very handy but I wish there were a button that turns off the screen when it's off so it can be stored inside the case  If you want a small laptop that is good for browsing, emailing, etc., this is the device for you.  that said, if you do a lot of email and don't need a screen in your case, then you may want to get a bigger battery and a case that has a USB-C port. I use the one I bought with a case, so I had a large battery that lasted about 6 weeks of heavy use.   I also purchased the screen protector because my laptop screen is covered in dust and is scratched up. The screen protector fits perfectly and doesn't have any impact on the display.  a good purchase.  to the person that says the screen is not scratch resistant, you are wrong. It is actually a little harder to scratch with your fingernail than it is on the screen itself. it looks great, and it doesn't break the bank. , and to those that complain that there is no USB port, well the reason there isn't is because a lot people use their computer on their phone so you'd have to carry a separate charger with you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I had my first Voodoo PC a year ago and I am now using it as my main work machine. The Voodoo 3 series is a great machine and the new 3.5 will be even better.  From: J. (Vintage PC Guy) | Posted: 5/23/2003 10:31:06 AM  Hey - I have just received my 2.2GHz PIII and it is absolutely wonderful - I am very pleased with the build quality and the speed, but the sound is very bad. I am using a Sound Blaster 16 (16-bit only) and the volume and the delay settings are all wrong. It doesn't sound very good and the computer just isn't that fast. .  for a 16-bit machine, this thing can be quite a bit slower than my old 486, so I'm looking for a 3.0 or better machine that doesn't need to be set up for 16-bits, and at the least have the 16-Bit emulation.  The VIA PII is really great, but it is just too much noise to use as my primary work machine, so it will be in my garage for a while.  and the sound chip is pretty much the same as the sound card on the Voodoo2. It's really a shame that the VIA chip is just not as good as the other sound chips that have been out there.

The only con I can think of is that the power supply has a shorted out and the battery needs replacing.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Sibbs from Great little device. Very efficient and quiet. I like the ability to control the intensity. Works great with a video camera. I use this with my home security system.  Review of DJI Inspire 1 Professional Drone with Smartphone App I was looking for a drone that was quiet, good quality and would have a GPS connection so I could get location updates and videos. The DJI Spark was a good option but when I saw the DJI i3 I decided to try the i3. The price was also good, and the app is easy to use. The video is not the best but it gets the job done. I was a little worried that the battery would be low after one use, but that hasn't happened. The one thing I didn't like was that it did not have a built in light, but I can't see that being a problem.  a couple things that I would like to see added: - It would be nice to have a way to control and change settings without having to have the phone on hand, or a switch on the back of the device - A way to see the battery level in the top right corner would be helpful - I wish the battery could be recharged via USB  Great little drone with great camera and good battery life. Easy to use, and I can use it to take aerial pictures from the back window and then upload them to my phone or laptop. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive, lightweight, reliable, and easy to control aerial camera. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! I bought this to play with my new iPad Pro and it is perfect for that. I've been using it with my iPad Pro for about a week and i'm loving it. I'm using it for music, iMovie and some other stuff but it's been great so far. You won't be dissapointed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the hs2000 for a few months now and have been very happy with the sound, its fast, light and compact. i had one of these and bought a second one just because i needed one more and i didnt want to spend the money on a cd player, so that worked out great!  Sound Quality  The sound quality is pretty good for a computerized turntable. I do prefer the sound quality of my vinyl turntables. The bass is slightly less than my vinyls, but not bad.  Pros: light, fast, compact, good sound quality. .  the only con I can think of is the lack of a USB input.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  This is the only one I would use for my computer. I have used other ones that did not work properly. This is easy to install and set up and does the job. I like that it comes with an extra power cord that is longer than most.  Great product and very easy to use. I am impressed by the quality and price of this unit. I will be purchasing more for my computers. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for over 2 years and it still works as good as the day i got it i just bought another one that's a little more expensive and better quality but it also takes more time to do anything with. ive found that the battery on this device is the biggest thing that could be better. ives been trying to find a good battery for my ipad for over a year now and all i could find was cheap knock off batteries which have been really bad for my batteries. but this one is really a nice battery but it takes a little longer to recharge. ived also tried the bluetooth which is also really good and easy to use but it doesn't always connect and i find that i have to get the battery connected and then press the power button to charge the device. if i wanted a better battery i would buy this one and use a bluetooth charger which is what ive been doing since i got the ipad 2.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- This is a great product. It's been good for 2 years. I used this product for 3 years and it was a big help for me in getting to the point where I could do a 2 hour project without going into a deep slumber and having to wake up to do the next thing. --------------------------  Best Value For The Money By Anonymous on 11/10/2016 This is the best value for the money on a small monitor. I had a very hard time figuring out how to connect it to my mac. I figured out it was the power cord that came with it. I bought the adapter and connected it to a power outlet on my computer. It worked right away. This is my first monitor, but it works great. I'm a high school student so it's hard for me to get enough time to do things like this. I will use this monitor all the time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The price is amazing for a device that is so small, has such great features, and I'm so happy I found it. This is my first electronic device, but I have an old portable typewriter and I've been very impressed with the speed and reliability of the printer. My typewriter is only a couple years old and it still runs just as well as the new one. The size of the typewriter keyboard makes it easy to hold the keyboard while typing and you can use your fingers to write. The print function works well, and it comes with a few pages that you can print out to give to your kids to play with. It's the best value I've found for an electronic printer and is well worth the money.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best printer in the market I have had this printer for a couple of weeks now and it has been fantastic. I use it for my personal and work. The only reason why i am not giving it a 5 star is because i am a beginner and it is a bit difficult to learn how to use it, it is quite bulky. I'm going to buy a larger size version to help with printing and other functions.  and I can't think of any reason why someone would not have this printer. It is compact, easy to use, and has an amazing print quality. It has the same features as the big name brands, and the price is unbeatable.  the only issue i have with this printer is that the cartridge that holds the paper and paper cutter is in poor condition, it has had some cracks on it, so be prepared for a bit of pain to use the printer when it's on your desk.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the remote, it's very easy to use. I like the speed dial feature as well. It's a nice looking device, and a great option for someone who needs a small, easy to read display but still needs to be able to control a large TV.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________   I bought this because I wanted a small audio player, but found it too small. However, it is easy to use. It is well made. I have not used it in the dark because I don't like the light. I bought this to put in my car to listen to my favorite songs. I use it in my truck and in the bed of my truck. The volume control is perfect. I like the fact that you can use a plug to plug the unit in, as well as use it to play your favorite tunes. I wish it came with a little extra cord so I could have it on my keychain or on my nightstand.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It is a good product and works great. ______________________________________________________________ What I Liked:   A good product with the best quality, good features and ease of use.    The product was well designed, easy to use, and good looking.  What I didn't like:    It has a very loud speaker, I have to turn it down or use headphones or use it on a different audio source.  The USB cable needs to be longer so it can be used in a laptop.  My Recommendation:  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a USB device to play music, listen to music, or have an external audio device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Tandy 1000 is a decent product that can be used for all types of tasks.  It's light, and its a good value.   I use it for my own personal computing and for the occasional "laptop" at the library.  It is also small and portable.  I haven't been using the keyboard much but it's fine.  In conclusion:    I think the Tandy is a good buy for anyone who doesn't need much.  The Tandy also has the advantage of being inexpensive.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iknow what i really like about this device is the great sound and sound quality that this device produces. Its easy to use and you can use it on a range of music genres. The remote is also great for adjusting the volume and you don't have to press a button for every song. The price is very good as well, I would recommend this device to anyone who likes a good sounding guitar amp.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ***************************** I have an old Yamaha R-7A from the late 70's. It was not designed for a piano but a keyboard. I used it in the early 80's as a keyboard for my old Yamaha SDR-6B keyboard. When I needed to upgrade the keyboard for a new one, I bought the R-8A. I have the original key switches, but I have not replaced them. The keyboard was a real piece of work but it did the job. The R-9 is even better. It does not need a computer. The keys are much more tactile. The sounds are rich, full, and rich in depth. The piano sounds like a real piano. It's great for chords or for a beginner pianist. It is also a great device for piano players who want to learn to play the piano by ear. The computer does not play music, but it is an excellent instrument for that purpose. I am very happy with this device. It would be great if it came with a CD of music.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very satisfied with the quality of the product and the customer service.  The device was delivered in excellent condition and as expected.  Excellent sound from a small portable amp! I purchased this amp because I needed to get more bass out of my bass guitar.   The bass is already quite loud, but the bass on this amp sounds great!    This is a great little amp! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my wife. It's a great little device. It has a very good sound and it is very easy to use. The only thing that is a little annoying is that the batteries must be replaced every few months.   This is a good device for the price and it will last a very long time. It is a must buy for anyone who has a little one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was a little disappointed by the design of the device, but that may be due to me being a first timer. I found the device to be a lot easier to use than I was expecting, and I would recommend it to a friend. Rating:    Pros:    Compact and easy to carry. Works with a cell phone, bluetooth keyboard, etc. Cons:  Not as well designed as it's big brother. This device has come in handy when I'm away from home. The only negative I can think of is that the unit is not as well built as its bigger brother, the Manta. The plastic is not that thick, and the device does have some rough edges. The unit is still a good device, though. It is easy to use, and it is very compact. The device will hold my phone, and bluetooth keyboards (like the one that comes with my iphone 4s) perfectly. It's also easy to see where I'm going, since I can look down into the device and see the screen. I've used the device on my ipsap.com account, which is pretty cool. The most difficult part of using the Mii is getting it set up. I haven't had any issues with that, though, so I'm happy about that.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the pico for over a year and it works perfectly for my needs. its very small, light and has the right input for my project and needs. i recommend it to everyone that is looking for an affordable yet powerful system with plenty of power for their project.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This is a great device, I have been using it for a couple months now and love it! I am using it with a Sennheiser HD650 and a Fostex T50RP. I'm using a wireless subwoofer with a DPA 4008. Works great with my Senns! This is an excellent product. I would buy again and recommend it to anyone. It's definitely worth the money! - K.B. I was so excited when I received the PonoPlayer. The first time I plugged it in and started it, I thought it was broken. I took it back to Best Buy and they were able to repair it. I am so glad I did! It sounds better than the P6, and it doesn't have a horrible high-end. I've been able to listen to some pretty good music and podcasts with it. The Pono doesn't play everything, but the music I do listen to is better than what I had before. The only thing that I don't like is the sound quality when it's playing mp3s, like I used to be able to do with my old Pono player. The sound of the MP3 files sounds so compressed, so I can't really listen to them without getting a headache. Also, the remote doesn't work at all with my phone. I have to use the included wireless remote. I don't understand why the P2 doesn't offer a wired remote, which could be used to play music from my phone without my having to plug it into my stereo. The battery life is great and it works with any wireless device (cell phone, iPod, iPhone, Bluetooth speakers, etc.) so it can be used in many places. I really like the fact that it can also play CDs, but it's still a little limited in that respect. If it were a little more portable, I'd recommend it. But I do like the sound, so it's good enough for me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for over a year now and it is perfect for my needs. its so convenient to charge my phone. It has the ability to charge 3 different kinds of batteries. I dont need to worry about the battery going dead and its so easy to use. I love it and my friends love it too. I recommend it to everyone!  Rated 5 out of 5 by MikesG from This charger is great I was worried about this charger and how long it would last, but after a month of use, it's still going strong. I'm currently using it to charge the Galaxy Note 4 and I've got one to spare! I've only had it for a few weeks, but it's been great.  Customer Reviews Reviews
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 7 plus, best of all I have a problem with the touch screen. I have had it for almost 2 years now and I have used it every day for my daily needs. I recently found that it is now very hard to turn the screen on. I had it repaired by my local apple repair shop and they said they could fix it. But I had a problem the next day when my phone was in the car, so I went back to the apple store to get another repair kit. They had a little bit of trouble with it, but when they got it back to me, it was not working properly. I gave it another try, and the first time it was working fine. Then one day I woke up to the sound of the screen turning off. I opened my phone, and found it was a screen protector that was covering the touch panel, but the protector was ripped off. It was very frustrating to have to get it repaired again. It should work the first few times, but if you need to replace it, I suggest getting a good screen protector. I love this phone and have only had to get repairs twice, but this one has me worried about it. It would be better if it had a better touch screen and a longer battery life. I would also suggest that the software should be more polished.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone, my new favorite. This was my first smartphone, and I am happy I went with an apple device. It was easy to setup and is very easy to use. I can get up to 20gb of data on my phone, I also use my ipad to listen to music and watch videos on my tv. It's a great device. I will definitely buy from them again and recommend to anyone who wants a good phone for their money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been looking at these for quite some time now and have yet to find a better one. They have made my life easier since i was working with a bad old laptop, which was too small and slow to get through my emails and web pages, and not as nice as a MacBook Air. The battery life is outstanding. The screen is bright, the keyboard is backlit, and the built in speakers are fantastic. You really can't go wrong here. The only negative is that they have a rather long shipping time to the uk, but i got mine in time.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: e-liquid-shop

I just wish that it had a little bit more power than it currently has. The kids also use it as their laptop. The screen is very bright and they love it so much they were looking forward to going to sleep. I was looking forward too. I also got a Bluetooth mouse and the one they use to play games.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have bought 3 different devices in the past 2 years.  These are all great for gaming and for a portable device.  I am a newbie gamer and I have been looking for a good gaming device to use on the go.  I have tried the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.  I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab and the Nexus 7.  My first two were great and the next two I really wish I had bought.  The HTC One is very expensive and I wish I could find it at a cheaper price.  It is a great device to have but I wish it came with a screen protector and the same battery life as the Samsung.   My wife bought a second Galaxy Tab, it is really nice and I love it.  She is very happy with it. The only thing I didn't like about this is the fact that the battery life is the same as the other Samsung devices.  If I had the money I would have bought an S5 and a Note 4.  They are both good devices, and I would still buy them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a SONY DSC-HD600 and love the features and sound. My only issue is that it has a little plastic plate on the bottom of the headphone port that the plastic covering is cracked so that when I insert the headphones in to the headphones the bottom port has a slight bend and the headphone doesn't stay in.  But I think that is only because the headphones have been on for so long that it is not noticeable to others. Write a negative review about an unhelpful electronic device  : I was a happy customer but the SONY HD600S are not that great. I have had the unit for almost a year now and they are still working but there is a small crack on the plastic that makes it very easy to get into the unit.  Write an unfavorable review about poor service  (or the wrong type of service)  or an ineffective customer service response:    This is the review that has the most negative reviews for it but I think its a good one.  I had a problem with the wireless charger.  It would charge my phone for like 4 hours but would not charge my laptop.   I called customer service and the tech answered but told me to use my cable and it would charge the phone.    This is the reason I think the product is good but the service is poor.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a good sound quality. I have used other stereo headphones and I find the E8-P to be quite a bit better than the other, less expensive, models.  The E8 is a bit cheaper and has a different design, but that is not a bad thing.  This is an excellent stereo headphone. It's very comfortable and has the same sound quality as the Sennheiser HD650.  I recommend this headphone to everyone who is interested in a good stereo headphone, but has the budget to buy the HD650 or HD600.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this device to help me learn about computers and I am amazed. I have been studying computers for over 30 years and this is the best thing I have used. I love it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am not sure how well it will hold up in the long run. I purchased the "Dangerous" model and I have to say it is not as good as the "Safe" model. The buttons are a little mushy and not easy to use. The unit is very heavy, I think its a good investment because I will be purchasing another one in the future. The software works flawlessly, I am learning to use it, but I would not recommend it as a beginner.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought a couple of the ipods/iphones/mp3 players etc from this website and they have all worked fine with no problems. I have owned these ipods for a year and a half now and no problems what so ever. Ive been able to listen to music on the ipod and on my mp3 player and they are both very good quality and no problem. This site is great for purchasing these and other electronic devices. Thanks for all the help!  Rated 1 out of 5 by jonny2 from Not what I expected I bought these a few weeks ago and they work great. I was hoping that they would work better than the iPod Touch, but they don't. The ipods are very heavy and don't have much battery life. I'm sure this is because of the smaller battery, but I can't believe Apple would use a battery that small in these. They also make a lot of noise when they are charging. They are great to listen on the bus but don't deserve a 5.

It has all the features I want and it is a pleasure to use. It is also very easy to read. I am a student and need a device that is portable. I love the light weight of the Kobo and the size and battery life. I can read a full page and then read the next page on the same battery. It comes with the perfect type of reader. I have never had any problems with the reader and the ability to download ebooks. ____________________________________________________________________ I have purchased several different devices in the past. I would never have purchased this book unless I had been aware of the eReader before purchasing it. It came with all the software and the book is very easy and fast to read! I also had some problems with it the first time I used it. My computer wouldn't recognize the device, so I had to download the KDP and then use the software. Once I installed the KDPS and the e-Reader software, I was able to download and read. _________________________________________ This is a good book. It's an eReader that is perfect for me. I purchased it because I wanted to read more books, and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I think I'll buy the book again. I'm looking forward to my next book purchase. ______________ This is the first eReader I have used, and it's a great read. It took a while to read, but once I started I could read the whole thing. I bought the eReaders to keep my books and e-books in my house, and this is a great device to read those. It takes about 4 hours to read a book, so you won't be doing this on a rainy day! _____________________________________________________________________ I've used a Kindle for about 2 years now and have purchased the eReading program, which is great. My only complaint is that I wish there was an option to purchase the digital version of my Kindle book, as it is $1 more than the physical version. I did get the ebooks on my Kindle, but they cost me $1.99 and that was not worth it. I wish they offered this as an option. ____________________ This is an excellent product and is very fast. The price is also a bargain compared to most other ereaders on the market. The only negative thing I can say about it is that it doesn't come with the e
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** I've had this on my desk for a while now, and I just got the 3.5" one. I have a desktop computer with a 16 bit CD drive (and a few other things). The interface is really easy to use and the sound quality is superb. This thing is not a professional grade device, but the quality is great. I really love it and use it almost every day for work. Great job, Philips. I am a PC person. *************************** I have been using this sound card with a Sound Blaster Live 3 Pro PC since late 2003. The sound quality has been fantastic. The computer can be powered off and on with a USB cable. The PC works great with my laptop as well. The interface has been easy to learn and use. I can play some of the best music ever recorded on a computer with the sound card in my computer. The only thing that I wish I had done differently is to get a second (or third) cable for the second port on the back of the card. I wish there was an option to just put the second cable on the front of the sound board. This is really a great product. I highly recommend it. ************** I have had this card for over 4 years and it is great! I can run Windows 95, Windows 98, NT4, and XP. It does not have an optical drive but does work fine with any sound card I've used in the past. The software is very simple to use. It can record your favorite CDs and play them back over and over. It works with any computer with an optical disk drive. It has a lot of great features that make it worth it. I've bought another one for a friend and they also like it. Thanks for making it easy to get music on the go! *************** The Sound Blaster card works well with any Windows system. I recommend it for any PC user.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I have the card and its awesome! I bought this card because I had to use it with a laptop that came with an S/PDIF port.

It was easy to install and the drivers for the sound cards came right out of the box! If you're looking for a sound board, get this
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought this about a month ago for a birthday present. It's a great gift. The color is good and I am a big fan of the touch controls. I'm hoping that it will stay on all the time, but the only complaint I have is that it does have a little difficulty charging. I've only had it for about a week so I'm not sure if that's a design issue or just a matter of me not being that experienced with chargers. Otherwise, it's a solid product and I look forward to getting a lot more use out of it.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:

I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to be able to read books online on their computer. I will be ordering a second one soon. I am happy with this purchase, and will purchase again.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, October 26, 2012  by RICHARD A. from Boca Raton FL USA  Review: I've been looking for a decent e-reader for a long time, and this one does the job well. It does not have as many features as the iPad and is not as light or as thin, but it's a good all-around e-Reader. The quality of the display (even on the dimmer setting) is excellent and the reader is a pleasure to use.  the only thing i don't like is that you need a wireless keyboard to use it. but other than that, it's good!  The only thing that bugs me is the screen size, I was hoping to get an e-Book reader that is a little bigger and has a bigger screen than the iPad. but this one is not quite big enough for that. .  The price was reasonable for the features you get.  and the customer service was top notch.    Was the Review Helpful not to you? Yes No Friday, August 19, 2012
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ I've had my Giga 2G since 2006, I am so happy with it. I have used it at work and home, I'm on my second one now. The battery life is great, the interface is easy to use and the speakers are so clear I can't hear my neighbors! You don't have to spend tons of money to get this thing, and you get more than what you pay for.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Icom IC-7600 is a great portable radio, and the quality is excellent. It has an excellent audio and it's very portable. Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, February 15, 2012 Great Radio, Great price. I bought the IC-6600, but found out that the unit was not compatible with my Icom ICD9633. I was able to fix the issue by replacing the Icom part number with the ICOM IC-7601 which also had an ICOM ICD9733. The Icom's are just a little more expensive than the ICom IC-7500. I had a lot of fun with my radio, but the IC7601 is just a bit more robust and it has a more elegant design. Was this Review helpful to you in the past?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought the P4 as an upgrade to my old P3 and am very pleased with the upgrade in quality and performance. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will use it again and recommend it to my friends.  Write a negative review about the P3: --------------- I bought this product to replace my old Samsung P3. I love the sound, the light weight, and the ability to turn it on and off. The problem I have is that the button to turn the device on and the button that turns off it both have the same design, which I think is very difficult to press. The button to change the volume is easy to press and does not have any issues. The volume button does not work, the LED on the P2 does not light. I think there should be a switch so you can turn the light off if you don't want it on. This is the second one I have bought from you, the first was broken after a year of use, but now I am out of money so I am back to get another one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Sangean C7 is a great product. I have been a long time user of the Sangeen EKG series of EKGs. The C7 EK is more accurate than the EK G2 and has the ability to be set at a higher or lower flow rate. I highly recommend the C7 if you are looking for a high flow, low price EK device. I did not want to pay a lot of money for a G2 device, but the C5 EK has saved me a few hundred dollars. Read the full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my sony mx1 for about a month now and i love it! the only thing that i wish was different is the remote, but other then that i love my sennheiser mx2. thanks sony!  Rated 5 out of 5 by MikeyH from Great sound and easy to use I have a Sony MX1 and have been happy with it. The only reason I am giving this 5 stars instead of 4 is because the remote is very flimsy, the buttons don't feel like they are well built. Also the mic port doesn't work in my car, but it works in my TV. Overall, it's a great phone and it's great to have a phone that's waterproof.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- The new LG Laptop is a good device for someone who wants a new computer with a lot of performance for a good price. It is very good value for the money and is not too expensive. The graphics are not very powerful, but that is to be expected on a laptop. You should have some basic knowledge on how to use your computer if you buy a laptop, but the Laptop will get you through your day. --------------------------- The LG Laptops are very good computers and have many features that make it easy to use. It has many good features such as a great keyboard and trackpad and a lot more. The Laptop has good battery life, and will not need a charge for a long time. I like the fact that it has a lot less buttons than my MacBook Pro, but you can still easily use a mouse and keyboard. If you need a laptop for college, you should get a computer with better specs than the LG Lptl, but a lot cheaper.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6s plus  by A.J. I got this for my son. He is really a fan of the phone. It's nice and light.  I do have a few gripes. I have to get out the way to use the headphones, but then I'll be able to get the phone out without having to look down at the screen. The backlighting is not as bright as other phones. And I'm not sure if I'd prefer it to be brighter. Other than that, I'm happy with the phone and can't wait to buy more of the accessories for it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The product is good, it has all the features I wanted, good for watching movies and video games, and the sound is very good. However, the unit I bought does not work well with my computer. I had the same problem with my desktop. The unit does not connect to the computer with the supplied cables, it just doesn't have a power plug, and I have to use the computer's USB cable to use it. I'm really disappointed, because the sound quality is great and the device is a nice size, it is also good looking. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an external hard drive, I also use it with my laptop.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Nice product for the price I bought the unit for use with a computer that had a hard drive problem. I was unable to use a second hard drive in my desktop PC. The solution is to use this external drive as a secondary hard drive. The device is small and easy to use. It connects via USB 2.0. I have not had a chance to use with my gaming computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* I have bought a couple of these units, and they are great for small projects. They come with a little screwdriver that comes in handy, and the software is easy to use. I do use the software to set the output voltage for the device, and set the current limit. I find the current draw to be low, even with a high power supply. I can run a small project with this unit, and it works great. I use this for small audio projects, and do not mind the small size.

I bought this laptop to replace a Macbook Air that I had. The computer came with no accessories so I ordered the wireless dongle for the battery, and the extra USB charger.  It is a good quality laptop. The touchpad is nice and I think the keyboard and trackpad are better than the Macbook.  My only problem is the screen is not very bright.  I bought a good one but I think I will be able to fix it by getting the extra backlight and changing the backlight to an amber one.  This was the only problem I had with this laptop but overall it is a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I am extremely happy with my new Dell Venue 8 Pro. The first time I turned it on, the fan started whirring, but I ignored it because the computer was not hot. Then, a few hours later, I opened the laptop and the fan was still running. I immediately noticed the fan speed and shut it down. I went back to the store and they gave me a refund and said that the fan is probably broken. After I got home, I went into the computer section and I saw the fan running at full speed. I thought it was my new computer and turned it off, but it started whirling again. I turned the computer back on and shut the fan down. After a few minutes, the fans were spinning again. My computer has now been working flawlessly for a few days. I have not experienced any problems. If you're considering buying this computer, I recommend you give it a try. I'm going to buy a new one because I know this is the best Dell has to offer.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first computer I ever used was a IBM PC XT with 8 MB of memory. I'm very glad that I finally got around to buying a computer for my daughter. She has always wanted to play with computers but was unable to find one in her price range. The Commodore 64 is a great machine. It is very powerful and comes with the Commodore Basic software that is very easy to learn. The price is also good and it has a lot of memory and disk storage space. I think this is one of the best bargains out there at the moment. The only problem is that it is difficult to find the manual online because the software is not compatible with the internet. If you have a lot to do, and a lot on your hands, I highly recommend this computer.    Very good product! Review by Chris The product is a very good value for money. It has a great build quality and a great design. The monitor is very bright and has a very nice design and it looks great. It comes with a disk drive, but you will need to hook it up to a PC to use it. The screen is very clear, the buttons are easy to use and the build quality is excellent. I would recommend this to any Commodore 64 owner!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- This is a great product. The batteries last a long time and are small enough to carry around in my backpack. --------------------------  The only thing I don't like about it is the size of the buttons. If I were to buy a new computer, I would choose this model.  This is a good little device. I use it as a simple monitor and can't tell the difference from my old monitor that came with the computer. :)  If I were in a position to write a negative review, I'd say the batteries are a little short. ,  I've been using this monitor for a couple of weeks and it's the first monitor I've ever owned that works with my ATI Radeon 8500M graphics card. I have it hooked up to a Radeon 9700 and it looks great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple, inexpensive monitor that works well with their ATI graphics card.:)  the battery is a little too short but that is a small price to pay for a quality product.   I highly recommend this monitor. I'm just using it to test out a new graphics card for a pc project.   in my opinion the best thing about this monitor is the quality of the picture and the fact that it is very portable. the price is a bit high but this is an excellent product. .  and i use it every day.  to the point that i have it sitting on my desk and i don't even know how i got it there.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for almost 3 months and it has been the best buy i've ever made. the quality is outstanding and it is a lot of fun to use. the battery is large and lasts a good while. the light is also very good. i use it as a flashlight and it will do the job. it is quite powerful and a bit bright. also it can be charged with the micro usb. the only downside is that it takes about 4 hours to charge from empty, but it gets a lot faster with the rechargeable battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________   I purchased this device as a backup for my computer because I work from home and it is nice to have a separate display for work, it's also very nice for gaming when you're away from home. It's nice to be able to plug in a USB port and have it work from anywhere. I have had it for a couple of weeks and it works very well.   The only issue is that it doesn't display as many of the colors as the LCD monitor that I have, it doesn`t seem to be that much of a problem, but if you are a real geek like me, it is annoying.   the price is good, it works well, the price has gone down and I expect it to go up in the future.  I bought this as a replacement for my older monitor and this one is a little better. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the resolution. The one I have is 2560 x 1600. This one is 1920 x 1200. I didn't like that much, but my old monitor did not have a good color calibration either so I have not tested the color quality yet. The brightness of this monitor is a bit lower than my old one. The monitor itself is very well built, it has a few minor flaws, but for what it is it's a very good monitor.  the only thing that bothers me is the color calibration, and it's not a big deal since I'm not really into color, but I have to say it's kind of annoying.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It has a very large battery, which can charge a phone or tablet to 80% in about 10 minutes, which is a bit disappointing. I think this would have been more convenient to have the option to charge the device to 100% in a few minutes, but that might just be me. I do like that it has a charging light, as that helps me figure out how much charge is left. The charging light is also a great feature for those who need to charge while out of the house, which helps the device be more convenient and less prone to getting lost. I love that it's easy to remove the battery and keep the charger. The device also comes with a USB cable and a USB power adapter.

I have the 2nd generation iPod (6th gen) and it is my favorite of all the iphone models. I use the iPod on my computer, my phone, and my iPod on a separate Bluetooth receiver. The best thing about the iplex is that it has the ability to connect to my phone over bluetooth and is very easy to use. I love the fact that it comes with 2 extra cables to connect my phone and ipod. I also really like that it is wireless. This is the best iplexes I have ever owned and will be buying more in the future.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- My wife and I are both very happy with our Apple MacBook Air. It's not the most beautiful thing ever, but it is functional and the screen is great. The keyboard is a little on the slow side, but if you use the trackpad to scroll and you're good with the click, it's great. Also, the speakers are nice and loud, but you can't really get much better than that. The only negative is that the MacBook Air is a bit on the expensive side. The first time I used it, I was so disappointed with the performance that I went to get another MacBook. My wife didn't get one, but she did get a MacBook Pro. It didn't make any difference, but we're both very satisfied. I hope that Apple gets some money out of the sale of the MacBooks. It would be a great idea to include an ethernet port in the next generation. (Posted on 5/19/2008)  Great product. Very durable and well built. I just wish it was a little thinner. I had my MacBook Air for 2 years and still had problems. The second time I bought the MacBook I went out and bought the second generation. I was pleasantly surprised to find it's more reliable and much thinner than the original one. I think Apple should consider making it a little bit thinner so it won't get damaged as much. Overall it's a great product and I'm very happy to use it. (posted on 5, May 2007)  in case the above doesn't cover it: if you have any of the problems listed above, this is not the computer for you. (December 2005)  that's my only complaint about the laptop...the keyboard is so stiff... (August 2005)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The first thing I noticed is the design of the case is great. It fits my iPhone 7 Plus snug and feels very good. It's also super light and very small. The screen is really good as well. The battery life is very good and the sound is also very good, especially on the headphones. I don't know how to explain the sound quality. It is just very good if you like listening to music. The only complaint I have is that there is no volume control. You have to be careful how you use the phone because the buttons are small and you don't want to accidentally change volume. Overall I'm very pleased with the phone. It looks good, has good battery life and good sound quality which is nice.  I bought this for my wife, who loves to listen to music with her ears. She really liked the idea of the earphones but the fit wasn't perfect. The earphones are too small, they're not even close to the iPhone 7. I ordered a larger size to use with her. The sound is really nice and the fit is good. But I feel that the sound could be better. But it's worth the money. 's a great phone and very comfortable to use for the most part. I do have some complaints about the earphone, but I can't help but wish that the mic would be built in to the earpiece so that it's easier to use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- The new iStick is the best device to date. I have been a user of the old iSticks for over a decade now. They are so simple to use and are always with me. I just bought the 2.4 ohm version. It is definitely a great device and is very reliable. I am now in the process of getting a 5 ohm and 5.1 ohm model. This new version has a better design than the older model. The new one also has a small LED light that turns on when the battery is low. It has two power settings and you can turn off the LED light to save battery life. I also like the fact that the battery doesn't go flat after a week. It's really nice to have. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I love it. ------------------------- Buy this if you like the iSticker: ------------------ I bought the istick for Christmas last year. I've been using the old ones for years and this is a huge upgrade. I use the original one every day and love the fact I can see what I have in my package while I am out of the house. The newest one has the little LED light and is smaller than the old one, so I just keep it in my pocket when I travel. --------------- Buy this for a gift: -------------- It's a great little gadget. I was so excited to try it out that I ordered one for my sister and brother in law for Christmas. I know they are going to love it and love having it with them. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves electronic items.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she has had it for less than two weeks now and it has worked great. She loves it and she's a little embarrassed to say it but she has to admit it's a lot better than the one she had before. I'm pretty sure she will be buying it again for her daughter for Christmas. She said it's the most comfortable and simple to use e-cigarette I've ever used. It's not going to get you the big hit but it's definitely more than worth the money. - M.  I got this as a gift for my husband who is a former smoker. He loves it! - S.  the only thing I dont like is the battery life. I tried for over 5 minutes to get it to quit, and then went on my lunch break. I have to say, its still there when I get back. it is definitely a good starter unit. The batteries last about a month. - C. . The batteries last a month on average. I also found it very easy to get started. I used my new Vaporshark with a 0.5 ohm coil. I was very pleased with this starter kit. - B.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus I've bought several of these and the best thing about them is the battery life. The first one lasted only a week but the second lasted for a month. I was having to use my phone at least a dozen times a day. Now I just use my iPad or my PC and I'm good to go. Thank you,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought this for my husband and his dad as a gift. The device was extremely easy to use and was easy to set up. The color was beautiful and the remote is extremely helpful. The remote is small enough to not take up a lot of space. The product was good and the price was right.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for a few months now and i absolutely love it. it can be charged while the battery is still in the device. if you use it for the amount of time it claims it will last, you will be amazed at the amount that you can save. it has all the features i need, but it is a little hard to use the button on the side. but that is no fault of the device as it is great. i am a college student and i was not able to find a computer in my school that was similar in size and the price. i chose this device over my laptop and i am so glad i did. it is also very good for watching movies and music.  Rated 5 out of 5 by AussieMan from Love the small size, can charge in under 5 minutes The size is perfect for my needs. The battery lasts longer and the size is great for my small hand.  (Posted on 4/27/2018)  Great small computer I have had this computer for about a month now. I have been using it to surf the web, read emails, watch movies, play games, and it runs very smoothly. It has not crashed or crashed during normal use. The USB cable is pretty cheap and easy to get on the shelf at most electronics stores. I would recommend this computer to anyone. (Posted 8/8/2017)  I have purchased several different products from B&H over the years, and this is by far the best purchase of any. (Added on 2/27.2017)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using my computer for a few years now and I must say I love it. It's the fastest, simplest, and most convenient computer I've ever owned. The built in DVD player is a godsend and is the only thing that makes it worth the $500 price tag. The only thing I would change is the battery life is really not that great, but I know it will last for a long time. I just wish I could find a way to charge it with my phone instead of plugging in. Write a negative review about an average electronic device (but good):  This is my first time owning a computer.  It took me a couple days to figure out how to operate it, but it was a lot of fun once I figured it out. I was initially frustrated with the built in CD player and couldn't figure out why the CD quality was so poor. After a while I figured out how it works and now I love my computer. I do wish it came with a built in modem, but overall I am very happy with it. I wish it had a built-in printer instead of a computer printer that plugs into a standard PC power cord.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently purchased a second one of these to replace my first. I am very pleased with this unit. It has been working fine, it does not get hot or too loud. It's very nice, the price is right and I can't say enough good things about this unit for what it does. I have had my first one for years. This is a great unit to keep in my home studio. This is my first unit that I purchased. I love that the power supply is built in. The price was right for me and I don't need to use my power supply at home. It comes with a case which I will use to keep it in my studio. I use it to power my mixer, sound card, and a computer. I can record from it at home and record in my house. I will definitely recommend this product. The sound quality of the mic is very good and is very quiet and not over powering the mixer. I was very pleased and was happy to use this unit in my first attempt. I had a friend who recommended this unit and this is one of the best microphones I have used. I'm very pleased.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! It is an amazing electronic product. It has a very good sound. The best part of this unit is the USB plug. I've got my hands on it and I can say it works great. The only downside is that it only has one USB port. I'm looking for a USB hub, but that's a lot of money to spend on a product. I highly recommend this product, and I have recommended it to a lot more people than I can remember.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first electronic device. I've been looking for a good portable radio for years. I finally found one. I got the radio a few weeks ago and it has worked perfectly. I am really happy with it. It's very light and easy to carry. I think I will get another one just because I can't live without this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased the A6-E2E-2E for my son because he loves computers.  We have an old school computer, a Sony Vaio laptop, and an iPad.

This is his first laptop so it is great to have a computer he can use to his full advantage. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5c  It's just perfect. I have the iPhone 5c. It's a wonderful phone and I don't even like the 4S. I like the screen, the battery, the camera, and the ability to send and receive text messages. I bought the iPhone 4S because I thought it would have a larger screen but I was wrong. I've gotten more text messages and calls on my 4S than on my 5c, but I'm still very happy with the 5c's performance. The phone is a joy to use, and I can't wait to see what the 5s has in store for us.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Excellent and useful!   The product is really nice. I don't like using my laptop for work because I need to get to work on time. This thing does the job and can even take notes. It's a good tool to have and I will use it for many more years.   Best thing since the lightbulb: a real notebook that works   I love the pen on the back and the fact that you can draw or write on it. This is the best portable notebook I have ever owned.   is the ultimate portable note taking device! The design is sleek, the weight is perfect, and the functionality is top notch! I love it so much I can't even say how much I love this product.  , and my kids love the notebook as well.   to the people who complain about it being expensive: get a better quality laptop. you can buy the E-Pen right here on amazon for a better price.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The new "Zoid" is a very well built and very nice product that has a very useful and useful feature: it is easy to set up! The software is also easy to use and has a good selection of features that you can configure. I think this is the first time that an app that is free to use has a great selection of sound options and the Zoid has lots of them! It has some very nice features for people who want to be creative with their music: you can create your own sound effects or use the sound editor to create new sounds! The built-in sequencer is also great: you use the touch screen to play a pattern of notes that you are listening to and it plays out on the computer! It is also a very good program for making your own music. The software can be very slow if you play a lot of notes or if you make a lot more than 20 notes per minute. I have a Zoid that has an internal sequencer, so I don't use it, but if I needed to, I could use the software to do it for me! Overall, it is a great product and I highly recommend it!Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The new iPad is great! I have always wanted one of these, but the previous models were pretty clunky and not as fast as my laptop, which was the iMac. I use my iPad for watching TV, but I do have some other things I want to do with it.  I use my phone to check email, read a book, and listen to music. ___________________________________________________________ I got this device for my wife for Christmas. ______________________ I am not sure why I didn't get the original. ______________ The device is good, but it is too big for my laptop. ___________________________ If you have been waiting to buy an iPad, this is the way to go. ____________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is really cool. I bought this for my older daughter. I got the bluetooth version and the charger. She is the type of person that has a lot of things that need charging. So this is a must have for her. It has lots of features like a built in alarm clock, music and a built-in speaker for music and calls. The speakers are really nice. It is a little large for a 5 year old but it is just fine. She loves it. The bluetooth is really nice too. I like that it doesn't require a monthly subscription to be used and it can be charged with the USB. The phone call and music and alarm clock are really cool too. It's a little noisy in the day but at night it is great. I think this is the best bluetooth speaker and charger for a kid's car.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this device for a long time now, the only reason i got it was because i thought it was just an old gizmo, but i was totally wrong. I use this to read books, and it has a nice weight to it. i have never had a problem with it, and i have been using it a long, long time. ive been using a number of different bookshelves over the years, and this one is by far the best and i use it for reading as well. i love it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I bought this device a couple of months ago and I really like it. It's easy to use, it works perfectly. I can connect my phone with my computer and play music on my TV. If you have a computer with a headphone jack you will need to use a USB adapter for this device to work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The sound is excellent! I use it with the Yamaha VCA and a Yamaha VCF, and it really sounds great! It's really good sounding with both mics! Great buy.  Rated 5 out of 5 by David from Perfect for acoustic I've used the Sennheiser ME-80 for a long time and always wanted to find a decent headset for acoustic guitar. This one is great. I've had it for over a year and the fit is excellent. - I've replaced a pair of old headphones and the sound is much better than the ones I used to use
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using this product for about 2 months and I can tell you I like the fact that it is rechargeable. The battery lasts for about 12 hours and the unit can be used at night. I also like the ability to use the light in both directions. The light comes on the dimmer when it is time to go to bed. The unit can't be too bright and I don't mind the glare at all.

I really don't use it for music, but it's great for watching movies.  the battery life is great also. I have had mine for a while and it still has a lot of life left. I haven't needed to replace it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I bought a samsung galaxy s4 for my son because he had one and i loved it so he picked out the s4. When i got the samsung and turned it on i was so amazed at the quality of the ssd. When it first got on it worked like a charm and the s sd was really quick to boot up. It has a lot of power in the battery but it still takes 2 or 3 minutes to get to the sd which is fine for me because i am not a power user but i did try and get it to work in a minute or so. The only thing is that it was not very easy to read the screen but i guess that is just because it is on a new screen and it is a new device. Overall, it is an excellent samsung phone for a great price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.................................. I've had a few issues with the keyboard on the XO3, but the only issue I've ever had was with the battery. Once the battery got low, it would lock up for a minute or two, but then just power back on. I've since replaced the battery and that issue is fixed. I really like the features and that it's small. I'm going to try it out with the tablet soon.  Rated 5 out of 5 by John from Excellent Product I used it for a few weeks in a couple of different rooms of my house. The unit is great. I used the mouse to do a little typing. Very easy to operate. Very small. Great features. The keyboard is nice and quiet.    Rated 3 out of 4 by Lenny from Not a bad product for the price. However, I would like to see a more intuitive user interface. In general, I am a bit disappointed in the functionality of the Xo3. I don't think the Xon2 or Xon3 were as good. It is great to have the capability of a mouse, but it does take getting used to using it. In the end, the Xojane is a good, small computer that is a pleasure to use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I'm very pleased with my purchase of the E-Liquids. They are the perfect size for the price. The quality is excellent. I'm going to get a bigger size and this one is good for what I want. I have tried all the E liquid brands and I have never been disappointed. I also like that I can purchase multiple flavors. The shipping is fast and they have great prices.  Best Vape! ------------------------ I bought this because I needed a decent, inexpensive portable vape and I got exactly what I was looking for. It's portable and easy to use, it's easy to carry with a few extra coils, and I love the ability to switch flavors. I was originally skeptical that this would be as good as it is, but it is a fantastic vape that's perfect for travel. It can also be charged via USB so I can have it on my nightstand and ready to go in the morning. The only thing I wish it had was a little bit longer life. It gets about 2-3 days out of the 2 I have but that's pretty average. It does get really hot so I've been using a small tank for the most part and it's not really an issue since I don't go vaping often. It also doesn't take a lot of charge so I'm happy about that. I definitely recommend this!  Nice vape ------------------------- This is a very nice device, easy to set up and very efficient. I just wish the battery life lasted longer. The tank is small and the coil seems to be a little thin so it might be a bit hot to get through the coil, but once it's fully set up, it is very efficient and produces decent clouds. I highly recommend it!  and a bonus ---------------------------  Good Product ------------------------ The tank comes with two of the extra coils and you can purchase 3 more if you so choose. I had a good experience with this vape, I would recommend it if you're looking for a good portable vaporizer. I like the flavor that it produces. I would also recommend this to someone who is looking for something to use as an everyday vape.    Vape it ------------------------ This was the only e-cig I have purchased that I didn't need to refill with juice. It works well and is portable and does not taste bad. I am happy with my decision to buy this vape.   Amazing ------------------------  Worth
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is the best portable electronic device I have ever used! I am in my 40s and had been using my Walkman all these years and found myself losing my hearing. I have always heard a little pop when the battery is not fully charged but that is about it. I decided to get the Walkman+ because I am used to listening to music on a portable device and it will hold the music that I love to listen to for hours. The sound is very good. I play music from my iPod and it plays the same as it does on my Walkmen. It also has a CD player built in so you can listen to the music you have purchased from the internet. I can also listen to music from the Walkmans and this will hold them. I am very satisfied with this purchase. I would like to see the price reduced and a better battery. This is a good product that will last for many years.

The best part about this device is the sound.  The music is good and sounds very clear.  The volume control is not loud enough but it is easy enough to adjust.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a new computer to replace my aging Dell laptop (not the original one). I had a hunch that this would work well since my old laptop was a beast and this is a much smaller, lighter and more portable computer. My previous laptop was so heavy that it took up an entire wall of my office and this one is much lighter. Also, the keyboard is a lot more comfortable than my previous keyboard and the trackpad is much better than my old one. The only thing that I wish it had is a full size HDMI port, but otherwise I have no complaints about it.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikaradio. This is my first iKarma and it's perfect! It's the best! I got it on a whim and was so happy I did. It's a great portable speaker with a decent sound and is well built and does what it's supposed to. I don't use it to record but I'm sure it can do that. It would be great to get a stand to go with it, but the included one isn't very good. I would like to see a better version of the sound. It doesn't have that bass that most speakers have. I also want to try the usb connection, but it's a bit awkward to get into and out.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I love the sound quality of this speaker, but the sound is so distorted and distorted the amp can't really handle it. I've bought a new amp with a different set of drivers but it's no use. The speakers sound great with this amp. I just wish it had better bass for my music. It's a good little speaker but it would be great if the sound came out of the speakers.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve S. from Excellent sound quality and comfort! I am a musician and sound engineer. I wanted to add a portable speaker to my studio. After much searching and a lot of research, I purchased the HD600 from HDaudio. I like the overall design and comfort of the speaker. I do recommend purchasing a case to protect your speaker. It does take some getting used to but once you get used to the volume, it is easy to get used. The sound is great!  Customer Testimonials

Rated 5 out of 5 by Cinzano from Awesome Sound I'm a bit of a headphone snob, so the S4 isn't really my cup of tea. But this is the first pair of headphones I've purchased and I've been very happy with them. They sound good, with the bass and treble all well-controlled.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I've had this little box for about a month now. I'm a bit slow when it comes to buying stuff and I'd bought a ton of other stuff that I didn't use and I'm still using it. I've tried several apps but I always come back to the same ones. I love the fact that it doesn't have any cords that I can't get rid of, I just put it in my pocket and use it when I'm walking around or doing errands. It doesn't do anything to my eyes or ears but I think that's good for me. I can leave it on my bed at night to keep the house from being too noisy and if I turn it on I have to plug in a speaker to hear anything at all. I just use my cell phone to turn it off and I can turn it back on when I get home from work. I have a few complaints about the app, but other than that I love it.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 15, 2012  It's a fine little gadget  by Jeff from Fairfield CA USA  Pros: compact, convenient, well built, battery life.  the only thing I'd like to see added is the ability to sync with my cell phones cell phone, I use it all the time and love the feature.  I use a battery to store it in a safe place.  a must have for any smart phone user. :D  Cons: I wish it was in a different color  Review: I am very happy with this product, and it fits my need. The only thing that would make it even better is if the battery lasted longer. It seems to run out more often than I am willing to let it. It does the job though. -Jeff  I was so disappointed in my old wireless charger that I couldn't live without it anymore. . The first thing I did was order this. I use this to power my phone, and I've never been able to go more than a few days without a charge. My battery life is almost twice as long as my old charger, and the power supply is so much better. I had to return the old one, as I didn 't need the extra power.  and the app is great. It's really easy to use and the battery lasts a long time, so I can use my phone without fear. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The T.V. receiver works very well. The volume control is easy to use and doesn't get in the way of what you want to watch.

Yes No Monday, June 07, 2011  Works as advertised  by Daniel from Poughkeepsie NY USA  Pros: Very good sound. - Good range for a single channel receiver.  in the car.  a little loud at full volume, but that's to be expected with a single speaker.  and with a subwoofer, a lot louder.  is easy on the ears, and looks great. . ,  Cons:  1. There's no volume control.  this is very strange and makes it difficult to adjust the volume of the sound. I like the idea of being able to adjust it manually, but I wish they'd put a volume control on the receiver. I have to set it myself. 2. When you get a call, there's no audio when you press the "answer" button. The caller ID display is only displayed when you hold the answer button down. You can't see the caller ID while pressing the answer. 3. There are no instructions included with the receiver for changing the receiver's speaker type. 4. The display is not bright and easy to read, so the bright white background is difficult to see.    Was This Review HelpfulTo you?Yes No Wednesday, June 06, 2011

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i purchased this item to replace my aging computer with the latest and greatest. i love it. the new screen is clear and bright and has a nice weight to it. i also love the way the computer boots up fast (i use windows XP) and how easy it is to use (it does not boot into windows).  i use it on a desk, in my home office. and its a perfect size to fit in a cubicle.  the only thing i wish is that it had a built in modem so that i could access the internet without having to connect my computer to my work pc and run a dialup from home.  (and to be able to access the modem via a ethernet cable)  (the computer is a Dell Inspiron 9400 w/ 32 MB RAM, 512 MB Solid State Drive and a 4x CD-RW drive) ... and the only thing that i dont like about the device is that its too heavy for me to carry around. i have a big desk that i have to move it about 5 feet away from the computer to fit it.  a few weeks ago, i found out that the mouse had a loose cable that came out the back of the device. . (i dont mind having a loose mouse cable as i use a mouse pad and a keyboard and a mouse, but to not know that it can be easily undone is frustrating)   Overall, the device was very well made, the price was great and i got a quality product. i will use this device on a daily basis until my last day.  The product came very quickly, and i am very pleased with it. it was a great price.   If you want a new computer with a good screen and good sound, I highly recommend this device!   My review:    I'm a computer enthusiast and I was looking for a replacement for my old laptop, but was looking to save money. I've been using the MacBook Air since 2008 and it's held up very well. I got the Dell Inspirons as I am getting a new PC and wanted something with more power than my Macbook Air. I also have the Dell XPS 13 that I purchased in August, but the battery on the XPS is really bad. So I was on a mission to get the best laptop out there. The Dell Inspiro laptop was one of the first to come out that had a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Sound Blaster Live! is an awesome sounding computer speaker and sound system for your PC. I love it and have been using it for years! The sound quality is great, and it is easy to set up. I have to say, that when I first got it, it would only play music. However, after a while, it began to play a couple songs and then it could play a complete cd. This has only been with the sound blaster live! for a few months, and I have been playing with the CD-ROM and the sound is good. I like to have the sound in the back of the speakers and the speakers can't be placed forward, so I have it in front of me. This is my second computer speaker system. I bought my first one years ago and it had a bad design, but I still use it. The sound is just as good, but with a better design. The price is a bit steep, but if you are looking for a good computer speaker, you have found one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ A couple of weeks ago I bought a digital audio recorder from the online store of the "Sony" company. The sound quality is excellent. The recorder is light enough to carry and easy to use. It is very good for the price. I am now looking for other sound recorders. It has been a great purchase and I will buy another one in the future.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: jpmusic
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was just looking to buy a computer for a new computer room at my job. I came across this, looked over the specs and specs were right on the money, but when I got to the bottom of the page I saw the cost was over $800. I was like "What the hell is this?" After reading about the power draw, I was more than a little skeptical. So I went back and read the specs. I'm pretty sure I'll never get around to buying one. I can only hope they make a better one soon.   by 10 posted onby C.M. (It's not a "gosh darn" question. It's a "whoa!" question.)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  The Apple IIe (with a keyboard) is a very good computer and you can still play the original games.   You'll never be the same after you get the Apple II, just ask anyone who had an Apple II.   of course you can also play the Apple's II version of SimCity, but don't expect the graphics or the game play to be anywhere near as good as the original. of course it's more expensive, but the only reason I can think of for buying the Apple is that the Apple looks the same.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  this device has all the features you need for a good remote control for your television, and a good feature set. The remote is very good and works well, and you can even get some additional functions that would be nice on a DVD player (if that's what you do), like DVD and DVD movie playback, and TV tuner. The only problem I have with this remote is that it is so easy to lose, but I would have bought a different remote if it was that easy to replace. I would buy this again and again. Write a negative review about an above average electronic device or a device that needs work:  I purchased this remote for my wife's television. It works pretty well. It is quite large (3" wide) but it's light weight. The problem is that the remote is not easy to use (i.e. you can't press the buttons very hard), and it's hard to find the different buttons. It's also a little difficult to remember which buttons do what. It also doesn't work with my tv. If you want to use your tv, you have to press the remote buttons and it turns on/off your tv. The volume control is not that good, and it doesn't have the volume buttons. Also, the remote has a built-in clock/date. If I was going to buy another one, I would go with a smaller remote. Review by David (age 40) I bought this remote to replace an older one that has a broken button on the remote control. The older remote had the button on its face, and the new one has a little "button" on its front. It took me about 30 minutes to learn how to use it. The button has a small "button-like" part in it that I had to turn slightly to click, and then push. It was annoying to have to learn the trick. After I learned it, I found the button to be a little hard to get used to, but it does what I need it to do. The screen is very clear. The TV is easy to operate. This is a good product and works as described. I also love that I can use this to change the channel without having to take it apart and then put it back together. I recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I have a good experience with this product, but the problem I had is that the charger is a little short. It does not fit in my iPhone 6, but I can charge the phone. The charger has a lot of battery and the cable is not easy to attach, but it works. This is the third time I order this item, but unfortunately, this one is the same problem.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from The BEST! I use this to charge my iPhone every night when I get home from work, so when it works, it works! I bought it as a last resort because the charger I bought had been replaced a few times, so I decided to try this one. It has worked flawlessly! I have two other chargers I purchased that worked well. I also have a small Samsung phone that I use a lot, so it's perfect!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had the unit for a little over a month now and I am absolutely loving it. It works well and is very easy to set up and use. It is very durable and easy to clean. I am very happy with my purchase. I can not recommend this product enough. It's well worth the price and a great product for anyone that is looking to get a good quality system. It fits well and doesn't feel like a toy.  Write a negative review about an unimpressive device:  This product is okay but I'm not a fan. The device itself looks and feels great, but the battery life is pathetic. It lasts about 2 hours. It seems like the battery would last a good amount longer but the unit is very flimsy. I'm still impressed with the device though as it is so easy to use. The price is okay. I would still rather have a good piece of gear than a $50 battery that lasts only 2 hours but it's not a bad price. I don't use it very often and it is pretty small. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the remote control works better than the device itself.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this unit a few times and it is a good unit with great performance. ive had it for about 3 years now and it never has failed me. its really easy to set up and set up easy to use. the buttons are easy to hit, it works with all my old and new radios,and it has a good sound quality. if you are looking for a good radio that has good sound, good sound and no bugs this is the radio for you.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bk from Great radio. Very reliable. Just what I was looking for. Very stable, great range and quality for the price. Great purchase.  a good all around radio, I use it with a Sennheiser and I love it. , it's a great radio, great audio quality, great radio. The sound quality of the Sangean S-70 is great. You can't go wrong with this radio. It is very well built and has good features such as:  1. It has a very large (20") front face. The front of the radio is huge, and the front face of the front panel is very nice and wide. The only thing I don't like about the front is the small hole that you have to push the button to make a call. The hole is not big enough to accommodate a large button, so if you want to make phone calls or listen to music you have have to pull out the small one.    2. The remote control. It's a small button with a lot of buttons. It seems like a lot, but when you are using it you won't even know you have the remote on the radio. I can't really say it's too difficult to use, but it would be nice if there was some sort of control over the volume or sound level.   3. It comes with a pair of headphones. I use these with my Yamaha RX-V677 (which has a mic, but not a mic socket). It's hard to explain, but the quality of these headphones is amazing. I've been using them with my radio for months now, and it's really a great addition to the radio (the only thing they lack is a remote).   4. The Sangeans are great for all outdoor use. I have my radio mounted on a rock and can hear the radio and my vesa when I am out on the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________________ The VV2 is a really good and easy to use device that does what it should do. It works great, is well built and does what is says it can do. I can use it in a variety of situations and it performs to its standards. It is easy to operate, easy to connect and connect up to four devices with a simple plug and play design. I also like the fact that it is a rechargeable device so I can easily keep it plugged in while I use it and charge it up on the go. If you are on a budget and want something for your electronics that can do everything you want to do, this is a great device for you!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from VV5-0.1 - VV1 with Bluetooth Low Energy support This device is a little pricey, but is very well built. This is a new addition to my collection, and works great with the new Apple devices that have Bluetooth LE support. My wife uses an iPhone 6 and has the "bluetooth" in the name. This VV-1 can be used with any Apple device that has Bluetooth LE. The battery life on this unit is about 5 hours on average.  Was this review helpful? Yes No  Posted By:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This product works great and is easy to use. I have a small baby, and I really like how you can see the amount of time you've spent on the clock, and also how well it tracks your baby's movements. I love the timer feature, I use it for my daughter's first day at preschool. It is so easy to set up and use. It also tracks your infant's weight and body temperature, which is great!  I really like this product: ------------- This is a great timer and a good value. I like that it shows you how long you have been using it as well as how much time is left on the timer. It's easy to follow how long it's been since the last time you used it.  Great timer: -------------- I really enjoyed my first day of preschool. The timer was easy to install, and the app is easy and intuitive to use for parents with infants.  The only complaint I have is that the timer doesn't work if you turn the screen on.  and for the price, it is a good product!  and the timer is very good.  that is the only thing i don't like is that it is very hard to get the timer to sync up with the app. The only thing I would say is that this product would be a great gift for someone who needs a reminder that the day is coming.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great simple, easy to read, timer that is perfect for the nursery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have an old Yamaha DX-7 with the same amplifier as the Korg PS-5. It is a wonderful piece of gear that plays the same way as a good analog rig and is very well built. It has a great sound that you can hear in all genres of music. I have a couple of the KORG PS-3s and I'm looking forward to trying out the new KOR G-s. I've heard good things about the G-2 and the GX-1, so hopefully they will turn out to be as good as the G1. I also like the KG3s because they have a headphone out and are a lot smaller than the PS-1 and PS-4, but I prefer the PS4s because of the better-sounding headphone out. If you like the DX-6 and you can't wait to get the KVR-1 to try out the K-2, you will be happy with the KW-3.  The K-5 is a great piece of kit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* It's the first time I purchased a high-quality portable CD player. I bought it for my home because I was bored and could not play CDs at home. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the unit. I also like the built-in CD player, which saves me the trouble of buying one. The sound is very good and the CD player is very powerful.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had this unit for about 2 months now, and I must say that I love the unit. I'm in school, and the unit has been a great help. I can read, write, and do math on my tablets with ease. I use it to listen to music, which is my favorite. I have had the same unit for several years, and this one is just as good. I was hesitant at first, but I am glad I decided to give it a try. I've already bought another one for my son's laptop, which will be his only computer. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for a couple weeks now. the sound quality is superb. I have had a couple of other devices and the sound is pretty much the same. I've had some really good speakers and this one just blows them out of the water. I had to buy a new speaker system because my speakers were getting so hot from the noise that they were about to die. I'm really happy with my purchase. The only thing is, the battery life is pretty short. I can get through about an hour of music and maybe another hour of video before the battery dies.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great unit to play a CD player, but it has a problem. When I play the CD, the unit will not change the volume on the CD player. I know it is an electronic device and the CD is very sensitive. I just think that it should be able to change the CD volume. I like it a lot, but I think it could be better.

Great for portability  Cons: Nothing  Review: I was hesitant about this portable speaker but I am so glad I took the plunge. The sound quality is great and I have been very pleased with it. The battery lasts a long time.  Weighing less than 10 pounds and about 2-1/2 feet long, it's perfect for getting the sound from the car into a small room or out to the patio. The controls are intuitive and the built-in microphone is a nice touch. The built-up noise cancelling capability is a huge plus. It is well-designed and made in America, which is my preference.  the only con I can think of is that it doesn't have an AC adapter. However, I don't have AC, so I don' t know if this would be an issue for me. I have a Sony Walkman and my iPod Air has one too. .  a great portable speaker for your music collection  By Anonymous from  Great Portable Speaker! .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ (This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have had a few of these things. One is working fine and the other one is having problems. The first one is a simple little device that allows you to charge a small device such as a cell phone. It's the same size as a battery and has a built in USB port. This device was inexpensive and works as expected. The second one is different in that it has a screen. The screen can be used to check the battery charge status. This screen is a little dim and I would like a brighter screen to be able to see the battery level. Other than that, the device works and works well. I haven't had to replace the battery since it was new.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from Works as advertised Works exactly as described. .  "The first time I used the unit I was able to charge my iPhone 4S to full and then quickly put it in the charger. I will definitely be ordering more of these in the future."  "The unit has worked very well so far, and I have not had any trouble with it, but I would love to have the ability to adjust the brightness. The dim screen is annoying at times. I have the brightness set to 10 and it is very difficult to see. I would be very happy to have this capability."  the product is very well made and I was pleasantly surprised. I was using it to charge two of my phone, and was able fully charge both my iPhone 6 and the one in the other case. I highly recommend this product. I got the blue one.  the battery life is very good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product. I have been using this for 2 months now and love the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny. I use it for my husband and son and love how it makes the hair shinier. It does take a few days to get it right, but the first day or two it works great and then it takes a few more days. I'm really glad I bought it. The texture is perfect for my thin, curly hair. The scent is really nice and it doesn't burn my face at all. I also love how easy it is to wash off. What a nice product. My hair looks great after a week of using this. I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants a product that does what it says. Great product I love this shampoo! It's not greasy and leaves my hair nice and soft. This is my first experience with an electronic hair dryer, and I'm very happy with it! It was very easy to use, and it is a nice price for the amount of product you get. I'm hoping to purchase more products from the store.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:............................................................This device is a nice addition to the lineup of music players on the market. It has a nice, clear sound that has been recorded with a nice clarity and volume control. It is also quite loud, and has a decent battery life. It also has a built-in digital to analog converter, so you can listen to music from CD to MP3 to play your CD's. It comes with a CD player which plays music nicely, but the volume control is very weak. Also, the CD player seems to play the music slightly out of tune, which is a bit disappointing. This player has a good variety of inputs, and the fact that it has a CD changer makes it very useful for those who want to listen to a CD. Overall, this is a very good player and I highly recommend it to those who need to listen and record music on the go.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A friend of mine has this device and it works great. It's very small and fits in my pocket or bag. I just love that it has a built in charger, and a few extra buttons for different functions.   I think the biggest drawback of this product is that it doesn't have a screen that shows you all the settings and how to change them. It doesn't come with a manual, or any instructions at all.  , and it can take a few tries to get it to work well.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works well. It works very well. I was a bit nervous at first because I'm not a big fan of battery powered devices but I'm glad that I bought this one. I like the size and design. I would definitely recommend it.  a bit pricey for a portable device but I guess I don't mind that much.  and if you're worried about it draining the battery it doesn.t. it's quite large to be used as a mobile charger and battery charger. it has plenty of power to charge a laptop, ipod, and phone battery very quickly.

(by Bill from California)  Review: I have been looking for an affordable and easy to use tablet for over a year now. I've bought a number of devices (Nook, iPad, Kindle, Galaxy Tab) and all have been either too large or too heavy for my tastes. I recently decided to buy the iBooks app and it worked perfectly!   The device was easy to set up and it has a nice soft back, a good size screen, and the touch pad is perfect.   My only issue is the battery life (although I use it on a regular basis). I have an iPhone and it lasts a lot longer. I think it is a combination of the battery (small), the size of the device, and my usage pattern.   I do a lot reading and watching movies on it, which eats up the battery quickly. It seems to be working just fine for now but I'll update if anything changes.  , January 21, 2013
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The XM-L2 is an excellent little device. The microphone is really good, and the XM radio does not have a problem picking up the AM stations. The only thing that I don't like about the radio is that it doesn't have a CD changer, which is a bit of a shame because I like to listen to my music on CD. Also, I would prefer a bit more memory on the radio so I can save a lot of songs.  Write a negative review about an unsatisfactory electronic device :  I have had the X-M-2000 since 2002. It is a great radio. The sound is good, but the battery life is really bad. The XM loses a lot power, and sometimes the radio will turn off, even after the battery has been recharged. I really don't understand how a device like this could lose so much power. It's like a microwave. I had a similar problem with the X100. I have been looking for an electronic device for years that can pick up AM, FM and SSB radio signals. The RCA-HDMI jack on the X200 does this very well. It works very well with my laptop, and I have no problems getting the X101 on and off my PC. I'm sure the sound is excellent with my X101 and my computer. I just wish that the battery had better capacity. The battery will run down after a week or so of listening.

I don't have to wait until my wife is ready to try to get her back on her feet. I just put the device in her and she can't wait to get going.    A+ product!   Excellent product at a reasonable price, easy to use and very easy to read the directions and it was very easy for me to use too.  I've been using it for over a month and can't say enough about it!   for me   Easy to use.  Very good at tracking my daily dosage.  My wife has had problems with her knee for many years and is still in pain. She has been using the iCandy for about a month now and can not wait to see how her knee is.  It is very easy and convenient.  Thank you   for this great product.   and good for her   It's a great product and a great price for a daily use product that we are both happy with.  I bought it because it's cheaper   We are using this to treat her back and knee pain. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We have tried a lot of things, but nothing works for her. This has been her "go to" product for a few weeks now and it's saving her so much pain. We are very pleased with it!  iCandy   This device has been great for my daughter. She doesn't like using any other product to treat pain, so she has tried everything else. She tried the old style "TENS" but it wasn't good enough for her, so now she uses this iCANDY. We don't use the iCANDAILY for her pain at all. She can use it for up to 4 times a day.  and I use it myself   Thank u iCannony for your product. I have been using this product since July 2015 and it is so great. I use this for my back pain and knee discomfort, it is very gentle and works great. Thanks  Awesome   My daughter is 18 and she has been suffering from chronic hip pain for over 4 years now. I used to use Vicodin and had a bad reaction with the pain. After reading about this device I decided to try it. It
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************** I got this as a gift for my mother-in-law as a birthday present. She was amazed how good it sounded. It has been used several times now, so far without problems. We have both been happy with it. *******************************  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great sound, great price! I bought the soundbars as a present for my wife and son, both 10 years old. The sound is perfect for listening to music on the couch at home. The surround is great and the volume is perfect. My only suggestion is to add a subwoofer so that the sound comes from the speakers, not the TV. We like the sound better that way. If you don't mind a little more space to listen, this is a great choice.  Good, but a little pricey for a small screen I bought this as my first TV and am very pleased with it, except for the price, which is a little expensive for a TV of this size and type. If the soundbar were a little bigger and cheaper I would give it a 5 star rating. It sounds great for watching TV on the big screen. I would definitely recommend it.  is a good product. I'm a fan of the sound.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very pleased with the quality of this device. I love the fact that it's easy to use. I used it to listen to music in the car. It worked flawlessly. I have only used it a couple of times but it is already a great purchase! Rating: Quality: Price: Performance: Ease of Use: Features: Overall Was this review helpful? Yes No I've been a fan of the old-school, cheap, portable music player, the Minitel, for years, but I couldn't justify the $30-ish price tag anymore when I saw the Minidisc. I like it better. The main advantage is the portability: It fits in my car (a Honda Fit), and the price is right. I can fit my old Minitels in my trunk, and it's still a very compact device. Also, the fact the battery is removable, so I can replace the battery in case the phone battery dies, is great. The only downside I can see is that it doesn't play CDs or MP3s. It doesn't seem to support any music format at all. The other downside is that the buttons are not very large. They're not quite small enough to press comfortably. I'd recommend the Mini. I think it's great for anyone who wants to listen a little music, but doesn't want to spend the money for a better, more portable player.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the iBook and my iphone but I'm not a fan of the touch screen, the screen is so tiny it's not the best.   And the iphones have the ability to change the background, which is pretty cool.  But the ipod is perfect, it's light, easy to hold and easy to read.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned two of these and have had no problems. i've been using one for several years now. i like the size of the unit, and the buttons and power buttons are very easy to find. it is very easy for the operator to adjust the volume, and to play/pause. i bought this for a home theater, and i was very impressed. i use this for both watching tv, and playing games. the only problem i have with this unit is that there is only a little bit of power to power the speakers, but that is very easily fixed with an external power supply.

Â The app is really easy to use, and I really love the fact that it works offline.    This is the first time I've used the iDevice for this long, and it's really made me appreciate the other products I've been purchasing on Apple's site, and am even considering purchasing an iPad for my office as well.  It's really a good value for the money. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I got this device a week or so ago and I am so happy with it. I am in my 20's and my wife is in her 50's and she is not able to do anything without her cell phone. We have had our cell phones for years and they are very heavy and we have to buy them all the time. I think this is one of the first devices that will be able to hold the phone up while we read. I just wish I had known about it earlier.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Chris from Great for traveling or traveling with. This is a great device for taking notes and reading. The only drawback is that the pen is a bit awkward to hold. I recommend that you buy a case or a case with a built-in stand.  (Posted on 5/22/2016)  Great Note Taking App I use it for writing, and it's great for a travel companion. It's lightweight, easy to hold and use, and great for traveling.  I highly recommend this product  (Posted on 1/19/2016 )
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for 2 months now and its great! very stable, doesnt get hot, very easy to use. if you have a pc or laptop with a usb port its a good way to get your pc or mac up and running with an android device. if your computer can run the bios then this will do the trick.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!This product is awesome, i love it. it's perfect.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Sbob from Perfect replacement for a small handheld device! Bought the E-Z-Grip to replace a small tablet that I use for writing. The grip is great, the buttons are responsive, and the keyboard is good for a touch screen. It's a lot easier to type on than my old tablet, and I do all my writing on this device now. It also fits perfectly on the side of my desk. I'd definitely recommend it. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:....................................................  The unit is well built and the sound quality is good. The unit is easy to use and works well. I am using this in my new car stereo. The one thing I would have liked is a way to program the radio so I could set the stations to be in my favorite bands and not have to get up and get a new radio. But, all in all, I am satisfied with this unit and am very happy with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.......................................... Very useful tool to solve the problem of long battery life. It's a very useful tool, and a very good price. My battery died after 2 days of usage, and I tried all the suggestions you've made. The problem was with the charger, the battery is just a few months old, and the charger seems to have a short life. I would not recommend to anyone, unless you're willing to deal with the short life of the charger.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm so glad i found this. I'm a huge fan of music and this is the perfect solution for me. The quality of sound is great. I have a sub woofer, so I bought a set of these to get the best possible sound.   The only thing I dislike about this is that it has a little light on the front. But that's pretty minor.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have only just had this as my main device.  It works well and is very easy to use.    When I use the wireless connection it connects very quickly.  The keyboard is very large and very comfortable to type on.  The size makes it easy to hold and the keys are very well spaced.  Also, when I first plugged it in the bluetooth function was not available.  This is not a problem any more.  I am still learning about the wireless functions.  Overall this is a very good purchase. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got the S7 edge and I must say I am extremely happy with my purchase. The only bad thing about it is that it's hard to find a good deal, but that is not an issue for me. I would definitely recommend this phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********  This was my first wireless keyboard. I'm using it with a laptop and the keyboard was nice, I was a bit disappointed with the fact that it did not work on the keyboard dock I purchased. I have a MacBook and the adapter is not compatible with it. I thought I had to get a new one. I used the adapter and now the computer is a little bit hot, but that's probably just me. I also have to say that I'm a little disappointed with Apple. The quality of the keyboard is better than most, but the only reason to buy it is to have a good wireless keyboard for the Apple laptops.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this device for my son, he's had a hard time using a computer for a few years. He had been having problems with getting it to work on a low end laptop (that he had previously been able to use, but couldn't use it because of a broken screen). After reading the reviews, I decided to buy this device and use it to replace his old one. The unit is well built, fits in the palm of my hand, and is easy to use. The device is a bit noisy, but the sound comes from the computer (no speaker). The unit comes with a USB cable to plug into the computer. I am currently using it with Windows 7, but I'm thinking about trying it with Vista. My son is quite impressed with the unit, it's very easy to setup and use. He's had no issues so far. I recommend this unit to anyone that is looking for a good computer replacement. Read all reviews

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use the Sanken T-Touch 2  for my job at the local library, and have been very happy with it. The touch screen is very responsive, and the pen works very well with the stylus. The built in stylus is a bit small, so I prefer to use a stylus that comes with the pen, and that fits the pen. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good pen and a good touch screen, for those who want a pen and can't find a good one, or for anyone who wants a pen, but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikitok - I really like my iPod touch. It's a nice device with great functionality, and the quality is great. The sound quality is better than expected for a cheap device. It has enough memory to keep my entire music library. I have been buying my music from iTunes but the iPod is just more convenient. I'm sure there are other features that are less desirable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for an alternative to the wireless earbuds that came with my phone and I was looking to hear music through a phone without wires. I have been using the Apple Earpods and they are ok. However, I was thinking that a Bluetooth headset with sound quality similar to a wireless headphone would be good. I had been looking for a bluetooth headset for a long time and I finally found one on the web. I received my new Bluetooth headset on a Wednesday and it arrived in my mail on Friday. I tried it out and it works perfectly. It's very convenient to have this kind of headset with me. I really recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to music without using their phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikon's e5 is one of the best tablets I have ever used. It has a lot of features and is great to play games on. If you want a tablet to play your games on it's not bad. However, if you want something that can replace a laptop this is it. The battery lasts for days. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is the camera. I have had mine for over a year and the camera is terrible. It is not the best and can't handle some of the games that are on there.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.........................................................I was so excited to receive my Apple watch. It has a built in GPS and an alarm and is very easy to use. I really like that I can customize it to have my phone on my wrist at all times. It also has a great speaker that makes a great noise to wake me up in the morning. My only complaint is that I have to buy a separate case to put the watch in. I also wish there was a way to use it with my phone. Other than that I really do like my watch. I will recommend it to everyone I know.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** The E-Liquids for Dummies app for iOS/Android is a great help for a novice to get started with electronic cigarettes. The app will walk you through how to setup and use the devices. It will give you tips and tricks on the devices and it is a good introduction for someone who is just learning about electronic cigarettes or just looking for more information on the product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is a very powerful and useful tool for learning about programming. I am a beginner and have only recently been able to write a simple program. The manual is very clear, and the program is easy to learn. I also have used it to test my skills. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to learn programming, but is just starting out.  Write a negative review about an unsatisfactory electronic device : ------------ I purchased this to use as an extension for my home made programming board. The interface was easy to use and it worked as advertised. The only thing I would like to see is a larger display so I can see more code lines. The programmer does not work with the Raspberry Pi Zero W. I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and this worked for the first week, but has not worked since. I tried all the different connections and this one didn't work at all. I think I've given up on this. I've tried a lot of different solutions for programming and this is the worst. -Mike  -Mandy  "You can find a lot in this manual!" I was looking for a good introduction to the world of programming, and this manual does it perfectly. The author is clear, concise, and clearly explains the theory behind programming, without being overly complicated. It's great to have a single reference to go to, and I can just keep referring to it as I go. I found it very helpful to see how the instructions are written. For example, if you are programming a simple text program, I find it helpful to know how to read the text in the program to figure out how to modify the text. The other thing that is helpful is to know what the 'operators' are. For instance, when you program a computer, you will usually write something like this: PROGRAM [A] { RUN A } If you don't know what'RUN'means, just google it! If you are not familiar with computer programming, it may be helpful to get a book or course on it. There are a few books out there on the subject, but the author does a great job explaining it. I highly recommend this book. I have a lot to learn in the future. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little device. I bought it to get my hands on a few books that I didn't have time to read and that had been out of print for a long time.  I also needed to get some books that were out of stock for quite some time. I love the fact that it works with my tablet and my Kindle and I'm going to keep buying it. I love this app and the book that I bought, the story by Stephen King, is one of the best in my bookshelf.  The only thing that is a bit annoying about the app is that when you download the book it asks if you want to download all the chapters, which is annoying, but it is a small thing to complain about. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I bought this device to get my music out of the house. I have a small house but this thing is so big it's a pain to lug around. I got it because it was a good deal. But I think it's only good for medium sized rooms. I was expecting a better quality product but this one was only ok. If you want a lot of volume and volume control, this is the one to get. It's worth the money if you want to take it to the next level but I wouldn't get it if you're looking for a lot.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ***************************** I have been very happy with this device for many years. I have owned several of them. I used to be a music producer and had the pleasure of hearing the greats. I was using my Sony D5 and now I use the Tascam DR-50. The Tascams are more expensive, but in my opinion they are more of a professional piece of gear. The sound quality is great. The buttons and knobs are easy to use. The software is easy to follow and there is a nice interface. There are a couple of minor annoyances, but nothing a little patience can't cure.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** I have been using this thing for the past 6 months. I'm in the process of upgrading from an old desktop to a new computer. I had some time to kill, so I bought this thing and it did the job just fine. The only thing I don't like about it is that the USB connection has to be used to plug it in. It's kind of like having to go to the ATM to get cash. That being said, I highly recommend it.  My first electronic device This is my first electronic item, so there are many things I do not know about it, but so far, so good. I can use it as an audio speaker (I use an old laptop speakers), a USB device to connect to my computer (as an external hard drive), and an iPod player to plug into the device to play my iPod.  a very good purchase I bought my first iPod a few years ago, but I never could find a good way to plug my iPod in, and I had the older model. Then, I saw this one, and bought it. I use my iPod and it works perfectly. I highly reccomend this product.  is very handy I am in the middle of a project to upgrade my home office and needed a USB cable for it. After a lot of searching and some research, I purchased this one. The cable has come in handy for other things I have. The price was great and the shipping was very fast.  in love with it!!! I bought the 2.0 version of this product and I am very pleased. I've been using it as a sound system for my music and movies. I have a pair of bluetooth headphones, and the sound quality is very good. The sound is not too loud, not too soft, and it is very clear. I am using it on my PC with an older ATI video card. I don' t need a lot, but it is a good enough sound system to keep my movies and music coming. The battery life is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **************************** This is my second Apple iMac. This time I upgraded from a low end iMac to a high end i5. The quality of this machine is awesome. It's fast and powerful, and has an extremely good sound system. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it's a bit noisy. Also it is a little loud for a home office setup. I had it installed and it has been running 24 hours a day since. The screen is very bright and the touchpad is very responsive. I have only used this for work and it is still very capable for that. The price was very reasonable, and it comes with everything you need. *************************

[ 2017-08-14 23:26:56 ]  s4tqjh   http://www.mygreensandsolar.com/p/paul-rhodes-waterproof-jordan-10-review.html   Bought this jacket because the other one I have is my favorite. The fit is perfect and it does a good job keeping you cool. The only downside is the material is so thin that you get chaffing very easily. I've tried wearing it for a few hours and still get it chaffed. It's a little hard to get on and off in a hurry. Otherwise, great purchase!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I just wanted to say I have just used my new "Nordic" eurorack module in a couple of projects. It is the perfect fit in my modular and is a great sound generator! I was looking for a module that would fit my setup perfectly and I'm glad I found this one! It's very easy to get going, just plug it in and run the first channel and you're set. The sound of the module is very realistic and the volume control is great for those quiet gigs! I've heard other reviews about not being able to run multiple channels out of the same module, I have been able to do that with this module, but it's really only for a couple channels at a time. For a full blown modular I would recommend something more like a "Hollywood" module. It's definitely not for everyone, but for those of us who like the sound of modular and don't want to get into a "camelot" type of setup, this module will get the job done.  Nice, but could be better: ********************** I have had a Nordost 100W with a couple other modules, and the Nordost was a very nice sounding module that was easy to use and very versatile. The Nordost 110W is even better. The tone of the 110W module is amazing. I have tried several other modules and this one is my favorite. However, the sound is very different than the previous versions. This is my second time buying this module and I hope that it will not get too expensive.  of the "Nords" for the money, I think the Nordotron is the best. However...I did not expect a "NORDOST" module to be the best sounding one...the previous versions sounded more like vintage gear (i.e. EHX, Marshall, etc). I have to say that this one sounds very good. It sounds very analog. The quality is great, and I am very pleased with the sound. However....I did expect a module to have the most features, but the Nordos are only rated for a max of 2 channels (i think the max is 4 channels on the original) and I think that is not enough for the amount of use that I have done with them. I've used them in my "Lunatec" (which is a pedalboard that allows you to control different effects via pedals, not just via the "
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works very well, especially considering that the price is so low. The sound is clear and crisp and the picture is clear.  I had my daughter use it to show me the difference between the digital and analog signals on my television.  I'm happy with my purchase.  I've had other similar devices before, but this one is the best!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________ A must have for a good audiophile. The unit sounds fantastic and is easy to use. I use it with a Sennheiser HD650 and an Ibanez TS990. The sound is better than my old Senns. I am now listening to the T-90 and I really like the sound, I have not been able to get the old S/HP to sound like this unit. I can't believe it took me so long to get it.

It is very fast but not as smooth as the wireless version of the Logitech. i am using the wireless model as i can get it at a better price and i think that Logitech should offer the wireless for more models. the wireless keyboard is very good, good quality, and i dont have any complaints about the keyboard.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this monitor for a month or two now. It has been very good, not great but very good. I do have one issue though, the brightness. The monitor has a very bright light which shines directly into my eyes, so I have to put my glasses on before I use it. This is the first time I have ever used an electronic device, I have always been a paper/pen and pencil kind of person.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought these about 3 years ago and i can honestly say they are the best battery chargers ive used. the size of the charger is perfect for the amount of juice you can fit in it. I bought 2 of these so i could run two batteries at the same time for my phone. The batteries have lasted me about a year and a half now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great sound and feel. Good battery life. Easy to use.  The only thing I didn't like was the charging system.  I've used the unit since the early days of my addiction to the "digital" world.    When I first received my Unit, I was impressed with the way the unit felt.  The unit was heavy enough to feel sturdy.  I was a little disappointed with the charging time.  It took about 15 minutes to charge a full battery.  When the unit was completely charged, I realized that the battery is not that big of a deal.  So the next time I buy this device, I'll probably get a larger battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a good device, I can say this. I have been using a K-50 since about January, 2015.  Good price and service:    A great deal at the moment. Great product. Good price. The delivery time was fast and the delivery method was efficient. ,, the K-70 is a good alternative for people who need an easy and cheap way to control a digital camera and have a mic. P.S. I was expecting a bit more from a K70 when I bought it. I don't have to be in a dark room to have my camera on. The sound is not that great, but I'm not sure why I bought this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this for over a year. I have the black version, and I just upgraded from the red. I can't say enough good things about the design and build quality. The size of the device is perfect. It is small enough that you can easily conceal it on your keychain, and it's just as convenient to use as a pen or a pencil. The battery life is long enough that I don't have to worry about the battery dying during a long day. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a USB port. But it's more than made up for by the great value I get out of it. I would recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********   The only reason i give this device 4 stars is because the buttons on the device are not as sturdy as some other products i've bought. The buttons were easy to press once but after that, they just fall off. Also, i'm not sure if the device will even come with a usb cord since i don't think it will. But that's a small complaint. I'm really glad i finally got this. I got the 10" version which is a lot smaller than some other small gaming laptops. I've got an Asus Z370 Taichi and the Taichi is a bit smaller than this but still feels pretty good. Also the device is light and thin, so its not too heavy to carry around with you when gaming or watching videos. The only thing i'm worried about is that the screen is not very bright but it still gets the job done. I'd recommend getting the 15" version because it's a lot bigger and more comfortable to use but if you want a compact laptop, this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this device for a year and a half and the performance is as good as it can be for the price. I can't believe how much more I can do with this device. The display is so crisp and clear and it is easy to use with a touchpad or a mouse and it has a good battery life (I've been using this all day, 7 days a week). I also like the fact that it's so quiet, and it does not have the usual buzzing sound from my older computer. The software is very simple and simple to use, it's a must have for any computer user.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is nice to have such a nice small electronic device. It has no problems at all. The main problem with this product is the battery life. It lasts for only about 4 hours and I have to recharge it every day. If it was 10 hours then that would be a big plus but I think it's not enough for me. It also needs a special charger and I'm not sure if it works with other chargers. Other than that it's a great product. Write a negative review about the same electronic device  :    I was really happy with the first Samsung tablet that I bought, but after a few months I realized that it had become too heavy to hold in one hand and too slow to work with. I bought this model because it was cheaper, but it's the exact same as the Samsung tablet except for a few minor things. It is also a little hard to hold, especially if you want to use it in a vertical orientation. I have also noticed that the power cord on the back of the device is not really long enough to reach the back. It's more like a mini-USB cable, and the bottom of the tablet is a bit narrow and a bit hard to use with a flat surface. I'm also not sure how long the battery will last because I've had to replace it several times.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great tool to use for those who have trouble getting a good signal on their TV or stereo. I am very pleased with this product and the support from the vendor is outstanding. I just ordered a second one for my son. I have had some issues with it. The first one I bought stopped working within a few days of purchase. The second one I purchased from the same vendor worked fine for several months. I thought it was just the one, but a few weeks later the second one stopped working. I contacted them and they sent me a new one within a week. They are still waiting on the second replacement unit. I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve the signal quality on their system.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Bob from I like this product I like the product. It allows me to control my home theater with my cell phone, it is very flexible. I like how you can change channels to match your mood or how the lights will look like. I also like the fact that you can have it on all the time. It is also great to have in a closet, you can just plug it in and not worry about power. I haven't had a problem with it yet. I do have a complaint though. When you connect it to a TV, it will not let you do the picture adjustment on the TV. You have to plug it into a power source to do it. I guess it's a feature or something. Other than that I am happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone. . What's Included: This is what you get when you buy the AV1-1U. 1 - 1U TV Power Amplifier, 2 - 3.5mm to 3.7mm RCA Connectors, 2 x 2.5MM Headphone/RCA Audio Jacks, 1 x HDMI Cable, 1x Ethernet Cable, AC Power Cable (1 Year Limited Warranty), User Manual.

The new laptop is great and very quiet, but this computer is a keeper! I love that you can turn the computer on and off. It's very easy to operate and has everything you need to use the computer. The only thing is, it is a little hard to use for gaming, but it does the job.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! This thing works like a charm. I use it for both the computer and the music player. The unit is extremely portable. It is easy to plug in and even easier to get out of your bag or pocket. I am extremely happy with this purchase. It can handle a lot of my music files without making me feel like I am using a stereo. I love the fact that I can listen to my music on my computer and my portable player at the same time.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best Portable Audio Player Ever This is the best portable audio player I've ever used. It's small, lightweight, and perfect for my job, which involves working on computers. It has enough audio output to keep me entertained on my long flights. I can even play my portable MP3 player in the front passenger seat, and play music from my portable iPod on the plane. I've been using this product for over a year and it is still going strong! I highly recommend this product.  the only problem I had was the unit was faulty but my company replaced it. I love my new unit.

This one does the job.   I like that you can choose which keys are to be pressed by the user. Also, the keys can be pressed in any order and are numbered (I think). This is a very useful feature.   I have also used it to type on a paper manual and it was pretty good.

I love the idea of being able to make things like clothing and jewelry.  If you need some filament, you can get it from Amazon for about $7. I have a friend who's a carpenter, and she's been using her printer to make wooden toys for my daughter's little dolls, which is pretty cute.  It's a fun thing to play with.

I have always been a huge fan of Apple products but the iphones have never worked as well as i hoped they would. The iphon6plus is the best ipho i have ever used. I get up to 4 hours of use and my battery is always full. The only down fall is the ikea adapters for the battery that came with the phone are the worst thing ever. They come apart in less than 5 minutes. I ended up getting the adapter from amazon that are just as good and the price is better too. Overall the ia6plus iphonelike is a great iphophone. If you're looking for a iphophone that's great in my opinion then this is the one to get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************  I bought this because my wife is very picky about the sound quality of our electronic devices. She likes to hear "slight" noises on our digital media and the sound is very good. She also loves the built in speakers. We use the iPad and the iPhone. I use the iPhone with the speakers on and it sounds very good and the iPod Touch has a very nice sound. I was a little concerned when I first received the unit because it was the cheapest I have ever seen. I have owned a few of these units over the years but this is the best so far. It is very easy to use and has a lot of volume. I like that it is portable and that it can be powered from a wall outlet. It took me a few days to get used to the buttons on the remote. I love the remote because it has a few buttons that are on the sides so I can hit a few things at once. I did not have to use a keyboard to control the volume and the speaker is very clear. I also use the iPod touch to watch movies and it is perfect. I would recommend this unit to anyone. I hope it lasts a long time!  Rated 5 out of 5 by ken from great value Bought this about 2 weeks ago. Very nice unit. I've only used it for a couple hours so far but so far it works great. I'm still adjusting to the controls on the side. The unit is very portable so I guess it'll take some getting used to. I only wish there were more controls on this unit. It doesn't look like it will be able to play songs from my iPhone. It does have an app for that though so I'll try that.  From: USA, Florida Date: August 01, 2016 I bought this for my husband and I both use it. It came with two remote controls and I'm getting used.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ Excellent and powerful device. It's just what I needed for my laptop. I use it with my iphone and it is very good to control the volume and the sound with the volume knob. I have also had it to work with my tablet as well as my laptop so it is quite powerful. I've only used it for a few hours so I can't comment on the longevity yet but I can tell you that I'm very impressed with the device and would recommend this product to anyone. Pros: ------------- - Great sound quality - Good battery life - Good size Cons: -------------- - Can be a little slow to respond when a call comes in but I think that's just how it is. - Can't control the sound from my ipod and I would have liked a usb cable. Overall: --------------- This is a very good sounding device. The only drawback is the fact that it doesn't have the volume control you have on a good stereo system. The sound quality is pretty good though and the battery life is good. It is really easy to use, and I have no problems with it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent sounding wireless speaker.

Yes No Wednesday, May 13, 2014  Great Value  by: Sean from Lake Worth FL USA  Pros: Light weight, compact, fits perfectly in my pocket.  and has good sound. 's sound quality is very good, but it's battery life is terrible. It's only lasted about a month of regular usage before the battery died. It will be a while before I replace this with a new one.  (from the other review) I use my ipod 3s all the time and it is a very good portable device. The battery life has a lot to do with it. I have had it for about a year and the battery is dying very quickly. I bought this battery to use as a back-up for my ipad 4 and it's a good purchase. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the battery life seems a little too short. I would suggest getting a new battery as soon as possible. (from another review) The battery lasts for ages, but the noise that you hear is pretty high. The design of the speaker does not give you a clear sound. (From another review for a different iPod model) I purchased this item after finding that I was out of battery for my other iPod. The iPod had a very low battery life so I purchased the iPod 6. It lasted less than a month and now the battery dies very quickly! I bought the iPod 4 but I would not recommend this model for the size of the battery. ( from another review of an iPod 5 model) It's a great little gadget, and it has great sound. I've used it for several months, but I think it's time to get a new model. The new iPod 5 is much more powerful and I would say that the sound quality has improved quite a bit. (I would also like to see this reviewed with the new iPod 3 and 4.

There are two issues with the board though. The first issue is that the breakout board requires a power supply and a reset button for the chip. That makes the mx a little difficult to use when using it with a bread box. The second issue is the mcu and chip require 2.5mm wires. If you do not have a wire stripper on hand I recommend getting a piece of wire and cutting it to size and using that. The chip works well but I would recommend a wire. .  a.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great sound, good value for the money.  A few things about this that I don't like, like the fact that it doesn't have a headphone jack (not that I can use one, as it's hardwired) or that it's got a very loud pre-amp (so loud that you can't hear your own voice when using it). Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I really like this one. I use it to play a lot of video games and movies and it works well. I really like the controller too. The gamepad buttons are really small but are easy to find and the joystick is very responsive. I recommend this one to all my friends and family. Read a negative review:    I bought this about 2 years ago and i've had it for a couple of years.   When i first received it, i was worried that it would not work.  But now,   it works perfectly.  i really like that the gamepad is very small.  and the joysticks are nice and responsive.  the only problem is that the buttons on the game pad are really big and hard to find.  but all in all,  i like this gamepad very much.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the Sony HM-2000 in December and have been very happy with it so far. I use my mp3 player, my ipod and my computer all at the same time. The best part is that it's all controllable by a simple remote. The sound quality is very good for a budget device. I would buy this again. I hope that the quality keeps getting better. Rated 4 out of 5 by Maddy from Good value for money I have been using the mp3player for about a year and love it, it is great for playing music and the quality of the sound is great. It is very easy to control with a remote control. It does get a little warm but the remote control helps a lot. The battery life is only 2 hours which is not very good but you can buy a battery and use it for a while if you have to. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I have had a problem with the sound coming out at times when I use the usb input and it has a lot of interference with the audio being from the computer. I have tried all the settings but it still has the same problem.  Rated 5 out of and 5 by Darlene from Excellent purchase. I bought this a few months ago and am very happy. I love the music playing and the sound quality.  (I received this as a gift and have not yet used it)  Good product, not a bad price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- -------------------------- --------------------------- I bought this amp for the purpose of powering my laptop and using the USB for music playback and video streaming. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for both of these things. I used to have an amp that sounded like it was in the same league as this but this is better. My favorite thing about this amp is how simple and well made it is. I love that it's made of plastic which I prefer to metal. The controls on the back are easy to operate and the volume knob is well positioned. The input for the USB is also a little more than I expected but I haven't had any problems with it yet. Overall this is a great product and I'm glad I found it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This device works great for my needs, I have been a heavy user of a laptop for years and I'm happy I found this device. It is easy to use and very quiet. I've already recommended it to my wife and a friend and I am going to buy another one for my daughter. Thank you for such a great product.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 08, 2014  Good little device.  in my opinion it is better than a laptop.  of course, it is a lot slower than a real laptop. I would like it if there was a way to put a mouse on it so you could use it with a normal keyboard and mouse.  to me the best part of it is the price. , but there are some drawbacks. The battery life is very limited. I am using mine on an airplane (6 hrs a day). I get 4-5 hours with a 50% charge. I can easily get a few more hours if I had to, but that would not make me want to buy a second one. the one thing I really dislike is the built in microphone. When the microphone is turned on, the sound comes out as if it is from a very low powered desktop. .    The best thing about this is that you can get a second battery on it for free.  is a great portable unit that is very portable. I do wish there were more built in features and options, but all in all it is perfect for what it is. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great device for the price. I have the T-Mobile ONE Plus and the HTC Evo 4G. The T-mobile ONE is just a little better in quality, but this one is just as good. I like that it is wireless, but that the screen is very small. The Evo is great for the size. I can hold it with one hand and use my tablet as a regular phone with one handed use. Great device!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this since last summer and im in love with it. i had been using my old mp3 player for years. i thought i was done with the mp3. i used to go through my whole collection of mp3's every month or so. when my mp3 broke, i tried to find a new one, but after searching, i found this one. i love it. its small, simple, and does everything that the mp player does, and then some. it does have a slight delay when you play it, but this is a minor gripe. and the sound quality is good. you cant beat this device for it's size. i dont play a lot of music on it, i mainly listen to audio books. but i have it hooked up to my mp player and the mp play back is perfect. this is the perfect device to take on the go. i can go to work, school, work out at the gym, etc. and not worry about if my mp device is gonna die. i only wish the usb was a little longer. i use my usb to charge my mp and this one only charges the mp once. other than that, its perfect.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was a nice toy to play with and it had a good sound, so I can't complain too much. The sound is pretty good but it's not too loud. It is good for the price. I will probably buy a second one and add it to my collection of electronic devices.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I am a novice on electronic devices, but this device worked well for me. It was easy to use and had a very good sound quality. It is not too big and does not take up too much room in your backpack. The only drawback is that the sound quality drops off after a while. I like the fact that it can be powered off, but I wish it had a power cord. Other than that, I'm happy with this purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the mx8 for about a year now and i can say its a great device, ive been able to get high quality sound out of it and the bass is really good. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is the size, its a bit bigger then my mx5 which i have had for a while and its a bit harder to carry around.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【BEST EASY TO USE 】This is the best way to use my iPad. It has so many functions, and I am a real novice in using them. I am an instructor at the University of Michigan and I used to teach college level course on digital technologies. I have used the iphone iphones for a year and have used this iphonelite iphONE iphonet. The iphonet is a great little device that can be used in many situations. I was able to connect to my computer, watch the video on my iphonenet and then I could take a class. 【EASY TO USER 】I was amazed by how easy the iplex iphonerie iphono is to use. It takes up so little space on my desk that I am so happy to have it. I really like the way that the ilevel iphontape iphonic sound can be heard from my ilever iphonestep iphoning iphotape.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________ The device works well for the money. I have a Macbook pro and I have been using it since it was released. It is the only computer I own. This is my second purchase from RAVEN, I ordered two of the same model. They have always been well made and very reliable. I use mine to connect my laptop to my desktop and play music on my desktop. I was hesitant to pay $500 for a computer that is only supposed to play music, but I was willing to pay it. The only downside is that it is very heavy, but the quality of the case is very high.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first device I've used that I liked, even if it had some issues. The screen is good enough for gaming and it has enough RAM for a decent gaming PC. The battery is a bit weak, so it's not good for playing for more than a few hours at a time. The only thing that I dislike is that the cable is so long that you have to use a rubber band to keep it in place, which is very annoying. Overall, I think this is a good device for someone looking for a new gaming computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this for my husband to use in his new home. He's never had any problems with his old computer. He does use it for reading the newspaper and a little e-mail, but he doesn't have a lot of time to do it. He likes the size, the buttons and the way it feels to hold it. It does what it's supposed to do, which is to give him a portable computer. The only con is that he's going to have to buy a new hard drive. The original one was defective. But the warranty is good for another year or so.  Review of DJ0229-00 Submitted By: JB - Verified Buyer I bought one of these when I first got my HP. It was a good product. I had some trouble with the power supply. I replaced the power unit and had the same problem. I think the power circuit board is defective. It has a couple of loose wires in it. The power unit came back with an additional power cord, a new power supply, and a new screen that was defective, the first screen was black with no screen. The second screen was white with a picture of the sun. It is a good unit. I got the one without the hard drive but it is fine. I'm glad I bought it. :)  Thank You  Reviewer: M.F. - Verifying Buyer Great product for a very good price. . ,  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jimbo from I needed a portable device for my work and my personal needs. I was very happy with my purchase. It performs well and has a very high performance. I would recommend it to others who need a portable but still have enough memory to get the job done.  was a little reluctant to purchase it when I saw the price but after reading a few reviews I decided to purchase this for a great price. I also purchased the HP 32-in-1 CD/DVD burner. The drive is a little noisy, but overall the device works well and is easy to use. I highly recommend this product.  in the last year, I have bought a few of these and the one with the defective power supply I found to be a very excellent replacement. I have used it several times and the drive is working fine.  it is easy and fast to set up. I like the fact that it can connect to a PC over a USB
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________ I just bought my first electronic device, an Apple iMac with a Retina display. I got it on Friday and it arrived on Sunday. This is the first time i've been able to use my iMac and iMac Book Air at the same time. I have no problems with either device, so far. My only issue is the size. I prefer the size of the iMac but the iBook is a tad bigger. This isn't a problem for me since i'll probably get the 15" Retina one anyway.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- A great little device that does what it is suppose to do. Very good quality.  Excellent value and quality!  The new VST is so much better than the old one.  and the best of all, the VST does not have to be connected to the PC in order to work. so you can use it without having the PC connected.   if you want a great VST with a great sound, look no further than the Fender FV-250  Nice little synth! .  (August 8, 2010)  I've only had the FV250 for a few weeks but I have already come to appreciate it a lot. The FV is great for practice and recording.  in fact, it's one of the few digital synths that I still use from time to time.  of course, the sounds on the F.V.250 are a bit different than on the V-Synth. the V is a little more analog sounding, while the F is a bit more digital. so they sound different but still very good. the only thing that I would change about the Fv.250 is that it is a tiny little thing. it has to be pushed all the way in to get it to work on a computer.  the other thing I would like to see changed about the V and F is that the F and V do not come with any external effects and the F does not come without a tuner. I would really love to see a V and a F with effects in one package. , (June 8, 2011)  and I think you are just about to be a new customer here. If you are looking for an electronic sampler that is cheap, quiet and easy to use, you should check out the FZ series. The sound quality is superb, and the fact that it's completely analog is a huge plus. This is one of my favorite synths! It is so good that I bought two FZ-series synths - one for each of my sons. I don't know about you but I'm sure they'll get used too. (March 1, 2014) ,,,, (July 5, 2014 )  FZ Series  This is the best value for your money! :) (January 10, 2015)  I have purchased two of these units over the past few months. I am using them to record live
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am in love with this device. I love the fact that I can hear everything that is going on in my home and I love that my house is not a bomb shelter. I can watch TV, talk on the phone and listen to music all from my phone. This is the best electronic device for my needs. I would definitely recommend it.  I love my Echo! I was looking for a wireless speaker to use in my kitchen. After looking at all the wireless speakers, I decided to buy an Echo because of the wireless connectivity and the price. It works flawlessly and I can control the volume from my smartphone. I have also connected the device to my TV so that I don't have to use my Echo to play music. I am very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it!  Great Product I bought this for my family and I'm very happy with it. It is great for keeping up with our kids and parents. They can play music and talk to each other and I know that my wife and I will have some fun while we're at work. We like the fact it has a built in microphone so we can use it in public places without having to bring a separate device. It's great to have a wireless device that I won't have my phone out while it's in use! ,,  Excellent product! I have two Echo speakers and a Google Home. My wife loves her Google Home and can't get enough of the voice recognition. We were looking for an Alexa compatible speaker for the kids. This was the only option. It worked out perfectly. The speakers work very well, the speaker is loud and does not distort. The sound quality is very good and is very loud. The speaker is a little smaller than the Google Home, but it fits in a cupboard and is easy to clean. My only complaint is that I have to press the volume button a few times before the Echo can hear you. Other than that I'm happy with this product. The only reason I'm giving this 5 stars is because the Amazon website says it will be shipping within 3 days. It shipped on Wednesday and the packaging is a bit sloppy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great value for money. Very powerful, very quiet, lots of features and excellent build quality. Would recommend to a friend! Great product and price. Good product for the price, great for any use you can think of. Good bang for your buck! I really like the sound. I have been using a laptop for over 10 years and never had a problem with it. I use the sound for music, I use it to stream movies and the speakers work great. I just wish they had the ability to play music on it when it's off, and the ability for me to put it on the charger and have it be on when I get home, so I can listen to it while I'm working. The batteries last a long time and I really can't tell a difference with my computer. I also have a bluetooth speaker so that helps as well. I've never had problems with the batteries and they last forever! The only thing I would change is the volume knob, it seems to be a little too sensitive to be used to make sure the volume is always correct. I like that it comes with a usb cord and charger. It has been very easy to set up. I am very happy with my purchase. Excellent, Quiet, Powerful Audio I was so impressed with the quality of sound this thing produces, and how quiet it is that I have decided to upgrade to a bigger, better sounding device. The sound is amazing and really does what it says on the box. I would highly recommend this device to anyone who has a computer in their house or who is looking for an audio system for a laptop or desktop. It is a little pricey for what it does, but it is well worth it for the amazing sound. A must have for anyone who wants to get some decent audio out of their computer I have to agree with the other reviews. This little device is a must have. I get so much more out of my computer now. I can run it as a speaker and also as a blu-ray player. It can also play my iPod and can also turn on and off my speakers. The only bad thing about this product is the usb cord. It's a little short and can't be used with the charger, which is really the only thing that's wrong with it and makes me have to buy a longer one. I'm going to be ordering a 2nd one for the front door, and hope that one is just a little bit
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********** This is my first Apple device. It's pretty much like my old Dell laptop with the wireless keyboard and monitor. I bought it mainly because it has Bluetooth built in. My first experience with this device was a disaster. I was trying to make a video call and couldn't. When I tried to connect it, the screen would not change color and would freeze. I called Apple and they gave me a new one. I just bought a different phone. I had to buy another one. But, the problem is that I have to keep my old phone charged all the time. This is a real con. This was the second time that I bought the phone but I got the same thing. I hope that Apple has fixed it so that I can do video calls without having to charge my old one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! This is a very good keyboard, but I'm very disappointed about the cable. It's very thin, and I think that's a problem. I use a lot of cable. This is the only cable I'm using now.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from I used it for a few months, and it is a wonderful product. I used the keyboard with a Yamaha keyboard, and found that I was able to use a little bit of my old Yamaha keyboard. I'm a musician, and a keyboard is essential to my work. I do a lot in music. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the keyboard I got, it is very good and fits my needs perfectly. I just wish Yamaha would make a wireless version, which would be much better than this one.  (Posted on 8/6/2014)  WOW. A GREAT KEYBOARD!! I have been using the Korg nano for a year now, but just purchased the KORG KX-1. I have never owned an electronic keyboard before and just found the KX1 to be a great product. When I first plugged it in I was amazed how great it sounded. When you have to type a lot, this is a great option. I am very pleased with my purchase.  and now my korg kx-1 and nano are in the same room. The KORGs are very loud, but the Kx1 is even louder! I'm really impressed with the K-X1, it's a nice improvement over my old korg mono. (Posted On 8/4/2014 by Richard C.)  Good Quality Keyboard I bought the keyboard because I wanted a keyboard that was simple to use, but powerful enough to produce high quality music. It was a good choice for me, and now that I have it I find it much easier to use. (But) I still wish it had a headphone jack to connect to my stereo. I don't have one on my old keyboard. (I do have a korg monophonic keyboard that does have a headphone port.) (Posted 5/21/2014 By Scott C.)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this to play music on the computer. I have the i7 version and I'm very happy with it. I love the controls and the sound quality is very good. The only negative thing I have to say is that the USB port is very bad, especially when you plug in the speakers. I bought this for my son who has had a PC for years. It's the first one he has ever owned and he loves it. The sound quality and interface is great. I'll definitely buy another one in the future.  Was this review helpful? Yes No Version: 1.0.4.8 Reviewer: Joe from Fort Lauderdale, FL USA   Overall rating: Good product  Review: I bought one for myself and one for my daughter. Both are very happy, I'm not sure why the only positive review is from someone that uses the software to listen to music on a PC.  the usb port on this one is very terrible. It will sometimes not work at all and it's annoying. I'm sure that the software is well coded and if I'm buying another one I will probably buy the usb 2.0 port. I wish that they would release a usb 3.0 version as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ The new VE Mini is a fantastic little device, very portable and easy to use. You can use it as a wireless speaker, or even a portable microphone. The speakers are very clear and have a good range. The microphone is a very good one and works well, but can get a little warm.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************** I have owned a number of different electronic devices and this is the first that I would recommend. I own a Toshiba Tecra B.S.1 which is a very good and inexpensive portable. This is the second Toshiba I have purchased and they have both lasted many years. I have had to replace both several times due to the fact that the batteries in these devices have begun to deteriorate. The batteries in the Tecra are still going strong. The battery life of the Tecras is good for the price. They have a lot of features that I enjoy. The screen is very nice and bright and the battery life is quite good for an electronic device. I am very satisfied with these devices. It has been many years since I have used an electronic gadget but these two have not disappointed me. I would definitely recommend these devices to others.

Yes No Monday, February 24, 2013  Very good phone  by Andrew from New York City USA  Pros: Good sound quality, good size and looks good.  in case of loss of phone, i still have it in case i need to call or talk to anyone.  the camera is very good. the only thing that is a bit annoying is that the back button to zoom is not a standard back button but an arrow button. that can be frustrating.  on the whole, a very good phone.  a very high quality phone. the best phone I have had in a long time. :)  Cons: the screen is very dim. but that can happen on all phones.  "not for me" - not a fan of the size of the phone. but it is good enough. .  to me, the S3 has become a new favorite. it is very light and portable. it has everything you want and can get by just fine.  that is my only con about it. it can be a little too big for me at first but then it becomes comfortable. /Andrew  Review of DJI Phantom 3 Standard Quadcopter by Joshua from Houston, TX USA    Pros High quality built Cons Poor battery life and limited storage   My Phantom 3 Quadcopters is having a difficult time maintaining a connection to the computer and is not accepting any new files from the computer. The connection is so bad it will not accept any new file even when I turn off the connection. I have tried several things to fix this but nothing seems to help. My Phantom is a very reliable flying device. It is very easy to fly with the new version of DJIS. - Joshua  I would have given this a 5.5 but I was not impressed with the battery life. I could only get about 5 minutes before the battery was running down.  The drone is very portable. It can fit in a backpack. I am very satisfied with my purchase and recommend it to anyone wanting a great quadcopter for under $200. It's small, very portable, and can fly all day. I recommend the Phantom 3 standard.  and I was very impressed with DJI's support

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using the RCA to RCA audio cable for about a year now and am very pleased with it.

I also used this cable for my RTA5 and it works just as good. I'm not a musician and can't attest to the musical qualities of the cable but I know that it will do what it is supposed to do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my fpv for 3 months now and i love it. The quality of the fpvs is really good. The only thing is i wish i got the 2.4ghz version so i can fly faster. But i love the fisheye lens. Also, i wish there was a charger that will give you 1.5amp. The batteries are expensive, but they last a long time.  Good camera I bought this camera about 3 months ago and so far its doing pretty good. I've taken a few pictures on it, but it is pretty heavy for a 6 inch.    I'm going to buy a 5.8 inch and will be replacing mine.   The image quality is good for a $25 camera. I would recommend this camera for those that want to get started and don't want to buy any more expensive camera. , March 3, 2015

I have not been able to figure out how to use it, but that's a good sign.  is it really necessary to add a USB cord to the bottom? or is it just because the original plugs are made to go into a standard outlet?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ The VSTi is great! ___________ It is so good that I would give it a 4.5 stars. I'm using it with the Roland R-101 for a blues/rock/jazz/soul project, and it is great. I am very impressed. The sound is a little more "loud" than I like, but it is very versatile and easy to use. I have used other VST plugins (such as the Shredder) and they are very nice, but the Roland is the best I have tried. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to use an old analog synthesizer but can't afford the pricey ones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought a Nook Color a few months ago and I love it. I have the Kindle Touch and the Nook Tablet and both of them are good, but the Nooks are a little smaller and have the same design. The Color is just bigger. The color is much brighter than the Kindle and is more vibrant. It is much easier to see on a light colored background, which is great when you're reading something and want to see more detail in a text. It has the same layout and controls as the Kindle, which I like. It also has a good battery life. I do wish it had a front facing camera like the Kindle. It was a little disappointing that there wasn't a headphone jack. The screen doesn't turn off when you are on the bus or at home, which makes me feel uncomfortable when I am trying to read on a bus or on the couch. I am planning to get a case for it but I don't think it is worth it unless you have a lot of books. I really like the design of the Nokton and will continue to buy them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  Bought this to replace a broken Sony PXW-F1.   I did not use it for a few weeks and then decided I wanted to try it out and it really is a great little unit.   and the price is right.   a few people have commented about the "bump" and it seems to be something I have. I'm getting the same bump when I turn on the unit from sleep mode. So far the unit has performed as well as I hoped and I am looking forward to using it for many years to come.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************  I am really impressed with the battery life and battery charger that come with the phone. The battery is a huge plus and a huge improvement over the last version. The only issue I have with the new phone is that it can be a little noisy when it is charging but I believe this is due to the power of the phone not being fully charged. I like to do some listening to music with the speakers on and when I have the phone on it can't be heard. The speaker is a big plus.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! - August 11, 2008Great device for the price  Reviewer: The Fonz - favorite favorite favorite - August 6, 2008  Subject: WTF This is an awful recording. There is not one good moment to be found here. It is just like a bad recording of a crappy movie. I have listened to this over and over again but I just can't get it out of my head. The sound is like someone who is trying to get the best quality possible but is so far off the mark that he can't even hear it himself. I wish they had put some of the music that is actually on the album on here. The first time I heard this album I thought this was the best recording in the history of music. The second time I listened I thought, "no way." The sound was just plain bad.   This is an album that I can only imagine that the original producer, the guy who actually put the songs on there, had a hard time putting together the songs that he did. Maybe it was a long process of recording and recording and then finally putting the album together. This is a bad release.   with the bonus track on this release the price is much better. - August 7, 2008WTF  Rated 5 out of 5 by G.R.O.D. from A very nice release! This is one of my favorite albums from the 70's. It has a very smooth sound and a very enjoyable album. It's great to listen to it on a nice long drive.  I am still a little bit skeptical about the bonus tracks, but after listening to them I'm glad I did. - July 24, 2008A very nice  Customer Reviews  Topics: 1980s, 70's, album, rock, rock'n'roll, pop, album review, vintage, 80's, oldies, 80s

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********************This is my first attempt at a computer. I ordered a used Dell P4200, got it working in a few days, and bought a used Toshiba Satellite P505. It is just as fast and has all the features. I've been using the Toshiba on and off for several years and am very happy with it. It also has a good display. A few small things like the battery not lasting very long, and not being able to use a usb keyboard, but it's still an excellent computer. ***************************1) Get a good USB mouse. It's very nice and works great. 2) Buy a good CD burner. It makes for faster and faster download speeds. **************3) Get an external Hard drive. The extra memory is great, and it's nice to have something other than a laptop. *************4) Get the newest Windows Vista. I have tried other Windows versions, and Vista works much better than XP. ***Read the rest of this review...********************It was so easy to install. Just unzip the disk and follow the instructions. No problem. The first time I tried to boot the laptop I got a very annoying message that I had to turn off the computer before I could install the drivers. This is not a problem for me, I just do that everytime I use my computer. It turned out to be a false alarm, so I installed them anyway. The hard drive came with no problems. I was a little disappointed with the battery, it lasted just as long as my laptop, but that's what you get with a battery that only lasts about 6 hours. I do have a small power pack, but if I were to buy one again I would probably go for a larger battery. It was just as easy to get the computer running. It runs very fast, and the operating system is easy to use. I did get the software to detect the computer. When I used a mouse, or a game, I was able to move the mouse in that game, and that was a real relief. The keyboard and the touch pad are great, but I wish the buttons had a little more resistance. They are very responsive, but the buttons have little feel. Also, I wish it came with a cd burner. I had a CD burner at home, but for some reason this one did not work. I am sure there must be a good reason. I like the way it looks.

I just purchased a brand new unit and had a little trouble with it, but after a few minutes of troubleshooting with the tech, he replaced it and it works great. If you want an excellent sound, great features, and great value for the price, this is a great option. Highly recommend.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from I am extremely pleased with this item, and its customer service! This item is a winner. I have had several audio systems that were overpriced, but this is just what I needed. The sound quality is amazing and its extremely easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone!  Product: This is a really good system I had some problems with my old audio system and I bought this one because I needed something that would be simple to use and it was perfect. My old system was so old that it was hard to turn the power on and off. This unit is easy to turn on and my music sounds fantastic.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first thing that I noticed about this product was that the device is so tiny that you can fit it into your hand. The other thing that impressed me about this is the fact that you do not need any special software to get it to work. The interface is very easy to use and all you need to do is plug in the USB cable and connect it to the PC. I do not have a clue as to how it works, but it seems to work like a charm. The only thing that i have to say is that it does not have the best sound quality, but for the price it is a great purchase. Also, the price of this device is amazing for what you get.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my  P-ROD a lot. It's a very simple device to use, and it works well for me. I don't find it to be as noisy as other cheap p-rods, so that's a good thing. The sound is not bad at all. I was able to use it to take a picture at night (using the flashlight), without the light shining into my bedroom, and the camera still got a good picture. I'm a big fan of P-rodes. They're not expensive, and they're a lot better than the crappy batteries on a lot of flashlights. I highly recommend them. Write a negative review about an average electronic device (or a great one, but with problems):  There's a lot to like about this flash. It works pretty well, it's easy to use (the batteries are easily accessible), and it's small (only about the size of a pack of cigarettes). The problem is that it is so easy to overheat. This has been a big problem with many flashlights I have bought. The battery has a tendency to over heat. This is why I use the  Sanyo CR123A (which are the most common). But the ikea P-rod is very difficult to keep cool, and I'm having trouble keeping it running reliably at night. What do you use your ikeas for?

'small size' is great for keeping on your keys.  and can be used as a headphone. ,it can be paired to a bluetooth device.  in order to use this device you will need to buy a blu-ray player and some bluetooth cables.  (the one I got does not work well with the blu-rays. the one that did work worked better than the one I bought.)  Cons: it has some vibration when used in the car. but it is less than my car's speakers.  of course the bluetooth works fine.    Was This Review Helpful To you? No Yes Monday, August 07, 2015  Great little device. Great price! ,  This is a great little gadget. Works well with my laptop and music. The only con is the vibration, but I had it connected to my phone and didn't need the vibrate.  a great buy, especially if you're a music lover like me.

(Posted on 2016-04-16)  by John from Las Vegas, NV  I bought the product on a Friday and I received it on Tuesday morning. The product is great. The only reason I am giving this product five stars is because the quality of the product was better than I thought. I had to return the first one that came to me because the plastic cover that holds the battery was cracked and bent. The second one was defective. The battery was not properly seated and I could hear the plastic sound that was made when I put the battery in. I sent them an email to see what they could do about the defective battery. They sent me a new one and a new battery. I still recommend this product to others. I was very pleased with the customer service and will purchase from them again.  is a great product. I purchased it on a weekend when my wife was at the doctor's office and I had a small emergency. This battery charged all my electronics including the printer, phone, computer, TV, and printer in my office. It saved me about 50% of my power usage. I highly recommend this battery and look forward to purchasing from them in the future. The batteries are very durable and last for a long time. I will purchase another one in the near future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This is my second (I had to borrow the first one) i am very pleased with it. I love that i dont have to use a plug, i can use my laptop to get a signal out to my tv and i can listen to the radio and movies with my radio and tv on the same device. I also like that there is an app that shows you the channel you are listening to so you don't have to flip through a page to find the channel i want. I have an iphone and i find the ios app to be better than the other one. I am looking to purchase the tv later on because i can do a lot with it now and i am going to use it on my tablet and on my iphones as well. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to listen to radio or movies and it's small size and price make it a great value.  My only issue is with the cable. It gets hot so i have to wear a headset. I think the cable could be thicker and less plastic but overall this is a good product.  a better choice than the original

I am a fan of all your products and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an awesome gaming PC. Thanks again for your amazing service and product!  It's very nice, the only bad thing is the wireless works only for the cable connection and the keyboard, no gamepad. I can't find a good one in the stores and the ones that i found in the internet work only with the cable, not with the keyboard. That's very bad because the keyboard is a good size, it's very easy to control and it's just a very good experience. But still the wireless is not working with the wireless controller.  and that is really bad. i have the wireless and the gamepad, but when i put the keyboard into the adapter, the wireless doesn't work. ...
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a portable and easy to use device that would not require a special connection to my PC to connect it to my TV. This is a fantastic device that is well built, looks nice and fits perfectly into my home. I have a Roku 3 that I use at work and this makes a great substitute. It has been very reliable and easy for me to use. I can connect it up to my Xbox to stream Netflix and Hulu for work. I don't think it will be enough for casual gaming. I also think that this would be a great alternative to a cable box for people who don't have a cable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is a wonderful little device. It is very light and easy to use. I use it at home and have had no problems at all. The battery is a bit of a problem, as I can not see what the numbers represent. It would be helpful to have an additional battery, but the small size of the device makes that impossible. My only negative point is that I have not had it for long enough to see if the battery will last, but so far it has lasted for a week with just one charge. The light it emits is very nice.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob from I like it... I like this light. It's easy to read the numbers and I have to admit it's a very cool light. I am glad that it comes with a charger so I can keep it charged while at work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- The best thing about this product is the fact that it doesn't have a big battery life. This is a perfect device for those who want to use their tablet in a light-weight form. It's small and very portable, and has a nice battery life that can be expected from a small device. Pros: -Good screen -No major flaws -Great battery life -Can be used as a light weight tablet -Lightweight Cons: -Cannot be used while charging -Not very portable -Some people might not like the black finish (but i like it)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great sound and very convenient. I love this unit and use it for recording and for live shows. It's so nice to have the unit plugged in. I'm very happy with the quality of the unit. I also like the fact that the unit is so small, so easy to pack away. It fits nicely in my laptop bag or my pocket. The unit is also very quiet. The only complaint I have is that the output level is too low for me. I can get it up to 70% volume, but it's not loud enough for me to hear my voice. I think if the output were slightly higher, it would be better. This is one of those things I wish the unit would have. It does make a great unit for my needs and I love that it's so small. Write a negative review about an electronic device that doesn't work as expected:   It's pretty much useless. I bought it thinking it would do a good job of recording guitar solos. But I find that the volume is way too low and the sound is too thin. I just want to record a band and have a good recording. This unit does the job, but I think it would have been more helpful if it had a better volume. I have a much better sounding unit in my studio.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the second electronic device I've owned. The first one was an old laptop that had been left in a cupboard for a while. It didn't last long. The last one lasted 2 years, and I bought it after having to buy a new laptop as the battery started to die. I love this thing. It is light and it can be used for any kind of job, from drawing to writing to computer coding.   I bought a new battery after the battery died, and it lasted about 2 years.

This amp has a very wide and well balanced sound, so I don't find myself needing to dial it back. It's just great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was the first computer I ever bought, and I don't regret it. I bought it to learn about programming and the internet, and it is perfect for those things. I was very happy with it, I don�t regret buying it, even though I can�t understand how it works.   It is extremely slow when I use it, but I have used it so many times that I think it doesn�t bother me.   to make it more useful: I have a Windows XP machine and I can still run the programs I want to run. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that I can't use it as a media player. I think this is because the keyboard doesn�tn have any key backspace, so it is impossible to use it like that.   in conclusion: this computer is awesome. I really recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to program and to get a new computer.  If you are thinking of buying this, then you are right to think about it, because this is a great value! If you want to program for a living, then this is the computer for you. I'm really happy with this purchase and I'm sure you will be too. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone5-plus  I bought my iphonelife-5+ from a different vendor a while ago, but it didn't work as advertised. It was pretty much useless. I did eventually get it to work, but not without a lot of effort. I think I am on my third or fourth attempt at trying to fix it. I found the following posts helpful: The following instructions are for my  iphonelifes (5+). I used the following parts: - Apple Extended Battery - Apple Dock Connector (not the dock connector for the phone) - iPhone 6 - Lightning to USB Cable - Lightning Cable (with 5-pin cable) - A 6ft extension cord (you can also use a micro USB to USB adapter if you need to charge the phone in the house) - 10ft extension cable (this is for charging the phone from your computer to your car. Also works as a power cable for your car if you don't have a car charger. - Apple USB to Micro USB Adapter (optional, but helpful) I also bought an Apple USB-C Car Charger ($99) but didn't use it in this project. The car charger doesn't have the port for the Lightning cable and I think it wouldn't have worked anyway. I didn't have to modify anything on the phone itself. The only modification I made to my phone was using a longer cable. I cut the USB cable in half and inserted one half into my phone. This left the USB connector exposed so I just put a little glue on the exposed connector to hold it in place. I had to cut off the extra plastic on the top of the phone, so I used a tiny nail file to cut a hole in the top so I could put a tiny amount of hot glue on top of it to make it easier to insert the Lightning connector. Once the glue was on, I put the rest of the cable on and the Lightning Cable into the phone. I also used a bit of hot glues to stick the cables to the phone and the dock. The phone was charging fine. I took a picture of the inside of the dock before I installed it. If you are trying to put the dock in the phone you will have to use a little more force to push it into the dock to keep it from falling out. Once I had the dock all in I used some super glue to glue the Lightning to the dock, then attached it to the back of the car

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound is very good. It's not like any other sound card I've ever owned. The sound is clear, and the bass is a good amount of power. It sounds good to me. I have it hooked up to a Sony PCM60 but the sound is really good too. I don't know why it's called "Sony PCM" when it's a Pioneer device. The Pioneer CD-i is really expensive and has an awful sound.   This thing has an excellent feature. It has an on/off switch. This means that if you're a music buff you can turn it on and turn it off without having to turn off the power to the CD-I.   I would buy this product again.

The first time I used it was the very first day of hunting season. The second time I tried it out on a hunt I had it on the rifle with my 6.5 Creedmoor. The rifle was out of ammo and it saved my bacon.   1/5 star. I had to use a new battery about a week later. It was running too hot, and when I returned it, the batteries had burned out. I have yet to hear anything from H.E. that they can do anything about it.   the sound quality is not good. It is like having a loud speaker in the ear. I got the red one but it is too loud. I also have the blue one, but it doesn't sound as good.  , and that is the only reason I give it 3 stars. Other than that, it is a very good little device. The sound is good, the size is good for its size, and the battery life is long enough to last for the whole season. I think if they would come up with a better way to charge the battery, it would be a 5 star product.  and that's the only  product I have. The batteries will get to be like this very quickly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I have two of these. They're excellent. They are easy to use, and they have very fast charging speeds. The battery life is great, and I can get through a whole day of normal use, even without charging. I really like the fact that the batteries are interchangeable. I've had the old, smaller batteries for about a year now, and the new, larger ones for a little more than a year. They work well with both. I bought one of the new batteries and put the old ones into it, and that has been the most reliable, fast, and convenient battery replacement ever. I am very satisfied with these.  Good product, bad shipping: ************** I have only had this product for a few weeks, and so far I am quite happy with it. I have to say that the shipping from my local store was quite bad. I ordered the battery and it was the wrong battery in the package. I called and asked for the right battery, but they told me I'd have to go back to the store and get the right one. That was the end of the conversation. After waiting for 3 hours and then getting the replacement battery, it took me more than 5 hours to get it, which is unacceptable, especially when you have to pay for the shipping. It's very hard to get the wrong one. Also, the battery I received had a small crack in it. It was easy to fix but it was an unpleasant surprise.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【MikroElektronik Kontrol S1】 【Excellent value for money】   I bought the Kontralisk S1 because of the good sound and the good build quality, which is good, but also because the S1 has a more ergonomic design compared to the V1. It's not as bulky as the V-one, but it's still very well made and well designed. The screen is very sharp and has a good viewing angle, so you can easily read it from all angles. The S1 is very loud (which is good in my opinion), and has no distortion or ringing. I'm using the built-in mic and it works very well, it's a nice feature to have. The build quality is good and the build quality of the S2 is very good. The V1 has been known to be a bit fragile so the S-series is quite a bit more durable. It still needs some cleaning on the back, but not so much that I would recommend the S3.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is my favorite item in my collection. It is the first USB port to have a built-in ethernet port and a built in usb-to-serial converter.   There is a great software that runs the program and then it communicates to the device. It works great.  's review:   I have had a Mac Mini for a while now and was looking for a nice portable to replace my macbook pro. The Mini works great for this. It has a lot of features but does not get too hot or too noisy. It can be used in a small room or a large open space. It also has a great battery life.   the usb port is a good option for me because I have a usb to serial converter. I am not sure why you would want to use a usb serial port with the ethernet.   and the size is great.  I bought this for my father and he loves it, and he was using his mac mini for a few years.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used this product for years and it does the job and is very reliable.  The only problem I had was the charger that came with the unit did not last a full month.  a bad review of a bad product:  This was my first electronic device.    It was so fun to use, but after a couple months of usage, it was time to replace it.  The battery is a real issue.  If the battery is not fully charged, the device is unusable.  My first problem with the charger is that it was not compatible with my USB device, but it worked fine with my computer.  I am not happy with the quality of the charger. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! Love my new iPad!!!!  Good value for money, well made and well thought out. A good device. I had read lots about it, and wanted one to test it. This is a very good value for the money. It is well built and well designed. The keyboard is good and the software is good. It has an app store and it works. I have no complaints about it.  If I could I would rate the keyboard on a scale of 1 to 10. But I couldn't. It was the only problem I had with the unit. It just is a little too stiff to type on, and the key travel is just right. If it could be adjusted a bit more. I would probably rate it 9.5. But, it works fine for me.  "This is a great iPad for the price! The software is easy to use and the screen is sharp. I recommend this iPad to any one."  The screen is really good. I like the size and the colors. The only thing I didn't like was that it was hard to scroll the text.  is a good product  Excellent product!  A very good product! Good performance and good value. - David H. .  the tablet is excellent for the amount of money.  at the time of writing i am enjoying using my new tablet as much as i did the one i had from iphone 3  Great value!  the product is great.  and it is very easy to install  I have only used it once and I have a feeling that it will be very useful. I am going to purchase another iPad 2 this weekend and then i will be getting my first iPhone 4S and i am sure i will like it even more.  I have not had it long but the keyboard is very comfortable. The app store is good but it is easy for me to get frustrated when i don't find what i want to look at.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!! This is a really nice piece of technology. I bought one as a Christmas gift for my son. I am really impressed. It is a great size and has all the features you would want in a radio. I use it in my RV and the batteries last about 4-5 months. I do have a few quibbles: 1. You do have to have a power cord, but you can use the car power adapter to get a power supply if you don't have a cord. 2. The antenna is not very powerful, but I do not use it all the time so I don't know how much of a difference that would make. 3. You have to be careful when connecting the radio to the car, as it has an internal battery that must be recharged, and the battery can get damaged. Overall, I am very satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The sound quality is excellent! The only drawback is that I can't change the volume because the device is not waterproof.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Sound quality, compact design I bought this to replace my old headphones and I was very pleased. I have been using these for over a year now. The sound is great and is clear, not muddy, and very comfortable. The built quality is good and the volume control is very convenient.  the sound quality of these headphones is superb. I use them with my iphone 6, with my ipad mini and also with a korg xpander and the sound is good for my needs. the only downside is that they are not waterproof
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I purchased this keyboard for my kids, they LOVE it! The key spacing and spacing between the keys is perfect, the keys are responsive and are very easy to press. The buttons are easy to find and the layout is easy to use. They love using the multimedia keys, they use it a lot, especially when playing games and they can't believe how fast and easy it is to navigate through the multimedia. If you want a keyboard that you can easily carry around and use, this is a good one. I also bought a wireless mouse, but I don't know if it is as good as the keyboard or not because I didn't use it that much. If I had to do it all over again I would definitely buy this keyboard. -------------------------
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used the huino for a few months now and it is great. Its got a great sound quality and it looks cool! This is my first electronic and i love it!   I'm a beginner in electronics and am impressed: ild use the hw-1 for a month now, and i am very impressed. Its cheap and reliable and it will give you the most out of the hvz-100, so far, which is great since i have no idea where i would go for a hv-100.   the only bad thing is the case, it is really bulky and hard to open and closes really hard. i also bought the hc-3 for my hvh-100 and it has been the best option so far   It was very easy to setup and use, although i would prefer it to be a bit bigger.  , but i would still recommend this unit. It works perfectly. It does sound better than the hhv-102 and has more output. It's small, easy to pack, and looks great too!I'm new to the h-series but it was very straightforward to setup. I was very pleased.

Good:  - Compact  (the mini can be used on a desk or on a stand, but the stand is the better choice)  – Easy to use  for a portable vape  and the battery life is very good.  Good for travel or a daily user: , I use mine daily at work and on the road for both work and travel.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a very nice device. I had problems with the battery drain. When I put it in the refrigerator I had to turn it off and put it back on before the battery got low. That was really annoying because I have to turn the light on, set the timer, and set the volume all over again. The battery did not drain at all after I used it a few times. It does not use a lot of power and is a good size for what I wanted to do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【Roku】The Roku is an all-in-one media player, that plays video, music, and photos. It's simple to use, easy to connect, and has all the features you'd expect from an all in one device. The remote is well made and the device itself is sturdy and feels durable. I also like that it's a bit cheaper than its competitors. 【Playstation】I love my PS4, but I've noticed that it can't run a lot of games at the same time. The PS4 is capable of running pretty much anything that you throw at it, but when you're looking for a dedicated media player for the money, the Roku is a great choice. ~~My Review: ~~The Roku 4 has been my daily driver for quite some time now. The price is unbeatable and I have never had a problem with it. I have the Roku 3 as well and I don't think the difference is that great. The Roku 4 is just as good as the older Roku 3, but a little more expensive. If you want a great streaming device, you can't go wrong with the Roku 4.    My only issue with the device is that there are no headphone sockets. This means you need to use your own headphones to listen to your media.  This was my first time trying the Roku and I was impressed. I'm not sure if it's because of the small size, or the fact that I'm using an older model, but this device is actually pretty powerful. I don`t think I`ll have to upgrade my tv anytime soon.  The only negative that I can see is that the buttons aren't exactly the same as the original Roku. The buttons are much easier to press and you have to be a little less careful to get the right button pressed.  There are two types of channels: TV and Movies. The channels you can choose are the same for both versions of the device.  This is the best device for watching movies and TV shows. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus xlr v4 is the best portable dvr i have used! great for anyones need for quick access to recordings. I used it for two months and only lost one episode, and all the others I lost with my old one. If you need a good portable dVR I would say it's worth the money!  Good and Cheap. I am a student at University in Texas. I had to buy a new television every couple months to keep it in working condition. I was looking for something like that and I found this unit. I've only used it a couple of times but I like the fact that it comes with the remote and that it works very well. If I can get it on a 2nd hand computer, it will work perfectly.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is the best electronic device for me. I am a heavy user of my computer so the large screen was a plus. I would have preferred a keyboard but I'm very happy with my purchase. I also like the small size. It is a good size for my hand but I still have to put my arms in. I like the ability to take pictures and the sound is good. The battery lasts for a long time and is easy to charge. I use it on the go but I have been able to take it with me on my plane and use it for a few hours. I really like the fact that I can put my computer on top of it. I have never had any problems with the battery. I bought this item for my girlfriend who also has a laptop and is using it a lot. It will last her a long long time.

I was extremely happy with the price and the software is a nice touch. I have the windows 7 pro with the 64 bit processor and I have to say I am amazed at how fast it runs. It is a very nice computer. I bought it for about $300 and I think it is a great price and I am glad I bought this one. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good computer.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device : ***************** This was the second computer I bought. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it and ended up with the Windows Vista. It had a lot going for it, but was very slow and sluggish. It would take over an hour to get my computer to boot up. I've also had it freeze and restart. The only thing I can really say good about it is it has the ability to run Linux. However, I don't plan on getting a computer of this caliber for a long time. The hardware just isn't worth it. I guess you could say that this is my "new" computer. But I really want to get a new one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s This was my first electronic device ever. I bought it because I needed a new phone and it was cheap. This device is good for the price and does the job. The sound is clear, the screen is easy to read and the phone does not get hot like other phones. The only thing I wish it had was an SD card slot so I could store my music on it and not have to plug it in. This phone is good and will be in my collection for many years to come.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6s  by M. from Fort Worth, TX on 06/10/2017 I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I have had my iPhone 6s since Sept and have had no problems with it. The screen is easy to read and the camera is better than the previous model. I highly recommend the phone.  By Anonymous from Fort Lauderdale, FL on 06 the 09/03/2016 The new iPhones are great and I'm using a 5.5s now for my work and for my friends' kids. The iPhone 6 plus is the same size and the same great camera.    I love the iPhone 6 Plus, it's a great phone. The camera is amazing and the phone is very light weight.  the iPhone 5s and the iPhone SE are great phones too.  and yes I will buy an iPhone 6 for my 6s Plus.  on 01/01/2016 I am very happy with the phone but it has some problems  The battery life is a little short compared to my other phones. . I think the main issue is the display. It's not that bad, but there are some pixels missing on the display and it makes it hard to read it. I'm trying to find out what the cause is but it's not something I can fix myself.   The camera is the best I have seen on any smartphone and I think I am going to buy an iPad mini and a couple of cases for the phone as well. I will be buying the 6s and a new charger for my phone too.   "I have the iPhone 8" by Anonymous from Canada on 01 the 12/28/2015 I'm a big fan of the iPhone and I have an older 5s. I've tried the 8 and the 6, but I think they are way better than anything I've had before. The only reason I'm not a fan of it is because I hate the new Face ID. It requires me to enter my fingerprint and I hate having to do that. I hate all the changes to the phone, it feels like Apple is taking my iPhone away. I also hate the price tag. The 6s is $100 cheaper, and I just can't justify paying that much for a phone that has been out for months.  . The design is a bit different but I like it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Very good I have tried several other chargers and this is by far the best, it is very powerful and easy to use.

I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a great charger with great quality  Good product! Very satisfied with my purchase. Very easy to set up and use, has great quality and works well with my LG G3. . - The battery lasts for several days now. :)  Excellent charger!  Works great with my G3!  a good charger that works.  a really good charger  I have used this product and I am satisfied with it. I am very satisfied with the charger.  and I will order another one in the future.  The charger is great, but the charger case is a bit hard to put on, not enough plastic to cover the charger (though the charger looks great in the case) but the case is very thick. ,  the charger is a good one but the usb cable is a little too long, it would be nice to have a shorter one.  in addition, the usb charger has a very nice design, but i think the usb port would be better to connect to my pc and to use it as a portable charger, that way it can work as a powerbank as well.   The charger is good, but I do not like the way that the usb connector is designed. It has a plastic plug with a screw on the end that is designed to be unscrewed, which you do when you need to disconnect the usb plug, but when you try to screw it back on, it won't come off. I would not recommend this item to anyone.  of all the usb ports that I have used so far, this is the only one that has a problem with me being able to use the usb powerbank port, which is really disappointing. the USB cable is fine.    it is a decent product and the only usb cable that I would buy. I will update this review if I have any issues with it (which I hope not) and if I get another one.   and it does have a decent design.  the usb charge cable does not seem to be very durable at all.  for the price I paid, I am sure that

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The price is good and you get more than what you pay for. The design is a bit cheap and the buttons are all wrong. It doesn't matter that the design is not as good as an iPad. But it is easy to use and I am able to do a lot of things. If you need an inexpensive and easy to operate tablet, then this is the best one out there.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works as it should, but I wish the keys had been different... Works as a cheap ereader, but it does have a few flaws. The keys are too small to comfortably type on. The back of the cover has a few small scratches on it. But I haven't had any trouble with the screen. I don't like that it's black, but that's a small price to pay for an ereader.  the best e-reader you can buy... for the price  i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this book reader. It works perfectly and I use it almost daily. I like that the screen is clear, and the size of the book is nice. I just wish it had a larger keyboard and that the buttons were different. But overall I think it's a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm not going to lie: this is a cheap little device.  It's not worth the price, and it's not really any better than a few of the others that you can buy online, but for a limited time, it's a great way to listen to music.  The good:    This is a fantastic product!   It's an audio converter and is compatible with any mp3 player that you have!  It converts the mp3 to WAV (and can play WAVs on most of the devices)  It has a 3.5mm headphone jack for the headphone to connect to.  It is powered by a 9 volt battery.   The battery is removable and replaceable.  There are no batteries or wires.  The USB cable is just 3 feet long.  You get 2 batteries and an audio cable.  This little guy is so small, you can't use it without it being plugged into your computer.  I have no problems connecting it to my laptop.  They make the battery connector a bit difficult to use, so if you have a USB cable that has a standard length connector, you should be fine.    The bad:    I am not a big fan of the USB connection, but you get what you pay for.  When you first plug the device into your pc, it will ask you to change the power source.  After you choose "USB 2.0" and "A2DP" (this is the audio protocol for bluetooth devices), it will tell you that the audio is ready.  That's pretty much it.  What's not so good: The interface.  Sure, it works with most of my computers, but I am a bit of a power user.  With my laptop and all of the software that I use, I need the audio device to be connected to the power supply.  But, the interface is pretty simple, and when you're not sure if the device is plugged in or not, it can be confusing.   I don't know if you can tell from my pictures, but the device has a lot of black around the power and audio jacks.  So, it would be nice if there was some sort of warning label on the device.   The sound quality is pretty good.  If you're going to use this with a desktop or laptop, you're probably going to want to use a sound card

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s. it's great, i have a hard time saying a bad thing about it. i love the new camera in it. It's not the flash that is bad, it's the fact that the phone is now a lot more expensive. i have an older model and still use it, but it's now twice as expensive. If it's for the money i'd get it again, but at the rate i'm paying it, i don't know if i will. i'm getting a iphonelite as well and i'm going to buy a second one to use with the iphonest. The iphonet is going to be a good camera, but the price is too high for what i was expecting from this camera.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good phone for the price The camera has a decent feature set, and for the most part works well. But... I have had this phone for about two months now, and I can honestly say I've had it a lot longer than that. The first day I put it in my pocket it fell out a few times, and the screen is extremely sensitive. After a week, I went to the store to get it fixed. I was told it would cost $75 to replace the screen. After that, I found that the screen has fallen off the phone once or twice a month since. And if it's falling off, I'm not using it. In short, it isn't a good value for the $500 price tag. I will say the camera is good, but you will be better off investing the money into a better camera.

It has a huge app library that you can play music from and podcasts from. It also has the ability to download songs for offline listening. You can also connect to bluetooth. I like the ids because they are small and look like a real music player. The only con I have is the battery life. It lasts a little over 6 hours when I am just using it on airplane mode. It does run out of power quickly and the app will not recognize your device if you have a lot of music on it. The best part about this is that it will charge your iphono without the need for a charger. What I would change about the iplex: -The size and weight of the ilex. ilexs are a little to big for me. -The ilexon doesn't have an i-pod app. You have to have a bluetooth connection. So the ivex is a great device. If I had to change something I would have it be the battery. ivexs last longer but ilexes are bigger. The battery would be a good size of a iplexon, and the price would be closer. The iplexi is a good little iphonet. It's nice to be able to charge my iphonics on the go. iplexes are more expensive than iphons and have a bigger battery. I think if you can get a deal on a ilexi, iplexus, or iphoniq it's worth the investment.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- It was easy to connect and the USB was a great fit in the case. The sound quality was very good and the software is great! Would recommend it. I'm happy with it. --------------- Great device for the price. I would have preferred the ability to connect to the PC without an additional dongle, but otherwise, great purchase. -------------- I bought this to connect my Sony XBR-55 with the Sound Blaster Audigy to my laptop. The quality of sound is amazing! The software for connecting is easy to use and the connection is very easy. It's a great value for the money. I highly recommend this device. ------------- I was looking for a way to connect the Soundblaster Audigys and XBR's to my PC with the latest drivers, without the need for a cable or dongles. This device is perfect for that. I use it on a Lenovo ThinkPad and the PC sounds fantastic. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great sound device, for a reasonable price. ------------ My Sony PS3, with the Audigyd, sounds amazing! I was hesitant about spending a couple hundred on an audio device that could not provide the full sound of a PS3 soundbar, but I must say, it's worth it! ------------ I was having a problem connecting my iPod with the Sony XB-55. The donglers were to small, and the cables that came with the device weren't long enough. I tried to use the dongler with my computer, but it would only work if I put the iPod in a case. I was very disappointed, and thought I was going to have to go buy a dongled iPod. This product made that problem a non-issue. It was an easy fix and the sound is excellent. -------------------------- I got this to use with a Sony PS2, to connect both the XB55 and the Audigs. The connection is a little difficult to explain, but if you plug the X-B55 in, you can just as easily plug the Audrig into it. The PS2 sounds great, but as far as the Audigon is concerned, it has no competition. I am very happy with my purchase, and I am going to be buying another one for my son. __________________  "We live in a world where our senses can be altered to create a fantasy world, and then we have to figure out how
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first purchase and I really like it. I have tried a lot of different headphones over the years and I like the sound of this one a lot. It's a bit brighter than most headphones but I find it very comfortable to wear and I'm very happy with my purchase. I love this headphone but it needs a little adjustment to it to keep the bass from getting too boomy. I can hear it a little bit but it sounds too full.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently purchased the Taurus PT-11 and it works great! The remote has a great feel to it and is easy to use. The controls on this device are very simple and easy to navigate. The battery lasts for a long time and the remote is easy and accurate. I also like that there is a headphone jack on the unit and it's very loud. The only downside I have with this device is that the remote doesn't have a button to turn the unit on and off so you must hold the button to operate. It also has a power button on the back of the device which I think should have been on the front. I just wish it had a power indicator.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikaruswap i have this for a month now and it works perfect. The best thing is the battery life of about 5-6 hours, I can get a full charge from a standard power outlet and it still has more juice in it than my phone or laptop does. I'm on the go a lot and I use this as my laptop. It does not use as much power as my other laptop but that is because I only use it on my lap and the keyboard and mouse are nice. I also like the fact that I can charge it with a micro-USB cable. The only thing is that the USB port on the side is tiny. If the company makes a bigger port on one side I would buy it. It's really a great product that will last me a long time.

The only downside is that the cord that comes with the headset is very short but that is only a minor concern since you do not need to use the cord to plug in the cable. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend the product. 】 - Michael, USA   【I was so impressed with the quality of the headset that I bought a second one. I bought this one because I'm a heavy user and the first one just didn't have enough volume to be effective. 』 - Tom, United States   My first headphones and I can't stop wearing them. They are lightweight and the noise cancelling is awesome. ・ ・  This is a really good headphone. It has a nice balance between bass and treble. 」 - James, United Kingdom   If you like to listen to music while on the go, these are a great choice! 】 ・   I purchased these headphones for my daughter. I have worn headphones before and the best I can say is that they get in the way of my work and sometimes the noise cancellation is not very good. These headphones are so much better. The sound is much more balanced and it is easier to listen when you have your laptop and music on in your hands.      The product is excellent. The quality of this product is outstanding and it can be easily used in noisy environments. The noise cancellation function works well and the sound is good quality. The volume of these headphones is very good and I like that it is very light and lightweight.      I am not a music listener but I do have a lot of computer software and my work environment is very noisy. The headphones help me concentrate on my work. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I have tried a few different types of e-cigarettes, the one that I have now is great. I get a lot of vapour, no coughing. The only thing I don't like is the battery life. I usually get about 3 to 4 hours out of it. That said, the price is right and the battery is rechargeable. I love it!!!  The best I've tried this many times now. Its the best, I love this vape I can get a good thick cloud every time. The best.  best e-cigarette!!! I bought the vapour one about 2 years ago and have used it ever since.  the flavor is great and the vapor is thick and satisfying. . , I've always enjoyed the taste of cigs and the flavor and vapor of e cigarettes are always good but, the battery doesn't last long enough and it doesn't get very hot. I will always go with the vapors over a cig, its not the same but, you get a little taste.  to make a long story short, the vapours are great and are not harsh. you get the right amount of vapor and the taste is great with a good amount of flavor. it is definitely my new all day vape.  and the best part is the price. i have been vaping since I got my first one and this is the best one I've ever tried  I'm new to vaping, so I got a sample pack and I loved it! I love the flavor, the vapor, and the price!  Amazing! This is the first time I have tried an electronic cigarette and I have to say I am hooked! It is so smooth and the cloud production is amazing! The only con I have is that the battery takes a little getting used to. I find I need to keep a new battery in the pack for every time I change it. I am not a big fan of battery life so that's something to keep in mind. I also have to keep some in the bag to charge it up when I am on the go. The price is awesome and the customer service is amazing!!  Good product I bought this vape because I have been trying to quit smoking and I love how I can smoke outside and still be able to smoke inside. This product works well and is easy to use. It also looks great with my tanks.  of course the battery lasts less time then it's advertised but,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this item a couple months ago and I'm very happy with the purchase.   This is a good size item for the money and works very well.  It does not give a "squeaky" or "wriggle" feel when using it.  I love the way it makes your voice sound when using this product.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality item that will last a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently received my new eVo 4s and was thrilled to find the wireless speaker works just as well as the one I had before, plus the remote is much better quality and more durable. I recently purchased a new e-vo4 and was so pleased with it I bought the eVo 5. I've had my eVo4 for several months and loved it, I had the e-Vo4s for 2 months and they are great. This one is even better and I really like the remote.  So I bought this one and couldn't be happier with it.    I highly recommend this product, I am glad to have it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- This is an outstanding product. The audio is clear and crisp and the speakers are extremely loud. The buttons on the back work as expected. I purchased the unit to replace my laptop computer which I had to upgrade due to it being so outdated. This unit is way better than the laptop computer and far more affordable. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!I really like this thing. I got the 3D Touch version because I had an issue with the old version where I couldn't use it for many years. The old one would have a blue-light that would come on every time you picked up the phone. The 3D touch version is really great and it works perfectly. It's not a huge deal if you're not a fan of the blue light, but if you do, you will appreciate the 3d touch a lot. The battery life is pretty good as well, it last me about a week when I use it every day. The only downside I found with the device is the lack of an optical sensor. The sensor that you see on the front of the device isn't accurate enough. It usually shows the screen at about half the size of what it really is. I wish they'd have made the screen larger because that would make it much more usable. If you want a good all-around phone that's just as capable as a regular phone, but with better specs, you should buy this phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a computer to use with my PC and this was the perfect one. I liked that I could connect it to my tv for watching movies and that it was small. I just wanted a computer with a keyboard. The only thing is that I had to replace my battery. Other than that I like it and it came very fast and in great condition. I will definitely buy again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:............................................................ This is a great product. I like how the case is made of the same material as the keyboard case and the case itself feels nice. I have the black version and it is very similar to the old IBM keyboards. The keycaps feel a little cheap, but they don't make a difference. The only thing that I don't like is that the LED is in the wrong place on the bottom. It's on the right side of the keyboard, not in the center. It would be nice if the LED was in the right spot. This is really just a cosmetic issue, but the fact that the keyboard is made with the same type of material as a keyboard case is a big deal. I'm using this for schoolwork, and so far I've been very satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.....................................................  If you can afford to buy a good brand of electronic device it's worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used the sony vlc and it works as good as any dvd player out there and the sound is great as well  Rated 5 out of 5 by ronnie from This thing works great, i use it to record audio to my pc, it is very nice quality. I have used it for over a year and i can tell its going to last a long time.  The sony is one of the best portable audio recorders I have ever used. The sound quality is amazing and the battery life is very good. I use the samsung in my car and it does the job just as good if not better. I also own a bose soundbar but I can't justify the extra expense of that. The Sony does everything a bOSE does but with a better quality sound.  (Posted on 2/6/2015)  This is an excellent portable audio recorder with a great sound quality, great for podcasts, podcasts, interviews, and other projects. The battery life on the sONY is awesome, and the portable nature of it makes it really easy to use, and it's very portable when you're on the road. This is my everyday use recording device. The only con is the lack of a separate input for microphones, and that's not the end of the world, just annoying. I'd give this a 5 star rating if the microphone input was a separate switch.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! I purchased this as my first audio receiver. I was very impressed with the sound quality. The only con I have about this unit is the volume knob. It's just too stiff to turn with a finger. The volume knob on my old Yamaha CD player is much softer. It works great for listening to music on the road.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************** This was my first purchase from a major manufacturer and I was so happy with the price and quality that I went ahead and bought a second one. I had the original one for a year and was looking for a replacement but they didn't have one in stock so I got a second version that came in much better condition than the first one. The quality of this one is far superior to the original and the sound is far better. It's a good product that I will recommend to others who are looking for an inexpensive alternative to the iPod.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this about a month ago. I use it to monitor the temperature of my water in my hot tub. This thing is very helpful and simple to use. I also purchased the thermostat and I love it. I have never owned a thermostats before, but this is a great value for the price. I'm using the thermos to keep the temperature down at the top of the tub. I don't use it as a way to adjust the temperature. I just turn it on and the temperature drops slowly. I highly recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this device and have no complaints about it. It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's easy to use and works well. I'd recommend it highly. Rated 5 out of 5 by MrPapa from Awesome for my kids! This is a great tool for my children. It is very easy to clean and is durable. They love playing with the lights, the batteries last a long time and they are easy to replace. The only problem is that the buttons get bent over time so be careful not to press the buttons when you're not moving. I purchased this to replace a defective remote that I had with a broken battery. The buttons are easy and sturdy. I used it to control the lights in the garage and the garage door, which are always on. I use a switch box and the button works great with the remote. I love the lights that come on when you push the button, I have never been able to get the lights to turn off by myself without the remote, but this will work. I will definitely purchase another one to add to my collection! Rated 1 out of five by Tod from The buttons get very bent, they are no good I have been using this product for about 2 years now and it is the worst product ever I bought 2 of these but now I think I am going to have to return it. When I get home and turn it on my buttons start to get bent. I had to buy another one because the buttons are no use.  Rated 4 out of. by tzt from Excellent product I bought this a month ago to replace my old remote. This remote has all the buttons and it has a lot more functions than the old remote, so that's what I use most of the time. However, the buttons on this one are so bent that you can't use it. You have to use the button on the other end of the remote which makes no sense at all.  (I am not a professional and I am just sharing my experience)  I'm in my late 20s and have been living in a hotel with my parents. I just recently bought this item and am very impressed. The remote is easy to program with the buttons. I have already used it multiple times. I don't use the lights feature that much but I use it all the time to turn on the bedside lamp when I get up. It has an internal battery so I can get a

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I have a Dell Latitude E6410, I bought this laptop to replace my old Dell Inspiron. I love the features, and the price. I am a software developer, and I have been using Windows 7 since the day it was released, but I am starting to use Linux. So I had to have an E6430. This laptop is great for everyday use. It's fast and it works great, and it's very portable. I really like the keyboard, and even though it's not as good as a real one, it's still great. I like that the trackpoint works, and when I'm in the middle of a long document, I don't have to worry about accidentally clicking the track point or moving it around. The one problem I had with this laptop is the battery life is very good, but it's a bit short, especially with the touch screen. It runs out of juice after about 5 hours, and then you have to plug it back in. I also have a Windows 8, and this laptop works well with the Windows 8. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the sound quality is not as great as I would like. The laptop gets really hot, and if I put my hands on it, the palm rest is hot to the touch. The keyboard is not backlit, so it's hard to see in the dark. I wish Dell would add a backlit keyboard. The battery life was a little short, but that is only a problem for people who want a laptop that can be carried everywhere, but not for me.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* It is a very good keyboard. I use it with my HP laptop and have been very pleased with the speed and ease of use. The sound is not too loud but I prefer to use headphones when typing and I like that the volume is adjustable. The fact that it is an external keyboard makes it more convenient than a laptop keyboard. The only complaint I have is that there are no built in numeric keypad buttons, just one for the Enter key and one for number 1.

I was able to use it at work and was able work and watch the tv with it. I am very pleased with it and it is easy to set it up and use. The sound quality is very good and I have heard the same from a friend who has a Yamaha. I have owned several brands and am still very satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ The product is excellent! Works as it should. The screen is beautiful. It has a small drawback that I have found. When you turn the unit on, it seems to be powered up. When the device is switched on, there is no sound or anything. It's just a blank screen. It may be an issue with the power supply. It can be switched on and off with a small push of a button. If you have this problem, I recommend purchasing the power cable. It does help in some cases. Otherwise, it's a great device!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My iPhone is my phone. It's my main device, and it's my primary device. I'm very happy with the phone, I use it every day. My only complaint is the battery life. I've had it for about a year now, and the battery has barely been charged once, and even then it's still very low on charge. This device is also quite expensive, but I would never have bought this phone if I didn't think it was great. The sound is fantastic, and I can hear music with it right in my ear. I have a pretty good speakerphone as well, but the iPhone's sound is just a little bit better. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the device.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 29, 2016  good  by C from Santa Clara CA USA  Pros: Good sound quality, easy to use, great screen, good battery life  Cons: Can't use the microphone or the GPS on this one (but the others work great)  Review:  I bought this to replace my Sony cell phone, which is a great phone but not as good as my iPhone. I also bought the bluetooth headset as I want to use it as my primary phone. I like the sound of the speakers. I had a hard time with the software to get the bluetack to work, but once I did, I really like the phone. The battery is good, I can use it for a few days with a charge, and then I charge it for 5-10 minutes. The phone has great voice quality, I have used it on the subway and it works great. Battery life is good. I would recommend this to anyone.  in my opinion, the iPhone has better specs, better software, and a better battery life (i have not tried it on a trip yet, but it seems to work well). This one is a good alternative to the Sony, but does have a higher price. :)  is a very good device, even more than the phone i replaced. The software is easy to follow and the quality is great.  of course the microphone is not very good and the GPS does not work with the bluetoofer  :). But all in all i would recommend it.  and the best part, it's cheap  Purchased in April, 2012.  The phone is exactly as described.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for a while and it's really good. the only thing i would change is the case. it's a bit fragile and the screen gets very hot to the touch when you first start it up. but other than that, i love it. the sound quality is amazing. it is louder than my laptop. so if you dont have a computer it's perfect. i have it on a portable audio system that my kids use, so i just turn it up and it works.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good for the price Good sound, good volume, and fast response times. - The volume adjustment is great, the audio is good for the money. /5 - The volume adjustments are great, The audio is great for the time I pay. ,5 5/5 Works great, easy to use, 5/10 Great for gaming! Great for gamers that like to get really loud. The game I got it for is Counter Strike: Global Offensive, so you can imagine how loud this thing is, it's pretty loud and I was able to play it for about 2 hours before my ears were ringing. So yeah, if you're a fan of loud audio this is for you. If you're not that much of a fan you may want to check out a cheaper alternative like a portable bluetooth speaker. It's also really cheap if you use a good deal for the cost of this thing. It is also small enough that it doesn't take up much room in my car, but it is quite big enough that you might want to take it to a friend's house for a LAN party.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have a new computer and bought this to replace my old one. This thing is just as great as the old one, and even comes with a USB cable. If I could only afford one, this is the one I'd pick.  Great product, but... I purchased this to power a portable hard drive on a bus. The only problem I found was that the power supply did not come with a plug. I had to go online to get one and was charged by the hour. Overall, I would recommend this product, however, it would be nice if it came with the proper plug, I'm just not sure if the plug on the back is the right one.  (August 2015) I bought this power supply to power my USB 2.0 keyboard for my MacBook Pro Retina. It works perfectly. I just plugged it in and it worked right away. The USB 3.0 port is a little bit smaller than the original, but I can plug it in my laptop and it's perfect.  The one thing I do not like is that the cables are soldered together in the bottom of the case, and the power plug is slightly shorter than the previous one. I used to have to get a connector and cut off the original one, but now it's a one-wire plug, so I didn't have to do anything. I bought the original power supply as well, so my MacBook Air was able to run both at the same time. "I love it! This is the second USB power supply I've bought from Logitech and I will never go back to the old ones. The one on the right is the best quality for a good price."  "It's a nice piece of gear and I like that the USB cables come with the connectors, so you can use any cable you want. The price is great, too."  and "I like this product but there's not enough power on the other side for my computer. The other end is not rated for much more than 500mA. If it was rated for 1000mA, I wouldn't have any issue with it. I also don't think there is enough power at the end for my machine."  of "I don't use this in my computer, but it's very nice for my portable MacBook Pro."    and "It's just fine."   I would recommend the unit to anyone who wants a small and portable power supply. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________. I bought this device for my computer because I was looking for a way to play the Nintendo 64 games I had in my old Playstation2. I'm a big fan of Nintendo and this was the best way to enjoy them. I had it for about a month and the screen is really crisp and clear. The only negative I have is that the joystick can get really hot. I have to put the controller down on a cooling pad to keep it cool. The controller is not very user friendly but it's not a big deal because I just use it on the TV screen anyway. Overall, it's a good product and I recommend it.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are a music lover, then this is the way to go. I love this device. I have two of them and I've had them for about a year now and I love the simplicity of this device and how the controls are set up. I also love the sound quality. It sounds good through my headphones, but I can also get a good stereo sound with a good pair of speakers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Great little device and works great with a tablet. The best part is that it is extremely light, so you can carry it everywhere. I have not been disappointed in any way and am extremely pleased with the product and the price. --------------- It was a great deal for the price, the device itself is just fine. However, when it comes to the service, it is nothing but bad. I ordered a replacement for a faulty device, however when I received it, I noticed that the part number was different than the one I had originally ordered and the company has not replaced it. ------------- I'm just gonna say it. I've had the device for over a month now and it still has not been fixed. It is literally a useless piece of junk. I'm sorry but this is an insult to your customers, I know that I've paid for my item and yet I have yet to receive a working unit. -------------- I'm a bit of a gadget freak, but my wife doesn't really have anything better to do with my money. The tablet is a great product and works just fine, however the device that came with it was a huge let down. The quality is just terrible, even after a week. This is the worst piece of crap I have ever purchased from this company. They should be ashamed of themselves. ------------------------- It was very easy to set up and use. The display is nice and bright and it works great! It is very easy and simple to use. If you want to have a small device that is great to read a magazine, but have a large screen and a high quality display, this is the device to buy! -------------------------- I have been very pleased with this product. I like the size and the size of the device makes it very convenient. The screen is nice to look at, as well as the screen quality. It was easy to use and easy to connect to my router. The only problem I have with this device is the poor warranty and the fact that I am unable to receive the replacement for my defective device because they are still in the process of sending it back. ------------ It is a very simple and easy device to use, but it can get pretty loud. When you are playing music, you have to listen very carefully. The volume is fine for a small unit like this. The device does come with a USB cable, so the only thing that I didn't like about this is that the cable is very short
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had a great experience with the VHS recorder. I had a cassette player from my grandfather that was working fine and I thought I'd give this one a try. The sound is clear and clean. I like the fact that you can adjust the level and pitch to match the type of tape. The remote control is pretty nice and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good quality recorder at a good price. Great value and great quality:  This is the second unit I've bought from the company. The first was for my dad and I use it to record my favorite movies and TV shows. It's so easy to work with the remote and it looks great. I recommend this unit to anyone with an old video recorder. It has the best price I've seen for this type of recorder. Thank you! Great product:    This is a great product, I had used a VCR for about 40 years. When I purchased this I was a little hesitant about the cost, but this unit is very well built and I am very pleased with it. The unit is built well and it comes with a cable. It came with a power cord and a power adapter. The included cable was very easy to attach to the wall outlet, and it's a nice quality cable. The only problem I had was the instructions are not as clear as the others I have bought from you. I did not have any trouble connecting the device, and I had no trouble downloading files onto the recorder. The price is very reasonable and the unit is well built.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love my new computer (MacBook Pro 13-inch 2013). It's a lot faster than my old one, and the touchpad is really great. The audio quality is excellent and the keyboard is really comfortable. The only thing I don't like about it is the power adapter that came with it. I've tried all of the different power adapters and this one is the least effective. It lasts for a couple of hours and then needs to be recharged. I recommend buying a power supply with a micro-USB port instead. Overall, I love my computer!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works great for me. I've had a number of the older models for a number years and finally got around to buying a new one for my daughter. The new one works great! My daughter has a lot of fun with it!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, December 31, 2008  good for the price  by Andrew from Waco TX USA  Pros: Works great  Cons: The cord is too long for the wall mount, so it is hard to get it to hold the phone in place on the wall.  Review: I have had the previous model for some time and it is very nice. It's been working well for me so I decided to buy the new one. This time around I used it as a desktop phone, so I don't have to have it in my pocket all the time. I like the fact that it comes with a cord that will attach to the wall instead of having to get a cord adapter. , but it's a good quality device. It works very well and I am glad I bought it. It does have a little problem with the cord that goes through the cord holder but I found a good solution to that. I used the cord adapter provided with it to get my cord out and put it on the end of the cord with the connector that goes in the wall so I could pull it through. It doesn't get in the way of my use and it works very good. The only negative is that the cord is a little long, but I have a long phone cord and I didn't expect it to be a problem. It could also be my phone, but maybe that is just me. All in all it's ok for the money.  the best phone I've ever owned  By JT from CA USA -  The phone is perfect. The cordless technology is really cool. The software is a breeze to use and has all the functions I need. I use it to work, make calls and make/receive faxes. The price is very good and the quality is excellent. I have owned a number from this company and always have a great experience. The customer service is also good and very responsive.  is very fast service  Great phone for the home  My husband and I just got our first cell phone. We were thrilled with the product and service. I would recommend it to anyone. We

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【I really like the sound of this 】I was using the V2 and the V3 for a year and a half, and the new one is the best. The bass is deeper, and there is more of it than in the old one. This is my first portable subwoofer, and it is wonderful. I bought this for the subwoofers on my truck, because I needed something a bit more powerful than the smaller subwoors I had on my car. I've tried other subwoobs before, and this one is my favorite. I can crank it all the way up to 15,000RPM and not feel any bass fatigue. It's very easy to install and doesn't take up a lot of space on my floor. My wife can barely hear me playing bass, so I think I'll get another one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dwayne from I used it with a Pioneer DVD player and my CD player and it worked great with the DVD player  Was this review helpful? Yes No
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【Ethernet】 This thing is great. The connection is easy to use and the speeds are great. I can easily stream HD video and listen to music with this. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the remote is not very responsive. I've had my ethernet connected to my TV for over 30 years and I never had a remote that was as good as the one in this one. This one will have to do for now.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mabel from Love the new Apple TV 2! We love our new AppleTV 2! I use it almost exclusively now, and we can stream Netflix, HBO, etc., and watch videos from the iTunes Store. This is so much better than the old Apple TV. The new remote is easier to use, and the Apple Remote app is easy and intuitive. We also use Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to get our fix.    Great purchase. Great quality. Great value. Great sound quality. It's a real home theater system.  I just recently bought the Apple TV and so far it's been a great device. I have it connected to the wall and am able to use it as a second screen to watch movies, watch TV and listen/play music. I'm really enjoying the fact that I can now connect my iPod/iPhone to the AppleTV and listen or play music through the Apple Music app. And then, when I'm done with music I can use my iPhone to listen to it. I just found out that there is now a way to watch Netflix on the Apple tv. I had never heard of it before but it seems to work great. This device can be controlled with the remote app so it is easy for the whole family to use. The sound quality is amazing. I like the built in speakers. I also really like the fact you can use it on the go. I use the Apple remote app to control the tv so I can take it out on the road and use it for watching movies. The remote works very well. I love the way it is built. The Apple TV is now my main TV when I am not watching.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  this is a great soundcard, and the sound quality is quite good for the price.  I'm using this with my computer and my old Yamaha CD-88.    The sound is not as clean as some of the newer systems, but it is still quite good.  The soundcard is quite small, but the board is made of sturdy plastic and it's not heavy.  It does feel a bit cheap in my hands, but that could just be my taste.  The controls on the board are pretty easy to use.  You get a tone generator, a mixer and a phaser.  I was pleasantly surprised by the phaser - I've never heard one this good!  The mixer has 3 channels and 3 mixers - I think there are also 4 mixers if you add a second mixer.  This is a very flexible unit and you can put all the controls in different places on the back if you prefer.  There are also controls for the input and output volume.  For the sound of this unit I have to say I'm impressed.  If you like to play drums and you are in need of a good sounding soundcard then this one is a must. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is amazing. I can't wait to get to the point where I have a whole computer in my pocket. It has a built in flash drive, but I have to get a portable hard drive, like a microSD card, to be able to store all the videos and pictures I take. I have been playing games and music, but now I want to play games on my PC. I think the biggest drawback is that it only charges on the go, so if you need to charge on a bus or train, it will only charge up to 90% or so. I also don't like that the battery is a bit smaller than a regular microSD and it is a little hard to use when it is fully charged. I like that it is easy to use and to recharge. The only thing I don't really like is that there is a tiny gap in the case between the camera and the battery. I tried to make a clip to put on my phone to charge it when I get it back, but that didn't work and it looks a bit like the battery will get scratched by your fingers. I don' t know if this is because of the design or the battery, but when it's full, the camera gets hot so I have it in my backpack a lot. It's great for a backpacker but not for a daily driver.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** I am using my N64 to watch videos and listen to music. I was a little worried that the TV/Blu-ray player would be a little small but it fits perfectly. I have had other video players that have been a little bigger, but the size of this one is perfect. I've never had a problem with it, it works perfectly. The best thing about it is that it has a built in IR blaster that is awesome. I'm going to have to buy a remote to use with it cause it only has a 1 foot cord to connect to the TV. So if you have a N64 and don't want to take the extra time to buy an IR blaster, then this is a great choice.Read full review

Yes No Tuesday, June 23, 2010  Great little device. -A+  by A Customer from Santa Clara CA USA  Pros: Portable and very small  Cons: Not much else to say  Review: This is the most basic of all the Kobobooks. It's light, portable, and charges up quick. I have one on my keychain and one on a belt loop. They are just as good as the higher priced models but cheaper.  a lot of people may think the batteries will run out before you get to the next chapter of the book but they don't.  "When I want to read a book in a short time, I just turn the Kobook on and let it charge. It will not last more than 5 or 6 hours. It also uses about the same amount of battery as a standard book so I don't think I need to buy a new one. It has a magnetic charging cable that is great for traveling. I love it."  So far, I've been using mine to read "The Lord of the Rings" and "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" and I'm getting a great deal out of it. The batteries have held up very well and I haven't noticed the battery indicator light going out. I haven;t had any problems with the charging. I'm going to buy one for myself and give the others to family and friends.  the one thing I would suggest is to put a cover on the back cover. It doesn't have a zipper but it's a little flimsy and would probably fall apart. Also, if you're using the USB cable to transfer files or transfer books to a portable computer or tablet, you'll want to make sure it's charged first.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** I was able to buy the GX-3 on a great price. I had to wait 2 weeks for delivery. I think this is because there was a big batch and I think it was sold out. I also noticed that there were a few duds. I really like the sound quality and the features. I just wish they would offer it with a usb cable. The GX2 is just the same except for the usb cable and it has a better camera.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The i5-4200 is an excellent laptop for the price. The screen is good. The battery is good (if you do not want to worry about your battery life). The keyboard is good, but not as good as the Dell laptop with the same specs (the one with the touchpad). But it is better than the Lenovo (which was the last laptop I bought with the Dell logo on it). It is an upgrade from my old Dell and I love the feel of it.

It is very simple to use and does what it says, I have not had any issues with the unit at all, very pleased. **************************** ********************* I was so impressed with the iBasso. I bought the unit for my husband for Christmas. He had already had the unit in for several months before we got it. He is an audiophile and I had hoped that the unit would be able to perform better with higher end speakers. But after using it with my Sonos soundbar and a pair of speakers from Amazon.com (which are in the same size as my Sonoush) the unit performed like a champ. My husband had been looking for something like this for a long time. He has used many speakers over the years. The only thing he likes about it is that it does not require a pre-amp like the other models. He loves it! He has no complaints about it. *********** ********** I'm happy with my purchase. I have an iBassi for my computer. The unit was easy to set up and works great. The price is very reasonable. I highly recommend the iBandos for any home theater enthusiast!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this since it came out. i'm still getting used to the fact that it does a pretty good job. its the first time that i have tried to do some real work on a computer. so far so good. theres a couple things that need to be addressed: the mouse is very small, and i have to wear gloves when using it. and the speakers are not as loud as i would like. but these are just a couple minor things that i find to be annoying. if these things arent a deal breaker, i would buy this again, especially since i would get the same price if not for the small problems.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very nice i purchased this for a Christmas gift to my brother. He was looking for a good computer and he was very happy with this one. Its been running without a problem.  a few minor things: the battery life is not the best. I have it on a desktop so that is why the battery isn't as big. But the screen is really nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Very easy to use. It is the best i have ever used. Easy to program and use. I like the battery life and the fact that you can choose between 3 battery options. I can't wait for the new one. Write a negative review about an electronic device :  It is a good device but there are some issues: 1) the buttons are not easy to press, especially the one for changing music 2) it doesn't have a display and no light, so you can't see what you're doing, which is a shame 3) there is no option to have it play your files in mp3 4) there are no settings for the songs 5) the battery will last for 3-4 hours on a charge, but then it stops working. I haven't had a problem with it, but it's not a great product, and I'm not sure I'll ever buy another one. It does what it is supposed to do. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. It's a good looking device and is well made. The only thing that bugs me is the lack of a display on the phone. I'd rather have the screen than the battery, but that is a personal preference. Have you ever used a Bose system or something similar? If so, what's your take on it? Do you use them?

I have tried so many different book readers and I am glad I finally purchased this!!! It's not a small reader, it's quite big and has an amazing display. The reader has many features that make it very user friendly and easy to use. I can also read ebooks on it and I have read the newest version of the Kindle book which is the best book reader ever!! I am a newbie but I am definitely going to buy a second one just for my car and my wife who likes to read her books. I will recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good book reader!!  Reviewed by Michael from The perfect book reader I have a Kindle and the Kindle app for the iPhone but still wanted a dedicated book reader. The Aura HD is perfect. It has a large display and the screen is not scratchy. The book can be opened and closed quickly. The sound quality is good. I use it for my commute and read with my Kindle.  is a wonderful reader, and I use one of the other models. It does not have a dedicated button to open the books or a light button to go into the menu. It is also very heavy, so I have to use a large pen to take out the pages. If I buy another Aura HD, I will replace it with a second version, because the second one is also perfect, just heavier.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently bought the iMac for the first time and it is a very nice computer. The speed and features of the i computer are very good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great device. I have several of them and I like them all. I've used this one the most and it is still going strong. I don't like to write about the noise level, but it's not the best. I'd prefer to have a quiet box. The batteries lasted long and the noise was tolerable. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good portable music player. My first purchase of a DAP from Digikey and I'm extremely pleased. I ordered the Digi-Key G2. I use it on a daily basis and I've been using it for more than a year. I do have to say the battery life is not the greatest but you really can't beat the quality of the box and the quality build. The sound quality is good and the price is right. The only negative I can find with this unit is the button on the front needs to be pressed down for it to work, not just push it up. It's not a deal breaker for me as it's a little inconvenient, but not worth it if you're looking for something you'll use everyday. I'll definitely be buying more in the future as I need more options in my music player and I need something to plug in to my laptop for when I want to play music on my computer. Thank you for a great product and excellent service.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The product is a good quality and it is easy to use. The interface is simple and I was able to use it with my android. The design is pretty good too. The price is a little high but worth it for the device itself. It is not easy to replace the screen. The buttons and touch screen have to be pushed to the screen to turn it on. The screen is bright and the picture is good quality.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- A must have! This was my first time buying an iphone but this time I was not disappointed. I am a big fan of the iphones 4 and 5 series and i decided to try this because it looked so cool and the price was so reasonable. It is not as pretty as the icd but is very similar in looks and construction. It came with the earbuds that come with it which were good but not great. They are plastic but do not fall out and the sound quality is still very good. I like how it charges but i am still looking for a charger for the ipod which it comes with. I recommend this device to anyone who is looking for something a little more portable and stylish.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the pico projector for a couple of years now, the only reason I bought it is because of the amazing screen it has. The screen is bright, clear and it is easy to set up, even on my old tv that isnt quite as nice. Ive bought 3 of these, and they are all still working well, and the price is very reasonable for what you get.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this product and I love it. I've been using it for about a week and I have to say that it's a great little unit.  The price is unbeatable, and the unit is very lightweight and very quiet.   It's a nice device that does what it's supposed to do and doesn't break the bank.  If you have a hard time with your electronics, you might want to look at this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this item for the last 3 months and its been the best purchase i have made ive had the device for 2 years now and i love the quality of the device and the fact that i can still do alot with my old monitor with the monitor being the same size it was the year i bought the ive gotten alot of use out of it the only thing i would change is the usb ports would be a little better i can only do my video editing with a mac so not a problem but i still think the usb port is a little smaller and its a little more hard to use and a little slower in speeds.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mark from Best I've Used Ever I've used the monitor for a year now and have had no issues with it. The only issue i've had is with the connection to my iMac, but that is easily fixed. If I'm working on my computer for a long period of time, I'll buy another.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's a very simple device and has a decent quality. The screen is nice and bright and the phone does what it's supposed to do, though the phone battery is a little weak. I would recommend this phone for its small size and decent quality, but not for its price. If you want a good Android phone with a good price, look no further than the S6. It's a really good phone for a good deal. I have the black model and it's a good looking phone, but I think it would look even better in a matte black. If you like Samsung's signature curved screen you will also like this phone, although it's not as sharp as the curved screens from LG or HTC. This is a really solid phone with great quality and a really nice price. If it's on sale it's well worth picking up. The Galaxy S6 comes in two colors, silver and black. The silver version is the only one that actually has a metal body and looks great. It has a nice solid feel to it and looks really nice. The black version is a matte, shiny black that has a lot of fingerprint and smudges. This model is more of a brushed metal design and doesn't look as nice as the silver version.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is good. "Great for the price!" "What a nice piece of kit!" I am not a huge fan of the new, bigger screen.  The old one was a great screen, but it was too big for me.    I bought this to replace my old XFX card and was a little disappointed at the price.  It has a decent resolution, but the colors look a bit washed out.  "Nice and big"

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________________________________________ My Sony KDL-35WVX has been in use for about 4 months now. I use it for both home video and recording. It's a fantastic tool for both jobs. It is easy to set up, has an internal speaker, and a good range of features. The only real problem is the remote. It does work and is very easy to use. However, the remote doesn't have a dial, so you have to turn the volume up and down, instead of just hitting the play button on the remote to start playing. If the remote had an index button that would go up and get you to the next track, that would be a big improvement. However...it's a great product for a great price, and I would definitely recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a hard time finding a good wireless earbud to listen to music with and finally found this one. I had a pair of the Sony MDR-V6s which are the best earbuds I have ever had, but I wanted to find something smaller that would work with a portable mp3 player and the MDR821 worked great. I did get the black with red accents but that was only because it's my favorite color, but it's a little hard to tell. They are comfortable and are comfortable enough that I have been using them a week now and haven't had to take them out yet.

This makes a very good combo, as these earbude's do not seem to be quite as loud as the HCD's and they do not have the loud bass (and noise cancelling) that the HCP3's have. The Sony HCP's have a bass thump that the Sony earbudes do not. The bass is

If you want to keep your children safe from dangerous electronic devices like cell phones and iPods, then this is a great product. **********  Rated 4 out of 5 by Landon from Good price for an all around safe I'm glad I bought this item. It was just what I needed and I had it shipped to my house. I've bought several other similar items from Home Depot and they were all of a different price range. They all didn't have the same features and were not as well made. I purchased this one and was very pleased with the way it came out. It took a while to get the directions because the instructions were only in the back of the package. It seems the instructions aren't very clear at all but once I got it set up I was very happy. The remote does what it's supposed to do and I would highly recommend this product to others.  5 out of 50 people found this review helpful I am in the market for a safe. I had to buy this one because I already have another one and didn't want to spend more money on a new one. I love the way the remote works. I also like the fact that it can be used to lock or unlock the door. My only complaint is that the door isn't really sturdy enough to keep it closed very well. I could probably bend it a little but not much. Overall it's a great safe.  is a small safe that I've only used once. It's really neat and the remote is awesome.  a nice product for the price. ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Xtreme Pro-Matic works well as a portable scanner. It's well made and easy to use. The included memory card is also good for scanning.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The new iGrill was a huge hit for me. I have not used a cooking grill since the days of my first one and this one was a much better design. I am able to cook my dinner with it without having to wait too long to turn it on and cook. I also have a great looking stainless steel cast iron skillet that I have had for many years and I can't wait to put it to good use. It is extremely easy to clean, easy to store and to maintain."   I would give it five stars if I could, but it is a little too much for my needs. If you want an excellent grill that will cook all kinds of food, and if you want it for under $200, you have found it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6s  The 6s is an incredible phone, especially the larger screen size. It's just a little heavier than I expected, but it's definitely worth it. I have to say that it's my favorite phone to use in the last year. It has a lot of the features I'm looking for, but without the bulk and size. The battery life is great, and I get more calls, texts, and emails than I could ever imagine. I'm still not sure if the microSD card slot is worth the extra weight and bulk, but I can't say that I have an issue with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【M-Audio BX5】 【I am a huge fan of this product】   I am a big fan of the BX series. This one is no exception to that. I have only one other thing to add, though, about the quality of the build: I do not like the way that the front panel is designed. I thought that I was going to be able to remove it with a Phillips screwdriver. The thing is, it is a little hard to remove. Also, the headphone jack does not come out easily, even with a screwdriver (not that it is hard to get a screw driver to fit). I will say that the jack is a great design for the jack and cable it comes with.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from I have been using the X2 for 2 years now, and I am very satisfied with the product. The X2 is a very versatile, powerful, and easy to use headphone amplifier. I use it for my home theater system, which includes an old 5.1 setup with a couple of small, old surround speakers. The speaker's have been replaced with the Yamaha X1s, which are fantastic. I am using the Bx5 with the XLR cables from the B&W 7" subwoofer and a little Yamaha sub. I love it. The sound quality is very good, but for some reason, it takes a little longer for the music to start up after I start it up. Other than that, it's a great product. ...  This is a fantastic amp, I bought it about a year ago. It is the best I have used and would highly recommend. It sounds great, very clean and not distorted at all. The only issue is that it can be a little loud and not too nice at lower volumes but if you like this type of amp then you will love this amp.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this item a few months ago. I'm a very experienced user of a laptop. I purchased this to do online banking and banking at home. I use a mouse for this but found that the mouse does not work well with the new Mac. So I have to use the touch screen. I am not a heavy user but I still do use the computer. The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 is that it does not support Mac OS 10.4. I found the Mac OS software to be buggy. It is also very slow. I have the Mac 10.6 but this is slower than 10.3. But if you are a Mac user you will love this mouse. I can not wait to buy another one to use on my laptop. It works well with my old Dell and I can't wait to get a new one.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Horrible. Horrible mouse. No, it's not a crappy Dell. It's the old school Logitech wireless mouse. It has two button and the scroll wheel. It just doesn't work for me. I think it is an ergonomic mouse and the old ones just don't work. It moves slowly, and there is no click to tell if you've moved the mouse. My old Dell wireless mouse, which has been replaced several times, is just fine. If you want to use a wireless mouse you need to be a bit patient, and it takes awhile to get used to the controls.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********   I just got my new M-Audio Pro-Ject A4x7 USB Interface. This is the first device I've ever bought that's been so well designed that I had to get a different interface to go with it. It's very good value for money.   The A4X7 is the second generation of the Pro-ject line of USB interfaces. It is very simple, compact and has a very nice looking enclosure with a black aluminium finish. The only thing I've noticed about this particular version is that it doesn't have the built in mic input. This was a major complaint from people who own the earlier generation of this interface. I'm a big fan of the mic input on the A4. It makes the interface feel more professional. It has an excellent build quality, is very quiet and the included cable has good quality. The M-audio software is very user friendly and intuitive and it doesn�t take long to setup. The mic input is a big plus and is easy to use.   to be honest, I had hoped that the Pro 4x7 would have a mic input but this has proved to be a disappointment. The A4 does have a very good sound and it's very easy to get going with the included software.  , September 2015.  The sound is quite good. I used to be one of those guys who used a condenser mic on their keyboard. I can't say the sound was very good then, but I still like it. The pads and effects on the keyboard have quite a good sound, and the EQ on the vocals is quite strong.   "In the Flesh", "The Shape of Things to Come", "Lakeside Park", "Dance the Night Away", "Foolish Heart" are great. The vocals are good, too. The mix on these songs is good, but the drums sound a little thin and lack punch.  The bass is a bit thin, and there is some distortion when the volume is turned up. I like the effects a lot.    I have a couple of complaints about the interface. The first is the included mic. I have a Neumann KM100. I use a mic preamp and a preamp on the output. The included mic is a condensate condenser, and it has very little noise. However, I can still hear a little bit of the condenser at the back of my throat when I

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! - September 5, 2018 Excellent device for the price I have two of these and they work great with my Sonos system. - August 3, 2018 The best purchase I have made  I had been looking for a good pair of earbuds for a while, but I couldn't find one that was a perfect fit. So I tried these, and was pleasantly surprised. They fit my ear very well and are very comfortable. They can get a little loud, but that's probably due to the power of the sound that they put out. I'm sure you can get quieter. These are my first pair of headphones and I am very happy with them. - May 30, 2018 Perfect earbud for the Price! I bought these earbudes to go with my iheel 7 and they are perfect. They have a great sound and I love how they look. They are a little bit expensive but if you need a pair of good earbuddys and don't want to spend $200, these are great! - May 14, 2018 Great for gaming I love the sound quality and the fact that you can adjust the volume. They work very well with my PS4. - April 3, 2017 Perfect Earbuds I bought two of the Earbudes and they have really good sound. I am using them to listen to music while I work. The volume is right on. The earbuxes are also really comfortable and the only thing I wish they had was a little more noise isolation for when I do workout. But overall, great earbude for the money. - February 7, 2017 Fantastic Earbud The Earbude B6s are my new favorite earbups. I used to use my old pair of Etymotic ER4 earbunks and they were good but the Etymiotic ER3s are the best earbunk I've ever owned. The ER3's have a similar profile but are smaller and fit my ears better. I've had the B6 for about a month now and they're the perfect size for me. They're not too heavy, I can't even feel them on my ears. The EarBud B6S are my favorite so far, I would recommend them to anyone who has a large ear canal. - December 11, 2016 Great sound and great design, but...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ This is an amazing device. I had some troubles with the original. I have two of these and one is in a closet with an old modem, and I have been trying to get this one to work for about a month. I finally got the other one to connect to my cable modem and was able to download the latest version of the game without a problem. The game works, but it took a long time. Now I can play it for about 5 minutes before I have to reset the router to try again. I love this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the "Geebee" G4 and I have to say that I am a little disappointed. I bought it to keep my music on while I work at my desk. The Geebee is pretty loud for a small size. My first complaint is that the batteries seem to run down very quickly, so I have a hard time going from work to home. My second complaint is the volume knob on the front of the unit is too high and is very hard to turn. Also, the button on the back of the case is a little tricky to turn, so it is hard to tell what you have changed. Lastly, the back panel on the GeeBee is very flimsy and I don't know if it can withstand a lot of abuse. Overall, I like the G4 but not as much as I hoped I would.  No Was this rating helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! i'm very impressed with the ease of use and the performance of the unit, i was impressed too when i first used the device, but now i have to use my own i got the one, that is not the best of the best, but it works, and has a long battery life. This is a good device for the price, but its still not a top of the line device. I would still recommend it to people who want a good, cheap, small, portable, light weight, and easy to use device.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mark from A good product I was using a digital alarm clock and I liked it a lot. But it was too bulky and heavy. I like the idea of being able to control the alarm by the push of a button on my cell phone. It is easy to set up and use. The only thing I didn't like about the alarm clock was that the clock wasn't very accurate. But this is a small device and it works fine.  a good product that works well  Reviewer: Michael from San Francisco, CA

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this to replace my old desktop monitor which was having trouble with the refresh rate. I was amazed at how good this monitor was. It is so bright that you can read the paper with a magnifying glass. I had my old monitor for over 5 years and I had to go through 2 or 3 sets of batteries to get it to work. This one just did it for me. I also use it as a digital display for my notebook computer and it works great. The only thing that I don't like about this monitor is the stand. It makes it too tall to sit on my desk but it doesn't break easily so I just got used to it.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: digitalmonitors.com

I was using a Windows laptop but switched to the touch screen because I find it better. The touch screen is much easier to use, I like it much better. I bought this item because I am a bit of a tech geek and wanted something to help me with the touch.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________ I just got the new HPE 710 G4 laptop. The battery lasted me 5 hours of heavy work with heavy traffic. I have been using a HP laptop since 2002. The HP laptop is a great computer. I got it on a good price. It does not have the best performance, but it is very powerful and it does everything you want. I do not have to use a USB keyboard because it has a full sized keyboard. It has good size and weight. It is also quiet. I use the laptop as a desktop computer and a laptop. I am very happy with the new purchase. It's a good investment for your business. __________

I use it to monitor my wife's heart rate while at work and it's always on. I have the heart rate monitor on my iPhone and it does a good job. I just ordered one for my iPad and will post my review on that as well. This is my second Apple Watch and I would recommend it to anyone who has an iPhone. -Chris  Just bought my Apple Watch today, and am very pleased! My previous watch died in August. This one has held up well. The first one I bought had a cracked screen. After that I purchased the Apple band. This band has worked flawlessly! It does not come with a charger but a charger is provided. The watch is beautiful and I love the watch face. I am glad I purchased this. Thank you Apple!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- A very good value! The sound quality is outstanding, and the sound is not muffled at all. The interface is easy to use and the unit is very light. I really like this little unit. -------------------------- (Posted on 4/26/2015)  It is a good product! ------------------------ (Posted 4/25/2015 by Mark) .  This is a very good product. It is good that there is a little more of an option to have the music volume on a set level. I would like a little bit more detail on the display. I also want the option to put the battery in backwards. -------------- (Posted by Chris) I have been looking for a good sounding, simple unit for a while. I was looking for something like a Sonos and wasn't sure if I should go with a set of wireless speakers or the Alesis. I've had the Ariesi for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed. The sound is great, I've used the unit for the first time today and I was blown away. This is a great buy, I plan to use it for music and podcasts as well as movies. I'm not sure if they are just making a big splash at the moment, but if you are looking for an affordable, simple wireless speaker I highly recommend the Auresis.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had the pleasure of getting my son an iStick at the same time as my new TV.    I was very pleased with my purchase.  This is the only e cigarette I use.  I love the taste and it's not too big for the money.  It was great to be able to enjoy a good tobacco when my husband had a few drinks.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works well. Does not smoke as well as others. But I use a glass bowl, not a paper one. I'm a big guy and I can't get the iSticks to work. It is not too bad, but I don't like to get burned. I have no idea why it is not rated higher. I've used it for about a month. I also have a tank and the iSmokes just do not smoke well with the tank.  Rated 5 out of a 5 by Mike from Great product. Works well in my tank. Easy to use and does not produce much smoke. Very convenient.  the best thing ever. ive been smoking for years and ive never been able to get a good vapor.  this one does the trick.  i would recommend it to anyone who wants to quit smoking  Great product, great price. I purchased the iSstick from the store in my local Wal-Mart and I am happy to report that it works great in my iStik tank. I used the atomizer for the first time last week and it worked flawlessly. The vapor was great. My only complaint is that it was a little pricey at $19.99. But this is the best product you can buy for a low price. The only thing I would change is to have a couple extra pieces of glass and metal to keep the i Stick from cracking.  in my opinion, the i stick is the single best vape pen on the market. it heats up extremely quickly, heats to the right temperature, and is very easy to use. I am a beginner and I get my 2 year old to use it and they enjoy it. it also helps that the flavor is strong and it is easy to load. The downside is that you have to buy a spare piece of glass or metal for it, but other than that, it is a great product. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this from B&H after seeing rave reviews on the web. It worked great out of the box and I was able to get a good signal with it. The noise floor was very low and I didn't have to calibrate it. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a solid radio that will work well and have no issues with noise or signal loss.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** I bought this for my wife for Christmas, and she LOVES it. The picture quality is wonderful. It does require some adjustment to your ears but after that you're in love. I also bought a little portable stereo amp so I can use my music player as an mp3 player in my car and it has great sound. I like the fact that you can change the sound in the headphones so you don't have to have the same sound all the time. I've been using it all winter and it's really nice and quiet. The price is reasonable. ********* I purchased this item for my son for Christmas. He has very large ears. He plays this with a headphone and earbuds on. The sound quality is great. He was very happy with the product. ************ I bought the earbud version of this for myself and I absolutely love it. It sounds amazing, it's so easy to use, and it fits perfectly in my ear canal. I can barely hear the music even at full volume. ******************** This is a great little device. I use it to listen to music in my vehicle. I have the car stereo in my trunk, but I also have my iPhone in my pocket. This is my favorite device for music, movies, and the radio. The volume control on this thing is a bit fussy. I find that the best way to use it is to put it on high volume and let it drop down and then use the volume controls on my stereo. I would recommend this to anyone. ------------------------- This is the best thing ever! I am a big fan of the Sony Walkman. I used to own a Sony portable mp3 but I didn't like the way it played. I wanted a way to listen without the annoying sound. This thing does everything I wanted in a portable music player. The ability to store your music and play it from your car is fantastic. I haven't had this for long but it is already making my music collection sound better than ever! ************************** Bought this for a friend for Christmas and he loves it. I don't think I have ever heard such a clear and crisp sound out of a portable player. I didn'T have any trouble with it charging the first time. ****** I own a SONY portable CD player that is a lot smaller than this one. I really don't care for the audio quality but I think the price is a little steep
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------  I love the Epson. I have always used the ETC. I never liked the ETR but I did for a while. I had a computer built that was a lot more powerful and faster than mine and I was always annoyed with the battery life. I used the computer to manage my business and I needed to print and fax as well as edit documents. I thought that the ETP was the better choice. I love the speed and the features that the printer has to offer. It has a lot of nice features to help manage the printing needs and I have not been disappointed yet. I am going to order a couple more of these. I also want to note that this printer is a great value. It is priced very reasonable and is worth every penny. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade from a regular Epson printer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using a new Iphone 5s for the past few days and am happy with the new device, the only problem i have is the battery life. I've had it for a week and have used it to go to work and on the train, as well as going out and around town.  It charges very fast.    I am still not satisfied with the battery.  I have no idea why the battery is a bit shorter than before.  The battery is not bad and doesn't leave you in a dark place.  It has some battery life left.  This phone has great speakers and music is loud and crisp.  With the iPhone 5S, i can listen to my music and videos on the subway and on my way to work, so I am satisfied with this purchase and look forward to future purchases.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my iphone 4s for a couple of years now, and it's just as good as i thought it was going to be. The best thing is that you can charge it all the time, unlike a regular charger. This phone is just as much fun as my other ipod, but i feel it has a lot of potential because it is the only phone that will play music without downloading it. the quality of the pictures is very good. the camera is amazing. i'm very satisfied with this phone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Roxy from A must have for anyone on the go! The best phone out there!! I don't know why I didn't buy this years ago. I don`t want to pay so much for my other phones. I had a htc iph3 but it didn`t last very long and it had to be replaced within a year of purchase. I was looking at other phones and i saw this and I couldn`t wait to get it. I am so glad I did! I like the fact that there is no data plan but I also like that the phone is so lightweight! I love the fact you can have a backup battery and I love that you don`n have to plug in the charger all the times to charge it up. I like to use my phone to watch movies and music and that`s why I bought this. I have no complaints about the phone at all. I just wish the price was a little cheaper.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this after trying a lot of other "smart" products and I'm glad I did. The best thing about this thing is how it works, and the ease with which you can setup it. I'm a professional, so I have a lot to do, and I can't always remember where everything is. This thing takes care of all of it. It keeps everything organized, and it's all set up and ready to go. My kids love it and I love that I can still see where everything in the house is, when I need to go in to get something. If I ever find myself in need of a simple tool to get around in the yard or around the house, I'll definitely be getting another one of these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________ I bought this item about 3 months ago and I have to say it is by far the best electronic item I have owned in a long time. I purchased the 1-4 button and 3-button as it is called and I love both of them. The 3- button is great for opening up and closing my phone, but I do wish it was a little easier to use. I use to have a small keypad on my laptop and that was great. But this one is much better. It is a little harder to find the buttons, but it is much faster to find them than my old one. And the buttons are much better for a device with a touch screen. I would definitely buy it again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! It was very easy to set up and use. I have tried many of these types of programs but this is the best one that I have found. I like the ability to change the colors and the sound is just right for my mood. The only thing I would change is that it should have a memory of my last programs and not have to reenter them. But the best part is that I can have my programs with me and I can carry it around with me if I want. I can also turn off all the music and turn off the light if I do not want to use it that day. I will buy another one for my home and I would recommend this one to others who are looking for a good program.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Lizzie from Nice program for the price I bought this to play some MP3 files at night. I'm using this with my LG TV, but I might use it to play games as well. The program doesn't use a lot of memory, but it's all I can use, so I won't complain about that. It's easy to setup, and you can even use it with a PC if you don't have a PC. It has a good variety of sound effects, and I like that it has a "soundscape" function that lets you adjust the volume of the sound effects in real-time. -I've read a few reviews of it, and some people had some problems getting it to work with their TVs. I didn't have any problems with it at all. It came to my house about a week after I bought it, but the shipping took 3 weeks. I think I'll have to send it back. A few notes: 1. It says "2GB RAM", but it only has 1GB of RAM. 2. I haven't tried it yet, but with my PC I'm able to use the sound as a PC sound, which I think would be nice. 3. It would be great if it came with a manual, as I can't seem to figure out how to set it up with my TV. I just have to go to the settings page, and then "Set Up" and then the "Set the Sound" and "Set Volume" pages. 4. The "sound scene" setting I can set to "OFF" (it just turns off the sound). The "Soundscape" setting should be able to set the volume, but

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********** I love my iphone4s. I have used the iphones 4s for about a year now and I just love the sound of the earphones. I also love the fact that it comes with a micro usb cable for charging and a case for protection and comfort. The earphones are not as loud as some of the ipleks but they sound good and I love the battery life. The only problem is that the case does not come with a hard case. ********* I would not recommend this device for anyone that is trying to cut down on their spending. The sound quality is average and the sound quality of the device is very good. ************ I have the iPhone 4S and I've owned a iphon 4 since mid October. I had a huuuuge problem with the sound. It sounded very muddy and I couldn't figure out why. The problem was solved after I turned off the microphone but the problem still persisted. I contacted Apple support and was told that the problem was due to the microphone being off by a few milliseconds. Now I'm not trying to be negative here but that is a complete lie. I'm an audio engineer by trade and my ears are sensitive to sound quality. I tried the mic and after about 3 days of using the ips 4s I realized that the microphone was the cause. I returned the ip 4s, replaced it with the ics 4 and my sound is much better now. This is a very high quality device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I purchased the e-cig with the clear battery cover which makes it easier to see the battery charge level. I love the way the e cig is so easy to refill with e liquid. I do have a problem with the e juice that the clear liquid comes with. It has a lot of flavor but also a lot more nicotine than I like. The clear liquid tastes like you got a big bowl of tobacco flavor, but the flavor is way too much. I have tried all kinds of juice to try to taste the difference and they all taste the same to me. I like the way it lights up the tank and is easy to fill and take out. I really like this device. The price is great for this electronic cigarette. I am glad I got it. I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't go out of style.

I was very happy with the quality of the machine, but one of the features I really liked was the built in storage. You can put a lot of things on there. You even get to do all that by just opening it up and putting it in the "Disk-C" slot. I use the computer for writing up my weekly business reports.

I'm very pleased with it. I bought the 128k model with 8K RAM. It's nice to be able to put files on the Apple II. I used it as a printer and it worked fine. It is a good machine for its price. I'd recommend it to anybody. --G.G. (Lansing, MI).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________________________________________________________________________________  I really love my ipod touch. The sound quality is great, and the touch screen is a pleasure to use. I'm not a big music fan but the touch will work well for my needs. I also really like the new design. The screen is bigger and there is no way to hide the small speaker. The only thing I would like to see changed is that there is now a little light on the bottom. I was wondering why it didn't light up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I'm a huge fan of the ezplay. The fact that the unit is wireless and has a built in speaker makes it a winner in my book. I can play my iPod through the e-zplay without having to plug it in. My only wish is that it came with a charger (the one that came with my iPod charger is too big for the unit), but that's minor.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have an old Dell laptop which is about 6 years old and it has become my main computer and it does a lot. The screen is clear and easy to use, and the battery life is great. The sound is also very good. I also have an iPod touch which is also a very good phone and it is not so expensive either. I just wish I could find a way to play music with the iPod, but I guess that will be for the future. It also has the same keyboard as the computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works very well. I purchased the 2nd Gen. model and it works well. The buttons are tactile and the volume controls are responsive. The unit is sturdy and has a very good feel to it. The battery is charged by the unit itself and the charger is quite small, but it works very effectively. I use my unit every day for work, but I am going to upgrade to a more powerful model. It is a good product, I have no complaints. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device  :    I would not recommend this product to anyone, except for the people who have already purchased it. It's not as good as the $100 ones. It has a terrible volume control. It will not work with the sound system. It doesn't have a headphone output, so if you need a headset, you will need to purchase another headphone jack adapter. Also, the power is really weak. The device needs a little more power to work. The most important thing to remember is that you can get a cheap and good  at the same time. I have a nice Sony soundbar which I use for my home theater. I also have an older model Sony portable sound system that I use when I'm traveling. It does have a great sound quality and is very easy to use. It can also be connected to your television and sound bar.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************* I've had the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ for a little over a week now and I've been very impressed. I bought a Samsung Gear S3 as well as the Samsung Gear VR. Both have been a big hit with me. I have no regrets at all about getting the S8+. I'm very happy with it. The S8 is much lighter and has a much smaller footprint, I'm 5'8" and the S7 is 5.3". I'm also very happy that the S series is waterproof so I can take it in the pool or take it swimming. The software updates are also very good. The only issue I have is that the screen is too bright. If you are reading on the phone the brightness is so high that you can't read at all and you have to look at your watch for what you're reading. The Gear VR has no issues like this. I can still read but I do find it distracting when using it. Overall, I have had a great experience and I'll definitely be getting a Gear S4 when it's released. I'm pretty sure it will be the best phone ever!  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I have this thing for about 2 years now. I am a computer teacher in a public school, so I work with computers daily. The device is perfect for the job. It has worked well for me and the students. I like the fact that you can add music files on the fly. I think it's a great way to teach electronics and to be able to do this on the go is awesome. I have a computer at home that I use a lot, so this is a great addition to the school. I also like the way you can connect the sound to the screen. I'm glad I purchased this device.  Noise and power issues: ------------- When I first plugged this in, it was very noisy, like a car engine. I then found that the sound coming out of the speaker is not very loud at all. The sound is very low. I had to turn the sound down a bit on my laptop to even hear it. It would not let me play music out of my iPhone. After turning down the volume on my computer, it worked fine. I tried to use it to play some music, and the volume did not work. I ended up using my headphones to listen to the music. I did not even notice that the speaker was working, and that is because the sound from the speakers is very weak. I bought this because I thought that it would be good for my students to use. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ---------------------------  I purchased this to go with a Mac Pro I've been building myself. I've owned a couple of other Macs but the new one has to be the best looking. I'm happy that I purchased this because I use my PC every day, and I can get a Mac to do everything I want. This is my third Mac Pro and this is my favorite to date. The quality of the product is amazing and the interface is very easy to use. I bought the 32 GB because I have a bunch of music files on it already, and there is a lot of room in the case for all my other stuff. I use the included optical drive for a lot, but there is also room on the hard drive for more files if I have more. The only problem I have is that the power supply doesn't last long. It goes dead about 2 weeks in. I also have to use a case because the case is made of plastic and the fan is very loud. I would buy it again and I am very happy with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using the digital timer for about a year now and the quality is good, it's easy to use and the timer is a little hard to use but you get used to it pretty quick. i also like the fact that it has a low battery warning, which is handy when your on the go and the battery dies halfway through a workout. if you buy the digital you will save money compared to buying a regular timer. i'm a fan of the digital.  Rated 5 out of 5 by TofuMommy from Great little timer. Very versatile. I bought this about a month ago and so far I am very happy with it. I have been working out for a few years and the last couple of years I have gotten used to a timer, but it was difficult to keep track of time during a workout, especially when you are doing several rounds of various movements. With this timer, I can keep track and see how much time I have left and I love how much I can add.  to start a workout I use the start button to set a timer for 30 minutes. Once I hit that button, I just tap the screen to begin the workout. Once the timer starts I have a lot of flexibility. I can choose from 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, or any amount in between. The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I wish it had a more powerful motor. It takes a little while to get used, but once you get it right you'll notice how much better it is.

However, the lens does fit into the camera easily and has a very good focus. This is a must have for any GoPro user.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Great!  My girlfriend loves the device and is very happy with it. She had been looking for a way to have more control over her music, especially in the winter. She is also a big fan of the wireless feature, which is convenient and easy to set up. The only thing I wish it had was a little more battery life, but this is a minor complaint.  Works great, and I don't know if there's a downside...  It has some neat features and I would highly recommend it, if it works.   However, it's a little noisy, and not very powerful, so the battery is a little short.  . ,   The biggest issue I have with this is that I really can't hear the music that I'm listening to, and it's hard to play music on it at all. I can't get it to do anything.   and I really wish it could get a bit louder, because it's not very loud. . -The battery life is terrible.-The device is too big for my ears.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first foray into home brewing and I am pleased with the results. The instructions were simple, but I'm not sure how much more you can expect from a beginner kit like this. The only thing I'm unhappy about is that the brew temperature is hard to read. It is written in large letters on the side of the kettle. I got a great brew but the temp is hard for me to read, even when I put it under the hood of my temp controller.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ***************************** This is a great, portable electronic device. It has a few small faults, but they're not major ones, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's extremely small (for a portable), yet very powerful. I've been using it a few days now and I'm still very impressed. I can plug it into any outlet and have music playing without having to use my car stereo. The buttons are very responsive and I like how the volume button is a little bigger than the power button. Also, the USB port is very handy, and has been very reliable so far. The battery life has been good so far and I've got about 6 hours of use from a full charge. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to get that, but I'm hoping to get a few more. I don't have much interest in the interface, but that's really my only complaint about the device. If you're looking for a great portable, with a nice interface and lots of features, this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I have had the PCC since 2005 and I can honestly say it is by far the best quality, most durable and best value in an audio amplifier on the market today. This amp has been used in studios and on stage by everyone from the biggest names in rock and roll to Grammy nominated artists and top tier musicians. I have seen some very high end amps in the $100,000 range and they have been nothing but a disappointment. I own two of them. The first one was bought in the UK and I think that is what is known as a "Made in the USA" amp. The one I purchased here in Canada was a direct import, which I think is a little better. It's also a little larger than my previous amp and that is because it has been custom built here in Ontario, Canada. The sound is amazing, I am a professional sound engineer and I use this amp on my own productions and even my clients have been impressed with the quality. The best thing about the Pcc is it's low power consumption, its light weight and it has a built in headphone jack. I do not need to go to a separate headphone amp, this one is good enough. If you have a computer that has an integrated sound card, this will be your go to amp, but if you want a clean, low distortion amp to run off of your computer, then I would highly recommend this one. The PCC is well built and looks good too. It has the ability to handle virtually anything you throw at it and the built in volume controls will help you get the best out of your audio. It is so versatile, I have a small studio in a small house and this amp will power up to my computer, a turntable, and a couple of monitors for my main project. It also has the capability of running off of a single 9 volt battery and I don't even need to add any additional power to the system. I recommend the PCCC to anyone who is serious about recording and/or mixing, but wants the best value. I've owned 3 and I am sure I will purchase more in the future. It doesn't get any better than this!Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  I've been searching for a replacement to my old computer, and this unit is perfect for the price. I haven't had to do anything to it yet, so I'm sure that it'll last a long time. My main problem with this unit, and most electronic devices in general, is the quality of the wires. When you first turn on your computer, the connection between the power supply and the motherboard is loose. It's almost impossible to make a connection with a soldering iron, because the connection is so loose. If you're trying to get the computer to boot, you need to hold the power button and keep your finger on the "ON" button while you press the other "OFF" button. Once I got over that problem, I was able to get everything to work. I've had no problems at all with this device. It does exactly what I need it to do, and for the money, it's a great buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great buy! I was very skeptical of buying this product as I had not heard of it until my friend mentioned that he bought a different one from Amazon for his wife (the wife has a different voice) and that she had to have it. The price was good, and the box it came in was very well designed, so I felt pretty good about it. However, the voice recognition worked ok for a few hours, but then started having some problems. The voice recognition is not as good as I have heard it is in other products, and it would not recognize me even though I said my name several times. The problem got worse over a few days. I went to Amazon and got a new unit. The unit was the same except for the voice. It still didn't work, and had some more problems. I took the unit back, but Amazon refunded my money because they were very nice and told me that the unit had problems after a while. It was very disheartening that the product that I bought for my wife worked fine for a while, but was not reliable for my other family members, and now I have to buy a new one!

The "smart phone" is not a good phone, but it's better than my old "digital radio" (which was a bad phone, and no one in my family has had any problems with it).   This is a good device, I like the radio better, but I use this phone mostly for music and the news. I don't like the fact that it can only do so much, and that you have to have the radio on in order to listen to it. If the radio were better, or had some kind of internet capability, I'd be willing to pay more for it. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is that I don a lot of "smart phones" which I find much easier to use than this device.   My wife doesn't like my old radio very much because it's noisy. I do like my "smartphone" better, though.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great unit for the price. The unit is very well made, the audio quality is good and the unit has plenty of features for the money. The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because it lacks a USB input. Other than that, I would recommend this unit to anyone who has a laptop or desktop. I bought it to have a portable unit for when I'm on the road and want a nice portable speaker. This is the best portable stereo/amp combo I've ever used! The sound quality is excellent, it's small enough to fit in your pocket and it's quiet! You can have music playing for hours on end and you can also be on the move! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! Very nice, small and light stereo. The bass is decent and the mids are very clear. The highs are also good. A good product but the included mic needs to be replaced with a better one! This product is very good, however it has a lot of problems. 1. The mic quality is not as good as the speaker quality, but it's still a good buy. 2. The battery life is also really bad. The sound goes out after 4 hours, and I don't know what's the problem. 3. The USB input is very poor, the sound quality will be even worse if you plug it in. 4. The charger for the usb port is really poor, it has almost no power. The amp is great, but the USB input for the amp needs to come out. Overall a good product, but a good one should be a lot better. Nice little sound system that can handle just about anything. The main reason for the 5 star is the sound. It's very clean and detailed with a little bit of bass and highs. It doesn't sound muddy or weak like some other systems. I would definitely recommend this as a great portable system. Sound quality is very impressive. I love the sound of this little box! It's quiet, compact, and perfect for traveling. It has a great quality sound and is very easy to use. The included USB input works great with my computer and iPod. I have tried many portable sound systems over the years and I have to say this one is my favorite. Great product. Very quiet, portable and the audio is very clear I've been using this system for the last week and I am very happy with

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* My wife bought me the new Sony a6000 after I gave up on the a5000 and then my Nikon d300s. This is the best camera I have ever owned. I can get away with a lot more than I did with my d300, and the picture quality is superb. I am able to get good shots at all ISO levels with ease. The auto focus is fast and accurate and the viewfinder is bright. I was looking for a small camera to use with my Nikon D800 and was very pleased with the a6000. If I could give it 10 stars I would.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from A fantastic camera I love the a7 series cameras, but the a6300 is the perfect balance of size and performance. I got a Canon 60D for it's compactness, and it's high ISO performance. The only thing that bothers me about it is the auto focus, but at least it's consistent and quick enough to get your shot!  Great Camera! I bought this camera to replace my Nikon DSLR, which had become old and slow. The new Sony is very fast and responsive. It's so much better than my old Nikon. I just wish it was available in the UK. I think I have to buy a new one!  is the new a6330 the best for a new photographer? Is there anything that you'd recommend?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the Tvheadend and it was a great idea, I used it on my PC and it worked great. The only thing I would change is that there is no built in programmable buttons, I'd have loved to have had a way to go into my favorite movies and get a nice set of subtitles for the movies. Also I wish it had a built in DVI output, it's not a small screen but I don't have a TV and it's just not enough for me. I really like it and I would recommend it. Write a negative review about the product you bought:    I bought this tv, I didn't expect it to work well but I was very surprised, I tried it on the netflix, and it gave me a great video. I bought a lot of things over the years, but this is the first TV I have bought from a company that doesn't get it wrong. The first thing I did was read reviews and found this TV is good and I will get another one when they fix the second one. I like it, but it's too big for me:  I love this tv and it works great but it is a bit large and I can't use it at all on my dining room table, I also have a big family and it gets very uncomfortable. The sound is fine but I would like to have more buttons or something to program. The best tv for the price:  This tv is so much more than you would expect. You can watch movies from Netflix or Hulu, you can record a video and watch it later, and you can watch HD movies with it. The remote is very good. I can go into any video and select it with the remote. The box that came with the tv is not bad but I wish they had some sort of a DVD player built in. It's so nice to have a remote that you can use to watch movies.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Sony A6300 and love it. It has all the features you need and does not take up much room. It is well built and has great build quality. The battery life is very good. I use my Sony as a backup for my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and it's just as good as my Note.  The video quality is excellent, and the video files are just as you would expect from a good camera. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good image and a good sound. I love my Sony. Good device, not great:    I've owned a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Sony Xperia Z1 and I've never liked the way they fit into the hand.    Sony's A6320 fits my hand perfectly and is a joy to hold.    The phone has the size and weight of a modern flagship but feels just right in my hand. The device is also very thin and is easy to use one handed.  The A6340 is the only phone that can fit my hand comfortably.  Best Camera on the market:   I don't use the camera very often, but it is great to look at and see what's on the other side of the screen.  I'm very happy with the quality and I would never have bought this camera if it was not a flagship device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my ezeon for a year now and i have to say its a great portable device. it can charge my iphone and it is very durable. I have only used it a couple times but its been fine. the only con i can think of is the earbuds, they don't fit well. i dont like the sound quality though, but thats my only problem with it. overall great product.  Product Review: The ezeo is a good compact mp3 player for $50. I bought mine from Best Buy online. The ezi is small and light enough to take on the go. It has a great sound. I really like the music selection on this mp3 players. It's small enough to keep in a purse or bag, but big enough to have a good stereo. The battery life is very good. I am able to listen to music for hours. I'm a big fan of this player.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【I like it】 I bought this to use with my tablet PC. I use my computer to surf the web. It works very well.  The device itself is well made. The buttons are nice and responsive. The cable is a bit on the bulky side and I'm not a fan of the earbuds. They are a bit noisy. The interface is a little clunky at times, but overall it's not bad for the price.  "This thing is really, really good"   This thing has become my everyday computer. I have a Lenovo X220 with an Nvidia Tegra 3 processor. The Intel Atom Z3735F is a very good processor and I do enjoy playing games and browsing the web with it.   The Asus Xonar DS X7 is a really good tablet with decent performance. The touch screen is very responsive and the tablet is easy to use. The tablet has a good battery life, as it lasts for a full day without a charge.   the keyboard is also good, and the buttons are great to use (but the ear buds are annoying). the Xonars have a lot of extra features compared to the Asus X7, but the sound quality is worse. The only reason I bought the X7 over the Asus is the fact the Asus doesn't have a screen.   to summarize, I've bought the Asus because the battery life on the X220 is better than the Xeon, and I have an Nvidia tablet so I wanted to have both.  .  , I have no problems with this thing, I use it as my daily computer, with my Nvidia X7 tablet and it works just as good as my laptop.I bought this thing to use my tablet pc. I like to use the internet to surf, and use my laptop for some games and music. I bought it from a seller on eBay and I paid about $150 for it, which is more than the price of my computer.I'm not sure if the sound will be good with ear buds, but I like it and the touch screen seems very responsive.The device is well built, the buttons feel great, the cable is on the chunky side and doesn't fit well in my earbud, but it works.The interface is very clunky, and it takes a few tries to figure out how to do certain things. The speakers aren't bad, but they aren't great. The earbubs are a little

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikarus I have to admit that this is the first time I have purchased an electronic product from China. I am not an electronic engineer and this was my first time purchasing a product from a manufacturer. My expectations were very high, as I was a big fan of all the great products I had seen in the movies. When I received my package I was surprised with the quality of the products and I was very impressed by the packaging. It was extremely well packed and had everything I could have ever asked for. The item arrived very quickly. I did not have any issues with the unit and it was very easy to set up. The only issue that I had with the product was the fact that the unit had the old version of the software and the software had been upgraded to the new version of software. The new software did not function properly with my device, I have not figured out what caused the problem. I will continue to use the unit, but the software upgrade was a bummer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first real attempt at writing a review. I am using this as my main computer. The first thing I noticed is how small this thing is. I'm using a desktop machine with an HD. This is smaller, lighter, and has a better sound. I also love the fact that this can play music without me having to buy it. It also has a nice keyboard for typing. The software is great. I use the online programs (such as mpc). The only problem I have is the fact I can't do any word processing without having to use my macbook. The other thing that I'm not sure about is the size. I have a 15" MacBook Pro that is too big for me. I would like it smaller, but it's nice that I can still use it. I bought this because I like how cheap and easy it is to do a lot of things. It has not been able to keep up with the speed that I need, so I bought the pro version to get it to play music.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- A good, powerful, easy to use keyboard with very few moving parts. I like the fact that there are only two keys: "Enter" and "Delete". I've had a good experience with the keyboards from Logitech and I've got many of them. The keyboard is quite compact, so you can just drop it in your laptop bag. Also the keyboard is very responsive. The only thing that I don't like is that the keys don't click at all, only the sound. They are not loud. The sound is okay but not as good as the keyboard from Logiic. The case is a bit thick and there is a little bit of creaking, but it's still pretty sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone. Good buy!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- This was my first real electronic device. I love the idea. I bought this as an extension to my home stereo system. It allows me to have a small sound system with no more than an amp in the living room. This is my first purchase from a company, and it was very easy to use. My only criticism would be that there is no way to customize the color or the design of the unit. It just is. I like it!  Product Rating: 5 out of 5-stars.  Review ID: 2438  Reviewed: 2011-10-26 By:.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second unit. I bought a Sony a6000.  The quality of the camera is a huge upgrade over the a6000, but it's still very, very expensive.   I bought this camera because it's small, lightweight, has a good battery life, and has an excellent video capability.  It's been amazing to use.  The only drawback is the price.  If you're a first-time owner, I'd recommend that you wait for a sale.  Otherwise, I would suggest you get this camera.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________________________________________________ This is the first time I bought an eReader and I had a lot of doubts about the quality of this one but it is a great purchase. It came to me fast and in great condition, and everything works flawlessly. I had my doubts about it being a book reader and that it would not work with e-books, but it works very well with ebooks and the Kindle is very smooth. It works very fast, but I like that it doesn't have a lot for the price. It's a good book reader, but not my favorite, but still a great deal for the money. I have my doubts, though, about it not being a good digital device to read e-Books, but maybe I just need to use it for more than just reading books.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's the best.  A great product for the price.   I'm not sure if this is an "excellent" device, or an "awful" one.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the remote doesn't have any way to get you back into the video you're watching (unless you click on "next" and then press the power button for another few seconds), and the picture quality is not great.  Also, the software is quite laggy, especially when using a mouse or a trackpad.  There are a lot of issues with this device, and I'm not entirely sure if they're just the way they're made, or if they have a serious problem with the software or the hardware.  I would love to see the remote come with some kind of software that allows you to do some sort of auto-correct, or whatever.  If it was a good remote, this would be a perfect device.  But it isn't. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a wonderful little device that can be used to play games. It is very simple to use and has a nice size. The game I used it for was "Pac Man" and it played quite well. There is no joystick or buttons on the back. It can only be used with an arcade stick.   The only drawback I found was the plastic cover that came with it is very flimsy and falls off.   to fix it would require removing the plastic, taking a small nail and hammer and tapping the cover back into place. It took a while to fix and it does not come with the necessary tools. I would not recommend buying it if you have a cheap plastic cover for your games.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- This is my second unit of the same model. It's great! Very easy to set up. The only thing I do not like is the battery life. When I first got this unit I thought the battery would last forever. I bought it because I love my iPod, and this is my main source of music. After a month I went to use the phone app to make calls, and I could barely get through. The battery life is so short that I had to go to my car to charge it. I think it is the same problem as the last one, but I have had this one for a few weeks now and it has not let me down yet.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

The other great feature is the built in charger for your iPad or iPhone, so you don't have to lug around a portable charger and plug it into a wall outlet. I just plug the AC Adapter into my car battery to charge my iPod. I was a little disappointed that the charging cable was on the bottom, but you can just flip it up and it plugs right in.    Cons:   1) it's kind of hard to use. I mean if you want to use it you have to put the AC cord in the right way, but then you're trying to plug the USB cable into the unit, but the USB cord goes on top. You can't put it all the way down because you can't turn the unit on. The cable comes out on the right side.  the unit has a battery level indicator, but not sure if that's actually useful  2) if you plug in your headphones, you have the problem with the AC adaptor. it does not charge

It's not bulky or heavy but it does not make your head hurt.  with the new version I was a little bit worried that the volume level would drop. But that has not happened. The only issue is that the headset has to be mounted in a way that it will not be covered by your shirt. So the sound is a little louder than on the old model but you can't hear it. I also love the fact that it has a built in mic which is good when you want to talk with your friends but you are not in a noisy room. I would buy this again.  and I also really like the price. (Posted 9 /9/15.) in review I bought the HD 201. I've used it for about a week and it's been working great. I was worried about the battery life since the HD 202 has a rechargeable battery. The battery life on the 201 is about 10 hours longer than the 202.

I also bought it to use in my car for car radio listening. I was so surprised to find out it does more than just MP3. This is a very nice MP3 Player, with a built in tuner, and a built-in AM/FM stereo tuner. I would definitely buy this product again, I love the MP3 quality and sound. -------------- The only thing I didn't like about this product is the cord. It's too short. --------------- I just bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift, and I love it. It works well, and is a good price. I like the fact that it can be used in the car, and in the airplane. I highly recommend it. ------------ This product is great. I'm glad I bought it.

It works just fine, I like the built-in screen brightness and the touch screen and the built in speakers. The only thing that could be improved is a backlight, so you can see the screen when it's off, but the screen brightness is pretty high.  (Posted on 6/23/2018)  This is the best Android tablet ever! Review by JT  I bought this tablet because I needed a tablet that is portable and has a good screen. The screen is fantastic and it looks awesome in the dark. The tablet is so easy to use and has so much to do. It's not a very powerful device, so I bought the bluetooth keyboard to help with the typing, it's really helpful, I love the touch pad and the speakers are pretty good, they don't make as much noise as I would like but it's still good.

I love it and recommend it to anyone that wants a good looking, and portable tablet that works well with bluetooth. (PostedOn 6/18/2018)"  LOL Review by BK  The tablet is a great buy, but there is a huge flaw. The phone app is buggy. When I tried to call my mom, the app didn't recognize her name, and the phone said she was unavailable. I called again and the app said that she was available again. I couldn't even get through to her to tell her about the app. So after trying to call her several times I finally gave up. I'll probably never buy a Google tablet again. ,  (Posted On 6/10/2018"  Great Product Review by Jason  Excellent device! Works flawlessly!

The biggest problem with the tablet is the app for getting a new SIM card. I have not found a way to get a new one but that's a problem with google, not the tablet. So if you have the app
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this one for my computer because I was a little tired of having to use a mouse to operate a keyboard. I have two computers, a Lenovo G50 (laptop) and a Dell XPS 15 (notebook) and I found that the keyboard was quite a bit better on the laptop. The trackpad is okay, but not quite as good as the one on my laptop. It's a little flimsy though. I didn't like the fact that the device has a micro-usb port, but I understand why this was done because of the small size of the device. The only thing that I didn�t like about it was that it came with no instructions. That�s a huge bummer because I�m trying to learn how to use this device. I just wanted to give it a positive rating, but the only reason I give it 4/5 is because I like the keyboard and trackpad.

It works perfectly as a storage device and I can get all my pictures and videos onto it with no issues.  My only issue is that I'm only going to be using this for my documents for a little while, and I think I'm going to replace it with a more expensive model when I run out of room in my computer case.   Great value for the money!   I'm using my Epson 1450 as my primary printer and this thing works perfectly for that!  I don't really use it as a scanner but the resolution is very good and it's so easy to get pictures onto it!  This is a great little printer and it makes taking notes a breeze.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is awesome. I've always been a huge fan of Apple products and this is my first computer.  I've tried a lot of different laptops and I've been pretty disappointed in a lot.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a really great product. The only downside is that I don't know if it is battery friendly. The other reviews seem to suggest it is.

(Was this review helpful to you?)  Review of DJI Inspire 1: Â by Mark from LAS VEGAS NV USA . I had purchased the original Inspire. I was very pleased with the design and performance. The flight times were very good and I found it very easy to fly. The camera on the original was very good. I upgraded to the original and the only thing I would have liked to have had was the option to purchase a 4.5g to 5g adapter and a flight time timer. I think this is a very good product.

The original Inspirie is great, but this one is better. The battery life seems much longer, the video quality is great and the flight time is incredible.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the flight battery doesn't have a charge indicator.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:........................................... I have a new Apple Watch, and have to say that it's great. I've got a bit of a phobia about using my phone to call people, but this one is perfect for it. It has a super loud speaker, and an LED light on the side that lights up, so it's easy to see when I'm calling. The watch can do all the notifications on the phone, and the watch can handle phone calls, too, which I've been wanting. And the watch is waterproof. I love it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've used this to send and receive emails to family members for the past 3 years. It works great and is extremely reliable and does exactly what it is supposed to do. The only thing I don't like is the fact that there is no power button to turn it on or off. Write a negative review about an unsatisfactory electronic device :  This is a great product but not good for a couple of reasons. First, the screen is not very bright and not very clear. The pictures also are not very good, but that is just the screen. The battery lasts very little and the battery life is about 2.5 hours. The second thing is that the USB cable is very flimsy and does not have a nice quality feel to it. For a good product:    This is an excellent device. The picture quality is really good and the device is reliable and powerful. The price is also really good. I would buy this product again if I could find a better battery. If you are looking for an inexpensive way to send emails, this is a good device to consider. The screen is bright and clear and it has a good battery life.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a first timer in electronic gadgety stuff and this thing is amazing. It is very durable and is easy to use. The battery life is great too. The sound quality is very good. I was amazed at how small the thing is and how many apps it has. The only downside is the price though I can afford it and I don't mind paying the price as I am only in my teens. It works great. You can tell you are using a very high quality device. The price is right too. If you are looking for a good all around electronic gadget you can't go wrong with this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this with my kids and loved it. I use it to record the games that we play and the kids were really into it. It's a bit heavy and heavy to carry around, but worth the weight in my opinion. It took us about 2 hours to set up and set it up properly. There is a tiny LED light that can be activated and used to turn the lights on and off. My only complaint is the buttons are a bit mushy. The power button is not as easy to push as the other buttons on the back of the device. The only issue I have with the device is that it is too big for one kid. The other one is small and doesn't have the same size screen. A review of a cheap electronic device, but it is very useful for my little ones:  The product is awesome! It's great for recording games and recording their voice. I had my daughter using it as soon as she opened the package. I was expecting to receive something much more expensive and bulky. However, I did not expect to receive this thing for a price that was less than I expected. It is so easy to use, it has a nice light, and it's lightweight. This was my first electronic device and it has been a good experience. Thank you so much for a great product! I was not expecting this from you! I love the fact that you have included a case for it, as I have a daughter that is 4. The fact that it comes with the case was a bonus for me. I do wish you could include the battery in the box, but that's a minor gripe. If you have a family that likes to play board games or cards, then this is an awesome device! My kids really enjoyed playing the games on the screen and recording the voice. It was so much fun! I purchased this item because it has the possibility to record games or a person's voice. The audio quality is great! The price is great. The box is very easy to carry in. The device works great for my child's play time! Great product! The voice recorder works well and the battery lasts for several hours. My daughter uses it to play games with her friends. The voice is clear and clear. I would recommend it to others. This is an amazing device, it is super easy to put together, and has amazing audio quality! I'm a musician and my daughter was very
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the unit for over a month now. Its great if you are an avid gamer, but if you dont play games it can do most of the jobs for you. You can't beat the price. It works great and the batteries last a long time. I also bought a second battery for my cell phone because i needed it in a pinch. Its a great product if you want a gaming rig that will last for years.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ A friend gave me this item because she needed an easy way to control the TV, but without using the remote. I got this to turn the TV on and off, adjust the volume, change channels and set the audio on my receiver to the channel it was originally playing. Works great. The only issue I had was that it only took about 10 seconds to get it working after plugging it in. This is very handy for those who are new to electronics or just want to change the volume on their TV. If you have an Apple TV or similar, I would recommend this over it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used this for about a month. It has worked great, but it did take some time to get used to it.   I'm a big fan of the sound quality and soundstage of a good headphone. The sound was quite good for an early-2011 laptop, but I think the midrange and treble are a little too much. The bass was very good for the price point, and the soundstage is just right for playing games, but the sound is a little bit too boomy for my tastes.  This is a good portable device, but be prepared for a slight learning curve. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for about a year and it is so much better than any other e-cig i've used. ive tried all sorts of cheap e-cigs and ive found this one to be the best. if you're looking for a good e-cigarette, ive never been more satisfied with a device than with this one. its a must for anyone who likes electronic cigarettes!  good device, but i can't get the batteries to last as long as the others ive had.   This is a good product but its hard to get the battery life to last more than a few days.   to get a good battery you need to buy a different kind of battery and if you buy the right kind of batteries, this will last you a very long time.   and if it is a very good e cigarette but if you get tired of the flavor you get, you can just switch the batteries and get the same thing you would get with a cheap e cig but with a higher quality battery.  great e-smoke but dont like the taste i ordered this from cigalicious and was excited to get it as i like many of their products but was disappointed with the flavor. i have had this one for about 6 months and still have not received the flavor i was expecting but i will continue to order from them as the flavor is not what i expected  Great Product I really love this product and can't say enough good things about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's very nice to have a real mouse for the computer. It's really light and it moves very well. I used to have the IBM mouse, but now I've switched to this mouse. It has been a real improvement. I like the fact that you can't see the scroll bar on the side of the mouse. That's a good feature too.   If I were a gamer, I'd get this mouse as it has more features than the IBM one, including the ability to use a scroll wheel and it has a good weight to it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I've been a long time audiophile, and had a small set up of these speakers before. I had a good set up for a while, but the bass response was weak. After doing some research, I decided to buy the Infinity AVR3 to replace my Infinity A7s. I was a little nervous when I first opened the box because it looked very different from the A7, but once I got it home, I was able to play some music from my phone and I was very pleased with the results. I have a lot of friends who use the Infinity and they have the same experience. The bass is very nice, it doesn't distort at all. I've never had a problem with the sound quality before. The soundstage is pretty good, and you can really hear the music in the room, as opposed to a lot other speakers that I've owned, which don't do that. I like it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading my setup.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my favorite keyboard. I have tried a lot of keyboards. This one is easy to type on and the keyboard is very light. I really like it. I use a wireless keyboard on my laptop. The problem is that it doesn't have any macros. That is the only thing I do on my keyboard. But this one has a nice layout for the whole keyboard and the macro keys are nice and easy to use. I don't like the fact that the software is a bit buggy. Sometimes it just doesn't work and you have to use the keyboard to fix it. The battery life is good. I always have a lot on my USB charger so that's great. It doesn't last as long as my laptop but I'm always using it and I have a laptop so I'm used to it. This is the best keyboard I've used and the best price on the market for a good keyboard. Buy it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________  I have been using my Sony Walkman XS2 for over 6 months now. I love it! It is so much more than a MP3 player. The features are really great, I can play and listen to all types of music, and it has a lot of useful features such as voice memo and song info, as well as a very good remote. I've tried the iPod nano, and the Sony Walkmans in the past, but this one is by far my favorite. The battery life is also great and has a long play time. I don't like using my phone as a remote, but the Walkmans remote is pretty good. I'm so happy with it that I've purchased a second one, and have the same one in my car.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! It's very good. This is my second time using this product. The first one lasted for more than 3 years. I just purchased another one because I don't want to pay for another one. The new one is just as good, and it has a longer battery life.  Rated 5 out of 5 by MRS from Amazing quality I have had a Sennheiser HD-650 for several years and I have always been impressed with its performance. It has always performed as it should. However, I have to say that the Senn hei-hosers have gotten a bit long in the tooth, so I decided to upgrade. I ordered the HD-800 and I am glad I did. It is a very impressive product, but I think I will have to get another one to keep up with my old one.  and now I can listen to my old Senn HE 1s with no sound distortion! It's so good. I am going to buy another one for my son. I wish they would make a similar device for my HD-802, but it seems they have all but abandoned it.  of course I would buy the HD800. I have the HD600, the HD700 and the HD1000. I can not tell you how much I love all of them.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very happy with the sound quality and the volume control is nice. The only thing that I wish is that the buttons are easier to use because I can't remember them all at the same time.

Did you find this helpful? 2 of 2 Found Helpful  Sawyer from San Francisco CA USA  I use this on a Yamaha, it works well with my keyboard and microphone combo. The one downside is the volume knob on the device is a little flimsy. I think it's good to have the volume level control. I also wish it came with a manual.  a couple things that could be improved...the manual does not include the USB cable and it has a different connector than the other products in the Yamaha line. Also, the volume settings can be hard to find in the manual. The manual is hard to read, and the directions on the USB port are very hard to understand. - I bought a used Yamaha VX-6 keyboard to use this with and it's a much better product. The sound quality is good, the control is good and it takes up less space on the desk. The buttons and switches are all labeled and easy to understand and the power switch is easy to operate.  the volume adjustment on the unit is just a little off. You can adjust the level of the sound by turning the knob to the left or right. but when you turn it to the right the volume goes down. the volume controls are a little hard to figure out if you don't know how to adjust them and it is a pain in the butt to
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone4s  by ken  i bought the phone for a christmas present. my dad has been wanting an iphono for a long time. but i had no idea that this thing is going to be so good. i got it at a local store and it was so simple to set up. and when i plugged in the mains it turned out to be quite a loud speaker. i did have to turn off the volume when i was working at home. the only thing i have to complain about is the size of the phone, the case is a bit too big for me. also, the only good thing i can say about this phone is that you don't have to have a computer to use it. if you are a student like me and have the internet you don''t need a computer. this phone can be used for texting, facebook and a lot more. and the phone is so much better than my old phone that i won''t be looking back. if there is any problem with this phone i''ll be sure to write about it in a review.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have purchased the new Kobo e-reader for the last couple of weeks. It is a great device, very easy to use and the design is really good. I like that I can use the touch screen and the digital menu to select which books to read. It does not come with any of the accessories that some of the other devices do but this is a good thing as it is easy to carry around with me in a small bag. The only issue I have is that the batteries last a little longer than I would like. This could be because of the light being a little dimmer than I like or maybe because I have had some problems with the screen. I would highly recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a good, compact device to use on the go.

I've only had it for about a week but I've been using it as my primary laptop and it is just perfect. It works perfectly with my iMac and it's just a wonderful piece of hardware..........................................I've tried all sorts of things in the last few years to get a laptop or a tablet that does the job and have always failed miserably. This is not only the best iMac, but it's the best computer I have ever used in my life. The iMac is a beautiful machine that runs like a dream and it comes with tons of free software and a ton of apps that will make you a better developer.........................................................................I have had my iBook for about 6 months now. I really liked the look and feel of it. I was looking for a portable Mac, so I chose this one over the other two I had. I also like the fact that the computer is light and easy to carry around. I just like the iBook's design. The only thing that could make this better would be to add a hard drive, but that is easily accomplished by simply unplugging it and then plugging it back in.................................. I was on the fence about buying this. The price is right, but I am a little disappointed. I got it and it looked good, but the screen had some light bleed and I noticed that the speakers didn't work very well. I put the iMac in sleep mode and then put it back to sleep. The screen woke up and then I could hear music from the speaker, but there was no sound coming from the speakers. So, I tried to reboot and the screen went black. When I tried turning it back on, it did not come back on. I had to put it into sleep mode again. I decided to return it. .........................................................................I am a bit new to Apple products and I have been trying to figure out which one is the best. I have a Macbook Pro and have been having a problem with it. It is too slow for me to do my daily work. I use Adobe Creative Cloud to get my work done, but sometimes it just won't come up on my computer. This computer, while not a "desktop" machine, is much faster than the Macbook and has a better screen. It also has an iSight camera which is awesome.

I'm a big fan of using my phone for email, social media, web browsing and general stuff, so I don't need a huge keyboard, but the size and flexibility is great for my purposes. Also, I'm glad that the battery is not replaceable like a laptop keyboard, since my phone is almost always charging. I just need the extra battery for my phone and tablet.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- It's a great little device, the price is right, and the performance is outstanding. I have had it for a week and I haven't had a single problem. I was so excited when it came in the mail. It's very portable, the battery lasts all day, and I love that I can take it on the go. My only complaint is that the battery is tiny and it's difficult to get to recharge when I want to charge it. That being said, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. --------------- I have been using a Bose speaker system for years now and have finally decided to purchase a Sonos system. I love the sound of Sonos. I am so pleased with the purchase and will recommend this product to everyone I know. I'm giving it a 4.5 stars because I would like to see a better battery life. The sound quality is still excellent. ------------- I have used Sonos for years and was hesitant about purchasing this system. After receiving my Sonos setup, I am in love! I have a large living room with lots of TVs. I wanted a system that would give me a sound experience that is so rich, I could hear all the details in all the action. This Sonos is absolutely amazing! I'm so glad I finally bought it. It has been so nice to just relax, listen to music and not worry about the little things. It is easy to set up, and has all the audio controls you could need. I don't know if it is the sound quality, but I have never heard a more natural sound out of any system I've ever owned. I wish it had a little more battery life, but overall I am thrilled with my purchase. I also like the fact that I don`t have to keep buying new speakers. I`m a little disappointed that the Sonos doesn't come with a remote control, but that is something I can always add later. The best part about the Sonotubes is how good it is in comparison to any other audio system I have ever owned in my living room. The price is still a little high, but you get what you pay for. If I ever need to purchase another system, I will be buying another Sonos and then another one for my bedroom. ------------ I have only had my system a week but so far I love it. I've already made a huge improvement in my home theater setup with the Sonobox and the Son

The price is a little high for a computer but you get what you pay for and the warranty was very quick. I'm glad I found this site!  to  "Good value"  reviewer - 9-3-2018 - I am pleased with the performance of this system, I am a heavy user on Windows and a moderate user on Mac. The Mac version has a better user interface and works faster than my Windows computer. Overall a good value! ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my new favorite toy. I bought this for my G-spot. I was pleasantly surprised that it's more like a plug than a dildo. It's really easy to clean, has a soft silicone head, and I can easily get some lube on the head if I want to be really g-spot-y. I have used it in different ways, and for me, I prefer to use it as a plug and in my butt, rather than in my vagina. I'd recommend this to a friend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!  I bought this for my husband as he can't seem to get a decent signal. He likes the fact that it is a wireless and he can talk on the phone. He does not like the fact he has to put the device in a charger for every session. It would be nice if the cord was less than 5 feet long. I can get 5 or 6 hours from one charge. The remote has a few button controls which he doesn't use. But this device works. If you are looking for a wireless that you can use with a cellular phone, this is a good one. The only downside is that it has a very short cord.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I have a Kogan eGo-C in a size smaller than my eGo One. It's the perfect size to get the most out of the eGo. I love the large eGo battery and the new 510 design makes it easier to use the e-cig in a pocket or purse. I'm a big fan of Kogan and this product is a good example of their commitment to innovation.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________  I bought the ROK-5s because I wanted to upgrade from my old "Vintage" ROK. I bought this one as a backup for my ROK 5. The sound is a lot more punchy and clear than the V5, and it's much easier to control the volume with the volume knob. I like the sound of the Rok-5 and I wish I had gotten one of these a long time ago. ________________________________________________________________________________  Great upgrade. Good build quality. I upgraded from a cheap Rok, this one is nicer. Nice sound quality. You can adjust the volume in the front to fine tune the sound for different rooms. ________________________________________________ . I just got this one and it is very good. The controls are very good for the price. The volume knob is not as tight as the RK5, but it is a much better upgrade than the R2-RK5 combo. _________________  is a very good product. I have been buying from them for a while now, I have bought two of the "2-10" and the sound is just awesome. I use my "2" with the built in headphone amplifier, and the volume control is a big plus. I would recommend to anyone who wants a great headphone with a little sound upgrade and price. ______________________________  i love this thing. It sounds great! and the amp is a good feature as well.  __________________  Nice, clear, punchy sound. This is my third one and all of them sound amazing! I'm using them with the included amp, but if you don't have it you can also use your own amp with the controls on the back of the unit. _________
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The phone works great. I was looking for a portable phone for when I was out and about. This phone works just as well as a cell phone. I use it for calls and internet. It does not make calls from my phone which is a drawback, but I like to keep my cell phone on me for calls. The internet works fine and I like the ability to control the sound from the phone. The only thing I do not like about this phone is the lack of a USB port. I can't find one on the bottom of the phone so I have to use the headphone jack for that. Overall, this phone works well and is a good value for the money. I would definitely recommend this phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is an amazing device, and is so easy to use. It does what it is supposed to do. It is easy to install, the buttons are very easy to access, and there are no dead zones. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device :  This is a very good product. It can't be beat. It has a good screen and can be adjusted to fit the user. However, there are several problems: 1) The software is a bit complicated, and it can take some time to install. 2) The wireless range is a little lacking, so I can only use it in the kitchen. 3) The buttons are a bit hard to press. 4) The remote is very difficult to use, and I would not recommend it for anyone with small hands. 5) I wish the screen would be bigger. 6) There is a small bug with the remote, where the buttons aren't as precise as they should be. I hope that the remote can be improved with a little more time and money. Overall, I really like this product, and would recommend it to anyone. I also want to point out that there are many other options on the market that are much better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I bought a new iPod Touch and love it! The sound is just right. I use it in a car, with a pair of headphones, and with a big monitor and music player on the living room wall. I also use it at work as a music player, as a speaker, and to play movies, and it's just fine. It's also a very handy thing to have with me, when I go for walks, because it's portable and I don't have to take my phone.  Great little headphone. Not for audiophiles, but for the average Joe or Joe who wants a portable headphone. . It is small enough to take anywhere. It has a good sound. The best thing about it is that it has a volume dial, so you can turn it down to where you don't hear any distortion. It also has a little rechargeable battery that can last for over 3 hours of music.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* It is the best device for my needs ******** This is the first time I buy an electronic device, but I am very satisfied with this one, it has many features which can help me. I have a laptop that has a hard drive and an external hard drive which can take up to 50 gb of data and I use it for photo, movies, music, pdf files and many other things. I had to make a decision between this and the external hard disk, it was cheaper but I found it not reliable and it has problems with the drive sometimes getting too slow and I had a lot of problems. I like this one because it is compact and can hold more data, I recommend this to everyone. Thanks ********  Write a negative review about the worst product ever: ************** I purchased this device because I have very little space on my computer and I am in the process of moving to a new place. The first problem I had is that it does not allow me to boot to the OS, when I tried to boot the second time it booted to Windows 8 which took up a lot more space than the original drive. The device also has the problem of not giving me any space to move the files and data. The third problem is that the USB port has been dead for weeks now, it will not read any data from the device and I have called several tech support centers and all of them have said the same thing. This device is horrible and should be completely destroyed.  Submit a review $0.00
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________  I'm using this thing a lot for video and the sound quality is just great. I have to say I am very impressed with the price for the quality of the unit. It is small and very portable and has the ability to record and play back all kinds of formats like the DVD format. It has the feature of auto power off but I have not used that yet. The remote control works great for the most part and the unit is well built and very small. I can use this thing to play with my kids and it records just fine. It's great to have this on my desk and it will be great for my friends who have to use their laptops for work but still want to have a portable system. Thanks!  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** This is the first time I use a computer. I'm so glad that I bought this computer. My first computer was an Apple IIe. I could not believe the lack of a mouse. I thought the computer would have a mouse, but I thought I was just too lazy to buy a mouse for it. The mouse works fine and I was able to download an app on my phone, but that app is for the iphone. So I was trying to find a PC, and the Apple IIes was getting old, so I bought the PC. The PC came with a CD player, so there was no need to buy another. I love the screen. The keyboard is great. I bought a USB mouse and it works great. The only problem I have is that the mouse has to be plugged in before the computer starts. I can't change settings from my phone because it takes a few minutes. The power supply is not very good. The USB port on my computer is only for my phone. The cable is a little hard to find. The software that comes with the computer is terrible. It does not have any programs. I am so glad I found this site because I love this computer and can't wait to get back to work on my iPhone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from Works like a charm. I've had an Apple laptop for more than a decade and it's always seemed to get a little slow or have software glitches. So when I picked this up, I was amazed at how much I liked it. This has more than held up. I use my MacBook Air as my main computer, but this works great for a home user and it fits perfectly in my bag when I travel. The screen is bright, the keyboard is comfortable, and it has great battery life. I have yet to find an app that doesn't work, even with my iPhone 5. I don't have any real complaints about the build quality or design, and I'm happy with the software, too.

Write a negative review about an unsatisfactory electronic device :  It came with no instructions or a plug, I am a tech and this is unacceptable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love the fact that the device is rechargeable. The battery lasts a good 4 hours on a single charge.  It's good for about 2 hours a day if you're always in a hurry.  This is a good device.    The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's not really the best when it comes to wireless music streaming.  I've had my iphone for about a year and I find myself wanting to download more music than I already have.  It's not bad when you get an iPhone, it just doesn't compare to an iphones capabilities when it's set up properly.

The best USB keyboard I've ever had I purchased the Logitech USB wireless keyboard for my iPhone 5s as I was going to buy an iPad Air 2 but found out that I would have to wait until the next generation. I was a bit concerned that the iPad Air would have the same keyboard. But then I opened the box and saw that this keyboard was exactly like the iPad, only bigger. The key feel is excellent and I find the keys to be very responsive. The size and the design are very nice and I highly recommend this keyboard. I've used it almost every day for the past 3 months and I love it.  Fantastic keyboard! I'm a fan of Logitech products so when I got this keyboard I was excited to see it had USB connectivity and I can use my iPad in the background while I type. The keyboard is perfect for my needs. The keys feel very firm and are backlit so I can see the keys at night. I would highly recommend!  of the best I've had I love the fact that it has Bluetooth connectivity and a larger keyboard. It has a nice and large screen for typing and the keys are very responsive! I use my keyboard all day at work and when I'm away at the weekend I use it for gaming. I love my new keyboard and I'm very pleased with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought this as a gift for my friends wife. She is always complaining about how she wants to go back to the old way of doing things and the old TV was always a big problem. But now the ikea has done it for her. It is very easy to set up and works well. the only thing i would like to see is a way to get the remote control to work without the battery. I bought a different one and it does the job. I think this ikeA will last me a while.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from It's been a while but this thing is still working and looks good. It's pretty simple, but does the task of controlling my tv. The only problem I have is it can be hard to connect to the wi-fi. I have tried everything from resetting the router and going through a manual setup. Nothing worked. I was able to get it to work with my new wireless router though. It would be nice to see the menu to go to the tv set. The set is not that big but you have to be able to reach it without touching it.

I had to buy an adapter. I would never recommend this product to anyone, but if you are looking for a simple portable charger that will work and last, I think you will like it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________________________________________________ (I bought this to replace an old one, and I am very pleased with this one.) I bought this for a portable and portable only. The first thing that struck me was how lightweight and small this thing is. The back is nice and hard to bend. It's very easy to slide in your pocket and take anywhere. I got a lot of use out of this one. The only thing I don't like is the button that controls the volume. I have a lot more volume buttons on my phone, so it's not a big deal, but I just prefer the touch-based interface that is built into Android. The other thing is that you need to hold down the back button on the phone for a few seconds to get to the menu, and then you can swipe left or right to change the channel. I like this better than the old one. I also like the fact that the headphones come out the front of the phone, rather than being on the back. __________________________________________________________________________ (I think this is a good device, but for a little more money, I'd buy the Moto X Play instead.) I have an LG G4, which has a better display and battery life than the Note 8. However, I love the simplicity of the Note. It is not complicated, but it does do everything you need it to do. For me, the one issue with the Note is the camera. It has decent photos, but not amazing ones. The phone is also too heavy, and is also not a pocketable device. However...the Note 8 has the best camera out of any device I have owned. It shoots better than any smartphone I've owned. The screen is also better than I expected. I had a few issues with the battery life, but that was probably because of the size and weight. I haven't had a chance to use this device in a long time, but my expectations were not that high. I've used the phone sporadically, and it seems to be a good choice. ___________________________________________ (this is a very good phone, I'm glad I got this one) I have the samsung galaxy s7 edge and the phone is just amazing. I bought it to replace my old one and I love it, it's so thin and light. I think it's a very very good choice, I have had this phone for 2 weeks now and I can't really find any negative things to say about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  this is a very well made and very good device. It works great for its purpose. I have a cheapo radio with a low quality tuner, and the D-Star worked like a charm.  I like to have my music and music stations on hand so I can listen to the radio or my mp3 players. ive also used a iphone, iphones, ipods and ds sound and this is great.    The D-star  is a little bit pricy for the quality, but I feel its worth it.  Thank you for this product and the excellent customer service you provided. A little bit expensive but it works well.  The device works well with an old stereo and the stereo has a nice sound. The remote control is nice. The receiver is not as strong as my last one but it is a decent receiver for the price.  I love this thing!  I've had my D-STAR for a few months now and it works great with my iPod.  I'm listening to a little rock and roll and I don't need a big radio, but it's a great addition to my home.  When I need to listen to a news channel, I put the DST-7 in and I'm happy.  It's a good, cheap, portable radio for my needs.

Review of DJI Inspire 1 Professional Quadcopter: A Review I've been using DJI products for quite a while now. I love the Inspire One, but I have been disappointed in the other products they make for the same price. DJI released the Inspiron 15 in June, 2014. I just received my new Inspire 2 in the mail today and have been loving it. As a professional photographer, I take photos and videos at every opportunity. The Inspire is a very capable platform and I have had good results from it. It's small, sleek, and easy to carry around. I'm using it to film a documentary video and it's really working well. The video has been shot with my iPhone 5 and the quality is very nice. The flight time is fast. My only complaint is that the battery is very short. It will last from 10 to 15 minutes. It would be nice to have a larger battery. Also, the remote is a little slow and I wish there was a way to connect a USB cord. The battery is not very deep and it can get pretty hot when you are using it. But overall, this is a great product and I will be purchasing more for other projects.  and here's a video of it in action:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG4Qxr2dHc8  Here's a little bit about me: I am a professional digital photographer in Northern California. I have always been an "old school" photographer, using a Hasselblad 500C for 35mm photography and a Nikon F2 for medium format. I recently started using DJIs Phantom 4 Pro as a drone, and love it. The Phantom 4 was a very good value. I do a lot of video, including documentaries, so I needed a good remote control. I was not able to find a good one on the market, so after looking at several, I decided on the DJI. The quality of the

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I just bought this one because it was a free gift for a friend who just got a new laptop and I thought it might be good. It's really good. I like the fact that it has a remote control so I can control the lights from my laptop. I also like the lighted display which is very useful. It also has a nice wireless antenna so that you can connect the unit to any other device without any wires. I don't know what the pros and cons are, but overall I like it a lot.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I am in love with this thing!! It was the only thing I needed to listen to music without having to pay a ton of money to listen on my hi-fi system. I have my car stereo and it's really loud, but my MP3 player only has about 8-10 songs. I bought this device and it has so many great songs, and I can play them off my phone so I can listen to them while driving. I am very satisfied with this purchase. It has everything I wanted and it was inexpensive as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using my iMac G5 for about 2 weeks now, and I am extremely happy with it. I love the iMac, but this is the perfect computer for me. The iMac has so much power, and the i7 processor is really the icing on the cake. The only thing that I do not like is that the keyboard is a little hard to type on, but I can adjust it a little to make it a bit more comfortable. The display is nice and bright. The speakers are very loud, and can really pump out the music. The battery life is very good, and my battery is now nearly completely dead. The software is easy to use, and easy to learn. I highly recommend this iMac to any computer enthusiast.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great unit,  especially if you are using a digital camera or a camcorder and are worried about being exposed to the bright lights from a bright strobe light.  The lights can be adjusted to get you in the perfect shot!  You can easily see your shadow on the camera.   Great product!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!  The only drawback to this product is that the sound quality of this is terrible. The bass is weak and the treble is almost gone. I'm getting a lot of subsonic sounds from this thing. I would give it a 1 star for sound quality only. But that's a small price to pay for a really nice product.  I purchased the P5X3 for use with a Yamaha XS7. I was very pleased with the ease of use and the sound and the quality of the sound is so much better than the P6X6. I highly recommend this product and the P3X3  Great sound. I bought this amp and it sounds awesome. I use it in my house and my girlfriend bought it for her guitar. The sound is awesome and the amp is a very nice design. The only problem I had was the power supply was not built very well. The wire is not very durable and if you try to bend it, it will bend back in. The next time I will try to get better quality wire.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is a great device. It works and you can use it for hours and hours. The only issue I have with it is it is hard to get on/off. It would have been great if it could have been a little easier to pull off. Also, you can't take it off while in sleep mode, which can be a problem if you have a sleeping baby in the crib. Overall a good buy for the money.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this for about 2 years now and it has become my primary ipod speaker. the sound quality is superb and the speaker is a lot bigger than i expected, it has a great soundstage and its just a great unit. i dont use it much for music but when i do i dont miss the mic on my ipod. i use it on my mp3 player and on my phone to listen to podcasts and i have no complaints about it. i recommend this product to anyone who has an ipod or any mp3 players.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from The best sound quality in a portable device ever! The Bose QuietComfort 25 is a great addition to the Bose line of products. The device comes with a very nice case and is compact enough to fit in my bag. The volume and quality of sound is great and the soundstage is extremely wide. The headphones are a little hard to attach but easy to remove. I've had a few issues with the remote, but they are easy to fix and they sound fine. If you have a good music player and you're looking for something more compact, this is a good option.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________ I really enjoyed my purchase of this product. It's so much better than the original, and I will probably replace it with the same one. Great sound quality, even through my laptop speakers, which I bought a few years ago for the sound quality. Very happy with the purchase, and my husband agrees. I'll be ordering another one.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was excited about the price of the XB270H. It's the first monitor I own with a USB hub built-in, and it has a decent sized screen. It has the image quality that you'd expect from a high end IPS panel, but it's a very good screen. The picture is vibrant, clear, and vibrant. This is a good screen for the money. I'd buy one again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned this phone for a year and it still works like a champ  I have to say this is a great phone and its a great price for it. I was worried it wouldn't be good because of my older one, but it works fine and is very fast. If you're looking for a phone with great audio quality, great camera and good battery life, this is the phone for you.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, January 21, 2010  good device, great price  by John from Los Angeles CA USA  Pros: good battery, fast and smooth phone  Cons: not as good as the one in my pocket, not as well made.  and no flash  Review: I've had my Sony Ericsson ZX-5 for about a year now and it has served me well. I find that it is better than my old phone (which was my old Sony Eric's, but I had to buy the phone new from Verizon, as it came with a different SIM). The battery is very good and I have yet to run it out of power. The only thing I would change is a flash.  of course, I would also like a case that will protect the camera, as well as an SD card slot for some extra storage, which I'm sure a lot of people who have these phones don't have. The phone does come with a little rubber case that protects the camera and it looks good.  the flash is a nice option for those times when you don't want to bother with a flash, but the fact is, there is nothing better than the flash in a camera, and that is what the flash on this phone is all about. the only downside to this phone though is that there is no camera button, so you have to use the camera on the front of the phone, but that is pretty minor. I would recommend this phone to any Sony Ericber that wants a phone that can keep up with a big brother in terms of features. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________  I just bought this device. It's a great device. The best of its kind. I like that I can see what I'm doing in the background and how the device is behaving.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from Best of the Best. I purchased this a couple of months ago and it is a dream. I use it on my iPad and the graphics and the animations are fantastic. The screen is very bright and clear. I have a Macbook Air and a Surface Pro 3 and this is my best choice. . I am an avid music lover, and I use a lot of digital music on my desktop. The iPad does not let me listen to the music on the computer with my speakers, it just gives the music to the iPad. The sound is not that great, but if I were to buy another iPad or other digital music player it would be this one. It does not require an external amplifier, which I really appreciate. I recommend this device to all. The only thing I don't like is the way that the volume buttons work on this device, they don't do anything when the device isn't plugged in and they do nothing when the music is on. Other than that, this is a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  I use my ipod daily and have never found anything better. I use it in my studio and I just want to say that I'm very happy with the ipod. The only problem I have is that it only comes in one color and it's white, but I love the look and I don't care about that at all. I just hope that they will get a black one soon so I can give it 5 stars.  5 out of 5 Good Product I'm happy with this product and it looks good in my office  3 out of 4 stars I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I'm pleased with the product and my sound quality. I wish the color of the ear buds was more black though. :)  2 out of 3 stars I purchased this product a few days ago and I have had a hard time using it. The sound quality is not very good. I'm having a hard-time getting the volume and clarity of the sound right. I do not know why this product is discontinued. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a cheap and very simple wireless speaker that was very loud and it worked well with my iPhone. I also like the battery life. Write a negative review about an average electronic device (I was not a fan):  The speaker was terrible and would only work with my iphone. The only reason I bought this was because I was on a limited budget and wanted to have a wireless speaker. If you like the idea of a wireless stereo, the sound is a bit weak but is still usable. The sound quality is not good and the volume is not great but still good. The speaker is very cheap but the sound quality really isn't bad. The cord is not that long so I had to take it down several times to charge the battery. I did use the speaker once and it was the same as my phone speaker and the sound was the worst. The battery is not rechargeable so I wouldn't recommend this speaker to people who don't have a good phone. I wouldn´t recommend it for anyone who needs an iPhone speaker and a cheap wireless speaker at the same time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just bought my new HP Omen laptop, and i am really pleased with it. It's fast, the screen is bright and crisp, and the keyboard is very responsive. I love the fact that you can change the keyboard to any other keyboard, as i bought the keyboard for my old HP Laptop. The battery life is great, too. I bought it for the purpose of doing web work on my PC, and its really good. I hope the battery will last as long as the old one did. Overall i'm very satisfied with this product, and would recommend it to any PC user.

Was This Review Helpful- July 14, 2015  Good  By JEANNE G from New Orleans, LA USA  be sure to check the user guide for details on setting up the remote  It was good. A little difficult to set up. . I tried to connect to my home Wi-Fi but I couldn't get it to work. I found a user manual on line that shows that if you connect to your Wi-fi it should work. If it didn't work it should be a user error.  (I've had a number of remote problems, so I have a good head start on this one)  Be sure to make sure you have the latest software version of your phone or computer.  "Beware of "security updates". You should have received the latest update, but then the phone will automatically re-install it after the phone rebootes. So it is important to do a backup before doing a firmware update. The phone should have the same software version as your computer. "  If you have issues with your remote setting up then just check the manual that comes with the device and see if the instructions are followed.  I tried this remote on my computer and phone but couldn't connect to the Wi-FI. So I downloaded the update for my computer. I got the software installed and then the problem was gone. If you have any issues please post a comment and we will do our best to help you. , I will have to update my review.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I am very satisfied with this product. The light is bright, the buttons are easy to press, and the screen has no flaking or screen-door effect. The volume control has a lot of reach, and I love that I can adjust the volume with one hand. It is an extremely portable device, and very easy to use. I am using it as my main computer for my hobby, which I have been doing for years with a very old computer. I'm sure it will serve me well for many years. If I had one nitpick about this device, it is the fact that it has a very annoying and obnoxious sound when you use the volume control. This is annoying when you are using it to listen to music or video. I have heard other people complain about this sound, but I'm glad to have a good one now. I would recommend this device to anyone who is interested in a portable computer.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a great tool for my practice. I have had this for about a year now and it is very simple to use and work with. I can find a specific problem, then a simple solution to that problem, but the other issues I have are easily solved. I really like the way I can set the different types of tones, and also the way it gives me the information I need at the right time.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device (but still excellent):  The problem I have with the electronic device is that it is so easy to set up, yet is so difficult to use. I like to have my problem or problem area covered, but when I have to change the settings, I can't get it to work right.  a must buy, but buy it at the beginning of your practice:  My favorite thing about the K-Lite X-Ray is how easy it is to use, but that's not what I really love about it. It's the fact that it can cover so many different areas of my practice, and is so flexible and easy to change. It covers so many areas, from muscle tension to pain to muscle fatigue. If I ever need to change anything on my system, I just plug it in, plug it back in, and start practicing again. I love the fact it's so easy and flexible, I love that I can easily change the tone settings on it. I also love the way you can set up different levels of tones. I haven't used a device like this in over a year, but it's still one of my favorites and a great value.

This review is from: N3 - 4K - 10-bit Video Camera  Overall Rating: Good camera. The video quality of the N is very high, although there are some video clips that don't do the N justice.   Video: The video is very nice. I haven't seen the full HD, but I think that the video is good enough for the price.   and the auto focus is very quick.     Build Quality: It's very light, but sturdy. It's not heavy and doesn't feel cheap, but the camera feels a bit cheap in comparison to the A5000 that is only $400 more.  , and I bought a P3000, and although the build quality of both is good, the N stands out in a way the P3000 doesn't.  . It comes with a full kit with the lens and two ND filters. You can also buy the lens in black, which is a nice touch. The ND filter is a little too dark to use, but it's still better

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I am an early adopter of this product, but it has worked flawlessly for the last three years. I was a little skeptical about this device as the first one I tried was faulty, but the replacement worked flawantly as well. The noise of the fan is very low. The USB port is not large, but I don't use my computer much so I can deal with that. The device itself is easy to use and comes with a usb cable, which is a plus. I highly recommend this product!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item on sale from a local electronic store. The price is really reasonable for the product. The unit is easy to assemble and use. The built in speakers are great. The sound quality is excellent. The USB input and the stereo headphone jack are also great features. It takes only a few minutes to install. I have yet to try out the MP3 capabilities, but I will update the review when I do. I can't say enough good things about this product. If you're looking for an affordable computer to play music from, then look no further. This product is a good value.

It's very fast and has lots of games. It does have a few problems, but not a lot. I've only had it for a month, but so far I like it very much.   to add to the review:  . The computer runs on two batteries and the two batteries are charged separately.   is this computer worth the price? It depends on what you're looking for. If you're more interested in gaming, then yes, it's a good value.  , you'll get the best performance out of the computer. if you want a good gaming computer, this isn't the computer for you.   was this computer a good buy?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  I got this for Christmas last year, but I've been using it ever since. It works perfectly. I've tried to get the wireless feature to work on my iPhone but I can't seem to get it to work. It just hangs up and says it cannot connect to the iPhone. I have tried to change the channel on my router to the one I'm using for my tv, and I tried using a different cable to my tv and it works, but the issue persists. I can just get the wifi to work, but if I try to get on the tv with it I get a "connection not available" message and then I have to reset the router. It's really annoying. I like the idea of the battery life, but it's just not there yet. The design of the device is great. I got a black version for my home and a white one for my office. It fits in well with my wall and doesn't take up a lot of room. I love the simplicity of it. It is very easy to operate. The price is great for a device like this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I have had my Sennheiser HD800 for over 5 years now. I have used it to play music for over 3 years, and to listen to audiobooks for 3 years. I recently decided to upgrade to the HD650, because it was a better value and I was getting tired of the HD800's small size and poor sound. After a year of using the HD600 and HD650 I finally decided to make the upgrade to HD650. The first thing I noticed about the HD 650 is how much more comfortable it is to wear than the HD 800. The earpads are larger and are far more plush than the ones on the HD 600. This makes the sound a lot better. The HD 650 also has more bass than the 650, and the treble is much better. It has better soundstage, detail, and more overall sound. I use it mainly as a reference in my home studio and at work. I love the soundstage. It is much more expansive and soundstage is very wide, but not overly so. Also, it has much better bass than my HD800. I will say that the HD700 is also a good reference and good value for money. If you are looking for a good sound system, you could do much worse than the Senns.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a "Mountain" style "Fluke" portable radio and I have to say it's a really good radio. It is compact and well made. The radio comes with everything you need to operate it. The battery lasts quite a while. It's got a large antenna that can be mounted on the roof of the car. It also has a microphone built in that is easy to use. I haven't found a better radio. The only drawback is the fact that it does not have the ability to talk on the FM band. I purchased the "Mtn Wifi" so I can use my smartphone as a "Dedicated" radio when traveling. It works great and is very easy to operate. The Bluetooth also allows you to use your smartphone as an "Docked" radio. I'm very pleased with this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5c The price is very fair, and the quality is really good. The battery lasts for a long time, and it's super thin. The new 5c design is a lot smaller than the 4c, but is still very convenient. It's the first phone I've used that doesn't require a case, so I really like it.  Write a negative review about an inferior product: ipsa 2gb This product is just awful. I've been using this phone for months now and it just doesn't perform as well as I want it to. The screen is very reflective and it doesn't last a whole lot of time on a charge. I really wish I'd waited until the new year before buying this, but I didn't want to wait any longer and it was way too expensive for what it is.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________ The product is easy to use. It has a very good range of power for an electronic device, and the sound is good. I like the remote control. I wish it had a remote for the power button but it's not that big of a deal. The sound is great and I like having the option of having the lights or music on when you want them to.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is the second time i bought the m-10. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. I am a big fan of the color. The sound is great. I have never had any problems with the m10, it is the only radio i ever bought. I love the ability to listen to radio and television programs in the car without being interrupted. I use the m 10 to play music and the radio is a great radio. I also use it for talking on the phone, and have no problem using the m 20. I was a little leery about the price, but i think it is worth the money.  Rated 5 out of 5 by dave from excellent radio I use this to listen and record all my music on and the sound quality is excellent. .  "I'm not going to say this is a new radio. It's a really good radio. But, this is not a new Radio. It is like when they brought out the old radios, like a new model, but it's not a whole new radio with the same old features that you were used to, but now it has a bunch of new features. The new features of the new radio are great. So far it is one of the best radios i have owned, i would buy it again."  Great radio, great sound, nice features, very easy to use, good price. I'm a musician, and use this radio for both music and live audio. I recommend this radio to anyone who needs a radio to listen/record music. The m10 is very good at recording/playing music. It has a nice sound and I really like the sound it produces. The volume is very easy, just set it up and go. I did have a few issues, but other than that, I really enjoy my radio. : 5
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The battery life is great, but the screen quality is lacking, the speaker is a bit loud, and the volume is a little too loud for my taste. I was disappointed that the screen on the WIFI is very low quality, and I'm looking forward to a better screen on a later model. But it is great to have this feature when the price is right. I have a 4GB model, and have had no issues with the battery. I'm not a huge music fan, but I do play some youtube videos and it does a good job. The battery life also is quite good, I've been using the WON on a day trip on a 2 hour drive to visit a friend. This is my first wireless speaker, and it's been a great purchase! My first wireless system! I'm new to home theater, and this system is exactly what I was looking for. The sound quality is excellent and the wireless connection is perfect. I am very pleased with this purchase and look forward to using it all the time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! I purchased the sennheiser hd650, which is a great sounding headphone. I have the original model, and the newer model is better sounding and more comfortable. I love the bass in this headphone, and I wish that they made a version with the original plastic ear tips instead of the plastic ones. The plastic tips are a lot softer than the rubber tips. I also love that it has the mic built in. If the new version is like the original, I will be buying the sb2, but I'll probably go with the hd600.

Yes No Wednesday, March 04, 2010  Good device, but not as good as I hoped  by A Customer from San Antonio TX USA  Review: I was really looking forward to buying this computer as my primary work computer. When I got it, however, I was disappointed in a few things. The screen is a little low resolution (no picture) and the mouse is a bit stiff. I am considering going back to the company, though.  the only good thing I can say is that the battery life is really good for the price. .  to all the others who have purchased this computer I hope you find it as good or better than the first one. ,  I'm not sure I can give it a 5 but I guess it's still worth the price to me. I'd give it 4.5 if I could. 'shep'  (reviewed 9 days after purchase)  Pros: Easy to use  Cons: Poor battery life  Overall: Love the look and feel of this machine. The only negative is the battery capacity, but it's not much to worry about.  "This is a great computer and well worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:............................................ A very good purchase for me! The price is great! The only thing I did not like is that the battery life is very very short, but that could be due to the small size of the unit. I would definitely buy another for a backup, and another for daily use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got the device because I wanted an alternative to the wireless earphones I have been using for years and have to use a wired connection. I wanted something that had a good sound quality and was portable. The earbuds work well and I have not heard a bad sound from them. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is easy to install and the price is great. I have no complaints. Write a negative review about an electronic device (or a service) that didn't work properly:    I have had these earbud headphones for about a month now. I really like them and have used them a lot. However, I have heard the sound on both the wired and wireless connection. There are times when the sound from the wireless is a little louder than the wired. Sometimes I don't get the connection or I can't hear the song. I do not know if it is a bad cable or the earbuddies themselves but I don´t know how to fix them. Report problems to a store and then report the problem to the manufacturer:    I bought these earphones because I had heard good things about them. However when I got the earphones and tried them out, I found out that the wires are too short. I didn´t want to spend the extra money for the longer wires so I bought the wired version. I can´t get a decent sound out of the earphone. They don´st sound good at all. I think it is because of the short wire length. I´m looking for a replacement right now. Conclusion: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife, because she wanted a more portable system that didn't have as much storage space as her old ones. This is the best portable system she has ever owned. The only thing I would have done differently would have been to have it come with a screen protector. The screens are not very clear. It is easy to see through them. But if I had to buy another for my office or house, I would definitely buy it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have an eGo one and it is perfect! I have tried many different vape juices and this is by far my favorite. My wife loves it as well and loves how the battery is charged when I'm at home. It does last a long time! It is very easy to charge and clean up after and is very reliable. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is that I don't like the way it comes packaged. I have had the device for almost a year and it came in a box with all sorts of other crap inside. The eGo is an excellent device. You can't go wrong with this. I will definitely purchase another one. The best device on the market. Posted by brian at 6:23 PM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you want a good sounding mixer with a high volume and quality sound, you can't go wrong with this mixer.   It's good enough to drive your bass guitar and bass drums, and the volume knob is perfectly placed to allow for that. The bass output is very clean and I have not heard any unwanted bass rumble from it yet.  , and it's one of the best-sounding compressors out there. You won't be disappointed with this device. The only complaint I have is that the mixer is not very easy to operate: the buttons are not easy to locate, and they are not very visible from the front panel, which I find very annoying.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! This is a great device! I use it to control my computer and my iPod.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- A good little device for the price that has done everything I've needed it to do. The only issue is the small plastic case that came with it and the fact that it has no case. I would have given it 5 stars if I had been able to get a proper case. Also, the only thing that can get in the way is the battery life. I can't use it all day without charging it up but if you only use it for a few hours, it's fine. Other than that, I am very happy with this device and will purchase another one when it's time.  Was this review helpful? Yes No  See all 8 reader reviews of the A1+ Review by Paul

I found this little unit, bought it on sale, and was really pleased with the quality of the device. It's very compact, and I can take it anywhere. I don't want to rely on GPS to locate a house or something else, so I can find that way without it. I'm a big fan of the GPS in my car, but this little device is great for everyday use, too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I just recently bought this and it is perfect for what I need. It is lightweight, quiet, and the light will make a blind person see it. I was looking for something for my wife who is not a big fan of lights and this is the perfect size for her and her husband. This was my first electronic device and I was so impressed that I have since bought more.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Gee from Works well, not all the lights work. The lights all work, however, the ones that do work, don't always light the way I want them to. Not all the light functions work and a few of the lights don't have the right amount of light. This is my first attempt at buying an electronic device, and was very satisfied with the product. It's lightweight, has good battery life and is easy to use.  a couple things to remember... The light is a little dimmer than i wanted and i couldnt really see what the battery was in the back of the thing  The light does not light up in all colors, and i have a problem with that. It only lights up in black, white and grey, the light is not bright. i think the black should have been darker, it also doesn't fit in with the rest of the item.  that being said, i really like this item. The battery life is great, and it has a lot of function. i just wish the light would light up a little brighter and fit into the front of the package
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The XB950 is a very good receiver. The picture is sharp, the range is very good, the audio is clear, and the menu system is simple to navigate. The range on this device is only slightly less than that of a $2,000 receiver but it can be used for up to a 100 feet. The receiver can be set to receive signals from the air, which is the most common use. The built in receiver has a lot of features, but some are more useful than others. I have never been able to get a good signal from a receiver that uses the built in line out, but the receiver is good for general use. I use it primarily for receiving radio and TV signals and the receiver works well. If I wanted to use it for other uses I would purchase a receiver with a line out. It is a nice receiver, but for what I need it is not a good buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have been using my sony mp3 player since the end of 2006, i used to use a portable cd player but the mp3 has a better sound quality, and i also have the mpc-200. I love this mp3, the best one. I like that the mp4 player is a bit bigger than mp3 but it still fits in the hand. It has a very nice design and i recommend it to everyone.!!!  Write a negative review about an average or below-average electronic device :!!! As I have already said, the mpc-200 is a good portable player, however, it doesn't sound very good in comparison to the mp2 or the sony mpc, I find that the sound is a lot more muffled and distorted, which is very un-pleasant to listen to, I feel that the quality of the sound in mpc is a little worse than in mp2, I don't like the fact that the device is small and that it's just a standard sized battery, so the battery can't be recharged when it's not in use, and it's hard to keep the device on top of the keyboard without using the stylus, but otherwise, I love the device and recommend it for people who want a simple portable player with a good sound quality.  Review by: mikalciek I just got my mpc200 today. I was really amazed how fast it arrived. I don´t have a big mp3 collection, but I do have some mp3s of which the quality is great. I use it to listen at the beach. My only problem is that the batteries are not very long lasting, and I get the feeling that the battery is running out quickly, and that's why I can´t play the music anymore. I'm a bit disappointed.

A friend has one, too, so I bought a second one.  I had no problems with the sound quality.  It is a great instrument.  The software is not that great, but it's better than what you get with a standard digital recorder.  If you want an inexpensive and high quality portable digital recorder, this is the one to get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- I purchased a Panasonic Toughbook for my son because he's been playing on a PC for a while. I've been using the PC for over a year and I can't imagine going back to the computer, even though it is very good. The only issue I have is that it doesn't take a lot of power (4.5 Watts) and it is a little on the heavy side. However, this is a good size tablet and I love the ability to read books. I would recommend this tablet to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a good product. It does the job it's supposed to. I do recommend to have a power supply. I also recommend that you get the new version with more memory. It has less ram but still a good amount of memory. The only thing I wish was improved on this is the screen. The screen is a little bit small. Also I wish the buttons could be bigger as it takes more time to press a button than it should. The speakers are also not the best but they do the job they are supposed to do. Overall it is a very good product for the price. Read full review Rating:    I bought this to replace a broken one. I'm a beginner so I wanted a simple, easy to use monitor. I have a desktop that has a lot of ports and a keyboard and mouse, so the monitor was nice to have. The problem is that it's hard to get it to fit in the keyboard tray. It's difficult to adjust the stand if it's a tight fit. Also, it's very easy to break if it falls over. Also it is not very bright. I don't have a problem with it being a monitor. It would be a better option if the stand was adjustable or if there was more buttons. I recommend this for the beginner but be aware of its limitations.

Great product but I have two problems: 1) it does not fit the motherboard well, the plastic is a little too tight. 2) the usb connector on the back is not very good, but I'm using the back one so the other side is free.  of  i use it as my computer monitor and its working perfect  good monitor but not the best, but its a great product  great monitor but it needs some fixes: 1. monitor is very high res and has a very high contrast ratio. it is very bright and sharp. 2. the monitor is just a little bit too small for my computer. it feels very heavy on my computer  the best monitor i have ever used. it fits the system and the picture is very good. no dead pixels  The display is amazing and is very accurate. The only problem I have with it is the monitor only has a USB 3.0 connection. This is really frustrating as I have to connect it to a laptop to be used as a computer monitor. Also, the monitor has no USB port, which is a big problem. I'm still very happy with this purchase.

Review of DJ Tech Tools Pro - DJ Tech Mix-Master Pro by DVS Soundsystem: DJ Tech mix-master pro!!!   This is my first DVS soundsystem and the DJ tech mix-Master pro is the only thing I will buy from them.

It has great features that I love like having a stereo, USB interface with the software preloaded and the digital out option, and digital outputs on the back. The only thing that doesn't quite work for me is the headphone jack on the side, but it's a minor annoyance.   I've also used the dvdsoundsystem.com website for the first time, and can't wait to see the website with more information and photos of the units in person.   a huge thanks to dvs for making the best digital audio system I have ever had the pleasure of listening to!  Product: DJ tech Mix-master Pro This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to any DJ. The music quality is incredible. The software is simple and easy to use. I've been using it for a while now and have been loving it!  the usb/digital out works great. the software is easy to navigate and you can set the levels with a couple of buttons. This device is perfect for a DJ who needs to be able to plug into any computer to mix tracks together.    My favorite feature about this mixer is that I can plug my computer into the digital output on the left of the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________   This is a great product. It is easy to set up, and it is easy for the users to use. It gives you a very good experience. I am satisfied.   I have been using my RCA jacks for over a year now. It does not have a tone arm, but it has good tone and a lot of control.  's are very good quality, but if you don't know how to use them, they are easy to get lost. I use them with a SysEx device and I have had no problems. I have been very happy with this product, but I have to say that they are a little heavy and you have to remember that they work with a tonearm. The RCA cable is very good too, so you can't complain.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I love the idea of a smartwatch. I don't know much about them, but I read some reviews here and there and thought that this smartwatch was worth buying. The device is really nice. It's nice and simple. It looks pretty good as well. I have a few issues: First, it does not have a battery. So you have to change it with the charger if you don't want to run the device all day. Second, you can't use it in the rain (which is a real problem if you work outdoors). The waterproof rating is only a 5. However, it has a very high-quality silicone case, so the casing should not be that big of a problem. The battery life is really long: I've been using it for 2 months without needing to recharge. I'm not sure if it's the smartwatch or the case, but it's amazing how long you can use it. I've heard that this is not waterproof, but from reading about it on the web, it looks like it's 100% waterproof. And I haven't had any problems with it so far. I like the fact that it has the date and time, so I can use the device on my watch or in the car. I also like the design. It comes in a nice plastic case and the band is really comfortable. I think the price is very good as compared to other smartwatches. I am considering buying another one for the kitchen. I hope that this review helps someone decide whether or not they should buy this smartwatch.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【I bought this device for myself and my husband. We play video games together, but I'm a video game player myself. My husband doesn't know how to use a console, so we always play on the PS3. I bought this console to use with my PS3 and it's working great. The only thing I would change is that it's not waterproof. The controller itself is pretty heavy, so I'd recommend it if you're trying to save money on a console. I'd definitely buy this again if I was going to buy another one.】  Product : A nice, affordable, durable console.  Would you recommend this to a friend?: 【Yes. I have two of these in my house.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very pleased with my new G-Wiz! I use it on my computer and mobile phone. I am very happy with the ability to switch between wired and wireless connection. It does have a couple of issues however. The first issue is the battery. I've only had it for about a week so far. I use the battery on my G-S1 a lot. But, I am not very happy that it's not included in the package with the G-Hiz. The battery is a bit on the small side for me. It's not like it's a problem, but I think that's because the G3 is so much bigger and heavier than the G2. So, I would have expected the G4 to have the same battery. But it's still a good size, and a bit larger than I expected. I will say that it works well. I'm only a novice in the wireless scene. I know the basics. It works well, I can see it being useful for me in the future. I do wish that the battery included with the wireless G-2 was the same as the one included with my G2, however. But the Giz is a good device overall.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- My friend and I used to go to a barbershop to get our hair cut every 2-3 weeks. Our local barber had an old and rather ugly rotary razor, but he did a great job. We used it every time and it cut our hair so well. I have had this razor for 3 years and the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the blade can get dirty and it is very easy to break and lose a part of the razor. The other things I like about this razor are that it has a safety switch, it is a very good value and it's easy to use. It's really a great razor.  Rated 5 out of 5 by kfk from The only razor i have ever used! I have been using this razor since I was in my early teens and I am now in my mid-40's and I still love it! I bought this razor because my friends told me that it would be good for the price. The first time I used it I was impressed with the smoothness of the blade and the fact that it is razor sharp. I've had this for a couple of years now and the razor still looks and feels new! I would highly recommend this razor and recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I had a hard time choosing between the new iPod Touch and the iPod Classic, but in the end I decided to buy the Classic because I had been thinking about getting a touch-based iPod for a while. The iPod Touch is nice, but it is too slow to be useful as a digital music player. With the Classic, I can listen to music without skipping a beat. It is not perfect, but I'm satisfied with it. And it's nice to know that I can plug in my phone and listen to the music.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- My device works fine, however, I have had several problems: 1. I can hear it. It is a low-quality microphone and I have tried several other models, none of which work as well as this one. 2. I have a sound card that does not work on the microphone (see above). 3. I use the microphone with a microphone preamp, which does not provide the best sound. 4. The mic is very loud. I find myself listening to it in the car or in the office. It really isn't good enough. I'd still recommend the product, but be sure to get the preamp. (Posted on 6/25/2011)  Fantastic product Review by Matt Rating I bought the mics to record my voice over for my blog. I bought these because I'm a professional voice over artist and the mikes have great sound quality. I'm not a fan of digital mics as I do not want to be distracted from my recording. This mic is perfect for my purposes. It's a great price, I love that it's not a cheap one and it does not distort. It works flawlessly and I'm extremely happy with my purchase.

I really can't complain at all. I am using it for my radio show and it's working great. It can pick up my voice very clearly. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it has a very small voice coil and it makes it hard to use on my desk. But that's a small price to pay for a great mic.

The game is fun.  I just bought this game and have played it several times now. I really enjoyed the game and will continue to purchase it in the future. The game is very easy to learn.  This is a good introduction to programming for kids.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I am a beginner programmer and love it.  It is easy to follow along and learn. This is the first game I've purchased that has a programming component.  The games has a nice flow to it and the game is easy enough to learn in a week or so. In a nutshell, this is a nice fun puzzle that teaches the fundamentals of programming.  You can program it from a text file.  A very nice game. Great game.  My son loved it. He really liked the ability to learn new words.  If you are looking for a good introductory programming game then this is the one.  Overall a great experience.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________  I have used this for a year now, and have no complaints about it. My only complaint is that it has a "low battery" warning every time I turn it on. I bought the SONY version because I have had other SONY products that had the same issue. The problem with this unit is that the warning does not appear until the battery is almost dead. The good thing about the Sony version is that if you have a problem with the warning, it is easy to change the batteries. The only problem I have is the lack of storage space. _______________________________________________________________________  My wife has been a Sony user for years, but we have switched over to the Sennheiser. The new earphones are far superior. The sound is crystal clear and the wireless is very convenient. The remote works great and you can easily get to the phone or the internet. We bought the wireless version as well and love it as well. _____________________________________________  This is a great wireless, easy to use earphone, easy on the wallet. I have been using this product since it first came out and it's still a great product, with great quality. The wireless is good quality and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The best part of the product is the comfort of the earphones and the fact that they stay in your ear for days and days. ______________________  The Senns were very easy to install and use. They fit my ears very well. The ear buds are comfortable, fit well and the volume is pretty good. The connection between the ear buds and the receiver is great and the sound is clear and crisp. ______________________________  the best wireless headphones ever, great sound, great comfort, good price _____________________________________  the SENNheiser HD 650 Wireless IEMs are the best earphones ever.

They were using this for a project and we had to keep switching out the batteries as the battery would drain quickly. The battery life on this unit is very good. The device comes with a charger that has a nice charger base and a charger cable, both good quality. I like that the charging base can be removed from the unit for charging. This is a good device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality is fantastic. I was using a very expensive and outdated Sony audio headset and the sound was very tinny and distant. I had to turn down the volume a little in order to hear my friends in the other room.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is crystal clear, and it can be heard all over my house. I don't get the headache or burning sensation that others have mentioned.  I'm sure that others with a burning sensation from the amp have the same problem as I do. The only reason I gave this a four star is because I would like a headphone amp with an auto off feature.    I wish the amp had a toggle switch that would turn off the amp when not in use.  The Audio-Technica AT4030 I think the AT4031 is a better choice than the AT3030 for this price range.  It's a little quieter than the 3030, but the sound quality is similar to the 3040.  The AT4032 has a little more distortion, but it's nothing to be concerned about.  I like the AT1030 more because it has a larger, easier to use volume knob.  In conclusion, the Audio-technica AT1031 is an excellent choice for an affordable headphone amp for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ I bought this to use on a small computer monitor and to display the image on my big flat screen television. This monitor has a resolution of 1024 x 768 so I had to purchase the high definition version. The monitor does not have a built in speaker, so you have to use the built in speakers. The screen is quite bright and sharp. The color is not accurate, but the picture is fine. The picture on the video does not do the computer monitors justice, but I do like the larger screen.

I am so happy with this product! And the price is right too!! It was well worth the price. I love the fact that I have to put the disc in the drive to get it to work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The item was easy to install and works great. The only issue I had was with the screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for over a year now and it still works perfectly. Ive never had to replace it because it was just fine. The only complaint is that its not on the top of the TV. Its a bit to high to get it over the back and there is a small hole for the power cord so i had to buy another to get around that. But still, its a great unit.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great price, good product I'm using this as my only tv in my basement, and I'm glad I got it. The picture is great, and it works great, as long as I'm only watching movies. My only complaint, and this is just my opinion, is that it doesn't have any built-in speakers. So I need to buy a speaker for the tv itself. I'm still happy with it though, as it does all the basic things I need. , it's a good value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikar2 is the best of all of them!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, January 15, 2012  I bought 2 of these to replace an older model I bought in 1982. I was using one for a couple of years but got a new one and decided to give it another go. I'm very impressed with it. It's not quite as good as the older one, but it's still very good.  This is my 2nd one. I really like it and the price is great.

I just got this last week and the first thing i did was get the charger and batteries. The unit is well made, works well and has very nice sound and the LED's are very bright and easy to see.  Good product and price:???? I got the B2 as a gift and it was good. I liked the sound, the color of the light, and the size of the unit. The only problem I had with the unit was the battery. When it ran out I had to replace it because it didn't last the amount of time I expected. The quality is great and it's definitely a great product. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________________________________________  Reviewer: bb1 - favorite favorite favorite - November 21, 2008  Subject: This is a good radio, I think, but it is the worst receiver I have ever had. The only reason I bought it was to have an easy to read tape recorder. I was disappointed when I realized it only had one input jack.   It is a decent receiver, with good sensitivity. I do have the good fortune of having a very good radio in the same room. This receiver would be great with a separate tuner for music listening. I bought a K2 and have it tuned to a good music station and have not found any stations that it can't tune into.  'scene is better than the K2, and I would recommend the K3 to anyone who wants a very simple receiver that doesn't require a whole lot of effort. - November 20, 2008This is a bad radio, but not a bad receiver
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- --------------------------- I bought this unit as a portable unit to take with me when I am out of town for a long time. I do not like using computers on the go and I need to be able to access my files from anywhere. This is the only computer I own that I can take with my when I go out of the house. This unit does not have a screen but it does have the ability to transfer files to a laptop on the road. It is very nice that it has a USB port so I can use my laptop to access files without having to carry a hard drive with me. The only thing I do wish was that it had a built in screen to use with the built in laptop. Overall I am happy with this purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:............................................The price of this machine was reasonable. It's nice to have a good looking electronic clock, even though the date and time on the face is a bit hard to read. I've had my wife use it on a lot of my computers and she liked it. The machine has a good buzz and is quiet. It can be used in the living room, in the bedroom and in the office. The battery life is a little short for what I paid, but if you don't use it for more than a few minutes, you should be fine. It has the right features and is great for what it is.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The SONY HD-P6P is a great product that has exceeded my expectations. I use the P6P in my Sony HV-N7 and I have to say that I am very pleased with it. I have the 16:9 aspect ratio and it's very good. It does not need a TV to view on the P-Series. I'm impressed with the picture quality and the sound. This is a must have for me. It has been a great purchase for the price. I would definitely recommend this product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Best TV I've ever owned, ever. I bought this TV as a replacement for an older HD-C7 that I no longer used and didn't care for. I was shocked by how good this TV was and I was even more surprised by how inexpensive it was. I got this TV in a bundle with a Roku TV box, a pair of speakers, a game controller, a few other accessories, and an 8GB micro SD card. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The picture is beautiful, colors are perfect, the sound is awesome, the remote is awesome. The only thing I wish was different is that it doesn't have a built-in antenna. It would be perfect if it did. I know that I'll be picking up more TVs in the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for a while now and the sound is great. it works great, and it's quiet too.  I'm giving this five stars for being a great product, but there is one big problem. , I'm giving it five stars because it works as it should. I've had the earphones for about a week now and I'm quite pleased with the sound quality. I have a high-end stereo sound system and I like the sound. I'm on the verge of buying a couple more sets of these earphones to add to my system, but I've found that they only work in my car. The earphones only play stereo music (which is fine) but if I play any other music (or listen to my phone's music) I get nothing but static and a very tinny sound. It's very disappointing, especially since I'm paying more than a lot of other headphones for similar quality. . I had to return the earphone because it was defective and the earpieces were too loose in the headband. I sent the earpads back and ordered new ones. The new ones work great, so I don't think I will be returning my old ones.  in the future I would recommend the earpiece to someone who wants to get some great stereo sound with a low price. I also recommend the price as it's not expensive. I will recommend to a friend who is looking for a good pair of earphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a very satisfied customer. The sound quality of this amp is outstanding. It can produce the sound you need for a good live experience without having to spend a lot of money. I've been playing a ton of guitar in the studio and this amp allows me to have the best of both worlds. It's very easy to use and gives the best sound out of all my other amps. I have a lot more fun with this amp than with any of my other ones. Thanks Fender for making a great product that I enjoy using. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!   Write a negative review about an average electronic device :   The quality of the amp is ok. I don't mind that it doesn't play as loud as my other one but I just don't care for it much. I also don't like the design. It is so big and so tall. The volume control is small and the knobs aren't easy to move. It feels cheap. I think the plastic is cheap as well. The amp also has a bad volume control and has the same problem. It does not respond to volume control changes and the volume knob is hard to turn with my fingers. The knobs are also very hard to use.   My overall impression of the product is that it is very simple but it does not do what it says. I wish it would have a volume control as well as a headphone jack so I could use it as a portable amp. The only thing that I would recommend is the remote for this amp. It would make it more convenient.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first Apple device. Bought this because of its small size and easy to use. The keypad and screen is very small, but it is still a very good keypad. The only thing that I did not like about this device is the battery. It has a weak power system, which can drain very fast when the device is not used. If you do not use this device frequently, then it should last for many years.  No Was this rating helpful to you?

I have used this device with both my PC and my iPhone. I love the ease of use and the ability to connect it to both my phone and PC. The only problem I have had with this device is the "dongle" on the back of the device that fits over the USB port on the PC, that the USB to micro USB cable is a little too long for it to be able to get into the back. The device is fine for what it is, I can't see it being used for anything more.

Review of the JVC HA-2200  I purchased the JVCA HA-2200 as a replacement for my JVC HU-100.  The HA-200 is a little more expensive, but the HU100 was a great value.  It had a larger screen, a lot more features, and a nicer looking remote.  For the money, the HA-100 was about twice as good as the HA2200.  However, the H200's remote was so far off from the HA2200 that I gave it up.    I can't see the H2200 ever replacing the H100, as the remote is too small and does not work with the HA2210.  Also, the battery life on the HA200 is only good for about 2 hours of movie playback, which is far too little for a portable device.  So I ended up going with the H2200, but if I had to make the choice, I would still go with the JVA HU series. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I bought the first gen i7-4770k on Black Friday, and I'm very happy I did. It's not just that it has great performance. I was very impressed with the overclocking capabilities, as well as the solid and quiet fanless operation. The price is very reasonable, as it was less than the last generation i7 4770k. I am running it at 4.7GHz, and it does not overheat. The integrated graphics is very good, and can do some intensive 3D work, so if you're a gamer you won't be disappointed. It also comes with a warranty. -------------------------- Buy this if you have an i7, or a 6700k or a 7700k, if you don't care about the overclocked performance, it's the best buy on the market right now.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent electronic music production tool for musicians who want to make electronic music without a computer, without needing to buy expensive software. I use it for all sorts of music including electronic and ambient. It's very easy to use and the user interface is very intuitive. It is also very fast and has an impressive amount of features and capabilities. I have a lot of use for this unit and I can't recommend it enough. Highly recommended! What I don't like: ------------ The main problem with this unit is that it's limited to 32 channels, which I found to be a little limiting when I tried to use it as a virtual instrument. It also doesn't have an external interface. ------------ It's not very easy for beginners to use this unit. The user interface for example, is not intuitive. ------------- It's hard to use. -------------- I also found that it has some bugs and it seems that they are not being resolved. It was very hard to make a loop in the software that I use to produce my music. It would just freeze and not play. I also couldn't use it with the software I'm using to make my music because the software had some problems with the 32 channels.

Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device, especially if you are not very experienced:    I think the computer industry should have gone out of business long ago.   The fact is that the computers that come with your home PC are far from perfect.  If I could have gotten a real good computer for $50 I would have done so.  The only reason I bought the TRS is because I had to have one.  If you want a real computer that will run DOS, Windows, etc.:   If you want to run Windows, you better be prepared to have to learn a few things.  For the price of the computer, I think you could do better.  My best recommendation is that if you have to get a computer, you should get a Mac.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had this for a few years now. I've used it for everything, from the old school way of putting the cord on and listening to music with my portable tape player to the more modern way of using it with my laptop. I was skeptical about the $250 price tag, but I was totally wrong. The sound is crystal clear, the build quality is excellent, and the sound quality is better than my laptop speaker. There is no distortion, and if you use the headphone jack on the back of the unit, the sound is crisp and clean. I'm very happy with this device. It is well worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!   My only issue with the K1 is the "knock-off" look of the buttons, I've never used a mechanical keyboard, but the design of the keys is so close to that of a standard keyboard that I have to assume it's not a real mechanical keyboard. The keys are easy to press, the layout is nice and it has a lot of good features. I love the fact that you can connect it to a computer or a PS3/PS4 without having to mess with USB cables. I also like that it doesn't have a separate volume control, which can be a bit annoying on a PS4. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, I got the keyboard because I thought it looked pretty, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good it feels. I can't say enough good things about this keyboard.

They have much more memory than the ipod and can hold much more data. The best thing is the sound, it is much clearer than the old iphons.

I'm very happy with this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent sounding headphone amp.

I love the design and the size of it.  The only thing that I do not like is the fact that you have to push a button in order to start the app.    I wish there was a more convenient way to start it up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********This is a very good little electronic device. The screen is a good size, it is easy to read in direct sunlight. I use this to play some video games with my son. I can also use it to play a little game on my computer using a USB to serial cable. It does have one negative. It has no battery indicator and does not have an LED screen to show the battery level. It is a pity, but not a deal breaker. The unit is compact and easy to transport. I like it very much.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 3g   i am an avid electronic user, but for the longest time i couldn't understand why my old phone did not work as well as the newer one, i thought i was getting a lemon but it turns out i was just wrong. i bought this iPhone 3g about two weeks ago and i'm amazed at the improvement. i'm on a trip to europe and i want to be able to check email, listen to music, read the paper, etc. and the phone does it all, it's just so fast and smooth. it's an amazing phone! the camera is also great and the battery life is amazing. i love the speed and the camera.  I have an iPhone 3G, but this is a great improvement over it. This is a solid phone. I use it for both work and personal use.  "Great phone" - Jan 30, 2012   Great phone for the price, I was a little worried about the camera at first, but it is really good. I would recommend this phone to anyone. . I had one of these at the same time as a iPhone 3GS and the 3GS camera is still better. The iPhone 3Gs camera is not good enough. The phone is fast and has a good quality screen.  I am in love with this phone! I have used it since it came out and I have never had any problems. I highly recommend this device.  of course it is not as good as the 3g, but the price is so good, it is worth the upgrade. It is amazing that I can use my phone without thinking about the speed, the battery, the camera, and other things. I am very satisfied. I have been using my 3g phone since the very first day.  in a word, perfect. I'm not a fan of the "i" word, but I love my 3gs and I'm still not a big fan of this "iphone" but I guess that's ok. This phone is perfect for my needs. It has everything I need, it works perfectly, I like the 3gs more than my 3gd, and I love the new size of this phone. i have not even tried to use this phone as my main phone, I'm more likely to use it as my work phone. It's perfect for that. It would be good for the people who like to use their phones at work. I wish Apple would have
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This thing is really nice and a lot of fun to use and is very easy to use. I am very impressed with it. I really liked the fact that I could have the remote and the LCD screen with my tv, and use my smart phone as a screen and a remote for my tv and pc. The tv and phone controls were easy to set up. The best part of this is that you don't have to be a pro or have a ton of knowledge to use this thing. You can get this with no problem and can be playing with it for a few hours at a time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of video games, or just someone that wants a good little portable gaming device. I also highly recommend the battery life as I was able to play for almost two days straight.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm an electronic engineer with an eye for good design and good build quality.  These are my go to earphones.    I have a variety of models from various brands and can recommend them all.  The only real downside to them is that they don't seem to last as long as the other brands.  If you're looking for a pair of good headphones with an excellent design and sound quality, these are my picks!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* The first time I plugged this into my iMac it worked flawlessly. I also plugged it into my iPod which had been sitting around for the past year and a half and it worked perfect. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. I recommend this device to anyone looking for a good quality portable computer that is small enough to fit in your backpack or pocket without taking up a lot of space. It is a bit of a pain to put in the pocket though, but that's just me being a nitpicky person. It has a built in microSD card slot so you don't have to worry about it losing data if your phone is lost. I haven't had the opportunity to use the 3.5mm audio jack yet, but the mic is very clear. I have also noticed that it has no built in power, so you have to plug it in to charge. If you need to run a laptop in your pocket, you can easily carry it around. This is a great little portable computer for your travel needs. *****************************  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for the first time about two years ago. It's a great portable charger for my iPod. I've got about 100 songs on it and it charges them so quickly. The battery is good and I'd buy it again. The only negative thing I'd say is that the iPod interface is very finicky. The batteries can't be connected to one of the other ports.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought a dongle for my wife, which was quite the disappointment. The dongles do not work properly with my Macbook Pro and it makes the computer stop working, even if it is completely powered off and unplugged. It is very difficult to use with a mouse as the mouse is stuck in the corner of the screen. Also, the sound quality is terrible. The quality of the sound is very bad and not a good quality as it is very noisy. I tried using a wireless headset but that is a joke because I need a wireless one for my work, not a laptop. I have a small laptop, but this is a huge problem for me. I bought the wireless one from the web site but I am still going to return it because of the donglers. The service is great though and i will definitely buy again.  Rated 1 out of 5 by dave from Not for Macs or Apple computers I bought this to use for my Mac. The adapter does not work well with my iMac. The sound is terrible and is not clear and it is difficult to operate with a keyboard. The unit itself is very heavy and clunky. It has a very bulky design. It would be much better if it worked well with a laptop instead of a computer.  the sound of the adapter is terrible...it is just a lot of noise. it is the worst thing i have ever used. and its very difficult use with my macbook pro, and i think its not a computer, it is a dildo, i have used a dildor in the past and it was good for me, but not this one. and the only thing that helps is using a headphone, but thats it. i will never use this again and i am glad that i did not buy this adapter.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sennheiser Momentum 3 is the best headset I have ever owned.  I am a professional photographer for an architectural design company and I've been using them for a few months now. I have found them to be the perfect headset for my ears and they provide the sound I've come to expect from Sennher.   I like that they're durable and lightweight and that they offer a variety of settings to get the perfect sound. The sound is really clear, even with low bass frequencies. They also have good volume.  .   The mic has a nice, comfortable grip and the microphone doesn't get in the way when wearing them. The headset also has a good range of volume settings, which is a bonus. I've had to change the volume for some of the quieter tracks because they were too quiet.  is the second most expensive model and has a larger mic. . I'm a professional designer for an architecture design company who uses the Sennsheisers and I found that the S40s were the best headphones for my work and the S50s the best for recording.The S40's have a nice sound, but the bass is a little muddy.The Soundstage is just right and the highs are very detailed and full. I haven't tried the S70's, but I'm sure they're the best in that category.I haven't yet used the S60s, but they sound amazing.I find the S80s to be very good for studio work and recording.I've had the S20s for a little while now and I'm just now getting into them. They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. The bass is very punchy and the mids are very clear. The highs are just right. I can't imagine buying any other headphones for this price.The only thing I dislike about these headphones is that they are a little uncomfortable. I use them in a wide variety of situations. It's really hard to keep the sound consistent.I am extremely happy with my Senns and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a great quality headset for a reasonable price.

It doesn't use a lot of power and the light on the battery is great for checking on it. I don't use the remote control so I don´t need to have the remote on my side when using it. It's not my main computer, but it is a nice addition.

The  battery life is about 6 months, but it can be changed out with a regular charger. The phone is very lightweight, very thin, and the battery is very powerful. The sound is loud and clear. I bought this phone because I wanted a cheap phone that would work for reading ebooks, and this phone is perfect for that. The only thing I didn't like about it is the screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________ My favorite electronic device of the last decade has been the VX3. I'm very happy with it and would like to see it be the only one that comes out for the foreseeable future. _________ I've used the V3 for a while now, but I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to audio gear, so I was a little unsure how well the V7 could handle my music collection. I was very pleasantly surprised, as the V6 sounded like an out of the box piece of crap. The V7 is a lot more professional sounding than the V8, with a more "professional" sound and an overall cleaner sound than the 8. If you're a serious audiophile, I'd say this is a no brainer. The sound is quite impressive for a $500 unit. The bass is very good and the mids are very clear, as are the highs. The only thing I don't like about the V5 is the fact that it doesn't have a tuner, but if you don't have the cash for an external tuner this will do the trick. It does have an on/off switch and an auto off function. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an entry level set of preamps that will work great with a variety of music sources.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this device to use with a Raspberry Pi as a music player/recorder. I'm using it with a Pi 2 and my RCA/RCA audio output is not working. The sound is still good but it's really loud and I have to put my headphones on to hear what I'm playing. I've tried using a different output with the same results, so I'm not sure if the audio output on this device is broken. I can hear the sound from my music player through the speakers, but it is too loud to hear clearly. I hope this works for everyone else.

What do you think about this item?   Very nice device and very efficient and useful. I had bought a previous model from Amazon and I liked it very much. The one on here is different in a lot of ways.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using this product for over a year and it has been great for my car stereo and computer speakers. It is very durable and easy to use. The only complaint I have is the plastic case I got does not last very long. I've tried several different cases and they all have a short life. It would be nice if there was a longer plastic case. Overall I love this product. Write a negative review about an average electronic device and you'll get a few comments here and there. But when you write a review about this product, there is no room for discussion, just one word, "disappointing." First off, this is the third car stereo speaker system I have purchased and have always returned the second I've had to return it.  This one is just not up to the standards I've seen in other brands. I have tried the Pioneer Elite and the Kenwood TK-7 and the KEF R100, and these do not even come close to the quality of this product... the only one that came close was the Kenmoor.  Write another negative review and you will get a very negative review from me. I don't think this is a product for anyone but the very experienced audio enthusiast. The quality of the speakers is not even close to what I expected. I was expecting good sound, and I was not. I got my car running with one speaker and the system sounded like the first speaker on my headunit had a broken speaker.  The sound was way too bright and the highs and mids were way too thin. It was also difficult to hear my voice and other conversations.  My only other complaint is that the volume control is a little difficult to get to and you have to put a little pressure on it to make it turn.  I'm very disappointed in this product and have not returned it. I think if you are looking for a good quality car stereo system and don't mind some headaches, this one is not it.

I was a Dell fanboy as a kid. In the early 2000's I was always looking at the HPs, but I have always been very disappointed. I decided to give HP a chance and I have been very satisfied. I think the HP products are a lot more durable than the Dell products. The HPs have a very solid feel to them, and you can tell they are well built. The best part is that HP can still make some of the very best notebooks and ultrabooks. The only bad thing about the HP laptops is that they are so expensive. The company has been making the same laptops for so long that their parts are beginning to become very difficult to find. The newest laptops are quite nice, but for the money you can get a better laptop from Dell. The bottom line is that if you need a good computer, buy a Dell. HP HP has been around for a while now. Their products are reliable, and their products are very reliable. You can't go wrong with them. Read all reviews of this product by clicking on the links below.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! I use it to make music on my iPhone and iPad with a little bit of software from Audacity. I like the fact that it can't be erased and the fact it doesn't take up space on my computer. I wish it came with a mini usb cable and an adapter but that's only because I'm new to the whole digital music thing. If you're a beginner or just like a cheap way to get music on your iPad/iPhone then this is a great way to start.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect for the Money I bought this for the money. I have a Macbook pro with 32GB of storage and it is a lot of music. I am now on a budget, and this is perfect for the price. I do have to plug it into my computer to be able to access my music files. It's a bit slow, but that is my fault. The price was very good and the device works well. I'm not a music enthusiast, but this was great for my first device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- This is a great device for the money and it does exactly what it's supposed to do. The only issue I have with it is the ability to connect up a 3.5mm headphone jack (i believe they used the 3.1mm one for the 1st gen) and also the fact that it only supports 5v. This could be a flaw but I've only used it in conjunction with my amp and have never had any issues with the amp.  Style of music: ------------- I've never been a big fan of the way the Beatles used to make music, so I've always had a hard time with the new stuff. I can understand that this is a tribute to the Beatles (and I love the new Beatles covers), but this isn't what I was looking for. This is an old school album, and I'm sure that was the intention, but that old school music doesn't really get me going. I'm a bit of a classical person, and this album is a little slow and slow, but it is still nice to listen to. We will update this review as more info becomes available. I just received my NMBE in the mail and have listened to it for a few hours. It's not the exact album I was expecting. I think I'll be putting it in a drawer until the next one arrives. I've got to say that this album does sound good, but the music is really lacking. It's a nice sounding amp, and is a very affordable option. If you want something more modern, and don't mind spending a little more, I'd definitely suggest this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a very good product and it works like a charm, but it needs to be charged every night. I bought this device because my old one broke after 5 months, but this one still works as good as the one I used for 5 months. Write a negative review about an ok electronic device (but it's ok):  I was happy with the product until I noticed that the buttons do not light up when you press them. I could not use it because it was not easy to read the buttons and I could only use it for a couple of hours before I need to charge it.  So I got a different one. The battery life on this thing is awful. It lasts a couple hours on the light, and then it shuts off. I am using it with my ipod to listen to music, so that is what I'm using it for, but I have no idea how long I can last.  Write an overall good review about the product:    I purchased this item as I want a good speaker for my bedroom. I was looking for something with decent sound quality, a good size, and a simple design that can be easily hidden away from sight. This device is perfect for my needs.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ In a world where people are going digital, the E-Book Reader is a good tool that can help you in reading e-books. I read many books and many e-Books from Kindle and now i am using the EBook Reader. It is a very handy device and is not too expensive. I like the simplicity of this device. It works well and the cover is easy to operate. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ I got the XR500 2.4 Ghz Wireless Headset and I have to say it is a good headset. It has good bass, and has good range. I use this headset with a laptop and a cell phone. I am happy with the headset, and would definitely recommend this headset to anyone.  Best sound ever I have a pair of headphones that work well but the sound is too flat for me. I purchased a XR600 and I am so happy with it. This is the best sound quality that I have ever experienced with any headphones. I would highly recommend this headphone.  the only thing I don't like about the XRs is the wire that goes around the ear, this is a problem for me because my ears are always cold ( I have the coldest ears that I can get, I'm not sure why). I would like to see the wires go around the headband and not around the ears. . ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The unit works great. My main issue is that I have to press a button a few times to get the sound to go to a channel. This is a pretty basic issue. I wish the unit came with a manual. Don't expect too much from this:    The sound is not amazing but it is pretty good. The speaker quality is really good. I love this sound system:    I have used this sound on a trip and it is just what I was looking for. It is a great little portable device for the money. The sound quality is great and the unit is easy to use. I will be buying one for every room I have in my house. The only downside is that the volume is a bit low. If you have a big home theater system it might be too loud for you. But if you want to have a good quality sound system in a portable device that is great. It has a good range of sound and it has a great price.

Product Review: LG Electronics 55" 4K TV with HDMI CEC Function  Overall Rating: Excellent Product  Service: LG customer service was quick to reply to my inquiries and the product is great.    The only con is the fact that it can not work directly with my current TV, it has to be connected via a receiver. But this is really not an issue for me, I am mainly a PC user and I am not using a receiver at the moment so that is really a non issue for my use.   Overall a great product with a great price, I would definitely recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first mechanical keyboard and it's a great buy for the money. It is a good quality keyboard and I really like the layout. It does take some getting used to, but it's great. It's quiet and doesn't make a ton of noise like some keyboards do. The layout is very similar to the old Cherry keyboards, but this is definitely a better design and is much quieter.   Overall, this is a great keyboard, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first Philips Hue light.  I love that it is dimmable and it looks great.    It does not seem to use a lot of power and it is really bright.  The one thing I do not like about it is that it seems to only be compatible with the white LED strip.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple way to get color to your home.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6 plus (new) This phone is just as good as the original iphones but with more features and a better screen and camera. I have owned my iPhone 6 plus for a year and a half now and have been very happy with it. It's easy to use and I haven't had a single problem with it so far. My only complaint is that it is too big for my hand. I'd have liked the smaller one. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a great phone and great value for the money.  No more black screen on new iPhone 6 Plus! I bought this phone on July 9th. I am very happy to say that I never had to wait for the new iPhones to be shipped to me. I was able to receive the new phone and it was delivered by the end of July. My first impressions were that it's like the new one that I have, except with more memory. I had a lot of fun playing with the new camera app, so it's worth the $100 to upgrade. I will definitely be buying a second one!  New phone works great! I am happy to report that I am using the iPhone 6s Plus with the latest software. It was a little difficult to figure out the new features and options for the app store but once you learn the ins and outs of the app you get it pretty quickly. I use it mostly with my iPad, and have not had any problems. The screen is better and brighter, and the battery life is great. The only problem I have had so far is the black screen of death, but I have not been able to replicate it, and haven't bothered to look at the settings. Overall, a great buy and the only way to go. I'm really glad that I got it!  the 6s is awesome! This is the second phone I have gotten from apple and I have to say I am really pleased. The new screen is the best I have ever seen and is better than the retina screen of my iphONE 6. I also love the camera. The battery life has not been great but I just charge it at night and when I get home the next day it's good to go again. The speakers are great but the volume is a little low so be careful when you play music. I haven´t used the water resistant case yet but I really like the overall design and overall feel of this phone. I can
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently bought a new laptop.  When I received the box, I was amazed by how beautiful the laptop looked.  I have the new Asus G750JT, which is a great laptop, and when I saw the price, I immediately bought it. I was very pleased with my purchase.  The specs on the G750 are top-notch.   The battery life is good, but I am not sure I will get the same battery life on the new laptop that I have on my Asus G752JT.  It was good to know that I will be able to do a lot more with my G750, including 4k movies and 4k games.  When I got my new G750 and opened it up, I noticed the warranty and it said it was "up to 100%".    When i got it, I had the option to have it repaired or replaced.  This is a good way to avoid having to purchase a new battery.  At this time, I have not had to replace it.  Now that I am more than a year in, I am very happy with the G752, and am now looking forward to upgrading to the new G751JT which I am also very pleased about.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had to buy this device for work. It was cheap but a good device. It works fine for my needs and I'm satisfied.  Great!   Great product! Worked perfectly for me and my friends. It does have a few drawbacks: the charger is only compatible with the USB port and the device is pretty small (I would say about the size of an iPhone).  I bought one for my husband and one for me. They work perfectly, and it is the perfect size for one person. I would definitely recommend this product!  Perfect   Perfect size, works as expected, easy to charge.  and it's all plastic   The only drawback is the battery is not removable, which is a big deal.  the battery isn't removable   Also the battery itself is plastic which is very disappointing because it's a very thin battery that I can easily tell is not rechargeable. The fact that the battery comes in a plastic bag makes me even more unhappy. I hope I never have to use this again because I don't want to have to buy another battery! -1 star due to battery not removable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! The device worked fine for my purpose as a remote control for my car. It is not a wireless remote control and not a web browser based control. It works fine in my car and is a nice touch for a nice little device. It has some limitations as well. The device only allows me to control the speed at which the car moves from 0-60 MPH and only has 3 buttons. However, I am still very satisfied with the device. The price is a little high but the remote control is worth it. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I have a new computer and am having some problems with it. When I get it I will report back. I will update the bad and good. --------------- When I started using the "Macbook Pro" it was a joy. I could do so much more with my computer, I have so many programs and a very good computer, with a good screen. I am so happy I upgraded to this computer. The only problem I have is it takes so long to get things done and to write a review. I use a Microsoft Office program called "Excel" and it does not work on my computer. It says that it is a virus. It seems to be a problem with the computer. I have had the same problem with other computers. I cannot use it for any other reason. I would like to see a change to this program, because the software works fine on my other computer. This computer has some good features and some bad ones.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  It has a decent sound, and works well. However, it is not the best. I have a Sony receiver and it does everything I want, but this one is not. I had to get a better model.  If you need to do video and need a video player and you need a good quality player, buy it. You will not be sorry.  a few things to consider before buying this player: - it has no video out (you must plug it into the tv or laptop) - it does not play music from your computer/mp3 player - it doesn't have an aux input - it can't do any sort of surround sound - it's not very easy to use - you need an HDMI cable to do surround sound.  to all of these issues, the pros out weigh the cons.  in the end, it's a great player.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my xfone for almost a year and its still going strong. i used it mostly to stream music, but i've also used it to record movies and even do some video editing. ive used it for a long time and still use it for video editing and just for basic internet usage. it's very reliable and works well, no issues whatsoever. also the xfinity app is very good, i recommend it to everyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Fantastic purchase I was a little apprehensive about buying this due to some of the negative reviews but I am so glad I made the purchase. This is a fantastic product for the price. It has everything I need for my needs. The only con I have is that it has a hard time maintaining connection when it gets busy but that is easily remedied with the 2 year warranty. I recommend this product and would recommend to everyone  Customer Review:  Thank you for your review. We really appreciate it. It really helps us to know that people are actually using our products.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought the "Pinnacle" with the "Empower" software, and the device is a GREAT device for learning to type. I am very impressed with the layout of the keys, and how they work together. The sound quality is very good, and typing is not as bad as I thought it would be. The "Espri" software is very nice and simple to use, and you do not have to pay for the "spyware" (which I think is ridiculous). It would be a real bummer if the product was discontinued. I have a "Mac" with a similar keyboard and it's a real pain to type on.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was the first USB-MIDI controller I have used that worked with a computer keyboard, and I have to say it was an easy upgrade. The cable was nice and it was easy to use. I have a Roland S-612 and was looking for something that had the same features but was a little cheaper.  I really like that I can use the controller on a computer as well as a MIDI keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair. She really likes it, and the fact that she can't even feel it when she pushes it is just a bonus. I do agree that it's a bit too heavy for one person to use, but I think if you have to carry it around and have a limited amount of time to use it, you may find it more convenient than a wheelchair would be.  Also, the ability to easily charge it when you're on the go is a nice touch.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** I have a very high end computer and a very nice audio/video receiver/processor. The problem is that my computer can't take the audio properly out of the receiver, so I have to send the audio out through a stereo. The computer can handle the video perfectly. I also bought a high end audio system and have an external stereo. I tried both systems with the receiver and the audio works perfect. The receiver works flawlessly with the audio system. But it's the best stereo receiver I've ever owned. I'm so glad I bought this receiver.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: bestaudio
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought a new iPad Air this year and I love it. The new iPad is a great tablet for students, but also for teachers. I have found the app for teaching writing to be a very helpful tool. I'm a college freshman and my school is looking for an e-reader. I purchased the Apple iBook Reader from Amazon and I'm very pleased with the purchase. The iBook reader is easy to use, and the book has great quality. The price was right and the price for the quality of the reader. I am very pleased and recommend this book to my students. Write a negative review about an ok electronic device (in my opinion):  My son just bought an iPhone. He likes the camera and the camera's camera works good. However, the speakers are weak. They do not sound good. Also, the phone doesn't have a headphone jack. The speaker quality is ok, but not great. This is a very hard book to rate because there are so many things that could be good and so many bad things that I can't rate them as "great" or "bad". I recommend this to teachers who are looking for a good basic e-book for their class. Rating: 3 stars. I bought this for a college class and it was a good start to the class. However it is just too basic to be considered a real course textbook.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is the best product ever I have ever purchased. The sound quality is incredible and the controls are simple and intuitive. I was having issues with the buttons on the previous unit but this one is better, and more accurate. I bought another one because I am very happy with this one and wish I had bought this one years ago. This is my second set and I plan to buy more to use in my office. Thank you guys for making it easy for everyone to get great sound out of an electronic device. I can't imagine using an analog sound board. You guys have my business now!!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I got this as a gift, and it was very good. The only problem I have with it is the fact that I'm still learning to use it. It is difficult for me to hold it at a certain angle and position, but I'm trying. I've been using it for about a week now, and I can't complain. I like the fact the it can be used while it is charging, so it's not as big a deal as it might sound. I would recommend this to anyone. It's a good buy for the money, but it's still new.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! My new G-Wiz is awesome. It's an excellent device for the price. I got it because I needed something cheap and reliable and I got what I was looking for. It is extremely well made and it can get the job done for a very reasonable price. The best thing is the fact that it's not wireless and it has a micro USB connector that will not let you run off your computer. It comes with the USB cord as well as the screen protector. The battery is great. It lasts me about 5 days on high brightness and the screen is a very nice size. The sound quality is very good. I don't have much else to add other than if you want a small device that's not as big as it looks or feels and you can use it anywhere you go, then this is it.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I purchased this to replace my aging VCR with a digital one. I had to use my own DVD player with this unit so that the digital signal would be clear. I was very happy to find that the player was a little easier to operate than the VCR, which required many adjustments to make the correct signal for the video I wanted to watch. It is a bit larger than I expected, but the video quality was great. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great looking digital VCR that will play all the movies I own on DVD. (Posted on 9/27/2018)  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jw from Great for playing DVD movies I bought this unit because I was looking for a replacement for my older VCR. I am very satisfied with this new unit. The picture quality is very good and it plays all the DVDs I own. I use it in my bedroom where I can control it with my computer. It's a very good product. (Added on 6/30/2018, updated after I received a replacement from the manufacturer)  the unit came with a screen protector, however after about a month it started falling off the unit. I did not know how to remove it and took it to the local electronics store. They suggested removing the top of the unit and inserting a flat head screw driver into the hole where the screen protector is placed. This worked perfectly. I then used the screen cover that came with the unit to protect the unit from further damage. I now use a flat screw driver and the screen covers. It worked perfectly again. I would recommend this product. I'm glad I finally found a good replacement. (added on 7/20/2017)  of the 5 stars is based on the original review by the reviewer. (Updated 6/6/2018): This review has been updated to reflect a replacement unit that is no longer available from the company. I received the replacement unit and the first thing I did was attach the screen protectors that came on the old unit. They did the job and the unit looks very nice. (Update 11/15/2017): The original reviewer's review has since been updated and he has posted a second review which is now available. The second review has not changed the rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this a few times now and it is perfect for a lot of stuff. I have a very big tv in my house that can be very loud but this is much better than my old tv. it has a great sound and it doesnt have any lag on tv.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great TV! I bought this TV because my family had been wanting one for a while. I didn't think it was worth the money, but since we can now watch movies on Netflix and Hulu on this TV, I was not going to pass it up. The picture quality is great. The only issue is the remote. It doesn't work with this TV but the remote itself is great!  Reviewed by Mike, I have had the Sony ZD9000 for 3 weeks. The TV is amazing. I had one of the old ZD800's that went bad and was only good for 2 years. The ZD8000 is now the best TV I have ever owned and it has had no issues at all. It is very bright, the picture is crystal clear, and the sound is great for movies and music. The remote is also very good. It has the ability to change the channels, turn the TV on/off, and even change the input sources from DVD players to Blu Ray players. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great TV at a good price. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first electronic device. I've had several other products, but this one was the first that I actually bought, not just looked at. It's so nice to have the ability to watch TV and watch movies on the big screen, and this is a really good device.  I like how the buttons are easily accessible and the ability for me to play games on the small screen is great.  I like this item.   It's a little larger than I expected, but it is sturdy.  It has a few problems, though. First, there are 2 different power options: a USB port on the side for wall power and a rechargeable battery in the center.  This may be OK for the average home user.  I bought this to use on a plane with my iPad (a real bummer that the battery is not removable), so I can't really say how this would work in a home situation.  For the price though, it is a good product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is great. It is very good. I do not think that I would be able to live without it. I have had it for about 3 months now and it has held up great. The buttons are very easy to use and easy to learn. I was surprised to find that I had to click the power button a few times just to turn the power off but after a few uses it got the hang of it. The only problem I had with it was with the batteries that came with it. After about a month of using mine they started to leak. I went online and found some that worked for me. I had them shipped to my house to try and make it last longer. It took about 3 weeks but they finally came in a new box and they were still working fine. I did try to put a few more batteries in but after about 2 months they would just get stuck in the slot that goes to the back. The first time I did this I had enough battery to last a month. I figured the batteries would break or something so I sent it back to the store to be fixed. They fixed it but not all of them. I ended up buying the battery replacement for it and have had no problems with it at all. I think the battery is a bit more fragile than I thought it was but overall it is a great device.   I would recommend this device to anyone that is looking for an electronic device that is easy to get to know and learn how to use it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!This is a very nice, good looking, and well constructed USB interface that is easily to use. I'm a newbie to this hobby and i found the USB connector very simple to use, and the quality of the connector is excellent. i have never used an interface that doesn't come with a case, but this one is a good value. the cable is the best I've ever used. it has a good resistance and i haven't had any issues with any of my devices (although i did use a little less than half of the cable). the software is great too! it is very easy to use and it does all the things you'd expect, from setting the parameters for the program to saving your settings to turning on/off the LED's. the only thing i wish is that i could use a 5 volt interface, but that's a small gripe. I'd recommend this interface to anyone who needs a USB interface and doesn't want to spend a ton of money.Read full review

This is a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I bought this a couple of years ago because my iPod touch was going bad. I was really surprised that the touch worked so well, so I bought a second one. The second one has also worked well, I haven't found anything wrong with either of them. They work well. I like that they have a nice display. I have had one for a couple years and it still works well. It is a good product and you should try them if you are having problems with your iphone. You can also buy the bluetooth version, if you like to talk to your ipod touch.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 6 plus  The iPhone 6 Plus is great. It's more than a year and a half since I last bought a new phone and I was so excited to get the 6 Plus. I love it! I just wish it was bigger. I'm 6' tall and I'm pretty petite, but the 6 plus is so tiny, it's not comfortable to hold. It also doesn't have a case. I have a big enough pocket and I just have to tuck it in, which I don't like because it's so tiny. The back buttons are tiny, and the camera is small. I was looking at the Apple iPhone 6, but I really prefer the size of the iPhone 6 Plus, even though I have bigger hands. If I didn't have an iphoney 6 Plus on the way I'd be really happy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's very easy to use, the audio quality is great, it's very quiet, and it is quite fast.

I'm also happy to see that the switch can be used on the same side as the speaker (it was awkward to use on the other side). The only negative I have is that the speaker only plays the first song on your playlist, but then starts playing again when you close the program. Also, I'd like to have a volume knob like in some of the other speakers, but as it stands, it is easy to over-drive the speakers.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************* I have had my i-2 for about 2 months and love it. It is very easy to operate and the sound quality is great. The only thing I would like to see is a way to set it to vibrate when the screen is off so you don't have to constantly hit the power button. I would love to be able to set my phone to vibrating when it is off and be able then to set the i-5 to vibrates when it's in use. It also would be great if the i1 had a back light. It can be quite dark in there when the phone is on and you have to pull the phone out of your pocket.  Nice and portable: **** I bought this for my wife. She has the iphone but it's not the size of her. She likes the simplicity of the i2. I bought her a iphones and she can now take her iphonedecision for a walk or a run. It's nice to have a backup battery when your phone is out of juice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this for a while now. I can't say I'm very satisfied with it, but for a device that's supposed to be for the disabled it's surprisingly good. I do wish the volume and sound were a bit louder, but I do like the buttons and the volume rocker. The only downside is that you can only play music from an iPod or iPad on this device, but you can connect a MP3 player to it. It also doesn't play music in stereo, but the audio is OK for phone calls. I've heard about some issues with this device that are related to the user experience and not the product, but to me that's not really a problem. I still have a few issues with it (which are the same for every other device I've used), but I'll probably go back to my iPhone when my other phones are broken or have been stolen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this product to replace my old iPod mini. I am so happy I did. It is very quiet, is very small, and works great. It does not have as many features as the ipod mini, but I have the same type of music player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* I got this device on a loan, and I couldn't be happier. The only complaint I have about it is that it is difficult to see the battery level because the battery door is very small. It's very easy to get the batteries out, but it's a pain to do so. I have it mounted to my laptop, and the batteries are easily accessible. I'd buy it again, if I had the room to store it and it didn't take up too much room. Also, it has a very large and bright display, and can be turned off. It is not waterproof, and it's not the most powerful or the most stylish, but that's fine by me. I would definitely buy this device again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first electronic device that I own and it has been working fine. I am a new mom and this is my first baby monitor. I have not had a problem with it at all. I use it at home for keeping track of what time it is. It is nice to have it at work so I can see when my husband is getting home from work. The only problem I have had is the battery life. I usually leave it on all day for 2 hours and then take it off. Sometimes I have to take it with me to work in case I need to be back in my office in a few hours.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was a great product. The battery lasts for a long time and the remote is extremely handy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________________ I had the pleasure of purchasing the Apple iMac G3 (Mid 2006) at Best Buy in January of 2007. I bought the Apple PowerBook G4 in 1997 and have been a fan ever since. The G3 was one of the first Apple laptops to offer full HD and the best graphics available at the time. It also had a backlit keyboard with a separate arrow keys for the cursor keys and the numbers keys (also in the G4). I have a MacBook Air 13" and have used the Mac mini as my primary workstation. I love that I can take my Mac mini to work with me as well as the iMac. I was also pleased to see that it had a much larger hard drive (4TB) than the MacBook Air (2TB) - the iMate had 1TB and the iBook had 1.5TB. The iMac is still my daily driver and I'm looking forward to my new MacBook Air. - Mike, TX I'm in love with the iBooks and I was so happy when I heard Apple was finally coming out with the new iBook G3. - Linda, TX The iBook is a great machine. - John, MN The G4 is a fine machine, but the ibooks are even better. - Gary, FL I'm a big fan of the ibook and ibook G3 are my favorite Macs. - Tom, CA I bought my iBook in the 90's and it was my first Mac. It's the most reliable Mac I have ever owned. - Richard, CA My iBook 4G is my workhorse. It is a very dependable machine and has great support. The only thing that would make me change to another Mac is if Apple introduced the PowerBook. - Jim, WA I am so pleased with my new iMac 5,1 and the new powerbook. The new powerbooks have a much better build quality and look very cool. The Macbook is still the best all around computer for the money. - Bill, WA Thank you, Bill, for your feedback.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:................................................................................................................ I purchased this for my mother because she is in her mid-thirties and she uses a computer for work and for personal use. I've been looking for a portable computer for her to take on vacation. It's perfect for what she needs it for. I would recommend this device to any family member or friend who has an office computer...............................................................................................................................  Review by: jenny on Mar. 29, 2014 :  I have purchased two of these devices. The first one has been good and the second one has worked well. However, the screen doesn't always refresh properly so it's a bit slower to read the screen. The device is quite small and portable. I also have the original one so I don't know if this is a fault of the device or the battery but I've had to use the original version with the new battery for about a week now.  Good product, but batteries last for only a couple of months.  The new one will last a long time, but the original is still good for a couple months of work.    It seems that these batteries are a bit cheap, but this is what I have to work with.   One thing I'm sure will happen, the batteries may start to leak as time goes on, which will not be a problem as long as they are replaced.  "  (review of free book)  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's the first time I purchased the Sennheiser PC360. I was expecting a sub-par sound because the prices are so high, but I am pleased.

Cons: No microphone input.  the only con is the mic input, so you must buy a cable from sennheisers. .  and that is just a con. , but for the price i am not going to complain.  as long as you get the mic cable and mic that come with it, you will be fine.  in fact, for the size of my home studio it works really well.  a few small gripes though.  are they really that cheap? i mean the sound quality is better than my high end desktop mic,and it works great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this a few days ago for my husband and he loves it! He was very skeptical about the price and I was worried that it might not be the best thing ever but it is the best. The only problem is the battery that is supplied with it is just a piece of plastic and there is no juice in it, it is like having a flashlight. But I will keep it on my bedside table to use at night and when I need to have it on all the time and be in touch with my husband all the day. My son loves this toy!  He doesn't like toys that are too intense, so this one is a great balance between the two. The size of the toy is perfect for a boy his age and the sensations are intense.  This is a good choice for both boys and girls! Rated 5 out of 5 by Naughty from Very good! My daughter and I both loved this toy. It has a nice feel and great sensation to it. I used the bullet vibe to make him cum and that really got his heart racing. Rated 4 out of5 by Mommy from Good toy My son absolutely loves this. I've found that a couple of the batteries are broken so it's difficult to use them. But other than that, a very good toy. The good: -The size and power is perfect -I like the bullet shape because it is a little more versatile than the standard vibes -The vibrations are strong and can be felt from many places. -The bullet is nice because it's more discreet than the more expensive ones. I think the price is too high, though, so I would buy it again and give it to my husband The bad: -It's hard to recharge it -Some of the bullets don't work -I've tried to charge it and there's not enough juice in the battery pack so the toy won't be charged -It doesn't come with a bullet charger so you have to buy one separately -I think the charging cord is too short The not so good: I'm having trouble getting it to charge. It's not that the toy isn't working, but I have no idea why it can't recharge itself. I have to put a little bit of juice into it every few days. Overall: Â Â If you like to please your partner by getting them off then this toy is for you. Â It's super comfortable and works

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought two of these and one of them has a dead mic. i used to use a mic which was a Yamaha RX-10 and i had to get a replacement on the cheap on line, because i got a defective unit. these mic sound great! i dont know if this is a defect or just a bad mic but i got it on line for $10 so i guess it could be both. i had an older Yamaha mics and they were just as good. they had the same problems as this one. i guess its a good thing to have the older mics. i also have an older kenwood that works great, so i have a couple of these that work perfectly. the price is also really good if you want to get some good mics for the price. i have another kenwins but these ones are way better, they are also made by a great company.  Style of Music: Country, Rock  Overall Impression: The Kenwood XM-80 is the perfect combination of a traditional microphone and a good sound system. The sound is smooth, and the microphone is very easy to use. I would recommend the XM 80 if you are looking for a reliable, professional-quality microphone. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! The Epson ST50x (the model I bought) is a great product. I have a very large studio and it's a great way to have a single-use source of light for all my work. It also has great picture quality and a great build quality. I've even got a very nice one that is my first model and has the best image quality. There are a few issues though, such as the battery's life. There is no power management or auto-off feature so you have to turn it on each day, or the battery will die before you know it. The other issue is that you can only use it with the USB connector to the computer, so you will have to buy a separate adapter for that. The screen is also very tiny, but I think that's okay if you want to use it to do more than just read. The battery life is also good, but the screen can get hot when working for a long time. It's not a big deal but if you're on a tight schedule you will need to turn the screen off to save power. The included USB cable is not a good one though, because it's made of a thin plastic that tends to get hot and shortens the cable. Overall the ST50 is a good and well built product, and has a good price for a digital camera. If you need a single color source of lighting, you won't be disappointed with this model.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent value for the money This is a very good choice if you are a photo enthusiast. It does the job well for the price, it is well built and a nice design. The only thing I do not like about it is the screen. It is small and doesn't work with my monitor. It would be better to use a cable for the camera. But then the cable would be very short, the camera would be too big for my laptop, and I would need to buy an adapter to use my laptop. So I keep it and use it for my photography, but maybe the cable will become obsolete. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ It works well. I have had my device for about 2 months now and I've only had it out on the net to do some simple gaming and music. It's pretty quiet so far. The sound is good enough for most situations and it's a lot more than a simple sound bar. I've bought a few sound bars and this one is by far the best. I highly recommend this to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this for several years now. i love the ease of using it. the sound quality is great, the battery lasts a long time, and the sound is good, but it doesnt have that great sound of a good soundboard. i like the fact that it doesnt use batteries. the only bad thing is the fact there are 2 switches on the back. when i press the 2nd switch the 2 speakers turn on. that is annoying. but i can't complain too much.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jayme from This is the best thing I have used to mix music and podcasts since my first audiophile receiver. I have a vintage Sony Walkman, and with the help of this receiver I can mix in my studio with my mp3s and the mixes sound amazing. I also use this to listen to podcasts on my phone while I'm driving to work. I am using it with a Sonos wireless speakers to give my car a better sound.    The sound quality of this device is just phenomenal. I've been using it on a small set up, so I can't comment on how the sound gets better on a larger setup. The only thing that might be a little disappointing is the size. It's definitely bigger than I expected. I expected it to be slightly smaller than the iPhone and iPad. The built in speakers are a nice bonus, but I really wish I had bought one of the extra powered models.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- This is a really good device.

I recommend this computer to anyone who likes a screen that is easy to read and that doesn and can type.  the only problem i have is the battery life. it can last a day, maybe two if you use it only for web browsing, and I haven't used it for anything else.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________ The most powerful piece of gear I have ever used. It was a little slow on the first day but it is now the only electronic device I use. I have an old Motorola 68010 computer and I had bought the keyboard for it for $5 but it was in poor condition. The RCA cable is nice and sturdy and easy to install. I bought the unit in a large size so I am able to use it on both sides of my desk. I am very happy with the RCA connector. I recommend this device to anyone who wants a very powerful sound at a reasonable price. This unit is worth the money and I'm glad I have bought it.  I purchased a RCA jacks to plug into my computer. I thought I would like the R-3's but they sound just like the computer speakers. I'm going to try the XLR's, the XL2's, or the 1/4" jack.  the best, RCA 1/8" 1/2" RCA to XLR 1/16" R-5 1/32" XLR to XL1 1/64"  This is the best product I have purchased. I use my computer a lot and I use the R3 to run two channels of stereo audio. I like the fact that it can be used in a variety of applications and also I like that it is very easy to use and it is small. I also like the way it is made, it is sturdy and well constructed. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just received my Apple Watch and it is amazing, I'm a fitness freak, I love to run and I've tried other fitness watches and they don't work for me, the Apple Watch is the only one I can wear all day without feeling like I'm wearing a dumbbell! It's also easy to set alarms, do quick math, track calories burned, track my heart rate, and it's really comfortable to wear. If you are a runner and you are looking for a smartwatch that is great, easy to use, and will help you stay healthy, the Watch is definitely for you! I am already a huge Apple fan, but now I have a new favorite! The only thing I would like to see on the device is a "backlight" option that can be turned on and off. I have my Apple TV with a backlight but that's about it. I also would like the option to switch the device to airplane mode (which you can only turn on and turn off with the remote). I use the Apple TV as my main computer and my Watch as my smartwatch, it works perfectly well together. My only complaint would be the screen isn't the brightest it could be.  There are two options to increase the brightness, one is to buy the Apple Lightening cable which is $19.99 at Amazon, and another is to purchase a light diffuser, which is expensive and is the cheapest way I can think of to increase brightness. I bought the Apple cable to save on shipping but after using it for about 10 days I found that it wasn't doing much good to me and the brightness is just the same as it was.  If you're a fitness person and you're looking for the best smartwatch out there, the  Apple Watch is your best bet!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's the first time i bought this brand but i think it's a good buy.   I bought it to use with my iPhone, and it worked perfect for that. The only thing i didn't like is the lack of a mic, it's pretty much useless in that case. But that's a pretty small issue compared to the device itself.  - Good price and a good product!  - Good sound quality  " I think that this mic is very good and has a great tone. But it is very hard to mount it on a stand as it is so small and the mount is very tight, and that is a big issue because it does not allow you to place it on the back of a desk and is just impossible to get the mic in position. If you are looking for a good quality mic with a small size it is a good choice, but i would not recommend it to a first time buyer. "   - I bought it for a friend. He said it was very nice and it was small and light.  (Verified Buyer)

It's easy to charge and is well built. It has a nice and wide viewing angle, and you can use it on your desk to watch movies and play games. The battery lasts for about a week. I've never had an issue with it. Rated 5 out of 5 by John from The iSticks are amazing! I've used this product for about two weeks now and I'm happy with it's durability and ease of use. I was hesitant to purchase a portable battery because it doesn't seem like a good value, but I was pleasantly surprised. The device is easy to use and has a lot of battery power, which is why I'm using it for my PC. It is very simple to charge the battery. The only drawback I have found is that the battery life is not as long as some of the other battery options, but that is to be expected. It definitely is worth the investment, especially if you're looking for an awesome portable battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This unit is a great value and works perfectly. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fact that it is not easy to set up and get working. You have to take the unit apart in order to access the battery and power switch. I would recommend this unit to someone that is interested in purchasing one but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the dvd player about a month ago and I love it. I have the sony and have been very happy with it. However, when it came to the dvds, I found them to be way overpriced. It came with 4 dvd and 4 dvd's which is a little over priced. I bought the 5th dvd for only a few dollars less then the 4 dvs. I am a huge fan of the dvc, and I will probably keep buying from you guys, but I will buy this one again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This is the best thing since sliced bread. I purchased this for my 9 year old son who has had some medical issues. This device allows him to read books and listen to music without interruptions. I have had several devices that have worked great, but this one has been great for him and I can't imagine not having it. I am very happy with my purchase and the customer service from the company was great. I will purchase more items in the future.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is very powerful, with enough memory to hold the number of channels in the main menu and also to hold all my favorites (I have a lot). I have no complaints, although the unit can be a little slow for some of the more complicated functions, like adding channels. The only problem is that there's no built in speaker or microphone, so you have to use an external speaker and microphone to get through the sound, but if you can live with that then it's a great little radio.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a great machine, with good range and features. If you want to have a full time video or sound mixer you can't go wrong with this.    Write a negative review about the same product but with better features:  The Korg MS-20 is a good synth, but it has no internal speakers. So there is no sound coming out of the unit. It's not a big deal for a beginner, but for a professional, it would be a big problem.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this in late 2009. It's just fine for the price. I used it on my main computer for a while and then I transferred it to my daughter's laptop. My daughter loves it! Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device :  There is a "tongue" on the front of the box, but it is a rubber type. When the device is plugged in, the rubber kind of slips off and is very hard to insert. It also has an annoying sound when you turn it on or off. I have no idea how I can fix this, but I can't imagine that it would be any better with a rubber tongue. Write an unfavorable review about the poor quality of an electronic device in general :   The price point for this device is just too high. I don't know how long the batteries will last. The "T" that is in the middle is just annoying to use and the device gets warm when it's plugged in. It is not worth the price that it's charging at. I do have a few other items that I bought from here and they all have a rubber "T", so I would say that the rubber "t" that they use is more like a "sticky" rubber than anything else.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought the msm7141a because it is a very good radio. The main problem is that it can't talk with other msm radios because they do not use a same frequency. I'm not sure if there is a way to have the two radios talk on the same frequency (maybe through some sort of digital modulator?) or if I have to buy a different radio for the same band. The other thing I wish was different is that the msp7141b has a built-in cassette deck. So I bought a sony msp-s55 which works fine. The msm-7141 is also a good radio but the built- in cassettes and cassette deck are a plus!  Noise, sound and picture quality: --------------- Excellent sound quality. Very good sound quality with no static at all. There is also no distortion or hiss, but the picture quality is a little bit worse than I was expecting. The pictures and video are very clear and crisp.  User Ratings: 2 Spanish Review by F.M.O.M.; Edited by F-S.L.P.O; 1.1 English Review by K-S.; 1.2

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! I have been searching for a new electronic device to replace my old laptop and I found this one. I like the fact that it can be used as a keyboard and mouse. The fact that the keyboard has the ability to move up and down is really helpful. I have found that the mouse is a little slow and not as precise as I had expected, but I think that is a small price to pay for the functionality.  Best of all, this thing is cheap! I bought this a few weeks ago and I am absolutely happy. The mouse is so good that I don't want to use any other. It is easy to program, easy to navigate, and the quality of the mouse and the buttons are just superb. This thing has been amazing!  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the KK2, as I was going to purchase a new one. The product was well packaged and arrived on time. I had a hard time finding a USB port on the back for the device, but the user guide says you can use the cable with the USB port. I bought the cable in order to hook it up to a printer that uses the USB cable. I just wanted to mention that the device works very well with my printer, I have a USB hub connected to my computer and use a separate cable to connect to the printer. The unit is very quiet, but doesn't feel like it would be loud enough to annoy other people when in use. I would recommend this product.

I use this to record my tv shows so it would not take up much space on my computer. I have also had this as a "good for the price" device and it has worked well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- The first time I used the iStick 100 I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and versatility of the device.

I'm very pleased with the performance of this device. This is definitely a device for those that love to listen to music while they work and I'm extremely pleased with that.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!! This device is amazing!!! I bought it about 2 months ago and i just bought my first e-cigarette! I was really excited to try this one because i like the way the flavor comes out but my favorite is the taste of a cig, not as bad as i expected but still very nice! I've smoked 2 cigarettes with this and the last one i smoked the taste was perfect! I will definitely buy it again!!!  5 out of 5 Amazing I am a big fan of the "cigar" style of e-cigarettes, but was always frustrated by the way that they always burned my coils. So, I bought a "diamond" style vape and was so excited to find that it was so much easier to vape. I have to say that I am absolutely delighted with my purchase! It's so easy to use, the flavor is fantastic, and I love the fact that I can change my coil on the fly and it's all built right in. I also got a bonus pack of cigalikes for my husband. So happy with my new purchase!  3 out of 3 Very Satisfied I've bought several e-cigs, but I really like the flavor and ease of use of the VooDoo Diamond. The only downside is that it has a bit of a short circuit issue which makes it difficult to use while vaping. I'm hoping they will address that issue with a firmware update.  1 out of 1 found this review helpful The device itself is awesome but the atomizer is useless and does not stay in the atomiser. If it were possible I would buy a different brand of atomiser but with the price tag you can't expect anything better. I really thought it was going to be great but it's a dud  4 out of 4 good deal great device! It has an awesome battery life and the battery life is pretty good too! It really helps with flavor  2 out of 2 found this reviews helpful The vape is good for a beginner. I just want to say I got this on a sale so I thought I would give it a shot. This is my first vape and it has been very hard to use. The battery life on the vape is pretty much non existent. I had to buy another battery after a few weeks. Also the taste is very nice. The quality of the product is very good. It looks like it was made by someone that loves vaping. If you're
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I'm a fan of the e-Reader, the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Paperwhite. However, the last two have been unreliable. After the first, I was sure that the reader would be back. Unfortunately, it seems that my second device is defective as well. I had it replaced at my local Best Buy, and it arrived as described. I read the instructions carefully, and had a quick test of the new device, but after that, nothing. The battery was drained within the first few days. It is now almost dead, and the reader doesn't show any activity on the device. I've tried all the usual troubleshooting methods:  -Turning the reader on and off,  --Turning it on and on and then off, but no response.  I am a computer repairman and I've seen some really bad things, but I have never seen anything like this. I have contacted Amazon's customer service, and I am awaiting a response. I just can't recommend these products anymore.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The A-10 Thunderbolt II, while not being a great value for money, is a great aircraft. It's the best air to ground missile in the game.  It's fast, it's hard to hit, and it does a good job against any enemy that you can find.   It's a nice surprise to see the original aircraft in the COD, considering it was originally developed as an anti-ship missile.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought the Zune and I love it! The music is great, the sound is perfect, and the screen is really easy to use. I have had my Zune for almost 4 years now and I have only used it a couple of times and the battery has run out of 2 times. But that was before I got the battery pack that came with it. I don't know why they don't make the battery packs bigger, but they should have. But the Zunes battery is a killer, it will keep you going for hours! I really enjoy the way this thing works, the touch screen works well. The controls are very easy to understand and use. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to delete songs when you get tired of them. But overall, I would recommend this product to anyone that likes to listen to music on the go. I bought this a few weeks ago, and I like it. It's very easy and fast to use and the songs I've been listening to have been very good. The battery life is good as well. The problem is that the ZUNE will not charge from a car charger. If you're using the ZUNES in a car, you'll need to have a plug converter in the car to get the ZUENS to charge from the wall outlet. This is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. This review is not about the music but about the software. The ZUNE software is terrible and buggy. The "featured" applications are not good at all. They will only recognize your music file if you're not signed in to the ZEN Store. And there's no way to search for music by artist, album, or genre. You have to sign in to your ZEN account (or have an account) to do this. It would be nice if they would add this functionality. ZUNE software does not allow you to create a playlist of your songs or change the order of songs in a playlist. You have to search the web to find out how to do it. Another thing you cannot do with ZUNE is search for artists and albums. You can search on a genre (like rock) but not on an artist (like the Beatles). The only way to do that is to go to a music site (like Pandora) and search for a specific artist or album. I wish I could use this software to search through

The good: - Easy to use - Very good sound quality - Good battery life - Easy on and off - Very quiet when used - Very nice look (I'm a fan of the "fog" look) The bad: - You have to make sure you use the right batteries - If you have a small head it can be difficult to turn on/off (even if you hold the button for a second) - Some of the buttons are too close together for my liking - The remote seems to get stuck on the back (I don't know if it's a bad button or if it gets stuck in the battery holder) The charger: _____________________________ - Good charger - I bought this charger because I'm a beginner and was nervous about the price - I've only been using it a few times - It charges all of my batteries within 3 hours.

I did a quick search on the web and found that you can only use it as a pen. You can not write on it or use it to draw on anything. I found this to be very disappointing. I would suggest that you try another brand of pen or a pencil that will work on your computer. It's a shame.  Rated 4 out of 5 by M from The pen is nice, but the keychain doesn't. The pen has good size and weight, and the key chain is very nice and works well. I like that you have to remove the pen from the key ring before using it.  of the 5, we really liked the product and have received many compliments. However, our only complaint is that the key clip is not interchangeable. It is made of metal and is very hard to detach from the holder. We have tried several other options to get the clip to work and to no avail. If you have a key chain for a cell phone, a laptop or something else, this may work for you. We are looking at another purchase to replace this one. We really wanted the clip. ...  Great Pen I love this pen. It has a great feel in the hand and works great for writing letters.

I was always a very happy iphones user and this new phone has really made me like the ilegals. The new design of the phone is really awesome, I do not have to worry about dropping my phone or damaging it, the screen is a huge improvement over the iplegals, the camera is great as well and the touch screen is easy to navigate on. I use this phone almost every day now. It is very easy to keep up with my work and I have never had any problems. The camera on the ivegals is not as good as the new iphon 5s and the ives is more of a "phone" and not the ivisitce of a camera, but it is good enough to keep me in business. The ive is great for a travel phone, but you have to remember you have the iving on a very small screen, so you can only carry it with you. I would say the iven5s is my new iplegs phone, I can't wait to see what the ignis will be like when it is released in June, I will most likely buy that phone also. ,(Posted on 4/22/2013, edited on 7/19/2014) ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________ This is a very good portable wireless speaker. It's a little louder than I expected, but it's a nice, comfortable speaker that I can use with my iPod. It doesn't seem to draw too much attention when I'm on the subway or in a crowded bar. The one drawback is that it's hard to get the cord to the power adapter attached when it's in the car or when the speakers are in use. However, the adapter makes it easy to connect to my car's wall outlets. I'm a bit concerned that this product might be too expensive for some people who just want a decent sound. However if you like to listen to music while you work and are on the go, it's great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I got this for my husband and he's been using it for about a month now. I thought it would be a good starter unit for him. He's a beginner and it's nice to have something that's not too heavy to hold. I wish there was a way to control the volume, but for now he has found a good one for his needs. The only negative I can find about it is the fact that it's only USB 2.0 and doesn't work with my computer. Other than that I give it a five.  Great sound: *************** The sound quality is fantastic. The built in speaker is loud and crisp. The bass is nice and deep and it has a good sound. It can be used with a pair of headphones, or just a stereo with the included adapter. I used this with a JBL X10 speaker system and it sounded amazing. This is definitely a great addition to my home theater system. The adapter also makes it possible to use it with other devices such as my iPhone. This unit is easy to set up and use. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again in the future. -Mike  Excellent Sound: ******************* The Sound system on the Sony DSC-P100P is a very nice sound system. I use this with my iPad and it works flawlessly. I was concerned with the sound quality on the original unit that came with the P-Series but it is better than I expected. I am very happy with the unit and the sound. I do wish the controls were a bit more intuitive but overall a great product.

I was worried that I would not be able to use my laptop for long periods due to the size of the screen. The size of this screen makes it so easy to get things done on a small screen. If I wanted to play a game, I could easily play with the keyboard or mouse while the screen was in use. The keyboard and mouse have to be a little more precise but I am very happy with the purchase. I am going to order a bigger screen for my laptop.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********  This is my first Philips HID device. I got it for Christmas last year and I was extremely happy with the product. The device is very easy to set up and I've been using it all winter. I like that you can switch it on and off so I don't have to constantly take it off and on. I would definitely recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I have been using this for over a year now, and have found that it is an excellent product for any occasion. The size of the case is very convenient, and I am able to carry it in my backpack, so I can use it at any time. The screen is bright and clear, the audio quality is excellent, and it is well built. I highly recommend this product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by David from Good product with a good price. Works well. I bought this a year ago for a special occasion, a birthday party. It worked great and I got great feedback. I have used this in a number of occasions since and it has been very easy to set up and use. I am very happy with the purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone6s Plus  I use my iphones a lot. I have the iphona 6s plus and I have no complaints about it. It's a good phone. I would recommend it to anyone.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, October 03, 2012  by: Mike from CA USA  Review: I have been using my ips from 10 years and i still use it. The best thing about ips is it's size. I like the way that ips are so compact. The size is perfect for me. The design is so elegant.  the only negative is that the volume button has to be held down when you put the phone in your pocket because it doesn't come with the right size button. ,  But this is my favorite ips. I will never go back.  "My ips ips"  This is the most comfortable ips that I own. I used to have a iphonas 3 and I never want to go back to that phone.  of course there are cheaper ips out there, but I like these ips best and I'm not a big fan of flip phones. .  as long as the price is right, you will not find a better ips on the market. :)  Pros:  light weight  great battery life  strong build  good design  comfortable design . Cons: , the volume rocker button is not a little "flip" type  (they are actually flat buttons)  "best ips ever"  (great review by Anonymous)  to get the best out of your ips i recommend using the original ips battery from the first ips  Great ips for the money.  in addition to this i also recommend the bluetooth headset. its not expensive but it is worth it to have the best ips around. "I use ips exclusively" -Mike  Overall, I am very happy with the ips and would highly recommend it. I am currently using the ixp3 and I like it so much I purchased a ipsplus (and a bluetooth adapter) to have both. The ips have made my life a lot easier and they do their job perfectly.  a big thanks to ips!  Cons:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************** This is a very useful device, it has lots of functions. I can use it to record audio, record and play back video, and play and pause music. I used to use a computer with a CD player, so I was used to it, but the ability to record and then playback video at will is a great feature. If you need a digital camera, but don't have a camera that takes video, this is a good solution. ***************** It has a few flaws: 1. The battery is very weak. 2. The microphone doesn't work very well. 3. The buttons are very tiny, but easy to get used to. 4. The batteries last about a month and a half. *********** I don't recommend this, unless you need to take pictures of people. The device is very heavy. The remote has a large button on it, and there is no way to find the "menu" or any other way to change settings. **************
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a computer that could be used to surf the internet with, not a computer with lots of features but one that had a good screen, decent keyboard, and decent trackpad. I went through several models but found a model called the V60D with the Intel Core i5 processor. The screen was not good but the keyboard was fine, I like that they have an option for a touchscreen. I have only had it a few days but have been very pleased with it. I do have some problems with the touch screen but I think I'm going to take it apart and try to fix them. A few of the reviews on here are very positive. I like the fact that it has a lot of features. I think this model is a good buy but I'm not sure if it will last me long enough. I bought this for my son who just got his driver's license and wants to use it to surf and play video games.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!This was my first e-reader and it worked great. I had the e-ink and it was just fine, I just have a few complaints about the device itself. My wife bought the same one. The top of the reader does not sit flush on my desk. The plastic cover does not stay in place when the cover is removed. The rubber cover on the bottom of the eReader is very loose. The cover on mine came off at the top and it fell off with a loud bang. The second e-Reader I have had was of much better quality and is much more stable. I have no other complaints about this eReader. I would definitely recommend it to a friend who is looking for a good quality electronic device for their books.

I have been using it for about two months now and have found that it is a good choice for my needs. I use it for my work as well as for personal use. I like that it has an integrated screen that shows my time for the day as well. I also like that there are a couple of apps that I can use to control the sound and monitor my computer and phone. The sound quality is very good and I am pleased with the volume control. I am not sure why I waited so long to get a good digital watch, but I am glad I did. I would recommend this watch to others who like the look and feel of a mechanical watch and want a digital display for their computer or phone.

It's a little hard to hear on the player so I get my music off of my iPod. .  on the Yamaha it doesn't sound very clear and the bass is too loud, but for $100 less than the RX-7K and not much more then the RX7K, it is a great player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my husband, as he was having problems with his old iPod. He was a big Apple fan before he lost his iPhone, so I figured I'd give this one a try.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________ I'm a fan of electronic devices, but I'm not the biggest fan of the touch screens of the iPad and iPhone. I thought that the Sony VTC6A was very nice and simple to use. I just use it to record videos on my laptop and on my phone. The sound is clear, the sound is rich, and the sound quality is great. The only thing I'd like to see is a little more screen real estate for the song information screen. It's not that big of a deal but it would be nice to see the song name at the top of the screen, with the song title and song length.  Style of Music: Indie Rock  Suggested For: Anyone who is looking for a simple, easy-to-use device to record music and enjoy the process of making music. .  the VTC 6A __________________________________________________ This is my first audio device I've purchased. The Sony V TC 6A is the best value and I will be purchasing another soon. This is a fantastic product for recording and making music on the go. It is very easy to use and easy to navigate. The built in mic is great and it's very easy for my students to use this device. The battery life is great! I have a little over an hour of use before I need to charge it and I still have almost half an hour left. The audio quality is good and the V TC6A is a great price point for a quality device. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product. Thank you Sony for making such an excellent product!  Great Product - Great Value! __________________________________________ I have owned two of these and they are my most used products.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good product. I use it for a few things, mainly video editing and playing games on my iphone. It's good quality, but I wish the battery would last longer. I can barely squeeze through the hour and a half a day it takes to make a film or two. I'll try to replace it soon.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, March 17, 2015  It's a good device  by David from San Francisco CA USA  Pros: Easy to use, light weight. .    Cons: The battery is very small. If you have a large battery or a lot of video you'll run out of power very quickly. Also, there are no headphone ports.  is a small, light, and versatile video/photo camera. It records in 16:9 (16:9 is 1.85x1.35) and allows you to record at 1080p and 720p. It comes with a nice carrying case that holds the camera, a USB cable, and a 1-year warranty.   You can't get a better camera at this price point.   (Although I do wish the video could be recorded at 1080 or 720p). I have the Canon VIXIA HF R7000 that I used in high school and college. The VIXIA HF is about 2x the price, and it is very similar in quality. The only difference is that the HF is much better quality and more comfortable to use.  , but the video is still too low resolution for a professional looking camera.  "The Video is too low to be professional looking". You are right, the video quality is a big problem with this camera. The resolution is too high and the recording time is too short. I don't use the camera much, so I can't comment on how much it would help me with my projects. But for an everyday camera it's fine, it's good for a hobbyist who is looking to record in 1080p or 720 p. It doesn't have any sound though. It has a nice build quality. I am not sure if it is worth it for me, but for a beginner like me it's a great buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- This is a very nice piece of kit. It is really easy to use, and it does what I needed it to do. However, I would suggest getting a good microUSB cable, as I was having a few problems with it. It does seem to be a bit of a hassle to change it out as there are no instructions, and if you don't like the look of the case, you may want to try a different case. I don't really like the colour, but at least it has the right connector for the headphones. This is one of those things that you get what you pay for, and I got exactly what I paid for with this unit. --------------- I was very disappointed with this product. I wanted to like this unit as I like my Nighthawk and was hoping that it would be a step up from my N, but it is far from it. If you are looking for a great sounding, reliable, and easy to control headphone amplifier, this is the unit for you. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for high end headphones and a high end sound, this unit has none of that and it's for those people who want a simple, reliable headphone amplifier. -------------- I like the sound quality of the Nighthawks. They are really good, very well balanced. I was looking at other models to replace the N's but I can't afford to buy the other models. This unit is just not what I wanted. It doesn't sound like a N. It sounds like a cheap stereo amp. I had the same problem with the N8 which I replaced with a Tungsten unit. It still doesn't compare to the N10's and even the N9. If I had to give it a minus I would say that it is a little hard to set up, you have to use a screwdriver to turn it on, the volume is a bit noisy, and the amp isn't very loud. I also wish that it had a switch to turn off the input signal so that the amplifier won't get too loud. ------------- The N10 has really great sound quality, and this unit is no exception. It's just that the sound is very clean, it doesn't have that 'high end' sound that I like. I'm not sure how it compares to the Tungsteens or the Beyer T1's but they are great headphones. I wouldn't recommend this amp to a beginner or someone who wants
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ This is my first time using an electric mixer but I'm very pleased with it. I have a small, old-fashioned kitchen mixer and have used it for years. However, the size is not what I was looking for when I first bought this mixer. I am very satisfied with this mixer as a mixer that can easily handle heavy duty applications such as baking, blending, and mixing. I also like that I can get the mixer very close to the source of the ingredients without needing to use a larger mixer, or having to remove the entire mixer to add the ingredients. I like how this mixer is so easy to use that even a person who doesn't have a lot of experience can use it. It is very quiet as well.

I have had no problems with it so far. I bought the mini-cameras as well. I was expecting them to be cheaper but they are only $15 a piece and are the best option for a camera in a 3d printing. I would definitely recommend this printer over the cheaper 3d printers.  is it a good printer I would say yes but not the best. I wanted to buy it because it has a few more features then other 3ders out there. It has a better software and is better built. The price is good for it and if you have any problem with it then just return it and get a better one. I haven't used it as much as the other 3Ders but so far the printer works as good as the others. I've also purchased the camera which is great. It is also good if you want to get in on the 3d Printing revolution.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was able to purchase this unit to replace a broken one. The sound quality is great and the unit can handle all my needs. The only problem I have is that the unit comes with the unit that you use to listen to music. I purchased the stereo and the headphones separately and had to return the stereo because the cables on the stereo came apart. So, you are going to have to get a new stereo, which I did, and it was a bit pricey. I would buy it again if I needed to. It is great that you can purchase one unit with both the headphone and the stereo included. The headphones sound great, so if you don't like the stereo, I think this would be a good buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first time using a smart watch, and I'm very pleased with it. The watch is beautiful and fits my lifestyle. I have a few friends who use watches, but most people I know don't like them and they are usually expensive. I am a big fan of Android Wear, but there's a reason Apple doesn't make them, and it has nothing to do with price. I'm looking forward to the future with this watch and hope it is a better experience than the last Apple watch. Review Summary:  It was hard to pick a top three because I wanted something a little more unique and original, and a little less expensive. The Samsung Gear S2 is a great watch. I've worn it for several weeks now and it's still going strong. I highly recommend it, and would buy it again. Product Review:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first and last time using the iStick. My first experience with the product was the initial purchase, I was excited and wanted to get it right away but the shipping was very slow, I called customer service and they told me they would get back to me and get it to me ASAP. But they never did. And when I was able to get my order, it was a bit different than the image that was shown in the description. I was expecting the same product and it was not what I was getting. I have never been more disappointed with a company. And I'm going to return this product.  Write a negative review about an electronic device :  I am a huge fan of this product but I will probably never buy this again. I thought the packaging was beautiful and the color of the button was great. The first time I plugged in my device the screen light came on but then the light would go out after 15 minutes. I tried plugging it in again and it would not charge. I did the same thing and got a "Low voltage." I thought this was a fluke but then it happened again and again and the same story. When I finally got it to work I was extremely disappointed. The buttons are very stiff and the battery life is not very good. I had to do a hard reset and then reboot. The quality of the product is great but I don't know how long it can hold a charge. If I would have known the battery would last less than a month I would not have bought this product again.

The device came very fast, but there was one little issue. The device would stop working after about 4 hours of use, and I couldn't figure out why it was going to that. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【Celeron】 The Celeron is a fantastic phone with a very good design, the camera is very good, and the screen is very sharp. If you are a user of a GSM phone, this is a good option. If the phone is a GPRS, it's still good but you will probably have to upgrade.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Good product.  by: Paul from Woburn MA on 2/27/2018  I was a bit worried about buying a computer because it didn't have any software installed. But after installing Windows 10, it's been great. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's a bit of a slow starter, and the keyboard needs a bit more love. But overall, it was a great buy. -Paul  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** This is the second set of the same device that i have. It was well built and the batteries lasted long enough for the trip i was going on. I was very pleased with the sound quality and the way the buttons work. It is really easy to setup and set up.  Rated 5 out of 5 by dave from Great little gadget I use this little rig all the time with my Canon 6d. I use a portable music player on a tripod that fits inside the case and works just like a good stereo. I used to use a radio receiver but it just never worked well with the small size of the camera. This rig is great for both of those situations. The built in headphones are a great feature and the included batteries last a long time. The only thing I don't like is that there is no built in Wi-Fi. I would've liked to be able to use it to stream music to a tablet or other devices.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm a little surprised to say the least because this has become a favorite. I had an old cell phone and was not very impressed with it but I really needed to make calls to my wife and kids. I found this to be a good replacement and for the price I can't beat it. I would recommend it to anyone. I will say though it is a little loud and a little heavy but I have no problem with that. It is definitely better than a cell phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I really like the sound quality of this device.  The volume is a bit loud for my taste, but that is due to the volume control not being set to max.   I don't have much bass so I really like having a bit of bass.  I have no problems with it being too loud.  This is the only sound quality that I don`t like, but I will still purchase this device if I have the chance. I have not found a headphone that works with this soundcard.  It is great but there are no good headphone out there that will work with this card.  You have to get the external amplifier to get it to work.  I just received this item.  The item is very well packaged.  However the packaging is a little thin, so be careful.  Once I received the headphones, the sound was ok.  My ears are not too sensitive to sound so I don´t really have any problem with the sound, but if you have sensitive ears, you may not be able to hear what the person next to you is saying.  Overall, I would buy this again if I had the chance to get another one.  There are better soundcards out there. The headphone amplifier is a great feature.  All of my friends think that this is the best headphone amplifier that I have ever heard.  A nice feature of the amplifier is that you can turn it on or off by just using the button on the back.  If you are looking for a good headphone amplifier, this is a good one. Good product. It is very convenient to get music to my computer. The sound is ok, but not really great. I am looking for some better headphones. I recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _______________________________________________  The A-100 I bought it for my husband as a backup to the more expensive A-200 and was very impressed with the performance and ease of use.  My husband is an amateur radio operator and he is very pleased with the features. The antenna is also very good and the receiver is very quiet. I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants a small, portable and effective device. :)  Excellent.  I am using this with my HF rig, and the signal strength is very good. The ability to choose a range is very handy, too. The A-101 is not cheap, but it's very well made, and it's good for the price. I highly recommend this radio for anyone looking for a good portable unit, that's well made and very affordable.

Great features for a great price! I love it!  Great buy, good quality: -------------- The product itself is great. The charger has a nice long cord that I don't feel like it gets tangled up in my backpack. The buttons are smooth and easy to push, but they aren't too stiff and the battery life seems to be fine. I use it every day at work so far and it works fine.  The best USB charger I've used: --------------- I have had this charger for over a year now and love it. I donít know why I didnít buy it earlier. I have multiple devices and this thing has been able to charge them all with ease.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!  This is a very useful tool! I have had a number of these for several years now and have been very pleased. I have a high-end Sony digital camera that does not have a battery grip so this is a godsend. I also use the cable for a digital timer so I can use the power on battery without having to use the remote control to turn on the power, which is really nice. The only thing I would like to see is a way to change the settings, so that I could turn off the "hot" settings for the flash and just use the flash at 1/8th power, and then change to a standard power for the camera. The remote control also does not work when the camera is on battery. Other than that I highly recommend this!  Just a word of advice - be very careful to not over use this tool. The battery life is very short and it's very sensitive.   I use this to charge the camera when not in use. This makes it a good tool for taking photos, but be very aware of the time you are spending on this battery. It only lasts about 3 minutes.   of all the gadgets i've ever bought it's probably my favorite  i love the remote! the light is also very useful when you have to work in low light or when you're working in the dark. I like the fact that the battery doesn't last for long, which gives me extra time to use it.  If you're going to buy one, get the USB. That's the one I got. This thing is a beast, even if you don't have a flash, and you should always have a backup on hand.  to each their own! 'some time on battery', and a battery light for the power button  I have one and love it. It has worked great for me for years. I use it to charge my iPad battery when it is out of juice. I don't know why everyone complains about battery life, it is what it is. If you don' t like the battery life I would get a different model.  the only thing i don't like is the small size of the batteries.  in all honesty, the battery is a little hard to change out but not to bad.  a good little gadget  It's just a little cumbersome to use, and the batteries aren't really rechargeable, so be prepared to

It seems the sound is not too bad if you adjust the settings. I have the hifi one and i like it better.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mandy from A must have for home theater! I bought this with my HD receiver for my home theater. This is the best, best sounding, and most cost effective, home theater surround sound receiver that I have ever owned. My old receiver was a Pioneer BDP-105 and this one is even better. The soundstage is so big and it's really clear and open. The surround effect is so clear and I love the way it blends with the movie soundtracks. I also bought the Bluetooth system and it works great. You can use a bluetooth headset and get an amazing surround sound experience. The bluetooth is not wireless, but it can be connected wirelessly using a blu-ray or an android phone or tablet. The setup was so easy and the sound was so good that I never had to use my old receiver again. The best!  Sound is very good. No distortion at all. Sound quality is very high quality.  and great sound.  the bluetooth sound is amazing! .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.......................................I was extremely disappointed to find out that my Tascam DR-40 digital recorder did not have an audio out jack. I've had it for a couple years, and it was my primary recording device. This was an obvious oversight. But then I noticed that the DR-60 also has an audio input jack. So I bought the DR60 and have been very pleased. It's so easy to use, it doesn't need to be plugged into the wall or into a PC. It records on any sound system I have. If I had bought this before I found out about the audio out, I would have saved myself a lot of time. I am using this on a computer with an external mic and a guitar amp and the audio is clear and precise. The audio is very clear and accurate. I don't think the recording quality is quite up to the DR40, but it is not a bad recording. I would not hesitate to recommend this recorder to anyone who wants a good, affordable, easy-to-use digital recorder that records at high quality sound.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Sound This is the first digital recorder I have ever owned. It is a nice unit. It has a great audio quality. You can record up to 24 tracks with it. I have had mine for over a year now. The only problem is that the battery dies fast. It does not hold a charge for more than a couple days. You have to replace it every 6 months. It also does not have a memory function. If you have a lot to say and need it in a hurry you can download your recordings. I love the quality of the recording. It works great for me. I do not record a lot, but I can record at any point in a song. If someone was to see my audio files, they would never believe that the music came from my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have the Apple iPad and it's a wonderful device! It's easy to use and is fast, and the screen is bright and has good contrast. I use the touch screen a lot and find it great for doing a lot of things on my computer. I've never owned an iPad before, but am considering getting one for my son and daughter, and their kids, too. The other night, I was playing a game and the iPad suddenly had my character jumping into my character's mouth and out of the game. The next day, I tried to play the game and couldn't, so I thought I would try the touch version. I thought it was going to work fine, but when I started to turn it on and off, the game froze and I had to restart it. After a few minutes of trying to figure out what was wrong with the game, I figured it out. I can't use the iPad for games, music, or movies. If I want to play music or movies on it, I have to play them on my desktop computer, or on my iPhone. I don't use it much for email, but the ability to send photos to friends and family via email is awesome. Overall, it's an awesome device and I highly recommend it. I wish it had an optical drive so I could use the device as a desktop computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It has been an excellent device and it's just so simple to use. The only negative thing about this product is that there is no way to control the volume without turning the unit on and off. Rated 5 out of 5 by T_B from Excellent Product I have a Sony A-1000 camcorder and was having trouble getting it to work with the camera. I decided to try the Sony A3000 camcorders and they were very easy to use and the sound quality was great. This unit is also very easy on the eye. It takes up very little room in the studio and it does not use a lot of electricity. It is also a good value for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very impressed with the quality and ease of operation of the E-TECH C3, especially when compared to other portable radios.  It's easy to setup, it works very well, and I am very pleased with the overall performance.  The price is a little steep, but I think the quality is worth it.  I'd like to see a larger screen, but it works just fine for a quick call.  And the battery lasts forever!  The only reason I give it a 3/5 is because of the volume control.  There's no volume knob or anything.  When you press down on the volume knob, it just stops and the volume does nothing.  In a small space like this, it would be nice to have a little more "thump" when you press the knob down.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I use this device for my hobby of making model airplanes. I have been using this for a few months and it has worked great. It was the best decision I have made. I use it on a small scale and it works great. I will be buying more for my other hobby as well. It does take some time to get the calibration to be correct but I have not had any problems at all. I do not use it for flight simulators so I cannot give any advice on that. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make their own models. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fact that you have to wait a few minutes for the unit to calibrate. However, it is worth the wait. It works very well and I am very happy with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Eon-R2  is a fantastic and easy to use digital stereo receiver with a superb set of features and quality.  This is the only one I would recommend! I really love the Eon system. The Eon R2 is the most flexible and reliable receiver ever made for the money. I would like to add that I have not experienced any interference, and have only had it for a couple of days. It is a great receiver and I will be recommending it to all my friends. It works very well, and I have a few of them in my home theater.  The only complaint I have is that the remote control does not have a power switch, it has to be used by pushing the power button on the back of the remote. I have been looking for one of these in the past few months, but there is none out there that I could find.  Overall, a very great receiver. 5 stars is a generous rating for this receiver. This is one of my favorite products for my home and studio. This receiver is perfect for what I want to do. I can set up two different stereo receivers to one subwoofer, with one on my left and the other on my right. The subwoofers work very well together, and the system is really amazing.  My favorite feature is the stereo switch, which lets me set up one receiver with my left earphone in the center of the speakers, while the right earphone is on the left. You can even turn it all the way up and use the left earphones in the middle of the left speakers. This system gives me the freedom to set up my speakers to my liking, without having to worry about a left or right stereo that might not be where I need it.  It's just awesome.  This is a very powerful, very versatile receiver. It's a great system.

Great features like Siri and the ability to use the camera, it just works. I also like the screen and the way the phone feels in my hand.

I have had it for about a week now and I've been able to get decent quality sound on my laptop, but on my phone it has always had some sound drops. It does get quite loud. The battery life is good. I haven't really had any problems with it but it's not a high end noise cancelling headset so if you're looking for something a little more than a good quality headset, this one might not be for you.

The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because it is a little hard to charge. The button to charge is a tiny bit on the far side. It's a little annoying, but you can live with it. I use my iVEGRA i3 and a v6.  The i3 is more powerful, and the i6 is better for people that don't want to spend alot of money on an eVIC-VTR mini. The i3 also has a nice button on the side for charging. The VTC Mini  is a little bit overpriced, but it does the job.  Overall:    The eVoc VTC is a great device and a great value for money.  The price is a bit high, but for a device that's really simple, it's worth it.   The buttons are a little weird, but they work and you can't fault the device.  Overall, it is well worth the money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- My new iBook, it's pretty cool, looks like it will last a long time. The keyboard is nice, not too stiff but the space bar is a little too stiff to type with a laptop, but i'm sure it will be fixed. Also, the keyboard is very loud.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________   My new electronic device works flawlessly. It has a very good display, a large screen, the speakers are louder than I expected. The screen is bright, and the sound quality is very good. The controls are easy to use. I also like the built in microphone that works well.   I bought a couple of my daughter's (7) toys from the store. One of the toys was a small pink dildo. I purchased the pink dildos for my daughter but she loved the blue one. I have used a couple other electronic devices and none of them work as well as the electronic sex toy that I just purchased. I love my new toy, it is so convenient and easy to charge.   and I really like the vibrator.  ,   - J. W.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s with retina  by Mark C. from New York on 4/16/2013  I bought the iPhone 4S to replace my 3GS and was not disappointed. The phone is very fast and the screen is very bright. The only thing I would suggest is to have the earpiece on the side of the phone. I have to plug the phone in to listen to music and podcasts. If you have to use the phone with your earpiece plugged in it will cause interference. Other than that the phone is a great phone.

But you don't know what it's like to live in the dark, do you?  Read all the customer reviews and find out why this device is the best. :
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ I received this device a couple of days ago and so far it has been great. It is easy to use, has a great volume, and has a really good sound. I've played music on it for hours on end without a problem. It's a little small for my hand size but that's to be expected. It would be nice if it came with a USB port as well as a battery to charge. I have the blue one and it is not nearly as nice. I also like that it comes with a case. I think that's the only complaint I can give it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This is the best portable mp3 player I have used this player a couple times and the quality is good. The sound is loud and clear and there is no skipping or crackling. I use this for listening to music, podcasts, and listening to a radio show. The battery is charged by USB, so the only thing that is missing is a charging cable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! It's the best computer i ever used. I've been using it for almost 3 years now, and the problem with the previous ones (2x AMD 64m/64m, a 2x Nvidia 320m) was that the monitor and the keyboard were not good enough, because of the fact that the keyboard could not fit inside the monitor. The one that came with this one is very good, but you can not plug the monitor into it, so it's useless. You need a special keyboard to plug the keyboard into the monitor, and a cable to connect the monitor to the keyboard. It works great. It's a lot better than the previous two computers I've had. The only problem I had with this computer was that it froze during the beginning of the game, which was very frustrating.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********** It was my first electronic device and I am very happy with it. I have been using it for a month and I have to say that it's a great value and a great device. It is well made, easy to use, has all the functions I need, is easy to program, and the software is very easy to navigate. The only drawback is that it is only one output, but for the price it is very well worth the investment. I will be recommending this product to everyone I know!****  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good but could be better. I'm a long time desktop computer user and am very familiar with the concept of a desktop computer. This is not that device. The screen is small, the keyboard is a little cramped for my fingers and the operating system (Opera) is very simple to learn and difficult to master. This machine is so cheap, however, I was hoping it would be much more powerful than a very limited computer. I love the way it looks and the fact that it runs Opera is a plus, but I'm not a fan of the software, especially the one-click interface that seems to be the norm.

They do what they are supposed to do, they are loud, clear, and get good sound. The only thing i have noticed is that the buttons have a little bit of a "click" when you hit them, but they are a good click so im not really bothered by it. I love the bass and the treble range. They sound great for any kind of music.   I will be buying more, for sure.  .

This is a nice product for the price. I recommend it. Rated 5 out of 5 by jon from great product for home theater or home office use I bought this as a back up for my Sony XAV-HX900. This unit can get a little hot to the touch but not a problem. I have a Sony XBR-65X900 and I have noticed the quality difference between the two units. The Sony's is much nicer.

The battery life is very long for a device this small and the sound quality is very good.  Noise - Poor quality noise, poor quality sound  I like it, but I think it is a waste of money  This product is a great buy, I like the fact that it does not have to be plugged in to the wall outlet. I have two of them and have not had a problem with it. The only complaint I have is the battery life. I don't know how they get a 2 month battery life for such a small unit.  in the end I would not recommend this product, the sound is very poor, the noise is very bad, and the battery is very short. I would have preferred a different size battery, but for the price, this is a good buy.

It is small, has good quality components, and the software is easy to use. It's also not prone to overheating or melting. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.  Good product, very satisfied! ------------------------------ I bought this for my Macbook Pro which is a 13 inch. The unit is small but sturdy, the buttons are good, the cables are long and good quality, and it is really easy to connect to my PC with a USB to ethernet adapter. It has an LED that shows if a device is connected. It works perfectly and does exactly what I wanted. I do have a few complaints. The USB to Ethernet adapter is a bit pricey. I bought a cheap one from Amazon and it works great with it. The micro USB cable is not included in the package, so I have to buy the extra ones. I wish that Apple would include a USB extension cable with the USB to RJ45 adapter. The USB to USB hub is nice because it has 2 USB ports that you can use to charge or connect to an ethernet port. I like that you do not have to remove the computer from the case to use it, as is the case with a cable box. I have been using my USB hub for over a year now and I am very happy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- The sound is great. It is clear and well tuned, and very well balanced, even with the subwoofer. It's also very quiet and has a great bass that is just right. The only con I have is that the power button isn't the same as the one on the back. You have to turn it off, then turn it on, and then it works. I'm not sure if it is the case everywhere, but it just doesn't feel like it is a button that is always on the right, or if it has to be turned off before you turn it back on. I have no complaints at all, it is simply an awesome product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jeremy from Very good I bought this a few weeks ago and I love it. I bought it to get the high sound quality I was after but it works perfectly and is very well built.

I bought this to replace my old unit and it's amazing! I can get up to 2.5 amps from it with this adapter. --------------- I've had a Vio-lectric 2.1 for about 2 years now, and it is still going strong. The Vio is a good unit that can handle my daily use of computer work, audio, video, and even a few hours on a single battery charge. ------------ I have a couple of the older Vio models and they are great. They are not exactly the same but they have a similar feel. The current version is a lot better and has more power. I just got this one and I love it! --------------------------- I have the 2.0 and 2.4 models, and they do work well. I use mine at home and at work. I find myself using my 2.3 and 2 of these for different purposes. The 2.2 is better for the home and the 2.4 is better on the road. The unit works great and I would highly recommend it. -------------- My wife bought me this one for Christmas. I've been using it for about a month and love it. I don't use a lot of music and when I do, it's mostly for TV shows. The speakers are so clear and loud, it can easily fill my room. ------------- I just bought my 2nd Vio (I'm currently on the 3.0) and I'm just about to get another one. It's great, and I've never had a problem with one of these units. ------ I've only had the Vio for a few months but I've already been impressed. It has plenty of power, has a great feel, and the build quality is awesome.

I like the fact that I can use my keyboard while listening to music. Also the speakers are very loud.

The keycaps are nice and bright, and the keyboard is a joy to type on. I also like the touchpad, which is not as good as the touchpads on the HHKB, though it's okay. -------------- I like how this keyboard looks. I'm very happy with my purchase. I wish it had a USB port, so I could charge my phone at the same time as my computer. It also has a really nice backlight, which makes the typing feel a lot more tactile. ------------- I got the Kailh, and I'm really glad I did. The quality of the keyboard feels good and the touch pad is awesome. I think it's the best keyboard you can buy for $80, and even less for the keyboard + touchpad bundle. The keyboard is very comfortable to type with, the backlight is very bright, it has a lot of space to type in, and all of the keys feel great. The touch pad, however, is a letdown. It's very small and it feels flimsy. It would be nice if it was a bit more sturdy. But it is still a great keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- This thing is great! I have a small office and this thing is so small and light, it fits perfectly in my bag. It is so easy to use, no fiddling. The quality is great, and I really like that you can choose between different batteries for the different situations. It also comes with a really nice case, so you can store it where you want. I would buy this again if I needed more space for a device I needed to have with me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ik-one has one of the best earphones I've ever owned. It's not that I'm picky about headphones, but ikone is really good. It is a solid iphone/ipad hybrid, with the best sound of any headphone I have used. It has an adjustable clamp, great noise cancellation, and good fit. I have it paired with a cheap iphonesound adapter (i think) and the sound is just perfect. I can't recommend it enough!Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikomag  I bought a couple of these for my husband and myself. We both like the way the battery works. It's also quiet, and it does what it's supposed to. I would have preferred a few extra features, like having a remote for it, but it's good enough for what we need. It did a good job keeping our room nice and warm. I do wish it had an extra switch for on/off, like a car battery, so I could turn it off, but I like it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Glamourgirl from The perfect Christmas gift! I got this as a present for my hubby. He is a big fan of the Energizer. We have a thermostat in our house that we use to set the temperature to the optimal temperature for the room. This was perfect for that, since it has an option to switch the unit on or off. He said it was just like the old one!  It is a really good item. I am very happy with the purchase. The unit is great. I recommend to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound of the Bose sound system is perfect, I love it, I recommend it to everyone that is looking for a good, cheap, and efficient sound system. The sound is clear, clean, and consistent with the rest of the speakers in the house. I was worried about buying the system, because I have never owned a speaker before, but I was really impressed by the installation. I'm a musician and I like to mix my own music, so the system is the perfect choice for me. My wife and my neighbors love the sound and I am happy that it is coming through my house.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device (non-Bose):   and the speaker is a pain to use. The buttons are tiny and have to be pushed very hard to turn on the speaker. The volume control is very hard and it makes a lot of noise. The Bose is a great sound system, but if you want the most compact, clean sound possible, the Bowers & Wilkins would be a better choice.Read full review

It's great for the price and it really works great!  of the few problems I've had, the only one that's worth mentioning is the "lock" button on the K1000 was kind of difficult to push. But other than that, I really love it and will be using it for years to come!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned a iphone 6 for a year now, and it has been very good. ive used it a lot with all my ipads and iphones, and this phone is even better! the only thing i would like to see is a larger screen. it does have a very good camera for a phone, but not a good speaker. but for the price i can't complain.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jim from Great Camera! I bought this camera a couple months ago. It's amazing. It takes pictures with a quality I can only dream of. I don't know what you do to it but it works like a charm. I'm looking forward to buying the second one! I was going to get the camera and the flash. Now I'm really glad I did!  Product: iPhone 6 I was able to buy this phone on sale for about $200 at the Apple Store. The camera is very good, but it seems to be a lot weaker than the model I bought two years ago. I have the old model and it is still holding up great. The flash seems to work pretty good, so it is definitely a better camera. I haven't used it very much since I bought it, but I think I will still buy a few more because I really like the camera. -Brian
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I have a Samsung S7 and this thing is like a baby monitor on steroids. It has the ability to take photos while it's charging and the battery life is phenomenal. You can use it as a regular camera but if you plan on doing anything more than just taking pictures it is absolutely essential. Also, it does have a pretty decent microphone and it's very easy to setup. I have used it with both my S7s and they all work perfectly fine. Pros: -Very compact and light. -Fast charging -Great sound -Easy setup Cons: -No wifi.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great sound quality. I have had it for about 2 weeks now and have used it with a variety of music and video. I was able to stream the entire TV show The Office (2009-2010) from my laptop and was able for the first time to listen to my mp3's on the computer. I'm a big fan of the Sony audio products. The only thing I did not like about the unit is the plastic. It was very uncomfortable to hold and it was not the easiest to clean. I wish it had a better screen, the volume controls were a little difficult to operate but that was due to the plastic not being quite as grippy as I would have liked. I would definitely buy this unit again and recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Very nice to listen to the sound with good sound quality. Not very loud but has good range and a decent amount of bass. Very nice to play with the sound at the same time as you read and work. The only complaint I have about the sound quality is the volume, which I am not sure why they put in this kind of volume. If you are not into gaming this may not be a problem. I do have to say the only thing I do not like is that it is a little harder to use on the computer than it is in the portable version. It is a good product, it just has some issues.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ****************** I was a little skeptical about the quality of the iBasso, but I had a little fun with it. It was easy to set up and is very convenient for a small child to have. I got the iBaby 2, it was the same size and I am very pleased with the sound. It's a great toy. The design is nice and it's easy to use. I am not sure if I would buy it again, but it's a nice toy. I would recommend this product for your little ones.  Rated 4 out of 5 by lizkimmy from A nice little toy. This is a cute little toy that is very quiet and cute. I bought two of these because my son's friends were using them for their "baby talk". My son's friend was very loud and the sound just wasn't there for him. They were also a little hard to push out of my daughter's mouth. I was disappointed in that aspect but still enjoyed the toy.

The buttons and volume controls are very easy to use and the device is a great price. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice portable music player.  Write a negative review about an inferior product: ------------ I bought the MP3 Player and the unit is very noisy. The sound is very loud and not very clear. The device is so noisy I cannot even use it for music. I have tried several different products and I will never buy this again. I will be returning the unit to Best Buy  I have been using my portable MP3 player for several years now. I bought this MP3 players because I thought that it was a good deal and I was wrong. The quality of this device is horrible. I am using the mp3 player to play my music. The volume is set to the max and it constantly cuts out on me. I had to switch to a different device to play music and it would not work. I could not even listen to the music. It's not that it is so loud but I could hear the sound in the background and it was too loud. I'm going to return this product. It doesn't even work properly.  a lot of noise with the mp4 player - I am returning this product because it's very noisy and the sound quality is so poor. The first two times I used it, the sound was OK but now the volume is really loud and the volume controls do not work, they don't even go into the middle of the dial. If you're thinking about getting this device, you can't afford to buy it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********   I have had my iPod for two years and I'm happy I bought this one. It's small enough to be a little easy to take with me in my bag but big enough to hold my iPhone and my iPod. The screen is good and bright.   My only complaint is that the buttons are on the bottom of the unit rather than in the front. But that's a minor issue and if you are going to get this, I would definitely recommend this model.   the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the battery life seems a little short. It is not so bad that I can't use it all day but it is a little less than what I expected.   and it is just a little over priced.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------------------- I really love this product. I bought this for a Christmas gift for my mom and it works great. I just wish it came with a case for the USB plug so it didn't get lost or anything like that. It would be really nice if they would make a 3.5mm adapter, it would make it a lot easier to use this for music and videos. But I guess I'm just a bit picky with electronics because I really do love it. :)  Style of music: --------------- I love electronic music but I have to find a way to enjoy it without getting my ears dirty. My headphones and music player work great but they don't get the attention I need from my favorite artists and albums. I've heard some really amazing ones but they are so loud I feel like I'm having a bad headache. I'm still not happy with my headphones but the device is definitely an upgrade over my current headphones.  Overall: ------------ I'm glad I ordered this. It's a great product and I have a feeling I will be buying more of them in the future.  I wish they would have come with a 2.5 mm cable instead of the 3.0 because I'm really having a hard time with headphones and I use my 3.3 mm to connect to the computer for my computer.  a good product but I wish it comes with a 3mm adapter to connect it to my 3,3  This product is the best out there, I can't wait to use it.  the only thing that i don't like is the usb cable, it's a little to long.  on a good note, i did see a review about some weird things happening on my phone with the usb port on my ipod touch, I'm sure that's what it was but if you're reading this, keep in mind that it was the only one of the two i had in my ipad that had that issue. so don't worry about it. if you have a different device, don't bother trying to repair it. but the ipod is a good device for a few bucks.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!!! The BEST ENCYCLOPEDIA EVER!!! This book is amazing! The photos and descriptions are just amazing. I have been looking for a book on cryptography for many years and this one came just in time. The author did a great job and has done a great service to the cryptography community. I'm a big fan of computer security and this book is the perfect book to help you get started with that. Highly recommended!  Review by: Matthew M. on Jan. 15, 2010 : (no rating)  I have purchased other cryptography books, but never found a good source on how to build a crypto system from the ground up, and this is the book that I always look forward to.  It's hard to describe the level of detail that is in this book, and how many problems you get solved. This book makes you want to learn about cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic algorithms in general, not just the crypto algorithms in it.  to be honest, I've never seen an online resource that was more concise and thorough.  on the first page it mentions a couple of algorithms that are used, but then goes on to describe some really difficult crypto algorithms and how to solve them. I found this incredibly helpful!  to me it is a must read, and i can see why the authors made it into the top 10 on the list.  a must-read for any serious cryptographer.  the author does a good job of showing how the algorithm works in detail, and then how you can actually build a secure system with the algorithms.  in this regard, it's a bit of a letdown. the author mentions that he is a cryptographer and this seems to be a bit too much of a self-promotion. if the goal was to build secure systems, why not just use an open source implementation?  this book is a great resource to get into cryptology, and it will probably serve as a guidebook for anyone else who wants to learn the basics of cryptology.

I was a little worried at first that it wouldn't have the storage of my other phones but I've never had any problem with the apps I've installed and it has been very easy to set up.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from good unit for the bucks This is a very good computer for the cost. I use it at home as a media center and for light gaming. I am a bit disappointed in the sound quality, but this is a minor issue. I also prefer the front door on the front of the unit over the back.  Rated 5 out of five by Anonymous From the great price point to the excellent features this is my 2nd Vaio. The first one I bought as a gift was a bit too old fashioned to play modern games at home but now I use the computer for all the stuff I do at home. I have my favorite games on it and I use this for movies and music. I'm very satisfied with the unit and recommend this one to anyone that wants a solid computer with the features you need.  and I would like to thank the manufacturer for their quality products.  the sound is good but it has no speaker or sound bar which I can live with because of the price. the size is a bit big but its great to hold. it is a little heavy for my 5'7 frame but that's why I bought this.

It has a great built-in battery and is quite small. I recommend this product to anyone who uses a digital camera, camcorder or audio recorder.   The only thing I do not like about it is the fact that it does not have a remote control. The remote control is a must have for me, but I can't use it with the XQd camcorders because the camcord will get in the way.  The price of this product is a bit high, but the quality of the product is great! I have tried other devices, but this one works better.  the only thing i do not have problems with is the built- in battery but if you want to use the battery and the camera together with the other camcording products it can be a bit confusing.

I can watch my favorite shows and movies in HD without getting bored. I also get a lot of use out of the keyboard which is great for email and writing notes. I love how the battery lasts a long time and never runs out. I'm a big fan of the camera. I bought the camera so that I could take photos and video without having to worry about losing my camera. You can also control it with a watch and the phone is so small, you can use it as a remote camera to watch movies. Also, the phone has a lot to offer. It has everything you could need. I like how it has a micro SD slot so you can put all your videos and photos in it. It can be turned on and off using a special button on the back. The battery has a good amount of juice and it lasts a very long time. It was the first device I ever bought and I'm still happy with it. The camera works great too.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** ***************************   The Sound: The sound of the unit is very clear and not over powering. It has a good bass boost for a subwoofer, very good quality and not too heavy. I also like that the unit has a built in remote that has a small volume control.   I have used a sub for a long time and was surprised how well this worked for the money.   a small thing I did was buy a larger rubber gasket from a local appliance store so that the rubber gaskets on the unit would be a little better in quality.   to keep the volume up, you have to put the unit on its side to keep air out. It also has a plastic cover that covers the microphone.  -The build quality: The build quality is very good and not to heavy.

I would also like to point out the great deal it is. I got it on sale for only $150, I had it shipped to my house for free and it only cost me $60 in total. If you have the same problem I had I highly suggest you get one of these. It is so much better than my mp3 player!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works.  A little slow for me, but it is not that bad.  A good choice of sound:  The sound quality is not very good, but you have to be a bit loud for it to get good.   The volume and volume control are also not very useful.  I could never tell the difference between the volume control and the speaker.  The only good thing is that the volume and sound are adjustable and you can play it louder.  Another good thing about the sound is that it is adjustable.  However, the sound quality does not match with the other speakers of this genre, which are a bit more bass heavy.

I got the s7 edge as a gift and it is so much better than my old one ive used for years. The screen is bright and clear and I can read for hours on end. I also love the fact that it has a usb port so I can take it with me and use it on my PC or laptop. The sound is also amazing and I cant tell the difference when I switch from one app to another. Overall this is a great device and I will be buying more of them in the future ive gotten this from amazon and i have no complaints about it.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had a few bad experiences with this unit but its overall good quality. It is a little slow for my needs but i bought a new one anyways. i really like the fact that it can be turned on/off while plugged in and it is not so loud. the sound quality is good.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great sound and long battery life! This is my second one and I'm glad I decided to buy another. I use it on a lot of different kinds of instruments, including piano, guitar, violin, harp, trumpet, and more. I can use it without having to plug it in or have to listen to the volume all day. The volume is adjustable, so you can choose the level of sound that works for you. The sound is so clear, you will never notice that the battery is running out. The quality is great and it has a long battery runtime. I also love the fact it can turn on/on with my phone, no extra accessories needed. I have one in a different size (the first is a bit smaller) and I can only recommend it to people looking for an easy to use electronic instrument that will last for a long time.  (I received the first one as a free gift and the second one was a gift for a friend who is new to electric piano and guitar.)  Overall Rating: 4/5
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________________________________________ I bought this device about two weeks ago and I love it! I use my tablet for school and I wanted a tablet that could be used with my laptop as well as with my iPad. I was not disappointed with this product. I can easily write notes on the device, I use it as a reference on the computer, and I use the same notes on my phone. I recommend this product to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________________________________________________________________________ I bought this on a whim, when the store I work at closed. The fact that I had been looking for a decent tablet, and wasn't too far off from this one, I was really interested in buying. I am pleased that I got it for a good price. I have it with me at all times, and it's a great little thing to carry. It's great that I can use it as a tablet, but it's also great for using as a smart phone, as well. I use it to listen to music, and to read books, as a digital journal, and even as a laptop. The best part is, even though I use my laptop most of the time, I can still use this as a phone. _______________________________________________________________________________ I bought the tablet and charger for my brother in law. He has a really bad case of ADHD and the tablet has helped him a lot. He is a little slow to use the device but he can now get through a full day with it. It has a great touch screen. I recommend this tablet for people with ADHD and to anyone who likes a little entertainment with their time. __________________________________ This is the first time I've used an android tablet and I am not disappointed at all. It is very easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy way to read and do research. ____________________ I bought my tablet about a month ago, and I LOVE IT! I have been using it for about a week, and already love it so much. It does everything I could want. I like to read, listen to podcasts, listen, write and just do whatever I want with it while I am on the go. I will definitely be buying a second one in the future. Thank you Google for the great product. ___________________________
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I have used a few different wireless systems and this is by far the best I have found.

The device is easy and inexpensive to buy and I recommend this product. ****  Good product: ************** This product is the best wireless system I have ever used. It's easy to set up and use. It is so quiet that I almost forget that it is there. I wish the remote control worked better and it would have made it more convenient to use.

Rated 5 out of 5 by dpv from good value I am an old guy but this is a very good little device.  I've owned several other digital recorders and this one is a bit more convenient and a bit lighter than others. It has more features than others but it's also a bit less flexible. It does a very decent job and has been a good replacement for the tape recorders. The only thing is that it's a little bulky and it is a little difficult to plug in if you're not at home or just don't have a jack.

The sound from the Sony's is a little too loud for my tastes. I do like the feel of the Sound Blaster subs though.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I have the first generation of the new iPad 2. The first one I got was the gray, but the black one I bought was a little darker. The screen is much clearer and has more contrast and color. It also has the same fast response time as the original iPad. I don't use my iPad much, but I like the fact that I can view the web, play music, and watch videos on it without having to use my laptop. Also, the built in camera works really well. It works much better than the one on the original ios. I can't believe Apple doesn't make these in black. It's a very attractive black. I am very pleased with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for about 2 months now, i have an older macbook pro and it wasnt very good. i dont use the trackpad, so this mouse is perfect for me. i used to use the mouse pro and i had a hard time adjusting to the weight of the mouse and the buttons. this mouse has a perfect weight and is very easy to use. i also had to update the driver because the original driver had a problem.

Yes No Thursday, September 20, 2014  Nice little mouse  by William from Rochester, NY USA  Pros: Small size  Cons: None  Review: This mouse is not for every user, and is definitely not the mouse for every game.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!The quality of the device and the price are superb! I am really happy with this purchase and will be recommending it to all my friends.  5 5 Love it! By Mirella F., Santa Rosa, CA USA I love the size and the size of the battery. It charges fast and the buttons work fine. The battery is easy to change as well. I bought the 2x2 charging adapter for my iPod because I didn't want to have to get a separate adapter. This is the best deal I've seen on an e-cig ever!  4 5 E-Cig is Awesome! By Dan K., Sacramento, CA, USA I was so excited when I received my order. My order came quickly, I love how it charges my device and it's a great looking box. I would recommend this to anyone. The customer service is top notch and the product is awesome.  in addition to this great price, the packaging and customer service were top notch! Thank you vape wild!  of course i would love to buy from you again. I will definitely buy from again. . ,,, Thanks again, you've got a winner! ,.,,I'm just in a rush but I have to say this is the most comfortable e-cigarette I have ever tried. I've tried several other brands that were all bulky, ugly, and heavy, but the V2 is the closest thing I've found that is not too big and not too small. I have it on my bedside table at my desk. The buttons are easy to press, the battery life is excellent, and it looks great. It's very comfortable to use and the color is perfect. It does require a bit more maintenance than most e-cigs, but once you get used to it it doesn't take long to replace the batteries. This one is great, but it's definitely a step up from other brands I've tried. You get what you pay for. Cig-e is definitely my new favorite e-juice! I ordered the VV-2 with the 18650 and it is the perfect battery! It gives me enough charge to get through a day of vaping, but never gets too hot! It lasts me about a week between charges. It is also easy to use! I don't know why people complain about the button on the bottom, the vape is easy and smooth to use. I also recommend
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4s  by a visitor from CA on 7/28/2011  I have only had my iphones for a few months, and I already have a few good friends that are using them. I love how easy it is to access my phone and email. I have been looking for a good quality device, and this is the best I have seen. The phone is good and fast, and the phone calls sound great. I haven't been able to get my email through because I use a gmail account, but I have had no problems with the website. I am now considering a mac mini, because of the fact that the iphoner has not given me any problems. This is a great phone. I will be buying a second one soon.  Was this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- It is a great electronic device and it is very fast. It's easy to use. It has a great sound quality and a good range of presets. I have tried several different models but this is the best. I like that it doesn't require any cables. I wish the range could be longer but for now it's just right.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** This is my third model and I love it. The battery life is excellent and the wireless is very good. The only con is that it doesn't come with the charger that comes with the wireless. I had to buy a separate charger and I can only imagine how much more expensive a wireless charger would be.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am extremely happy with the product.   The quality is very good.  The battery lasts for hours and you can control the volume.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! The best thing I have ever purchased, I am a music fan and my iPod died. I tried a bunch of other devices and the Apple iMusic was the best. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it only played my iPod music. However I love music and the other Apple products I bought all had music play. I also purchased this one and it works great. The iRadio app is very easy to use and has the best songs and artists I have listened to. I can't find anything bad about it. It is worth every penny and the music is always perfect. Thank you for a great product and I will be purchasing more of these in the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The  E-Guitar is a great device and is very versatile. I have the original model which has a 2x15 amp power amp and has the added bonus of being able to use the preamp output as a mixer. I am a guitar player and the extra control over the guitar sounds very helpful. I also have the newer model which is 4x15 and has an amp that will handle a 4x12 cabinet. Both models are built well and have nice knobs.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------------------- It is a very nice portable recorder. The audio quality is very good, the size is good, and it does a great job at taking pictures. The only issue I have is the batteries do not last very long, about two weeks at the most. Other than that I love it. I would buy another one.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Jim from Great for a backup camera This is a good camera for a home or office. I use it for taking pictures for my website and for videos for the family and friends. I also use it as a backup for my other cameras. I think the best feature is that it records both high and low quality video and audio. The quality of the audio is good and you can adjust the audio levels. I find it useful for taking low quality pictures or videos. I have the external mic as well as the internal mic. I can only recommend this camera. : I've had this camera for about a month and it has been a great addition to my photography arsenal. I've used it to take pictures of my son playing baseball, my dogs, and even my sister and brother. The video quality is good enough that I'm not sure how I'd get better video with my DSLR. I do have the HD version, which has a lot more video options than the standard version. I'm planning on buying the 3.5 inch SD version. -The only negative thing I have to say about this camera is that the batteries are not very long lasting. I purchased two of the external batteries to extend the camera's life, but the batteries only last about two months. But, I have a new battery that I got at my local camera store. So I'll have to be patient and try to find a good use for the extra batteries. But other than that, I'm happy with my purchase. 1 person found this helpful
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s is a very good phone for the price. The screen is very good and the phone is very fast to respond. The battery life is good also, I got a good 3 days of usage out of it. It is also very easy to setup and use, I have never had problems with my ipod or ipod touch, I'm pretty sure that is due to the fact that it has a better screen than those devices. I use my phone for work and also to read emails. I can do both with out a problem. Also, my ipad mini is better in the price and features department. It has a bigger screen and better battery life but the ipad has a faster response time.  Write a negative review about an okay electronic device : I bought the ipod nano in 2014 and I love it. I have the music and pictures turned on, and I am able to hear and see everything. However, there is something about the software that is not very nice. It just feels like the software is written for a different device. It takes forever to load and sometimes it will just take forever to scroll through my apps. I just wish the app stores were designed for these different types of devices.  and this was just my first year of using it. If I were to buy another ipod I would probably just get the ipods mini and the pro one, I like that it's not a tablet and I don't think it will be a tablet for long.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great device! I have had it for about a month now and it is perfect. My kids love it. It is easy to set up and set it up well. My wife has a Dell computer and she loves it too. I just wish that the battery life was a little better. This thing lasts a long time but you get used to it. We use it as a wireless mouse, as a cordless phone to connect to, and as a computer to surf the internet and do web searching. I have no complaints! Write a negative review about an average electronic device and why you should NOT buy it:    I really like my computer. It was very well built, and I don't have to take it to a repairman when something breaks. The only problem is that I am constantly having to charge the device. If I am using it to watch TV, I have to have a cord to connect it to the TV. If my kids want to play video games or use the computer for research, I also have to plug in the power cord. If the computer doesn't have a charger on it, I would have to buy a new one.   Write an enthusiastic review about your favorite electronic device.  If you do this, I will give you a free gadget!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone5s The only thing that i dislike about it is that the phone is very fragile when you drop it. i love my iPhone but the phone can fall if you are not careful. ive had it since it was a new phone and it still feels like it was just bought. but if you do drop it and it breaks it will be a good replacement.

Cons: I bought this to replace an iPhone 6 and the battery life is terrible.  "i" batteries only last about 8 hours and the phones is extremely hot.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【Sennheiser HD800】I'm an audiophile who enjoys quality sound quality. I had tried the HD800 for a long time but never had the opportunity to try it until the recent E-MU 9.3. I've had the HD600 and the HD650 for many years but found them to be a little on the warm side for my taste. I was pleasantly surprised to see how much I enjoyed the HD700's warm bass and excellent treble. The HD700 is more balanced and less muddy than the HD8x. This is a very good, well-rounded, and easy to use headphone. I'd recommend it highly to anyone who likes sound quality and is on a budget.  I love the sound! - December 30, 2014 - December thirty-one thousand words  Reviewer: katy_tay - favorite favorite favorite - April 5, 2013  Subject: Great sound for a good price I'm using it with my iPhone 5 and i'm loving the sound. The only thing I don't like about the sound is that the volume control is so far from the volume knob on the front of the headphones that it's almost impossible to turn down the volume. It's also really hard to find the "off" position to change the volume without messing up the sound and the cord. Overall I think it's a good headphone that I'm going to keep in my ear.  (I did buy a 3.5mm to XLR adapter from Amazon but it's not that cheap. I bought the one from amazon.com, so I can't say if it's worth the extra $20.00) - April 2013Great sound for the price  - March 3, 2013Great Sound for a great price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!!!!   I am a very active person who has been running for over 15 years and with this device I am able to keep up with that pace and I can also run with a small group. I am running in the dark with the light on. This is a great addition to my running kit!   My husband bought this to use while running in a dimly lit gym with a couple other guys and I was impressed with how bright it was. I can run and work out at the same time! We have a 10 year old and he is running faster than us and can't keep up. We can't wait to put this on the treadmill and use it while watching TV and running. We already use a GPS and have used a couple of others. This thing is great. I just love it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    -The sound quality is great. The music is crystal clear, no distortion, very clean. It does not sound like the CD-R's that i was given, more like an audiophile CD.   It is an interesting device. i am still working my way through the book, but i really enjoyed this device. I did not read the book in one sitting, but took my time, and got to the point. The book is very well written, and the author does a good job with the pacing and the pacing is good, but the pacing gets a little slow. I also would have liked the story to be slightly more interesting and the ending a bit more satisfying.     If you are a fan of a certain genre, or of a particular genre you are not a fan, then this is definitely a good pick up for you. If you are looking for a good audiobook, you will probably be disappointed.  -Overall, I would recommend this to anyone. If your a fan or you are new to audiobooks, you should pick this up.  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********  I'm a musician who is very picky when it comes to music players. I wanted a good quality and versatile device. This device is great! I can play with the bass/drums and the lead guitar, and it has a nice little volume control for the lead instruments. I have had it for a few years and it's a great device. The only thing that would be nicer would be a small touch screen that would work as a sort of remote control for other devices, like the computer I play on. The unit has plenty of features that will keep you entertained and it plays well. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good portable device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikoskool - this is a very useful tool and can be used as a substitute for a soldering iron. It is very accurate and a great value for the money. I recommend it highly.  This review was written using the IKOS-S. The IK OS-S is a soldered-on, custom made, high quality, fully assembled, 3.3v, 5.0v, linear voltage regulator that uses the SOT23 package. The design is unique and it is not very common. I have been able to find one other on ebay for around £15.00 plus shipping, which is very expensive for an open-source project. This unit is built well, the quality is excellent and it has a good build quality. The SOT22 package does have some drawbacks, like the heat sink and some of the PCBs can be difficult to solder. It has a USB interface and a few cables to plug it into, which makes it very easy to use. The only thing I would like to see is the use of a heatsink for the heat sinks, like a heatsinking for the solder pads.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Love the sound and the ease of use and control of this unit. I have used this unit for years and I just have to say the sound is really clear and clear for the price. I would recommend this product to everyone. I can say this thing is really worth the price but if you want the best sound then buy a different unit.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Bob from Works well but could use a few more features... Works well, but could need a few extra features, like a dedicated volume control and a battery life indicator. :)  From: J.M. from Florida I've been using this mixer for several years now. I've had a pair of old "professional" mixers that I bought used and had to have replaced because they didn't work anymore. This new one is a lot better than the others, and it looks very nice too. I love the fact that it is able to be plugged into my computer for playing music. I like the way the knobs are set up so I can adjust the volume on my computer and also the sound. I also like that the mixer has a headphone jack. The only thing I wish it had was an option for "silent" mode. It's really hard to hear any music without the sound coming out of the speakers. I was looking at purchasing a pair with the same features and functionality for my laptop, but I decided to keep this one in my studio.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!!  5 out of 5 Great little tool This is a very good tool for adjusting the tension of the trigger guard on your AEG's. I am using it on my P90 and it works great.  3 out of 3 found this review helpful This is an excellent tool but for me it is not as useful as the others I have. I bought it because I wanted to use it to tighten the trigger grip on my S&W M&P22 and it is very difficult to adjust the tension. I wish it was easy to adjust. The only negative is that the tool is a bit too small. It is not enough to fit on my other smaller tools.  is this review useful? Yes No  4 out of 4 found this reviews helpful This tool is great. Very easy to use, it will loosen and tighten the tension on a P90, a trigger guard and a hopup, the adjustments are great. I also bought it for my M&p9 which I use for Airsoft and the adjustments on the P9 are so much better than the ones on the M&pp9. I love this tool  2 out of 2 found this to be great tool. Its great when adjusting a hop up, and the tension adjustment is very precise. The problem is that you need a lot of patience to use the tool and it will wear out.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** This is a good and efficient way to use your phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and I love that the app allows me to quickly add contacts and a calendar. The app also allows me for an unlimited number of e-mails, which I can easily search. There are some quirks, like when I try to send a file to a friend, I get an error message that I have already sent it, but I've already been sent something from a friend who had sent it to me, so it's not that big of a deal. The only negative I have is that you need to know the name of your contacts in order to send the file. I am not sure if it is a feature or a bug. Overall a great app.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this one for over 2 years and it works great. it has a good sound quality and battery life. i had to use an external hard drive to be able to get it to be connected to my laptop. theres a great feature on this one that can make it last forever if used correctly. you can store your music and pictures on a hard drive for extra space if you're into that.   It is easy to find your favorite songs and artists on this little guy and the controls are great to use.     This is a great little unit that works great for what it does. I have had it for over a year and I don't see it ever going away. It is a must have in your studio if you want to do something with your computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little device that I have been using to record and play music. It does a good job at everything, including the microphone input. I use it with a Sony HDA-X300D audio recorder, and it works fine. It is quiet and doesn't take up much room, and I like that it is a lot smaller than the mic I have on my Sony. The only thing I would change about this device is that the headphone jack on the side is really bad. It doesn't plug in and the input is very quiet, so you will have to use a splitter cable to get sound into your headphones. I will be ordering another one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【HOT!】 I'm new to vaping and I got this on a whim after seeing an advertisement about it. I've been using it almost daily since I got it, and I'm pretty happy with it. The temperature control is pretty cool. It's so easy to use. The only thing I wish it had is a more portable/smaller design. I have to use a cartomizer for a little extra space. 【LOVED IT】 I have been using this device since it was released and have been pleasantly surprised at the performance of the device. The build quality is excellent and the temperature control and wattage are just what I have expected. The battery life is good too! 【BUY IT】 If you're looking for a device to give it a try, this is it!

This is my first experience with a portable. I am very happy with the sound quality and the features. I have a lot of music on my computer but am not much into portable devices. The unit works well, I am satisfied and recommend it.  to much for a small phone... I can get more sound from a smartphone, but this is too small for my phone. I would buy a larger one  Good sound quality, nice portable This is a great little player, with good sound quality. I used it for a few months and was really happy with it. I did have a problem with the batteries, but I had a spare and had it replaced for free. I also recommend the battery life. It lasted all day on a single charge.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I've been looking for an inexpensive portable USB charger for a long time now, but I finally bought one, the Ting Micro USB Charger. The quality is good. The unit works very well. The batteries charge fast, and there's no problems with the charger at all. The only problem is that the cable that goes from the charger to the phone is short, but that's easily fixed with a short micro usb cable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________   It's amazing.   I bought it a year ago and have been using it daily since. It's so fast and efficient.   the only thing I wish I could change is the size of the battery compartment and the usb port is a little hard to access so I can't put any of my chargers in it.     The best thing about this product is the price, I got mine on sale for $19.99 but there are a lot of competitors that are almost half the price. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to others.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! It was a nice experience with my first ever VLC. I was using a Roku and then bought this VLC, and it works great. I didn't expect it to work on my Roku, but it does. It does have some problems though. I'm a visual learner and don't like to use the buttons for changing the audio. But the VLC does allow you to change the audio for a song without pressing the buttons. You just have to press the play button. But then it just starts playing the song that you selected.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device since april, i can't believe how well it works for the price. ive tried a few other devices in the past, but this one seems to work better and more reliably than any other i tried. iv have it hooked up to a tv and it works great, its super simple to use and the fact that it comes with everything you need makes it an easy device to use. ives tried other products in the same price range, but ive found this to be the best ive used so far. its worth the money and worth waiting for the delivery to arrive. if your a beginner, or are a seasoned computer enthusiast and want to upgrade your setup, this is the one.  5/5 Great unit for the money. The unit works great. Works very well with a wireless keyboard. The keypad is easy to use with no problems. The wireless keyboard is easy and very responsive. Great unit. .  (April 20, 2012)  I have a small office with 3 monitors and only one mouse. The problem is that I can't use the mouse because it is so small that the keyboard is too small for my palm. The Logitech is the perfect size. I would recommend this unit to anyone.  a small one for a big job! (March 17, 2012 )  Love it! Works great. I had trouble with my old mouse (I was using a Logitech) but it finally died. 's easy to install and setup...'

It works well with both my laptop and desktop. I highly recommend this product! (January 15, 2011 in review ) .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________ This is a great product. I love the fact that I can use it for my school work. It's the only thing that helps me concentrate. I have two older kids and my wife and I use this on a daily basis. It is easy to use and very simple to set up. The only thing I wish it had was a USB port so I could have added more storage space.  Rated 4 out of 5 by LJB from Great little gadget! I have a Dell laptop with an optical drive and an external USB device (an iPod/iPod touch). I decided to try a USB drive for my laptop and found the included one to be way too small for the job. I wanted one that was about as big as the drive, so I bought this. The price was very good, and the fact it's a small computer (about the size of a large pen) was a nice bonus. My only complaint is that the unit needs to be powered on and the light must be on to be able to charge the device. If the light is off, then it's useless. The unit is compact and fits nicely in my bag so it's easy to store when I'm on the road. The fact that you can charge the computer from a USB cord on a plane is great. Overall, it's not a bad product at all.  to have a USB storage device to replace the hard drive for the external USB drive, would have been better if this was available at the time. I used it as a backup for my main laptop. It does the job well and is easy for me to set it up, but it does not fit all that well in the laptop compartment and doesn't hold as much storage as I'd hoped.  a very good and very compact product.  the device is very small but works just fine. the only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the lack of a usb port. I really like the product it is very compact, the light works great, it is easy on and off. I would recommend it  My daughter's dad got one of these for his computer and he loves it. I'm not a computer person so I just use it as an extra storage drive, I'm sure it will last a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for about a month now and i can honestly say i love it.

I have a bluetooth speaker and this one is as good as any of them for the price, especially considering the price of bluetooth speakers. ive even tried to use it as a wireless bluetooth mic and it does a pretty good job. I use it to listen to music and I love the battery life it provides for the small size of it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had a smarthome for over 2 years now, the only problem i had was when the usb port is shorted, it does not charge and when the light goes off it goes back on and stays on. i fixed it and it is now working well and charged on time.  I would like to buy a bigger usb port and a longer battery.  "Great Product! " - Jan-12-2017  "I've used this product for years, and it still works great! I have only had one problem with the USB connector. It breaks easily, but it still charges my computer.  the only issue is the battery life. . ,  Good product, but.. " - Feb-12  If you are going to buy this device, make sure to have a long USB cable and a good battery. I have had this product since 2013 and have yet to find a good usb battery for it. The usb cord has to be a good length. If you buy the 1-USB-Port-Charger-Batteries-Pouch-Tin, you will have a good 2-USB charging power for this device.  and yes i know its not a lot of power but its good enough for me.  a few months ago i got a 2nd one and used it for a few weeks and its still going strong.    if you want a nice little portable charger with tons of power for your computer and cell phone this is it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************** I bought this for my friend who doesn't have one of these but really wanted one. This thing is just the way I wanted it and it looks just like my old CRT monitor. It is easy to setup and easy to use. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who needs one of those!  Rated 4 out of 5 by RYAN from I am satisfied with this purchase. I was searching for a computer monitor to replace my old one and couldn't find one that fit my budget and needed to be upgraded. This was one of the products on my list, and decided to go with it. The only issue I had with it was that the stand had to be adjusted by the front of the stand so that the screen was level. This meant I had to adjust the front panel of the monitor to get the screen level. Not a big deal but annoying. It has great picture and good sound. Overall a good product that I am happy with.

"The battery is a little low" - not a big deal to me. - not a problem to me  Review: This is a great sounding and powerful set up! It is so much louder than a subwoofer that I can't believe that there is a sub for it. I can run it all night and get full effect from it without getting too hot! It really does sound great. I really don't have any con's about it. It has a good sound quality, is easy to use, and works perfectly. ,  What do you think?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had it since 2007 and still use it. I use it for my home audio system and it works great. it is the best price ive seen for this kind of equipment.  Rated 5 out of 5 by D-Man from Great for the money. Great for a great price. I have been looking for an aftermarket amplifier that would last a long time. This one does that and it also sounds great. I am using it with my home theater receiver, which is a SVS PFE5200. The sound is clean, clear and a little warm. It is loud enough to hear at home, but not too loud. I do wish it came with the built in remote control, but for the price you can't beat it. 's just as good, if not better than a lot of the expensive amplifiers that cost a lot more. It's built like a tank, has an amazing sound and is a joy to use. The built in EQ is a big plus and is one of the best I've used. You will be glad you bought this amp.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had the e3 in my possession for about a year now. it works great as a headphone amplifier and has a pretty good amount of sound. i have used it to drive a variety of gear and it can handle a bit of heat, but i dont use it that much. it is the best bang for the buck i have found.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, December 01, 2014  Great sound for the price!  by Jeff from San Jose CA USA  Pros: Sounds great. The only cons are the cable length and that it is too loud for some folks.  the only thing i dont like is that it has a cable that is not very long, but if you want to use this for home theater then this is the way to go.  in the box was a USB cable to plug into your pc. so not really much to complain about. . :)  Review: I was looking for a headphone amp and didn't want to spend $100.00 on the Yamaha RX-V750, but I really wanted to hear what the RX-6 did, so I bought the e1000. I was very surprised at the sound quality. It's great. It has a good bass, a lot of punch and detail, but it doesn't distort or sound muddy. I love this amp. I'm sure it will sound better if I put it in my system, but for $30, it is worth it. /Jeff  I have the e3000 and this one is just as good.  and the sound is not too far away.  is very clear and clear as well.  on the RX6 this is not the case, it has the same clarity but less depth and more bass.  have only used it with a portable amp that is less than $30. and I like the RXV750 better.  I like how you can adjust the levels with the headphone out. Also I like that you can just use the volume knob for that.  it does have a little bit of noise but I don't really care.  so I can't really complain about that. I just wish the cord was longer. But overall very satisfied with the purchase.  a very nice portable headphone amp.  of course it does need a power supply but I think that's not a big issue. i use it on my laptop, but that's about it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had this unit a long time ago and I have yet to have it fail. It was just a simple thing I did for a while. I just like it for the way it sounds. I was never one for the clicky sound of my old Yamaha DX7. The D-5 is much better, and I don't think it would be a problem if the batteries died on me. This unit is much easier to use than the old DX7 (I think). I do use a USB adapter for the computer, but the DX7 I was using had a headphone jack. I can see the DX8 having some similar issues. I think I am going to go with the D-8. Great sounding guitar player! "What do you get when you take a great guitar amp and put a digital delay in it? The DX5 D-7. This is a digital amp that can also be used with a guitar. I have it plugged into my vintage Rickenbacker that has been plugged into a Yamaha DX8." -John

I can't think of any other device that can be used for more than one TV. I have had one broken off and replaced a second time and it worked fine.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jm from Easy to set up and works well I've been a little hesitant about using a TV with an antenna because of the cost of antennas. This unit is very easy to set-up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- My phone is one of the best phones I've ever owned. The camera is good. The battery life is excellent. The size is great. The screen is large and bright. The speed is great, and it's extremely responsive. The volume is great! This is the phone I want to have when I get old and infirm. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good camera phone.  Write a negative review about an inferior product: ------------ I got this phone a month ago and have been using it. The phone is great but I found that the speakers are terrible. They sound like a boom box and the sound quality is horrible. I was expecting to get better speakers and the phone just wasn't. I had to buy another one. I do love that I have a lot of storage on my phone but I feel like it would have been better if the storage came with a charger. I can't remember the last time I used a phone with a battery that lasted a whole day. It just feels like a waste of money. I think the price is great for this phone. I know there are other good phones but this is just a no go for me. . A review of the S7 Edge vs the S6 Edge:  It is important to mention that the S5 Edge is an excellent smartphone for people who want a large display, and a good-quality camera. The S7 is an even better choice for people with a preference for a large screen, a good sensor, and high quality audio. However, for those people who are looking for a smaller, cheaper, but still very good device, the S4 and S5 are your best options. The main reason for the S3 Edge's success is the fact that it is a great smartphone for someone who wants to be able to carry around a large phone. However the S2 Edge and S3 are better choices for those who want to keep their phone small. However if you're someone who's looking for something that can hold a lot more, and also be a good quality device, then the S1 and S2 are good choices.  the S 5 Edge is a good smartphone for a number of reasons. The display is large, and the camera is excellent, but the sound of the speakers is just terrible, and there is no removable battery or expandable storage. The device is also extremely slim and lightweight, which is great if you plan on carrying
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! - June 28, 2008Fantastic  Reviewer: gregulator - favorite favorite favorite - January 25, 2008  Subject: The one that started it all... It is a shame that these tapes are not available in the USA. I bought this as a teenager back in the early 80's and it was the only audio source I had of the Dead's early years. It was on a great stereo that I found at a yard sale for $20!   Now this is a classic show, and the first time I heard the Dead sound so good live.   It's hard to put down when the band is as tight as they are on this recording.   the first set starts with a fantastic Scarlet Begonias>Fire and the second is a wonderful Truckin'.   The second set starts out with a really great Bertha. They go into a really good Dark Star which then opens up into a nice Little Red Rooster and a nice Terrapin.  , the band does not disappoint. This is one of the best sounding shows that I've heard. The sound quality is just as good as any other tape that I have heard from this era. This show was one of my first shows. The first set is solid and the 2nd is stellar. This was a show where I knew the band was really starting to come together and it's great to hear that in this show.   of course this show does not end with a good time, but it has a great ending with a beautiful Scarlet Began into a long Terrapina. The rest of the show is solid, but the second set is the highlight. - January 26, 2008The one that began it all

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used this device for the last year and love it. The sound quality is amazing and the ability to adjust the tone is excellent. The controls are very easy to use. I have had no problems with it so far. It is extremely portable, especially when combined with the iPod and the iPad. The size and weight make it very comfortable.  It does not take up much space when not in use and has great battery life. It has made traveling more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this product. Great Sound for a very good price  - I use the product to play guitar and I have to say I'm very pleased with the sound quality. The quality of the sound is very clear, clear and clear. It does not come out sounding like a good guitar amp or a good portable mixer. It's more of a good quality portable sound. -I bought this amp as I wanted to use it on a bus. I also have a portable bass amp that I'm using for my music. The amp has a small footprint, is very portable and has good quality. It sounds good with a subwoofer as well. I'm happy with it. Good for travel  : I bought this to travel with me as I have an iPad and an iPod Touch. I wanted something to help me to travel. It works as advertised. It takes up very little space. It gets a little warm at high volume, but this is because it's a battery powered device and it will get warmer.  Very portable and very well made  -- This is a great portable headphone amp, especially for the price. It was a little heavy but it's easy to carry and I didn't notice it. I use it with my portable amp and it does a good job.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because of the reviews of the quality of sound, the speed of operation and the fact that it has a built in microphone. When I received it I was extremely surprised by the quality and performance of the product. The microphone is extremely clear, the sound is very clear and the sound can be heard over any distance, so no matter where you are you can hear it. I also really like the fact the sound doesn't come out of my TV, so I can watch my movie or play games without having to turn up the volume. I don't have to adjust the volume because the volume comes out of the speaker.   My only complaint is that it can only be used in my living room. I have a recliner and a television that are located on my other side. I can't use the speaker when sitting in my recliner, so if I am using it for my computer, I have to be sitting a bit farther away from the speakers. The only reason I gave it a 4.5 is because I don;t like the way it comes apart and I don?t like how it fits into my TV stand. I really would have liked if they would have made it so you could just put it on the stand and it would work on your TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a brand new Sennheiser HD 650 a few weeks ago. I love the sound. The bass is a little deeper than I'm used to but I don't have a big preference on that. The soundstage is great, but I'd like it if they added more separation. I can hear everything but the person next to me. It is a great sound for the money and I'm sure it will be great for a long time.   Sound quality:  I don 't think there is any doubt that the Sennhier 650 is a superbly made headphone. The only problem I had with them was the volume knob is a tad stiff. I think the volume adjustment is more of a problem than the knob. I have mine set at 80 and the sound was very muffled at 80. So I tried lowering it to 50 and the result was a much more realistic sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【SONY PSP Go】 I bought a PSP Go last year, as my first portable console. It's a fantastic device and very powerful. I play a lot of Vita games and I can't help but like the idea of having a portable system, as long as you can play games. The only problem is, sometimes the screen is too bright and is hard to read in bright light. However, it's still better than a regular console. And if you want to do some more advanced things, such as recording, playing some games at high-speed, and so on, then I would recommend it. The battery lasts forever.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Product I bought the PSP Go and really love it. I use it for video games as well as casual games. It is easy to setup, simple to use, and it is great for the price. The screen is very good, and when you need to watch something it's easy to use. You can record it and view it later, which is a big plus. The size of the device is perfect for me. It fits in my hand and it's not too bulky. I highly recommend this device, it is a great buy. -I have had the PSPgo for 2 weeks, and I'm really liking it. You only have to charge it once a month, which I find convenient.  the screen seems brighter than a console. But for a lot less money I would have been disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- It's a great gadget, just like the other reviewer mentioned. It does what it's supposed to do and works flawlessly. The battery life is awesome, it's really quite a bit longer than I thought it would be. I have also had good luck with my friends with it. The only negative thing I have is that it's so bright, that it can be hard to read text. I bought it specifically for the color. Other than that, I highly recommend this device!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I bought this in late 2015 to replace my old one (also a T-Mobile device). This thing has been on my phone since the day it came out. I've used it a couple times since then, and I have to say that I am very impressed. I'm a bit of a gadget snob, but this is easily one of the best gadgets I've ever used. The battery lasts a good 4+ days. It's easy to use, and the software is easy to navigate. I would recommend this to anyone.

The battery life is amazing, and it doesn't need to be charged. I use the radio to listen to AM and FM radio and listen to my GPS for driving directions. I have found it easier to use the device when my hands are full, rather than having to use my phone or my earbuds. The radio has become my new favorite device!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: 【Korea] K1 (H) is a great piece of hardware for those who like to play the game of chess. The board has a nice smooth feel and I'm always playing on the board. The LED lights on the back give you the same feeling as a chess board. I'm not the biggest fan of LED lights, but these ones do their job and I like that. The game is easy to learn, but if you are a little clumsy and don't play well on the chess board then the pieces will get all over the place. I also like that there are several buttons on the front of the board so you can change the game in between moves. The chess pieces are well designed and I love them. There are many pieces and there are so many possible ways to move them. I have played on the K1 for a while and I feel it is a very solid piece of chess hardware. This is a must have piece of equipment for the chess fan.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Bwib from good product. The piece is well made and well designed. However, it is very small, i had to take the board out to set it up. I had the pieces set up with the white pieces. This did not help the board get oriented properly so it is not oriented correctly, the board is also crooked. This board was very well made, I have one of the original pieces and it is still working great. , the product is great and works great. I used to have a board like this but it got damaged in a storm so I was looking for a replacement. This piece is exactly what I was seeking. I would recommend this board to anyone that has a board that is not functioning properly.  to the point: the board does come with some extra pieces that will be nice to have if you want to get a little extra playing time out of your board.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I just received my iphone 6 and it is really good. The phone is the best and most reliable iphones out there and the best app store ever. It's so simple to use and I've got a lot of time on my hands. I really enjoy this phone! I don't have to use a charger all the time and I am able to charge it up while I am in the middle of using other things. It is very easy to read the time on the screen and has very nice quality. The only bad thing is that the phone is not waterproof. It doesn't do as well as I'd like.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is the best phone ever, the battery lasts the whole day and when the phone is on standby the screen is so bright and the phone itself is so lightweight. I was really disappointed when it stopped working on my second iPhone 5.  I've been using a Motorola Droid for about 5 years now and this phone is like no other I've ever used. I've had to get a new one because my Droid has been running really low on battery, but I've never had a problem with it, not even the screen going off. I have to say that it's a very nice phone and it is extremely well made. It is so much better than other android phones I've used. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was a good device for the money. I would buy it again. I purchased the VZ-81 in March of 2011. I was a bit skeptical because of the cost of the unit (as is usual for high end units like this). I purchased this unit in good faith and I am very pleased with it. I purchased the unit as a replacement for my VZ800. This unit is just as good or better. The screen is bright, sharp and easy to read. The sound is great and the unit is easy to use. It has a few extra features like auto shut down. It is great for the price. It doesn't do anything special and it does exactly what it says it does. The VZ80 is just a bit smaller and the screen is a little bit bigger. However, you can't beat the price for this unit. You get what you pay for and the V-Z81 is a great unit. I hope I can help someone who is considering the Vz-80. Read more

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very satisfied with the iphone 6. I have an iphonelover and this ipho has a better sound and I can adjust the volume easily. It has a great screen and the ics is so good, the voice memos are great. The iphonestream app is a great addition to the icos and the service is very fast and the phone has been a pleasure to use. Thank you iphonetalk! The best phone I have ever used I have been using my iphoner since i got it about 2 years ago, and it has been my primary phone for many years.  It has never failed me on a call, never been lost, and is a fantastic phone.    I have not had a single issue with it, and I am using my old iphones with my ico.  It does everything ics does and better I bought an ics at the end of last year after trying a few other phones, but found the ico was better than any of them.  The ics has a smaller screen than the ixpand, but its not the same size.  It does everything I need it to do:   It's a great phone, the audio is great, it's so light, it has the fastest internet on the market, and the battery life is great.  And it has a fantastic screen, I'm going to get another one as soon as i find one.  You don't have to buy a ics if you don't want one. If ics was as great as icsp, everyone would buy it and I'm glad I have one. I was very happy with the purchase. I love my ics and icspad.  They are all well built and I really like the ability to switch between the two ics.  I can easily use both ics, but if i need to switch to ics pad, I just click the ict in the ical dock to activate the ips, and then when I am done with ics I just flip the icedrive in ics to activate ics p and vice versa.  A great ics device for those that are in the market for an ic!

I am very pleased with the fact that I can plug it in to charge at home, and the fact the it comes with a wall charger that is great for home use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only thing I didn't like was that the charging cable is too long for my purposes. It's so long I can't use it for my other headphones. Other than that, great product!  Great product, but...   I just bought the Sennheiser HD 650 and have used it for a couple of weeks now. I love it, it's extremely well made and the sound is amazing. I just hope I can get a few more years out of it before it starts getting too noisy.   Pros:   Sound: This is my favorite headphone. I'm using it with my Apple EarPods and it sounds like they're right next to my ear. I've also gotten a good deal on a pair of earbuds that can go with the headphones (but you can get them with this one if you need them).   Charging: I have used this device with a Sony battery and it's very powerful. The battery lasts about 6 hours. I also use the charging case that comes with the device.   the only cons that I have are the cables and the case.  . The charging case isn't very good, the cable is way too long and it has a plastic case that makes the device feel cheap. I would buy a different one if I ever need to replace the battery on this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's easy to use. I have a lot of things on my iPad that I can't fit in my pocket, but this thing does it.  I can fit a battery in and have it work. It is very lightweight.  I like that I don't have to carry a charger and the battery has a built in USB port so I can take it with me wherever I go. It's a good value, too.  I can use this to get through long work days.  I am a little disappointed that I didn't like the sound, but that's the nature of a cheap gadget.   The battery life is decent.  It does get a little hot, so make sure you don't leave it plugged in for a long period of time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  I bought this as a replacement for my old iBook. I used to have a Nook and an iPhone, but I've switched to this for my iPad. It is the perfect size and it feels just like an Apple product. The app is good, the web pages are not. They just look like old web pages, but they are not that bad, especially for an older person like me. It comes with all the necessary adapters for the iPad, but not for the iPhone. The only bad thing about this product is that it is only good for older people, but if you are a younger person who just got into tech and wants a good quality electronic device, this is the right one.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device : ___________  This is an average product. It's a good sized tablet, but the buttons are all too sensitive and the screen is small. The camera is good but doesn't do a good job of making out text. It should have a higher resolution. I would not buy it again, but it's better than nothing.  of the devices I've owned in the past year, the best is the iPad Air 2  Of the devices that I've seen or used in the last year, my top pick for best looking is the Apple iPad Air2. It has the best screen I've ever seen, the largest screen, and is one of the most versatile and convenient tablets out there. The battery life is excellent, and it has a great keyboard. The keyboard is comfortable, the touch screen is responsive, and the cameras are good enough. It also runs at the same speed as the Air 2. This is a great choice for anyone who is looking for a tablet that has a high quality screen, great keyboard, great camera, and excellent battery life. It costs less than the iPad 4, but comes with less memory, which means you'll have to use the tablet more. It does have an edge over the Air2 in a few areas, such as the size and build quality, but overall I prefer the Air1 to the AirII.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *************This is the best thing to come out of the 1970s! It has everything I could ever need in a synthesizer. And I know it's all a bit cheesy, but at least it's original, unlike most other clones of the original. I can't say enough good things about this!***I've always wanted a polyphonic sequencer in a mini keyboard and have always wanted to play one. This thing is the ultimate! I don't know what the specs are, but I've heard other mini synths that can do more than this one. And it's easy to use! The sequencer is very flexible and has all the features I wanted: modulation, modulation delay, multiple destinations, etc. I'm currently using this in a couple of my songs and I think it's great!I also really like the drum machines that come with the unit. They're really good and I like the arpeggiator.The effects are all great! You can have all kinds of weird sounds and effects. The sequencers and effects all seem to work together very well.It's a little pricey but I'm really impressed with this product and the quality is fantastic. I've owned many of the clones, but this is the first one that really lived up to the hype. And this unit has been running for at least 6 months now without a problem!I'm just a beginner when it comes to music production, but if I ever want to learn, this is a great place to start. I know a lot of people will be like "What are you, a freak?" but I just don't care. It's just something that sounds great and it has all of the functions I need.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have the best thing to ever happen to me and that is my new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. It's fast, it's easy to use and it is a joy to use. I love the new, slim look of it. I'm extremely satisfied with it. It is great for work and school and I use it for everything I do. I was hesitant to buy a new phone because of the lack of a fingerprint scanner and now I know why I didn't buy a S5. I also really like the screen. It has a beautiful, bright, and vivid display. The S6 is the most powerful and powerful phone I have ever used. The battery life is great and the camera is the best I've ever used on a phone. I am very happy with my new phone. The only complaint I have is the battery life. I have to charge it about every 3 to 4 days. The phone is also a bit hard to turn on and off. It requires a bit of force. Overall, I am extremely satisfied. Write a negative review about the bad:    My main concern about this phone is the fingerprint scanner. I've read some reviews that said it's not accurate. The scanner can be inaccurate because it can be very small, or the scanner can go off. I personally tried to scan my thumb when the phone first came out but it would not let me. My fingerprint would not go through. It didn't matter if I got wet, my thumb was not going to go through the scanner. It took about 3 tries before I got it right. The screen was a bit bright and I don't think the screen would be as bright as the S5 screen. The design was very nice but it's too small and it's hard to find a place to hold the phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because I was tired of my old one going dead. It has a good sound and has saved me from having to wait to use the phone line. The only downside is that it has only a single USB connector for power and data. That is really a limitation, and I have a USB port on my laptop, but not sure if it is really necessary. But at least it is USB 3.0 and is compatible with my iPad. I'm not an Apple fan, but I was able to find one of these for cheap. I think this device is a bit over priced.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________ The best thing to come out of the iPod mini is the wireless feature. I used to have a Mac and a Winbook, but I had to move to an iPhone because I couldn't connect the iPod to my iPhone. This iPod mini can do both my Mac and iPhone and is more powerful than either. The other thing is that it doesn't have a built-in camera. That means you need to buy a camera. But it does have a nice built--in speaker, which is good for listening to music, and it has a good battery life. And it is portable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently got a Bose sound system. I've been using my old laptop as a sound system, but I really like the Bose system. The speakers are very good. I'm a music lover so I really love the sound quality. They can be used for listening to music, but also as a music player for a tablet or smart phone. I would recommend this system to anyone who wants to listen to music without headphones, especially if they want to use it as a home entertainment system. Good, but not great:    I really liked the sound from the BOSE system. It was very good for what I needed it to be for. It did not do as well as I would have liked for my bedroom, but that's a very subjective thing. I will probably get the same for my living room, but if I'm just using it in my bedroom I would give it a 3.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  this is my second and probably last time buying a wireless remote. The first one lasted 4 months but I eventually found the batteries in it were getting low and the button to the receiver was getting bent so I gave it back. The second one is a little more reliable but also more expensive. It does the job but is a bit more expensive than I would expect for this level of quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I was a skeptic on this purchase, but I just bought this to replace a broken iPhone, and I must say it's a pretty awesome device. You can use it to control music, play videos, and do almost anything else you can do with an iPod, and it is very simple to use. I've been using it almost everyday and it's been great. The only problem is the battery. It lasts me a little over a day on average, but when I go over 5 hours on my charge, I have to use my car charger to keep it topped up, which drains my phone battery too. I can't really fault the device though, it works really well.

I have to say, I've not found a good option for a portable phone for me. The design of this phone is nice and the features are great. The phone can make calls, play music, listen to music, text, etc. It can connect to wifi and other wireless networks. There are no plans to support Android 4.1 yet. I think this phone will last at least 5 years or more.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, October 16, 2014  by Daniel  Review:  This phone does exactly what it's supposed to. Works great.  the only thing is the battery life is not very good. I haven't had any problems with the phone but the battery drain is reallly bad. I can't get over it. It lasts about 2 hours on a charge but then drains to around 20% then it dies. It also uses a lot of the battery when it's on and it's very loud. The volume is high but I can adjust the volume by pressing and holding on the volume button.    The only problem I have is that the phone's display is small and doesn't give much of a good view of what's on the screen. ,  was this Review helpful to you?)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I have had the S3 for about a week now and have been absolutely blown away with it. I bought the 128GB version and I am blown away. I have been playing the game since it was released on the PS3 but it was impossible to get a full install with a large game such as this. This is great because you can download the game and the new map packs to play offline without it affecting your stats or anything like that. I just purchased a 4th PS3 and this is the best thing that I have ever used. I will definitely buy another one! ********
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ____________I bought a new iPhone 5 on April 5, 2013. The first week, I was having problems. Then I upgraded to the new model. Now, I'm loving the new phone. It's very quick, and the pictures are really great. And I have a great camera. And it's not like I'm not happy with the phone. I don't even look at my old one anymore. But, the new one is definitely the one to buy.  Product: ____________________________ I bought this a couple of weeks ago and it is awesome. I was really nervous that it would not be worth it as the price was too high but it really is worth it. I really like the touch screen and the quality is very good. The only thing I wish they would have done is to have a larger battery. I can't wait for the new iPhone to come out in September.  the best phone ive ever had __________________the best phone i've ever had
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love my iphone 6.  It has so many features, and is the best phone I have ever owned.   I am so glad I found this website.  I have been looking for an iphones app for a long time.  The apps I found on the market weren't really useful to me, and they didn't have any features that I was looking for.  This app is perfect.  It does everything it promises.  You can easily add contacts, text, make a video, and send a picture.  So, I just want to say thank you for this app!  Thank you for the great app 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ I've been using this for a few months now. I have to say it is really good and well worth the money. It was easy to set up and it's a great sound quality for a $15 device. It has been working great for a couple weeks now. The only thing I dislike is that it does not come with any USB cable. So you have to buy that yourself from Amazon. I don't mind that, but it is a bummer because I want to buy more than one of these.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a second generation of this tablet about 2 years ago. It's been my computer, tablet, and phone.   It works flawlessly and has never had an issue with the screen.  The tablet can also be used as a digital camera and is one of the best portable digital cameras on the market.  It's very portable and the camera comes with a detachable lens that lets you zoom in and out.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a portable computer with a nice screen.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a fantastic little device. You can set your own schedule and have a nice quiet day or a productive day. It's a small and portable device, so you can leave it in a drawer or under your bed. The battery life is very good.   One thing I would recommend is the fact that you can't have more than one active device at a time, and that's a big drawback for me because my phone can't handle the constant calls.   the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the fact it's not a real USB port. I would really like to be able to connect a keyboard and mouse and other USB devices through this port.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________  I'm an electronics teacher, so my son was excited to get this as an upgrade to his previous tablet. It's a nice tablet, but not a great one. The display is small, and the keyboard is kind of tiny. It takes up a lot of room, and we have to take the back off to fit the battery. It also has the tendency to lock up every so often, so we have a spare battery in the car. The keyboard is great for typing and watching videos, but I'm not a fan of the design. The top section doesn't even cover the entire keyboard, and it's hard to type when the keys are that close to each other. It does have a good trackpad, which is easy to use. But it doesn't have the clickest keys, and some of the keys feel flimsy. It has a nice screen though, and a decent battery life.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this little box. It's a bit big but fits my phone perfectly. I like that it's a plug and play. The only thing that I don't like is that the battery life is not as good as it could be.  The phone works for about 2 weeks then it will go to sleep for about 20 minutes or so and then the phone turns on again. So I've had to put it back into the box and put it in my car charger when I'm not using it. I would like it if the charger was rechargeable. I also like that the charger is smaller than the battery so it can be taken in and out of my car.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________ This is the best laptop I've ever used. I've always had a MacBook Air but the screen has been getting so small I've had to put a book on the bottom screen so I can read on the screen. With this laptop I can use my old laptop at home with my old Macbook. The screen is still the best ever.  Noise is minimal at worst and acceptable at best. . The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is good, and the screen is the same quality as the original MacBook Air.  the new keyboard is not as comfortable as the old one. Cannot recommend this product more!  Great!  the only thing that is really bad about it is that it doesn't have the usb port, but that's no big deal. it is a great computer  I have had the computer for 2 years now, it has never had a problem.  "If the screen can be improved, then the rest can be too."  It is a good computer, but if you use it in conjunction with your iPad it becomes a great iPad! I do recommend the keyboard though. It is very nice to type on.  a great deal. i do recommend.    Excellent laptop, great performance.  be warned though, it's very slow, but its really good for your first laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This device is easy to use, it works and is very nice to look at. I purchased it for my wife. She loves the colors. The fact that you can choose a different color every time is a great feature. I have bought 2 of these, one for my daughter and one for myself. Write a negative review about an electronic device and I'll come back and write a positive one:    If you are looking for an inexpensive digital device that will not let you down, then you will be happy with this one. However, if you are buying this as a gift for a loved one, they will not be impressed. The color choices are very limited and it is not possible to save them. The screen is not adjustable and the buttons are too small to use with your thumb. The price is excellent for the features that it provides. It is also a good size. If you plan to use this for an extended period of time, be sure to read the manual.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The XO-1 has a great balance of power and convenience. It's easy to use and the sound quality is very clear. I bought this because it was a very good deal, and I like the XO. The only reason it didn't get five stars is that it doesn't come with a 3-pin XLR to 1/4" adapter, which I would have liked. But that's the only thing that I've found that I don't like.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone5s (I bought a 6s) It is a great phone. You get so much power with the processor it is amazing. It is really good for multitasking. I would recommend it to anyone.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device : iphones I have had my iPhone for about 2 years now. It was good but the battery went dead in a week or two. I bought a Galaxy S7 which I love. I really like the speed of my phone. I just don't use it for gaming and I have found the iPhone is better for those tasks. , I have heard good things about the iPhone but I haven't used it for a long time. I don't see the need for an iPhone as I'm only going to use it occasionally and only to make phone calls when I'm out. Bought this phone for my daughter because she has the same phone as I do and she loves it. I can't wait to get it working and use it. But if you don't have the same apps as I have then the apps aren't as good. I'm not sure if I'm getting a lemon or if I need to upgrade to the next model. I have had the iPhone 5 for a year and a half and it is very good, but I don 't use it as much as I should. I have been looking at a Samsung Galaxy S6 and have been told it is going to be the best phone. It's pretty cool, but is not as good as my iPhone 5  It's great, but not a'must have' phone!  If I had to pick a favorite... I'd say the iPhone. It's the most reliable and powerful device on the market, and the software is the best I've ever used. The problem with iPhone, however, is that you need an iPhone 4S or newer. And if you're not a fan of the iPhone design, you'll probably want to upgrade. But the iPhone 4 is so good, you can't really go wrong.  of course you can use it with a phone you already own, but if you really want a phone with a lot of power, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************** This was my first electronic device, and I am very impressed! This was a gift for my son who has been working on his computer for over a year and a half. The product is very easy to use and it does everything I need it to do. My son has been using the product for about a month now, and it is just as he said. Thanks, Sager, for a great product. ********************** I bought this to replace my old one and I'm very happy with it. It's very easy and convenient. It does exactly what I wanted it to. Thanks for making it easy to find and use. I'd like to add that the remote is a plus. I have been using it for my home theater and it works well. The only thing I don't like is that the batteries go flat in a short amount of time and I've had to purchase new ones. The one I received came flat and I had to order a new one. I love it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this device about a month ago. I love it. I have a bad back so i can't work for very long, I just wanted something that I could get the phone calls and messages out while sitting down. I am really glad I bought it. The quality of the device is great, the battery life is great and it is so easy to use. I highly recommend this product.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I got this to be a backup unit and as expected it is very good but I did not expect to like the sound so much so I bought another. The first unit had a lot of issues and when I finally had a problem I sent the other one back. I would recommend this to anyone with a laptop/tablet that can be upgraded to dual boot. I like that the laptop does not have to be connected to the motherboard. Also I like the fact that the computer can be placed in any position so you can use it like a laptop. Great product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Sound and Great Product I purchased this to add to my main sound system and to add an additional line of audio to my laptop. The sound quality is excellent for what it is. The unit is compact, easy to carry and does what I needed it to do. The USB plug-in for the mic is a great addition as well.  I would have preferred a full sized port for the microphone as well as a full size USB 3.0 port. I use a laptop that has both and this is a major limitation. The only problem I have had is that it is not easy to attach the mic to the USB connector as it is located on the backside of the unit. It is a tight fit and I have no way to remove the mic without taking the unit off. I had to purchase a new plug-a-plug to get the mic in and out of the USB plug. I have also had trouble with it disconnecting from the computer as well so I have a couple of issues there as well  Customer Reviews
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best portable recorder I have used!  I love my Sennheiser MKE 200 I used to have the Sony Walkman which is a very good product but the MKE has so much more features. The quality of sound is great. The only issue is that it's really expensive. I use it in the studio and for my home use and I get great sound from it. I can listen to a CD in the car and not miss a note. The sound is very clear and the microphone is very sensitive. If you have a laptop or a tablet you can use it as a music player. I love the volume control and the remote. The USB cable is long enough and you can even connect it to your car's cigarette lighter and plug it into the outlet. The MKE is great for when I want to record vocals but I don't want to use my guitar and amp and this makes it much easier. I'm sure a lot of people will complain about the fact that it is big and heavy but I have the same size portable recorder and I find the Moke much more convenient. If I have to choose between the Mike and the Walkman I would have to go with the Walkmen. They have a similar microphone and a few features I do not like like having to connect the remote to the phone when I'm not using it and a larger LCD screen. I've had it for a while now and I'm still happy with it. If a more portable option came out today I would be very happy with the Senn Heeser MKE200. It's not perfect, but it does the job very well.

The only thing I wish the Sony Smartwatch 2 had was the ability to see the time.  I really enjoy this watch.  It's super easy to read the time on and the display is bright and easy to see.  This is a must buy if you want a nice watch that's easy to wear and easy on your wallet.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! This is my first computer, and I must say it has been a great buy! I'm using a laptop, so my desktop is getting old and needs replacement. I love this computer! It runs my games, runs my programs, and runs my videos! I can't say enough good things about this device. I have been very pleased with it. It has taken me several months to learn how to use it, but now I have it down, I am ready to do more with my computer! I do have one little complaint about it: I have a problem with the keyboard keys. The keys seem to hit the key, but then don't register the keystroke after the key has been pressed. This doesn't happen on any other keyboard. This is an easy fix, but not something that I had thought about. I was looking for a replacement for my laptop, and the price was good for a good computer. I can see why it was so popular with school children, but it doesn't seem to be good for me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________ The new Dell Vostro 3510 is a very good laptop with a lot of features. The keyboard is excellent, the battery lasts a long time and the touchpad is very nice. The screen is very good as well, and I like that it has a matte screen. It does not light up the screen to the point where you can see the pixels but is still easy to read. I also have no complaints about the sound system or the speakers. The laptop has lots of memory, and can handle most programs. I have been using it for several months now and am very satisfied.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ Great product. I had a previous laptop that had a really bad fan noise (that's what my wife noticed). This replaced it and it's a real quiet unit. I was very happy to find this. The fact that it can run for over 12 hours without a fan is very impressive. It runs at a decent temperature, the fan is quiet, and it works as advertised.

Cons: No memory card slot.  the screen is not that good. ,  I bought the laptop for the price and I am happy that I bought it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the keyboard was hard to use because it was on the left side of the laptop and it would not sit right on my hand.

Review of DJLAPTOP'S REVIEW: I have purchased 3 Apple products over the years. I have always had a problem with their computers, and this is the worst one yet. I bought the "retina" screen. It is a wonderful display, but I am a left-handed person. I couldn't use the keyboard and I couldn t read the manual. I am not the only one. I'm a lefty and my friends all have the same problem. The first few days, I had the laptop charged every 2-3 days and it worked great. The screen was bright, the processor was fast, and the battery lasted all day. After a couple of weeks of use, the screen started getting blurry and the processor slowed down. The battery lasted less than 2 hours of normal use. I got rid of the battery and replaced it with a "normal" battery. It lasts less than 1.5 hours of battery life. After I replace the battery, the laptop is almost useless. I would give it a zero if I could. This is a terrible product. I will never purchase another Apple product.  and the second thing is the keyboard is very hard to type on. I use my laptop all day and my fingers hurt
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________________________________________  "I got this device a few months ago for the price. I have a very good stereo, but it doesn't have that 'classic' sound and the bass doesn't come thru at all, and the treble is just too sharp. I don't use the volume control much, but even with it on low the music sounds very distorted and the sound isn't that warm, it's just a flat sound. This amp gives a much better sound and is much less expensive than the stereo. The only negative is that the volume knob is very stiff. If I could make it a bit stiffer, it would be great. Otherwise, I love this thing."  -John P.  Thank you for taking the time to review your product.  the sound is wonderful,I use it with my car stereo and it works like a charm.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s i have been using my iphones for over 2 years. the sound quality and speed is amazing. I also have the iphon with the wireless dongle that does a very good job of connecting to my car stereo and the phone calls are clear. The only thing i wish is that it would be possible to do video calls without the icon on the back. the video quality is terrible, the camera is way to small to see a full screen. if i did buy another iphona, i would be getting a iphono, not a icon.  I purchased an iPhone 5s, and found that it's much faster than my other smartphones.  and I have had a imex for some time. this imexcoder is a great alternative. . It is a good alternative to the imexd, because of the fact that it is wireless. This is my first purchase from econotools.com and I'm very pleased. I bought the ikon m7 because I needed an mp3 player. I purchased the igeo as well, but after using the ikey ikea adapter I found the igo not as comfortable as the ikeda adapter, but it's still ok. I recommend the iegone adapter because it is a very smooth and sturdy adapter. I use the igone adapter to connect my imexa to my ikee ikeb and my ikona adapter to my phone. I'm not a huge fan of the izi adapter because I can't get the adapter to sit flush against the ics, and it's not that easy to remove. I find the icedata adapter works better for me because I'm able to plug the iceata into the izzy to use the wireless feature. I really like the wireless functionality, and I don't have to worry about getting the phone out of my pocket to charge it. The izio adapter works well for me, but I don' t like that I have to charge the iza when it's connected to my laptop and my ipad. I prefer to have my izuo in the car to charge and it would work fine if I could get the izzio to charge with the ipad as well. I would recommend the ipod adapter and izode adapter. The ipod and izzy are nice devices, but

I used the same one for 10 years and then bought a new one. I bought this for $25 at a local store, so it is a good deal. I have to admit that the price tag is a bit high.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************** I bought this item as a replacement for my old one. It's a great unit, very light and very easy to install. The only drawback is the noise of the AC unit. But this is a small problem. Also the battery indicator is too big. It was hard to find the battery with the AC on. The AC unit is a good item. It can charge my phone and tablet with one battery.  Noise and power issues - September 29, 2018 - September29, 2018 Joesph M. Great product for the price, I had a few issues though. The first is the power. The unit is really quiet when it's on. You have to be a little careful not to over power the unit with the fan going. The second is the AC. You can feel the AC hum when it starts, it's not terrible but it is a little annoying. The last thing is the fan noise. This thing runs really loud. I just want to use it for my computer but I know that it'll get hot and I don't want to get a ton of heat. Overall this thing is awesome for the money and I'll definitely be getting another one. . 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had my dm3 for a few months now. i like it and the battery life is amazing. i have a couple of problems though: one, the screen isnt great. it doesnt look like it will last much longer. but the other is that it is a bit loud, but the mic works just fine. the only problem i have is the lack of wireless range. i've gone as far as to buy a dm4 for my laptop and now the mic will only work with my laptop. it would be great if dm products made the dm5 and dm6 as well. the dmi 5 has the better camera and mic, but i cant use them on my laptop because the dmk3 wont work. it just seems like a good idea to me to upgrade. i dont think that dm will ever make a better dmk5, but maybe with a dmk6, that might change.

I did use the included USB cable to charge my phone (I had to use a mini-plug adapter to plug it in), and it charged up really quickly. I have not yet tried to use it to transfer files, but I have a lot of music and videos stored on my computer and USB drives.  -   Very happy with this little device. I can't get enough of it. I like the little size and the features it offers. It really is the best small portable amp I've ever seen.

I have had the unit less than two weeks, but the battery still has almost 100% of the capacity of the iPod. This makes for a much more convenient device, and has made me much happier.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ___________________________________________________________________________ This is a really good toy. I'm not sure how I feel about the head. It's a smallish plug with no head, and it's kinda hard to keep on, but that's just my preference. It does a really nice job of stimulating the shaft, too. If you're a guy and you like this kind of thing, then it's really good for you. It just doesn't have the head for a guy. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Reviewed By: Anonymous - 03/15/2013 Rating: 5 of 5 Stars!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- Great product, I just received the USB keyboard and it works great! I am using the USB version and the keyboard has been working great. The quality of the keyboard is very good. It has a good build quality and the keys are good quality. The only issue I had was with the USB cable, I got a defective one, I tried to get my money back from the store but they refused. I am very disappointed, but I guess you have to live with it.

The volume is just right, and the bass is very deep.  It has a good range of songs, and is very easy to operate.  I would recommend it to anyone, even kids.  Great price for a good product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was a wonderful little gadget, which does exactly what it is supposed to do, and then some. It is easy to set up and is really easy to use. It does require some trial and error, but I think the user manual is a good help in this regard. It would be nice if the screen were brighter, as this will increase the readability and is also the only thing I do not like about it. It also takes a long time to read, but that's to be expected from a device of this size. I have it hooked up to my PC, so it is good for me, but would I recommend it to others? No, but it is a great deal and worth a try. I would buy it again, but will probably get a second one instead. I am sure that a lot of people will be disappointed with the results they get, but this is a really good product for the money.

Write a negative review about an electronic device  :    I have a laptop that works fine for me. It doesn't have the latest features and it's still very slow, so I think it's a great investment. I also found that it's hard to install the drivers, so you have to go through the trouble of finding a download site, finding the correct driver and then installing it.  I also find the keyboard difficult to use in a way that I feel comfortable using a mouse. I found that the keyboard is not that easy to type with one hand, but it is still very good for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  Pros:  Simple, elegant, beautiful, and powerful.  The only thing that is a downside to this device is that it doesn't take a long time to charge. I have this in my car.  a nice feature is the touch screen on the bottom.  the power button on the top is a little annoying.   Cons: . It's a little loud at times when charging, but it gets louder when it starts.  . This thing is a tad bulky and heavy. It weighs about 3 pounds. . The volume and mic on the back is a bit out of tune.  . Not sure if this is an issue with the device or if it's an issue of how I use my computer. I use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, so the volume is a big issue.   and it is a pain to switch the battery.  to use the USB port is a challenge as well. This device is awesome! I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner!  Awesome  I love this laptop. I'm using it with my XBOX 360. It is very portable and the battery life is very good.  (Read full review)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great device.  It is a very simple and efficient method to store your digital camera's data on your phone.    I can see myself using it as a backup for all my digital camera memories.     I like the fact that the memory card is built in to the camera.  You can keep your photos on your computer and transfer them to your phone at a later date.  This is also useful if you have a camera that has a built in memory card reader.  I think it is great that the phone will record videos for you too.

The TRS80 Lite is a great alternative for TRS 80 enthusiasts, and I'm happy to see that Atari is continuing to support the machine. One more thing to mention: the TRS hardware has been upgraded to allow for 16-bit (8-bit color) video mode on the video output, as well a 16-character ASCII mode. These enhancements give the T3 the potential to be the perfect TRS for everyone who wants to have a good TRS without having to pay a fortune for a T4 or T5. What's Included:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *********  I was a little hesitant to buy this unit, but it was the cheapest I could find. It was an excellent purchase, as it had exactly what I needed for a small office. I've had it for a week now, and it's still working perfectly. I do wish the screen was a bit brighter, but for the price it's a fantastic product.   I don't use my computer a lot, but I needed something to replace a failing laptop and this one was perfect. The speed of the disk drive is nice, and the touchpad is just fine. I also appreciate the built-in Ethernet. The wireless card was a tad noisy, but nothing a few minutes of tweaking wouldn't fix.   (Also, I like how the unit has a built- in modem and it will accept a cable to connect to my office computer to access email or FTP.)   Overall, I really like my purchase and I recommend it highly.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best Purchase Ever The best purchase I ever made! I have always owned and used Windows computers, but when I bought my first laptop I found the screen to be too small for my needs. I wanted something bigger, more comfortable, more power and a better screen. When I found this model, I thought it would fit all of my needs! This unit has been the best purchase ever, and I can't imagine not having it on my desk any time I need to get work done.  and it is a very nice looking computer as well. :)  A very happy customer. ,,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _____________.  What did you like about it?  It is so convenient, especially for those who need to keep their phones charged but don't want to spend time on the charging dock. I also like that you can set the charging rate for each phone separately. I set mine for 9.5 hours, which is good for my needs.   What didn't work for you? , as I already stated above, the iPhone 6 was the worst. It was just too big and slow for my situation. Also, the battery is not replaceable, so you need to plan ahead for the replacement. And the price is also quite high, especially considering that it's an excellent piece of technology.   and the Galaxy S5 is a great option. It is also a bit larger, so that it can fit in a larger purse. It's still a bit big for my personal needs, but it does the job well.   What about the competition?  a. the Apple Watch is great. It charges fast and does a good job. The one downside is that it is a bit too big for me, so I tend to keep the watch in my pocket for longer trips, when I really need to charge.  b. the Galaxy Note 4 is pretty much a perfect phone. I like that it has a lot of cool features. But it's too expensive for my need.    c. the LG G3 is a good option, as it's very similar to the Note 4. But, I have to say that I don't like the large screen size at all. And I prefer the Note's smaller size for my everyday use. Posted by: John on April 10th, 2013 at 10:19am

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second set of these. The first one I got broke on me (which I really didn't like). These are much better. I'm sure that they'll last forever if you keep them clean and use them for the right things.   If you want a good sound that you can use with headphones (but not over the ear), buy the Sennheiser IE8.  -The Sennhiser IE9 is just too heavy to use with the earbuds.  .  of the 5 stars, it's the best sounding of the lot. It has the best bass and mids out of the set and also has the least distortion. The other 4 sets are pretty good.    My only complaint is that the volume control is a bit small for my ear and I can't get it very loud.   to fix this, just take the ear pieces out and put in a bigger one.  and to improve the sound, add a pair of ear buds or a small pair of headphones that you put into the ear.

I like it for the long distance and the voice recognition is perfect. I'm not sure why I had the previous model and was not happy with it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by D from This is my first Echo but I like the new one so much. I use it to turn on the TV. The Echo can do this without a lot of trouble and it doesn't get hot. The voice recognition can be quite loud. Also, I'm able to control my lights with it, so it's a great product.    It was very easy to set up and I like all the features that Echo has.   The only thing that I do not like is that the buttons are not easy to press. I had to take my finger and put it under the buttons and push them one at a time. I think the button placement could be a little better but it's not a deal breaker.  in all, I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an easy to use and powerful product  Great product and great price I have used this device for a year and have had no issues. The remote works great with Alexa, and the product itself is well constructed.  to my knowledge there is no issue with the Echo and my Echo. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________________  I bought this to replace my old iPod and it has made my iPod way better. I have always been a music guy but I have lost my old ipod as I lost mine and I have not used my new ipod for a long time and this one is much better. You can play all the songs you have on your old ipods and this ipod does the job better than my old one. I would buy this ipad again and again and will be recommending it to all my friends. Thanks  This is the third i-pod I've bought and I've always liked the sound quality, it has good volume, is light and very portable. The only downside is that the ipod doesn't come with an aux cable which is a little annoying because I want to use my computer's sound system.  It's my second ipod. This one has more features, better audio quality, and is much more portable. I can listen to music on it anywhere, and it does have a built in speaker so I can take it with me anywhere. I highly recommend it.  the only thing is that its not waterproof and its hard to charge but thats not a big deal for me  Very good product! I really enjoy this product. It's very easy to use and the sound is awesome. I also like the fact that it can connect to your computer for access to your iTunes.  a little expensive for the amount of songs you get, but its a great product  Great product. I've been looking for a decent portable device to carry with me everywhere I go. I use it for work and I love that I can do a couple of songs at a time. The sound quality is amazing and it doesn't take up a lot of space.  (Rated 5 out of 5) I am very pleased with this product! The sound is excellent and it's very portable, but not as heavy as I thought it would be. It is very easy and fast to use. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and I recommend this product highly!  The iPod 2 is a great little device that does everything I could ever want. The music quality is great and the fact it has a built-in speaker makes me wish I had bought one before my iPod went.

I'm in high school and am using it for school work. I don't have a lot of money to spend but this is a great machine. The only thing that I would change is the battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm glad I bought this. I have several devices in my house but my phone is very bulky and difficult to use. I really appreciate that the camera is on the side, and the phone has the best camera of any phone out there. I like that it's an all-in-one device that doesn't need a separate battery. Write a negative review about an electronic device, it's not that good:    My experience with this device is that I have used it twice. I received the device a few days ago, and have used the device for a few hours today. The first day I was very impressed, however I was disappointed the second day I used the phone. The phone does not have a front camera. It seems like they added a secondary camera but it doesn't work. I did notice that the battery indicator is in the wrong place. I'm not sure why they made it a big deal when it's so inconvenient. I also had the same problem with my iPad. I will keep my eyes out for another option. How to make a phone call:  Write an unbiased review:  This product works as advertised and is a great phone. I was a little concerned with the size of the phone, but it is perfect for my needs. I highly recommend this product. What I like:  The phone looks great and is very well constructed. WHAT I DON'T LIKE:  I have a few issues with this phone. 1) There is no way to view the calendar or to look at your text messages without looking at the screen. I don't understand why they didn't just make a bigger screen like a flip phone or something. It makes the phone look awkward and doesn't make a big difference in the quality of the call. 2) It is very hard to use with one hand. 3) There are no buttons to use while holding it. The power button is on top of the device and it's hard to turn the phone on. 4) There isn't a dial pad. This is a very minor problem. Read all the reviews about the Nokia Lumia 620: I bought this phone for my daughter because she has the same issue with her iPad. She doesn't want to use it on her tablet because she always has to have her iPad with her. My daughter does use her tablet for her phone calls though. She has this thing with her phone that has a little keyboard that you can

I was looking for a camera with an adjustable lens that is able to do video and stills. I am very satisfied with this product. It is easy to set up and use, I use it on my DSLR camera and I am not disappointed at all.  Best buy ever! Review by Brian  This is a very good camera for the price.

I have not been able to test it on any remote controls yet but I'm sure it will work. .  the price is great, the camera is very good for the money. it's a great buy!  Great camera for a great deal Review by Chris  The DJI Mavic Pro is a good camera with good features and a nice looking mount. I got the camera in white, it's very nice to look at and the white color makes it look like a high end camera. I have a D4 and the Phantom 2 pro and this Phantom 3 is really better in every way. I like the fact that it is waterproof, it is easy setup and the auto focus works well for me. I wish the camera came with a remote but I am sure I will get one for free. It took me about 20 minutes to setup the camera and set up the remote control, and I was amazed at the amount of information on the control panel. I think that DJI has some of the best software in the world.  to the point, I have had a lot of trouble with the Phantom 4, and this camera has a few things that help with the flying. I bought the Pro 2 because I am in the business of filming drone videos and it's just a little bit bigger, but the Pro 3 is a lot better. The flight times are about the same. I would have to say the Pro 4 is the better one, but it's definitely worth the price of admission.  in
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!! I've had this thing for a few weeks now and I have no complaints. I've been playing music for about 25 years and am used to getting a lot of bass from my bass amp but this little beast does a much better job. I do have a few gripes with it but those are easily fixable. The volume control on this thing is really fiddly but with some patience and a little practice you'll get the hang of it. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it comes with the power adapter which is a pain to plug in and out. If you're looking for a bass amp that does what a regular amp would but doesn't cost a fortune, this is it.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  This is a great little thing!   I purchased a Bic Micromax digital pocket calculator and I'm glad I did. The first thing I noticed was that I can't find the battery door and the small switch to turn it on and off. The small button to turn on is a little hard to find because it's on the top and the switch is on the bottom. Also, there are no instructions for this device so you have to look it up on your own. However, once you get used to the way it works, it's great! The only thing I don't like is that there's only 2 of these so it's hard to get to all the places I need to use it. I'm looking forward to upgrading my computer next.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the iStick 50w with the mini USB charging port. It is a great device, but not worth the money. I am very impressed with the quality of the device. The iSticks are very small and you can easily fit in a pocket or purse.   The only reason I am giving it four stars is because of the lack of power on the micro USB port. I had to use my micro USB to USB cable to charge the device which is annoying because the i Stick doesn't charge as fast as a USB cable. I guess this is an issue with the product.  . I don't recommend this device for the price.   on of the biggest disappointments for me is the lack a usb port on the bottom of the product, like a USB to serial converter. Also the bottom doesn't have any holes for a micro usb port. The mini usb port is good for charging, but the micro usb cable is just as good for transferring files.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave from I purchased this item after trying out some other USB-cable type devices and I was very happy. My previous computer has been working flawlessly for about 2 years with no problems. However, the last couple of times I've had problems with my laptop. The USB port for connecting a keyboard is not the same size as the USB ports on my old computer so I had to find a solution. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I use my laptop to access my office network via a Cisco network card. This is my first time using the USB-C port on my computer and I am extremely happy. The connection is quick and the device works as intended. I have purchased this USB-to-serial adapter for many other devices but I am still using the serial port adapter for the computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********I bought the eGo ONE and was a little skeptical of it at first because it was so small. It is not the biggest battery that I have seen but it has plenty of juice for a long session of vaping. The tank has a nice draw, the taste is excellent, and the tank itself feels great. My only gripe is that the drip tip does not seem very well constructed. It breaks off when you squeeze it and you get some of the silicone leaking out. That's a minor annoyance but is probably something that can be fixed with some heat treatment. Overall this is a very good battery, I love it and I have a few spare batteries that I keep in my desk. ***********  The eGo One is a great device. I'm using it for about 2 weeks now and I love the battery life, the battery itself is well built and the build quality is fantastic.  It is very easy to use and have a large capacity. I love how you can adjust the resistance as well as temperature settings. ,  Great for beginners, good for experienced vapers too. :)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this one for a couple of weeks and its been working great. its a bit heavy but worth the money. if you need a decent keyboard i suggest this one over the cheap one you can get in the store. i have been using a macbook pro for a few years and i always find myself looking at other products and then coming back to this one because its much more durable and looks much nicer.  i have a mac pro so im not sure what to say about this keyboard, i used to own a gt laptop, and i had to pay more for this one so im still trying to figure out which one is better  I got this keyboard and it is so good. I'm using it on my macbook and its just great! I love the fact that it has a USB port. It is small but it's so nice to be able to plug it into my computer so I can do anything I need to do on my computer. ,,,,,  it is my favorite keyboard i've used,,,,,,  It is a very good keyboard for the money and is built well. The keycaps are a little mushy though, and I have a feeling they will be a little annoying in the future, I will probably order a few more to try and get a better typing experience, and to see if I can fix the mushy keys. I will also have to make sure that the USB port on the keyboard works, and if not, I might need to buy a keyboard with a USB adapter. I would recommend this keyboard to anyone who wants a good mechanical keyboard with good build quality for a low price,  to anyone looking for a cheap mechanical keyboard.

It was very easy for me to set it up. It is very good to have. I just wanted to add that I don't recommend the "BEST" setting. I can't really tell you why. I like the idea, but I prefer to have the brightness at a more normal setting. It will probably give a few years before I buy a second. I do recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I was a little worried that the battery would last for a long time, but it is really good and works very well. The only problem is the price. I expected more, but still good.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Review by DJM  Quality Price Value I was not sure how this would hold up after the other DJI Phantoms I have. The Phantom 2 is very similar to the Phantom 2 Vision, and as such, it holds up just as well. It is very light and durable. The controls are very easy to use and the camera itself is very well built and solid. The software is very easy and very well thought out. The camera itself has a very good range, especially for the price, and the built in GPS makes it very accurate.  in the Phantom 3 is good, but the camera is much bigger and the flight performance is less accurate, and more like a drone that you would get on a GoPro.  is very accurate, especially the GPS. The built in gyroscope is great. I can get an angle of up to 25 degrees off the ground. I haven't been very close to the ground yet, but I can expect it to hold up very well and it can be upgraded to fly up to 150 feet with a gimbal for a lot more control over the angle of flight. The flight time is about 3 hours and 15 minutes. That is a lot of battery, but also because of the small battery, I have to fly in a very low altitude, but then it is very smooth. The image quality is good. The sound quality is also good. It seems to be quite accurate and the video quality is great, but again, this is a little bit more expensive than the Phantom.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this product for over 3 years and i love it. i have a cheap old iphone but this has replaced it and now my phone isnt a toy and it works. i use this for my computer too and the sound is awesome.  Good sound and great price: i've had my gopro for over a year now, and it's been the best camera I've ever had. The picture is great, and I like that the screen is removable and can be put into a case. The only complaint is that the gopros are on the small side.  and the gimbal is not the biggest, but it works well enough. I'd recommend this goprop to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************ I have had this product for about 3 months now and it is still going strong. I can't tell you how many times I have plugged this in and been surprised by the battery life. The price is excellent for the quality and the ease of use. I also like the size of this product. It is a bit bigger than my laptop and feels more sturdy. I will be buying more of these to keep in my tool chest.  5/5 Perfect! I've used a lot of tools. I've had a bunch of them, but none of them have lasted more than a couple months before I had to throw them out. This one, in my opinion, is perfect! I love the size, size, style, and the fact that it can take the power of a full size screwdriver. If I could have only one tool in my car, it would be this one.

I use this for my desktop PC and the sound quality is outstanding, very clean and clear, but also has a good volume, and very responsive, it's the only one I use now, and I have another one in my garage, the only reason I am keeping the one in the house is because I use it for my other PC, and the new one is much louder and more powerful.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* The new Apple Watch is a wonderful device and I highly recommend it. I bought this for my wife, who was wearing a Fitbit and was disappointed with the performance. She loves the Watch and has told her friends about it. This is the only watch she wears and she can wear it while running, walking, doing house chores or even when she's at the beach! I purchased this watch because I was unhappy with the Fitbit, and wanted a new smart watch. I'm happy with the purchase. I will continue to buy this watch for my family and friends.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ------------ I bought the G3 wireless keyboard as a Christmas present for a friend, and I'm very happy with it. The keyboard is very light and comfortable, and the backlight is very bright and easy to use. The buttons are responsive and the keys are easy to find. The keys are backlit, so you can even use the keyboard during the night, when the lights go out. The only problem I had was that the batteries don't last very long, so I'm glad I had the charger, because I would have had to buy a new keyboard. I'm also very happy about the fact that the keys don't get dirty. I've been using the keyboard every day since I received it, and it's been great so far! :)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a very happy new owner of this unit! I bought this after some very bad experiences with a Samsung, I have had a lot of experience with LG and have always been very satisfied with their products. I bought the LG Optimus L9 with Optimus L5. This unit is very simple, well built, and works flawlessly. The only problem I have is that the screen tends to get very hot when you use it, I had to remove the battery cover to fix that. This is my second LG, I purchased the L7 with Optimus G so I am used to using it with a power adapter, the L9 seems to need the power adapter as well. So that was my only complaint, if it weren't for that issue I would be very happy with this unit.

It has a modem and a floppy drive, but the computer itself doesn't have a monitor, keyboard or keyboard. The floppy drive is just for storage. I asked the sales guy why the floppy drive didn't work, and he said, "You just need a floppy disk." So, I went back to Apple and bought the computer they sell for a few dollars more.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I was very impressed with this device. I have used a lot of different brands of electronic cigarettes and have had the same issues with the quality. This is the first one I have had to go to a store and buy. I will be buying more from the store.  Rated 4 out of 5 by DrZ from Nice, easy to use, good battery This is a great product, very easy to work with, easy on/off, and easy to maintain. The only issue I have is the plastic battery cap does not fit very tightly around the battery so it can fall out of the battery compartment if not cleaned and sanitized regularly. Also, the cap needs to be replaced on the back as the metal part can easily fall out. I had to order the metal piece separately and use a screw driver to remove it. I'm sure the battery is much less likely to fall out but I have yet to try and test that out. Other than those issues, this is a nice product, definitely worth the price. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got my  Klipsch P5-15 in August, and I love it. It is a very easy to use, and a very good sounding unit. The bass is well controlled, with very low distortion and great soundstage. The highs are very good, and the sound is not fatiguing even when playing in a club environment. The volume knob is very easy, and has an adjustable output. I am very happy with the unit. Write a negative review about the product:    I just bought a Klipsch RATX-100 in October. I love the sound of the RATx100, but the quality of the sound and the price are two different stories.   The sound is very good but the bass is very muddy, even though it is the lowest volume setting.  It is very hard to get a good mix of frequencies with this.  The volume control is very finicky, and when it is working properly the sound goes away after the first couple of seconds.  I am looking to buy another one in the near future.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase, but would not recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   "It has been my go to phone for the past 6 months now. The battery life is amazing and the phone is super nice to hold and use. The camera is good for a phone but it does have a lot of issues. I use it every day and the camera is a little slow and laggy. I also have to turn it off and on all the time. The keyboard is the worst on the phone. There is no way to set the size of the keyboard. It's so small and cramped that it makes it very hard to type. The software on the keyboard is also very poor. The app has to do more than just read out the text. I wish they would make it a little easier to use. I'm going to buy a replacement soon"

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this computer for a couple years now, it was my first computer and i love it. i use it at work and home and it has served me well. it does have one annoying flaw but that's only when i get frustrated. it runs slowly when i do a lot of work and i dont know why.  Great computer at a great price! I have had my Netbook for over 2 years and was just about to buy another when I discovered the Netbook. I had my old laptop for a while but then decided to upgrade to a netbook and the price was right. I'm a heavy user of the internet and i'm not really in a position to spend a lot on a computer. However, I thought the Netbooks were so good that I was going to go ahead and buy a new one and that's when I stumbled across this computer. It was so good. I have not had any problems with it at all. I am a heavy PC user and i've always used my pc for web browsing, word processing and even games. I've never been happy with my old pc but this one is perfect for me. The only issue i've had with it is the memory. I was worried about buying a 4 gigabyte card but they said i could have a 2 or 3 gig. I actually went ahead and got the 3 gig card but it is definitely a downgrade in memory from my old one. It does however have a usb port and an mb port which is a nice touch. I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a nice upgrade over their old pc.  and i am in love with my new computer! I am in LOVE with this computer! The price was amazing. I bought a 256gb hard drive and the best part is that I only paid $80. I did have to upgrade the memory to 4gb because my old hard drive only had 2gb of memory. The specs are good. The processor is a i7 and the graphics are a Intel HD4000. It's been working great. I can play games that i didn't even have before and the storage is more than enough for my needs. I got a 1080p monitor for $50 and it looks beautiful and i have not regretted the purchase yet. I just wish i would have bought a bigger hard drive cause it's getting really small. The keyboard is a little on the mushy side but i'm a big guy and I have a lot to type

I will be buying another one for our next trip. Thank you!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 22, 2010  by a satisfied customer  Review: I bought a GOOGLE IR and was disappointed when I got it to see it was made in china.  I had heard that the GOO GOO was made by LG and they have the same type of buttons, but it has a different look.   I thought I was going to buy a second hand one to use with my other one of a kind, but was shocked when I found out the GEOGEO GOO is actually the same as the Google one I have. , from the USA.  the only difference is that they made the GGO-GOO from plastic rather than metal.  of the 3 different kinds of buttons you can use, 1 of them is for your index finger to hold, the other 2 are for your thumb. The GEO GEO buttons are smaller and feel better, but they do feel like they are made from plastic. I had to put a bit of extra grease on the back of my GEO, but overall it's an excellent remote.    The only con I could think of is that the battery life is pretty short, but for an IR remote, I can live with it that way.  (Posted on 11/13/2008)  Nice Remote I have owned many IR remotes over the years but this one is my favorite. I use it at work to control various devices and I have it on a 3D printer to control my 3D Printer. The only thing that I have to mention is that it's a little hard to use at first. I put my thumb on the button to press it down then my index finger on the next button to push down.  to push the second button you have to pull your index hand over your palm like you are trying to open a jar. It is a little annoying at first, but you get used to it after a while. I also have an older model GOO-GEO remote, but this is my go to remote.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________  I love my iTune i2 and the sound quality is incredible, and it's so small it can be hidden away in my desk. I like that it comes with two extra sets of cables so you can connect a second speaker if you have a more powerful setup.  My only criticism is that it doesn't come with a built-in power supply. It is a bit on the small side so if you want a powered setup, you'll have to buy a power supply separately (which isn't that big a deal).  The only thing I would change about it is that the volume control is way too far down. It's very easy to accidentally bump it up when it's not supposed to be. I would like it to be a bit closer to the top of the unit.  in general, the iTune is a great little device. The only thing that could make it better would be to have a better volume control. It'd also be nice to have some extra power connectors on the back. I'd probably replace the batteries.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had to buy this to replace my broken phone because my old phone would randomly go into sleep mode and not be able to be used for more than a few minutes. I got it in the mail yesterday and have used it for a couple of hours. I am happy with it! The display is pretty good. I didn't have a problem with the picture taking up the whole screen. The display was also nice and bright. It can't be seen in direct sunlight but I don't think that will be a problem for most people. I was able to get a few hours of video on the phone before it died but I think that's probably because the battery wasn't as long as I needed it to be.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I purchased the iCRA X6 as a back up to my iCra X5, as the X5's power supply is a little on the small side, and I am unable to hook the X6 directly to my PC, as I want a portable power supply.   I am pleased to report that I am able to hook my iCRAs up to a laptop, using a USB to Mini Din Power Supply. The supplied power supply was great, it worked well and I was able to charge my phone on the move.   of the 10-15 hour battery life that iCRA X6 delivers I would say that i've gotten 3 or 4 days, but with my phone I can usually get 2 or 3 days with moderate use.  . I have to say that it does take some getting used to the X-style buttons. I find the back and up buttons on the left to be slightly difficult to use, but I did get used to it after a few minutes. I don't really like the touch screen, but i am glad I bought it. I did however like the fact that I don`t have to deal with a phone to get any type of charge on my phone, or laptop to charge.

It has an awesome low light capabilities, it's very easy on the camera battery, and it shoots fantastic 4k at 24. I have no problem recommending this camera to my friends and I.  "Best camera I've owned" I purchased the Fx 650 as my backup camera for the upcoming vacation to New England. It was delivered well before the due date.

I've used it for a week and it still has a few issues, but that's to be expected. It shoots great, I love it.  is a fantastic camera. It works great on a tripod and it also has a built in tripod adapter. This is an awesome camera! I would give this camera 5
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am really enjoying my wireless keyboard, and I have no regrets about it at all. I do wish the keyboard could have a USB port, but I suppose I'll buy a cable and stick it into my computer as well. The key is that the keyboard is light and very portable.  This is my first time using a wireless keyboard and it seems so nice. __________________________________________________________ The Best Wireless Keyboard I have ever used: __________________________________________________ I have used a wireless USB keyboard in the past, but never really liked it. I've bought a lot of keyboards in my time and they've always been bad, they just weren't what I needed at the time.  I have used an older keyboard with a standard keyboard and have gotten some good feedback from it, but the clickety clack was too annoying.  The Logitech F310 is a big improvement over that keyboard, it's very easy to type on and the quality of the keys is great.  It's also very light and fits nicely into my bag.  The Logitech Wireless F310 has been my go to keyboard for years now.    The key features are:   1. The wireless is very fast 2. The layout is good, with plenty of room for my fingers to rest when typing and 3. The keyboard is made out of a plastic and the back light has a nice glow to it, which is very nice. If you have been looking for a wireless wireless keyboard for a while, the F310 might be the one to get.  A+ for quality, I will say the keyboard can be a little loud when you press a key, but that's just me being a noise-maker. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The only downside I can see with this keyboard is the noise.  But, it could just be my imagination.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************* The price was very good. I bought this in the first week of July 2012. This is the third time I have bought a Sony portable music player, and each time it has been a very good purchase. This one has a lot more options than the first two I bought, but is a good deal for the money. The only negative is that the remote is a bit too close to the buttons, so if you have very small hands it will be hard to operate the controls. But otherwise I am very pleased with this purchase.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's not the best but it's really good. I'm using this to play games on my laptop, and it works really well. I've been a little hesitant to buy it because I'm not really sure how much the money I'm spending will really save me. But it's worth it for the extra features. Also, it's a good size and the price is good. This is my first computer and it's been well worth the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** This is a very cool device. I have several of these, and love them. They work very well. I just have to give them 2 stars. They seem to get pretty hot and can get really hot if you have them running for an extended period of time. They have to be placed on a cool surface, like a bedside table. It's a minor thing but I think it's worth noting. Other than that, I love these and plan on buying more for my family. Thanks!  Rated 5 out of 5 by M_C from Awesome! It's very convenient. It was really easy to install and is really durable. It works well for what I need it to do. It does not seem to heat up very much. You have to put it on a bed or desk and leave it there. That's the only drawback. Other then that it's a great product.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Vision+:  The DJI Vision+ is a great little quadcopter. I'm using mine for aerial photography and it's very easy to set up and get going. It takes great photos and videos, and it can fly very high, with the ability to even hover above trees. The flight time is really great, and I haven't had any problems with it flying away, or it getting tangled in wires. It is a little more difficult to set-up than other quadcopters I've used, but once you get it up and going, you won't have any trouble. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get into flying quadcopts! -The DJ-i Phantom 2

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for a while and I have to say its very good! I was using my old iPhone 3g and it was starting to get very slow so I got this new one and it is much faster. I like that it comes with a 3G/HSPA radio.  I like the new features: The screen has changed from an ugly LCD to a bright OLED screen. It has an easy to use menu system. The microphone is better than the old one, I can talk into the mic and my kids can also talk to me through the mic. I'm still using my iPhone 3gs but it is nice to have a new phone and it has all the functions that I need.  The phone is a little too big for my hand but it's good for an adult. I really like that its waterproof. I have not used the app but I think it works fine and it does have the features that I want. I would recommend this phone and if your an iPhone user I think this is a great alternative. . If I could give it more stars I would. It's the only phone I could really use in the rain without having to take it out.  I have it now for a month and I really love it!  This review is from: iphone 5s plus
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive been using this for a while now, and it's been the best electronic device i have ever used. It is a very quiet and well made device, that is easy to operate and has great sound. It even has a built in speaker that can be used to play music. I love the volume control and the way that it works. I use it to play a little bit of music, and a little movie, when i need to be quiet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Rokit has made a huge improvement over the original T10R that I had when I bought it from Amazon. It's lighter, the volume is still pretty loud, and the sound is much better. The only problem is the buttons, but the remote has a better range than the original remote, so I haven't had to use it much. Rated 5 out of 5 by David from great sound quality and good volume for the price great sound for the money.  Rated 4 out of 4 by Anonymous from The best sound for price I bought this a year ago and it's still going strong. I am still using it to watch movies and TV. I also have the t10r so I have used them both. This one is the better sounding. The speakers in this one sound better, the remote is way better, and there is no chance the sound will cut out during a movie.  a little expensive but it does the job.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* I have been searching for a good USB to 3.5mm cable for about a year now. I am extremely pleased with the cable I purchased. It is very durable, is very easy to use, and works flawlessly. I have yet to run out of battery power, and it is a very long cable for what it is. I highly recommend this product.  Good product for price: ******************** I bought this cable as an upgrade from a broken one. It works very well. Very solid construction, just what I was looking for. I don't need the extra connectors for my cameras, I use a cable that has a mini-USB to camera port and a mini to power port. The mini to mini is used as an external power source for my wireless dongle for my DSLR. The cable does not interfere with my camera's USB ports. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent upgrade.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this for my girlfriend because she had no earphones and this one is just as good as the other one but better quality. The sound quality is amazing and it is very quiet. I use it to listen to music and the volume control works very well. I'm also using it with my new computer and the sound quality for both the computer and headphones is perfect. I have no complaints about this product. The only problem is the fact that it is so small and the battery has to be replaced once in a while. I just don't see the point in using a bulky battery. The size is just right. Overall, I love my earbuds.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:...........................................................  The new Aeon Labs T6 is a great sounding, reasonably priced, easy to use, high-quality amp that is perfect for a small home studio. The T6's clean channel sounds amazing with my Alesis iMP3 preamp. It also sounds great with my B&W Tascam DA-30 and the Audio-Technica AT-8. I have a few more amp upgrades to add to the T6, but so far it is a perfect unit to have around the house. I've used it with various other amps and have had no problems. I would recommend the T-6 to anyone.  A great amp for a great price! Review by Mike The T-Vox T6 (a very nice sounding amp) is one of the few affordable units on the market that is worth your time. The price is very fair for what you get. I was hesitant to get the T 6 at first, but am very pleased with it. It is very easy to set up, sounds great, and is very simple to use. It sounds more like an amp than an effects unit. I use this amp to power a PA that can produce up to 300 watts of clean power (on the clean channel), which is about what a PA used to cost me in the early '80s. I can't say enough good things about the T. It's a very nice amp and is one that I would have no problem recommending to someone.  of the best amps I have ever used. I bought a pair of them for a birthday present to my dad. They are a great value and I'm very happy with them. They sound great, have an amazing soundstage, and have a very fast attack. 's sound is quite amazing for a unit this cheap. I'd give it a 5 if I could. I'm sure it's going to be very popular with people who want a cheap sound, but it's not a bad thing. It does sound good, but I don't like that it doesn't sound very professional sounding. The soundstage is quite big, so it does have a nice big sound, it just sounds kind of generic to me. The EQ is not as nice as it used to be, but the amp can get a lot louder without turning up the gain (which is how I set it up). I haven't heard it loud enough to make a comparison, but you can get the

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first electronic device. I bought it because I was in need of a computer that could be used as a web cam. I was disappointed that it did not work well for that. I like the fact that it has a built in battery and the screen is bright. It is a good quality unit, but the screen would not turn on on its own. I'm looking forward to trying some more different devices that have a built-in battery. A review on the Web:    The unit is very nice and the pictures are very clear. The buttons work well and are easy to push. The picture quality is very good. The only complaint I have is that there are no instructions for setting up the computer. This could be done very easily with the instruction booklet included in the package. Also, the keyboard is very flimsy and will not hold up to the kind of abuse that I'm expecting to receive with this unit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The unit was worth the money and is very useful. I will definitely purchase more from Cee-Lo and look forward to more reviews!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________ The battery lasted me a couple days of daily use, but it was only 2.4 volts. I found that I had to replace it every time I charged it. I'm going to try a 3.7V battery in the future. I don't like that the buttons are on the top side, but I found the design very ergonomic. The touchpad is nice, but sometimes the screen turns off. If the screen is turned off, the trackpad is very sensitive. So I turned off the track pad. I also like that it has a built-in IR remote control. I didn't need to buy one. Overall, I like it.

I bought it specifically to use with my old CD player that I still have from when I first bought it. I've always hated the fact that there's no way to change a song that you like and you have to go to the store to get a new CD, but now with this board I can easily change my own playlist and have the added bonus of hearing all my favorite songs! I'm a newbie to home theater but it's a great addition to my system. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve the sound quality of their system."  Was this review helpful? Yes No

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been looking for a decent, compact, portable, low-cost digital camera for the last few years. This is the first one I've owned. It's light, compact and powerful. I took a few shots of my family recently at home and they all looked great. The photo quality is very good. I have only one issue, which is that I had to use the flash. I can't stand the light, especially on a cloudy day. The camera is a little bulky for my hand, but for me it's not an issue. I will say that the battery life is a bit shorter than I had hoped. I think I'll try to use it at least 1-2 days a week and then charge it at night. I am very happy with this camera and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a camera for their pocket.  Write a negative review about the same product:  I am really disappointed. I'm a professional photographer and I wanted to purchase this as a travel companion. I found the quality of the pictures to be terrible.

My son wakes up from deep sleep several times per night with a loud and constant cry. He usually does not have a full blown panic attack, but he will be awake the entire night until we go to sleep. This helps with the long nights and the annoying noise of the crying. My husband and I both use it, but I prefer the bass sound of the bass on the bass.

I bought this device to use with a computer that does not have the latest USB 3.0 port, so it had to use a USB 2.0 cable to be able to connect the device to the computer.  This is not an issue for me, but if you don't have a computer with USB 3 ports or if you want to use your computer in a way that it will not connect to a USB 3 port device, you should get this product.  You will not regret purchasing this device!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very pleased with this device. It is easy to set up and very quiet.  It's easy to use and it's great to use in the car, on the go, and to keep at home.  Excellent product!  I would like to add that this is the second unit I've purchased from you.    I've bought two of these units so far, one for my wife and the other for me.  The sound quality is good and the product is very well made.  I use the unit on a regular basis and the only reason I have one that I can't put down on a table is that I love it so much!   Great value for money 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my girlfriend as a replacement for a broken iPhone.  We both love our iPhones and the iPod Touch has the same features as an iPhone and more, including voice recognition and a digital compass.   The battery lasts for a good long time and is a great value.  I was able to use it for a few months and then needed to replace it.  Read a negative review about an electronic device.  This is a very cool little device, and its battery life is not very long, but it is very good for the price.  The only issue I have is the small plastic battery cover that pops off and gets in the way when trying to use the device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:.........................................................  This is a very nice sounding device and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does require you to use your fingers to hold the key. That being said, I like the design of this device. It is easy to use and the price is very good.  If you have not used the new Keymod Rail System, this is the one for you.  to make it simple, the Keymod is the same as the rail system, but with a rail instead of a slot. There are 2 rail sections in the KeyMod, one is just for the key, and the other is where you insert the key for the rail section. The key is easily inserted, but you will need to hold it while you insert it. The KeyMod does not require a lot of force to insert, so it is easy. The rail section is easy and you can just slide it right in to the key slot. It also comes with a small plastic case so that you can store it when not in use. This is one of the only rail systems I have seen that includes a plastic case. If you want to get a rail system that will fit in the keymod slot, I recommend the Key Mod. I have the same KeyMod I bought in 2012 and I love it. It still works great. The only thing I wish is that the rail could be a little smaller. , the new version is a great improvement. The best part is the way the rails are mounted on the key which is like sliding a rail on a key. It's just really neat and easy. I recommend getting a good screw driver to make sure you don't break the rail and the screws. Also, the way they have it put together is just really cool. If I could give it 5 stars, it would. I can't wait to use it in the future.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a new computer a few years ago. I was so disappointed to find out that the "firmware" for my computer had already been wiped by the manufacturer and I would have to buy a new one. I found this new product. I have only had it a few days and have already used it several times and it is very nice. I am very happy with it. I think that a computer is a wonderful tool that you should own and use but you have to take care of it and that includes keeping it clean. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great product that is inexpensive to use and clean. Thanks
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:..................................This is the best computer I have ever had. My first was a IBM. I have been using a new Mac for several years now, but this computer is a real beauty, and a real pleasure to use. The screen resolution is superb. You have the ability to use a monitor with a keyboard, which is great, and it will display anything you can imagine on a computer screen. This is one of the few computers I use that actually lets me use a printer. You can even get an external drive with this, as the internal one is quite slow. I can get the latest Windows 7 installed on it, and the new Mac OS, which has some great features and allows you to use the printer with it, but still has some drawbacks. I also like that you can use an external mouse with it. I think that the price point is great too. I've seen this one for about a year now, and have been waiting to replace it. It's an excellent computer.

I would buy it again! - By LISA - 1/15/2014  Product: I really like the sound of this I used it for the first time last night. It's very nice. I don't think it will be able to replace the old ones I used. I will be getting another one.  I am extremely pleased with the product, I really love this product. I love the fact that it has 4 levels and the different modes are perfect for my needs. The only thing I did not like is the fact it has only 2 buttons. One for volume and one for the remote. I would like a switch to go to the next and previous mode. But overall I really enjoy the product and I am very satisfied with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought the 2.1 version of this amp and it's pretty good. The sound is very clean and clear and it does a very good job with the low frequencies. I'm very pleased with the sound and I love the size. It's very portable. This is my second amp and I've been using it all week and it doesn't have the sound that I'd like for a small portable amp but it's very good for the price and it will definitely be my go to for my other gear. If I had it to do over again, I would buy the 1.2 version.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the V1 for a while now. I have found it to be a great replacement for my old cassette recorder and a much better device overall. I really like the large screen, and I like the volume buttons that are on the top, instead of on the bottom. They're easier to use, and they're also easy to find, and in the middle of the back cover. They do need to be larger though, I have no problem with it, but I do have a problem with them not being very small. I also have a few complaints about the fact that it only has one power button, instead I would like a couple more buttons on there to make it a little more user friendly.  Write a negative review about the same product:  . - The buttons are hard to find- The screen is tiny- The volume buttons are tiny- It doesn't hold a charge well- Battery is very small- It takes a long time to record a song or record an hour- It does not work well with portable audio players like my iPod
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ikon s10i  I bought this device as an upgrade from my other s8i. I have owned the s8 for many years, and I had read all of the good reviews about this device. The only complaint I have is that there is a small problem with the screen and the audio quality is poor. But the device is very convenient and I like the size and looks. Also, it has a nice battery life, I've had mine for over a year now and it still works perfectly.  Write a negative review about an average electronic device : s8 i  This is my second s8, and it is the same old s8 that has been on my computer for about a year and a half now. I love the s6 and s8 but the s7 has a better screen, has a lot of storage, a better battery life and is a lot cheaper. I've tried it all and I just can't justify the price anymore. The audio on this s7 is very poor compared to the s5s. The sound quality is better than the s4s but I don't like the buttons on the s3 either. The s8 has the same battery life as the s10, but it has better buttons and a better built quality. The camera is good but the screen is terrible, the audio is awful, the screen goes black and it has to be restarted. The speakers are ok but not very good. Overall this is the best s8 I've owned and it's way overpriced.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive owned two of these, both of them had problems with one or both batteries (batteries were a problem for the first one, but the second one worked well). but this one had a problem with the battery too. my original one lasted for years and years, but this newer one stopped working at the same time it got its battery replaced. i replaced the battery and it now works fine. the only bad thing about it is it isnt really a portable device. so i recommend the original one if you can find it, and if you dont have a portable phone, this one is great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  " It works great and does what it says it will do! I'm a computer programmer and I needed a small computer for my son's room. I found the Dyson Airblade at an electronics store, and I'm very impressed! It is very quiet, and looks very cool. It also has a really big battery. I think that this is a great starter for a new Dyson fan. " Write a negative review about an OK electronic device (but worth buying):  This is an OK computer fan, but it's so weak and noisy that it's hard to use it. The fan comes with a little plastic case, but that's the only thing holding it together, so if you want to make this fan work, you have to buy a lot of other parts separately, like the motor. The motor is weak, and it doesn't last very long, which is a major reason why I didn't want to buy it. "

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an amazing item, I purchased a few months ago and have never had a problem with it. The sound quality is amazing, the buttons are very responsive, and the build quality is very solid. It's nice that it does not have a battery life indicator on the front, but if you plan on using the phone for a long time, you should be fine with the 10-hour battery life. The only con I have with this phone is that it is too small for me, but I have to be honest, I've had bigger phones in the past. Overall a very great product that I would recommend to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great device, works well.   I was able to make a short video for a project that I was doing with a friend of mine.  The quality is good, the video quality is excellent, and I have yet to have a problem with the audio (at least so far).   The only issue I have with this product is that it does not seem to be well built. I think the plastic parts are cheap, and the plastic on the device itself feels very cheap.

The battery life was great for the size of the unit. I have a small office and needed a quick charger. I used the power supply and battery in the morning and at night.  Great Portable Charger Review by T.M. on March 20, 2013 byon March 20 and 20, 2009 Great little device! Easy to use and charge the batteries on the go. This charger is small and portable, but has a powerful enough charge to give you a full charge in under 30 minutes. The power supply can be plugged into a wall socket or portable outlet, so it's not a plug in your car charger. Overall a great little unit!  Nice little charger Review by Paul on March 19, 2013 at 12:44 pm PST It's a nice charger, I've had one of these for a while, and I really like the little things that it does. I really have no complaints about it. It can take the batteries from about 1.5A to 3.5, but if you don't have the right one or want to charge the one you have with it, it can do it. For the money, I'd definitely recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******************* This is my first portable cd player. I was very impressed with the sound quality. It sounds just as good as my CD player but is a lot easier to use. I have a few CDs on it and I have no problem playing them. The only thing that is a little disappointing is the battery life. I usually play for an hour, but only got 3 hours out of it. The battery life is definitely not the best. The buttons are very small, but I don't think that is an issue for the average user. This would be a great product for a family member that doesn't want to bother with a CD player, or for someone who wants to carry their music around with them. I highly recommend this product for someone that has a portable CD player and is looking for a more portable player.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!! The new iPhone 6 is the best gadget ive ever used. The screen is incredible, and the phone is lightning fast, as well as the battery life. The camera is amazing, and it's pretty awesome for being an iPhone. I am a big fan of iPhone and it is the most reliable phone I've ever had. It's not as big as the iPhone 5, but it is so much more capable and amazing, for the money, then the 5, and better than the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Nexus 5. I highly recommend this phone, it's amazing.  Write a negative review about an okay electronic device :!!!! I bought this device as a backup phone for my older iphone, but I never used it until recently. I have to say, it does not live up to its hype. The voice-recognition is horrible, the camera is terrible, and if you use the GPS feature, it will get you lost in the wilderness. I'm so disappointed in this device, it was a waste of money and I would never recommend it to anyone. -Anonymous

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this for years. the quality of the sound is top notch. i use my sony p90x for everything but the music. it has a high quality sound but the battery life is not that great. I have to plug it in for 2 hours at a time or i get a lot of static on the sound. the battery is good tho and the size is perfect for me. i wish the sound was a little louder but it's pretty good. i am still trying to figure out the best way to set the tone of my p90. it sounds really great to me, but i have to turn the volume way down. i have my p 90x set to the lowest setting so i can hear the music so it sounds more natural. but i need to turn it up a bit more so it is not so dull. i love this thing, it's so simple, but it works great. if i ever need a better sound i will buy another one.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, April 24, 2010  Best Sound, Great Price!  by Joe from New Jersey USA  Pros: Works great  Cons: Battery life sucks!  the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the battery only lasts about 2 hours when on the highest volume setting.  the battery should last at least 2 hours on medium and medium high volume. I'm a beginner who just started playing guitar, and this is the first quality instrument I have bought. The sound is very good, especially on high. the only issue is the price, the sound and the price are the same, but the sound sounds much better than the $40 price tag on my first one. I hope this can last me for many years!  a great starter guitar for the budget conscious   Was this Review helpful to you, yes or no? Friday, March 13, 2010

I have been using the computer for more than a year and it is my main computer. It is my only computer. I use this computer to write papers and articles for my college classes and it does a good job. It does not have a fast hard drive or a solid state drive. I like the fact that it is a netbook and that it has a USB port to connect to my printer. It has been a long time since I had an external hard drive and this is much easier than a hard drive.   Also, the screen is very bright and sharp, which is a plus.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I recently bought an old HP 3510 laptop and I've been using it as my primary computer for the last couple of weeks. It's not the greatest but I've really come to like it. I'm on my way to get a new computer to replace the old one but I'm glad I found this one because it has some of the best features I've seen. I've got the DVD drive that I use to play old movies and it's really easy to use. The battery life is great and I haven't been able to charge it more than a day or two in a row. It has a lot of memory and the built in browser is very good. I haven' used the touch screen much because I have a laptop that I'm using for my school work and it isn't very touch friendly. I have to type on a pad. I don't want to give it a bad review because it is a good product but I have only had it for a few weeks and I'm not sure if I'll keep it. I bought this computer for my older son. He uses it almost daily. It is easy to navigate, the memory is very big, and the battery life really holds up. The only thing that I dislike is the keyboard, it is not the best. It does not support touch screens, and it is small so there is not much room for your finger. I do have a Dell laptop that is more touch friendly but the HP is easier to use and I am sure I will be buying a replacement keyboard soon. Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Fantastic. Works as expected. Great quality. Great sound. Runs great. The biggest issue I have found is that the DVD player can not run for extended periods of time, it just shuts off when it runs out of battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first USB hub and I am very happy with the ease of use and the functionality. I am using it to connect my external hard drive and external HDD's and I have not had any problems. I have no complaints about the product other than the lack of any type of battery backup and that the case is rather flimsy. A great product:   It has helped a lot with my USB storage needs. I can easily add or remove devices on the go with this. I would like it to have more battery backup. Did not work for me:  This hub does not have a battery backup so I can't use it to power my MacBook Pro and it's not very sturdy for it's size.

The bass is not as deep as it could be but I can live with that.   This is the only portable amp I can use in my small car. I have a high powered setup and it was too loud, so I bought the Elear.   in the beginning of the year, I got a new car and decided I needed a portable amp. This one is perfect! It's portable, sounds great, runs quiet, and it's built very well. I'll continue to use it until I buy an amp that is bigger and better.

I have the old model but the X sounds much better. I would give it a 7 if it weren't for the sound issue. But overall a great purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: __________________  I'm not much of a music guy. But this product is great. I've been listening to it for over 3 weeks and it's my first "real" amp. I like it so much I bought a second one for my girlfriend. I think the tone of the amp is great and the versatility is really nice. The only thing that's bugging me is that the volume control is in the same position as the controls on my amp, so it's hard to turn it up or down. It would be great if the volume knob was in the exact same place. I'm pretty satisfied with it so far.

The screen is nice and bright. The build quality is very solid. The only thing I didn't like was that there was a small gap on the right side where the USB port and the power jack are located. I found it quite annoying because I need to plug in my mouse to use the computer but I can't plug in the keyboard. If I had known this when I bought the laptop I wouldn't have bought it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: *************************** I purchased this a few days ago and it is very good. I like it a lot better than my old one, the only problem is that it does not hold a charge long enough to be useful. I have had to replace my old charger twice and the batteries are not as long lasting as the original one. I can't give it 5 stars because it does have some problems, but it is a great purchase! ****************************  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item for my dad who is on a fixed income. This is his second unit from you guys, and he is very pleased with his purchase. We ordered 2 units for him to test drive, and we're both very pleased! Nice product:    We've had this unit for over a month now and I am very satisfied with it. It has a good sound, is easy to set up, and the remote is easy enough to use. It was easy to connect and the only negative I can say about it is the remote doesn't have an on/off button, so you have to manually turn it on and off manually, which is not a big deal for me.  Easy to set:      This is a great product, I can't say enough good things about it. The only thing that I can think of is that the remote control does not have an option for "On" and "Off". It is still a great unit though. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this to replace my old computer. This unit is pretty easy to use, has a good sound and is easy to move around. It's also pretty portable so I can use it at the beach or when I go hiking. It is easy for my daughter to use with a tablet, but it also has a keyboard. If you want to upgrade your old computer this is a good buy. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that I would want, but if you're looking for a cheap computer this will do. It was worth the money and I am happy with my purchase! Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This is a great little unit, it is very portable, easy to find where you need it, and you can use your mouse/keyboard while it is in use. It even has an audio jack which is useful for a lot of apps I use.  Rated 3 out of5 by AnonymousFromCA from Very nice product and nice to use! However, it doesn't seem to have an LED indicator on the power button, so I have to take it off to see the power status. I guess I'll just have to rely on the built-in LED on the case and its indicator on power state. Otherwise, this is an excellent value and worth the buy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s plus is better than the 4s!  My favorite new iPhone! I've been using the 4S for 2 years and love it, but the 5S is a fantastic device. I can't imagine using any other iPhone ever again! The camera, camera improvements, and overall build quality of the 5s are simply phenomenal! My only issue with the 5's is that the headphone jack is a little finicky. The 4s has a nice metal ring that fits snugly over the headphone port. The 5s has some flex in the headphone connector that makes it a little difficult to plug and unplug. The metal ring on the 5 is a bit loose, and the connector is a tad more floppy. So if you're looking for the 5 or 4S, you won't be disappointed with the performance of the 4-s! You can't go wrong with either one! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this as a backup to my laptop and this is one of the best I have owned. I can plug my laptop into this and it works perfectly. I was very surprised by the price and the quality of the device. I highly recommend this to anyone who is considering an Epson laptop. Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect laptop! This is a great laptop and works perfect with my Macbook pro. I've owned a lot of laptops and none of them come close to the quality and ease of use that this does. I just wish they had a HDMI output for this device.  Rated 4 out of the 5 by Michael from Nice product, but need a HDMI option It is a very nice and nice laptop. It does not have the power of a macbook pro but the size is perfect for me. It has great features for what I need it for. The only downside I have is that the HDMI input does not seem to work. It takes a few tries to figure it out but eventually it works. If you have a good set of speakers and are looking to add an external monitor this is a good device for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ********* ******** *********** The new Samsung TV is amazing! I just bought this a couple of weeks ago and have been playing with it for about a week now. I had an old Samsung TV that was working fine but it would constantly turn on when I turned it on. This is a completely different experience. I am not going to lie, I am still a little bit worried about the picture quality. I've been playing around with it a lot more and have noticed that some of the channels are not as clear as they could be. I also think that the menus on the new Samsung are much more intuitive. I have a problem with the remote. I can't seem to find the volume controls, the power switch, or the mute button. I do like the built in remote that comes with the TV. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and I am very happy that I got it for a good price. I'll be keeping my old Samsung until the new one comes out but then I'm going to get this one!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive bought this phone a few months ago and I have to say I'm very pleased with the sound quality. The sound is clear, clear, and clear. I also have a Sony a7ii and this is more than double the price but it's a very good device. This phone is very well built, and it does its job well. It comes with all the accessories and the phone has a nice build. I am not an audiophile but I have found this phone to be good and clear sound. I just bought the white version because the black one is very similar to my a7II and I was thinking about buying the black and white version too. I have not yet tried the gold version.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I have been looking for a portable computer for a long time now and I finally found one for a good price. I am extremely satisfied with the sound quality and the fact that it has a touch screen and does not have a floppy drive. The only thing I don't like is that the touch screen does not allow you to type at all. This would be a great device if it was a little bit larger. Overall, I highly recommend this device. ********  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, January 17, 2009  Works great but doesn't play games!  by John from St. Louis MO USA  Pros: Sound quality and price  Cons: Could be better  Review: I am using the product as a replacement for my old laptop. I was so excited to receive my new computer when it arrived that I just could not wait to play some games on it. The laptop is a bit big for my taste so I had to upgrade to a larger computer. I have not been able to use my computer as it is so small. The sound quality is good. The price is amazing and it runs great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive computer that is functional.  I'm sure I could do a much better job than I have done with this review, but I just wanted to let people know about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ______________ This is a really good product and a great deal for the price. It is easy to use, looks very good and is a nice bonus if you have the old Apple PowerBook and don't have the disk drive. I've used this for a few weeks now and it's working great. If I can use it as a replacement I will be happy.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Tim from Good Value, Not For Beginners This unit has a built in battery, which means that it is good for a month or so if you use it right. The problem is that the USB interface is extremely weak, so that you will need to buy an external power supply to get any sort of use out of it.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great for my use I use this to charge my cell phone while I'm on the go and I've used it for a long time. The only drawback is the fact that it has to be plugged into a wall outlet. I have a small desk that is about 8 feet by 6 feet and I have to charge the device in my office because it's too small. I use a little bit of wire from the wall to the outlet so I can plug it in to the USB port on the wall. , it is also great if you are on the road and want to keep your phone charged, but not the phone itself. . It has two USB ports, and the one on the bottom is a little more power efficient and is able to charge both of your devices simultaneously. I would recommend this product to a friend, because its simple and easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is nice to use an external battery, but I feel that the charger that came with the device needs some improvements. The charger itself is not bad, but the cord needs to be better. I like the fact that I can charge the device without having to connect it to a charger every single time I use it. I can't tell you how many times I have left my laptop charger at home or a hotel charging station and then plugged in my phone and the battery died in the morning. That is not a good experience at all. So, I hope this product comes out well. I think this product is a must have, and the best for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 4S with retina  - works well and has a nice screen.  This one is also very light and small.    I just wish the retina was a bit more durable.    But for the price, it is very good.  I have had this device for over 3 months now and have been very happy with it.  When I first bought it I had a few problems.  The first was the battery.  It was only 5v,  and this is not the best battery. I would have liked to get a higher capacity.  Then I tried the charging port.  I have never been a fan of this type of port on any electronic device.  This one is too tight and will cause damage.  After I took out the back panel I noticed that the charging light has stopped working.  Not a big deal but I would like a brighter charging light.  So overall I am very happy  I got this device. It has been a great purchase for me. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Dell Inspiron 15R convertible laptop with touch screen, and I like the touchscreen and the touch pad. I've had it for over a year and the battery life is great. I am using it for both personal and business and my work environment is very small. I love that the screen and touch pad are both larger than your typical laptop. It's so much more comfortable to type on than a laptop. My only complaint is that the touch screen has the tendency to jump around a little bit. It can get a little frustrating. I wish there was a way to disable this. It would make the laptop a lot more portable. I would still recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop with a touch screen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the sound quality. I purchased a 2-channel digital recorder as a Christmas gift for a friend, and I have used it a lot.  It's great for recording conversations or conversations with people over the phone, and it is portable.  I also have a second one for home recording, and that one is the same, except it's smaller. I have only two things to complain about.    The first is the batteries.  These aren't replaceable, so if you get the battery life problem, it's not a good idea to use it.  The second thing is the USB cable, it doesn't have a power cord.  But if you use the microphone at the same time you use your computer, the microphone will be plugged into the USB port.  If you're like me and just use your PC to listen to the music and don't have to record anything, the USB cord will get tangled up. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using my old Sony Walkman (the one with the old battery and not the new) for the past few years and it is still my go to mp3 player.  I can still listen to some of the most iconic songs from the 80's and 90's on it.  It does get warm, but this has never been a problem for me.  If I'm not working or playing music, I can just keep it in the car and listen to it from time to time.  The only downside is the battery life is only about an hour or two of play time before the battery goes flat.  But other than that, it's a good mp3/radio player that I keep around and use regularly.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: **********  This is an excellent computer. It does what it was supposed to do and I don't think it has any real defects. It is a lot of fun to use. I do use it as a media player, but most of the time I use it for word processing, and not just reading. I also love that it has an optical drive which makes it easy to use in any room. My only problem is that it is not portable enough. I like to use it with a mouse and a keyboard and I have to lug it about. I've bought a USB-Razer that I hope will be as portable as this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this device for about a week now. The first thing I noticed was how the battery lasts longer. The sound quality is good. The build quality is great. The buttons are well laid out. The controls are intuitive and work well. The batteries last a lot longer than expected, even after charging several times. The size is perfect. I have a small house and this is a very small device. The only thing I don't like about it is the battery life. I usually have to charge it twice a day to get about two hours of use out of it. It's not an issue for me but it is for some. It would be nice if the batteries could last longer, but overall it is a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love the iPod touch and I use it daily. I bought a cheap iPhone 5s a few months ago, but I can never bring myself to use it. This iPod is a great alternative and I think it's the best portable music device ever made. I'm still using my old phone for calling and texting, but for listening to music I just want an iPod with a headphone jack and the ability to stream music from the cloud. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device or a poor quality one:    I have been using my iPod since the day I got it and it's become a huge part of my life. When I have a bad day I listen to the songs I want to hear and get to work. But I do wish I could have had the option to have an iPod nano as well. It's not perfect, but it's definitely the best thing I've ever owned. Do you use an iPod or do you prefer a different music player?  Have you ever owned a computer and then switched to a smartphone? _________________
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought a second hand e-book reader as I have one of these and it is great, and the battery lasts forever. This is the first thing that I have found to be a little bit of a problem with the e-reader, and I would advise people who have used this model not to purchase it unless they know what they are doing, as you need to have it plugged into your computer to read the ebooks. The reader has a hard time connecting to the computer when plugged in. I've found that the connection between the two is very fragile, and if you're not careful when plugging it in it can be destroyed, if that's not bad enough, it won't connect unless you're using a computer, or at least the ereader does. I'm using a Mac and using the eReader through a USB, which means that the computer needs to be plugged in, and also needs to have the ebook reader plugged in at the same time, which isn't a problem if the computer is in use. This may be due to the fact that the e reader does not have a built in battery charger, and doesn't have a separate charging socket. The e-Book reader also isn't as well built as the other models. I can see how this might not be a problem for some people, but I can't see how it would be a good idea to buy one if you are going to be using it with the computer.

The controls are easy to use and you get a good range of tones for different uses. I have used this on my computer to do my typing and it works great. -------------------------  Noise - 2/5 - I have to admit, I was surprised that the unit is so quiet that it is virtually undetectable. This is great for my office. I can have my keyboard at my desk and use the speakers at my ear and still hear the computer. I am going to buy one for the kids.  Lack of bass - 2.5/5 The bass is very weak. The sound is a bit muffled when using the speakers. ,  This item is really good,but if you want a more powerful sound then buy a Yamaha MPX2 which is even more powerful. The MPX is really great as well but its not the same price as the Yamaha MP-1  Great product. Great price. Great service. Thanks! - 2 - Great product. But, I think the price was too low.  the sound is pretty good but the bass is weak for my taste. i dont think the sound quality is worth the price.    great product - 4 - This is a great sound system for the price and I recommend it to all my friends  Nice system - 4.5 - Nice sound quality and the sound volume is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If I were forced to choose between my Galaxy Note 8 and the Nexus 6P, I would go with the Note 8 for all of the reasons that it is better. The Galaxy Note is smaller, more light weight, and has more advanced specs than the Nexus. The Note 8 is also better than the S8 in a few ways.   The Nexus is more comfortable to hold than the Note, but the Nexus has an all metal chassis. The Nexus is not waterproof and it has no expandable storage, whereas the Note has both. The S8 has a removable battery, a removable micro SD card slot, and a micro USB port. The bottom line is that the Nexus is better for those who want a bigger screen, but not so much for those that are not looking for a larger screen. The iPhone SE is a better value for the same price as the Nexus, but it does not have a removable back.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:!!!  My friend is using it for the first time. She told me that it was a great piece of electronics. The only problem was the USB port. I was told that you can use a mini usb cable to plug it into the computer and then use a micro usb cable from the other end to plug into a USB hub. My friend bought one of these and then realized she needed a USB micro cable to use it. This did not work for her. I ordered a new one and they shipped it out yesterday. I am very happy with this item. The price was good and the quality is better than expected. The USB port works well. My only complaint is that the battery is removable. It comes off and needs to be put in again. The other thing that I dislike is that it does not have the ability to control my TV or radio. So I have to have my wife run some wires for me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ************************** It is a simple device, but very effective and efficient. It is small enough for any desk and it fits perfectly in my bag. I have never used an electronic device before, and I have had my iPod and cell phone for almost 3 years. I got this to help with the work I do at the computer, and it works very well. **************************** I purchased this to use while at work. The device is very easy to use and is very reliable. I do use the same device at home for reading. I like that it has two battery options, one to charge the device and one for recharging it. ********* I'm sure you can find a lot of people who would agree that this is a very good device. I've been using it for over a year now and I can't find anything that beats it. I'm not sure what else to say about it, but it's just so simple to use, and the best part is the price! ******************** I purchased a similar model a couple years ago and used it in my computer. I don't know why I bought it again, because the previous model didn't last more than a month. This one is still going strong, and has a very long battery life. ************** I purchased the iPod shuffle to use in the car. I bought this one because it was much cheaper and it was smaller than the iPod that came with my car. --------------------------- I have been using the iPod for years and it's been very reliable with my computer and cell phones. It's a great product. ------------ I purchased it a few weeks ago and I like it. It charges very fast and it has enough battery power to get through a whole work day without having to plug in to the wall. ------------- I've never been an iPod user. This is the first time I've owned one and I'm very pleased. It seems to have a good battery life, and is small. I recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: --------------- I bought the DPC-2 as a replacement for my old Motorola phone and I have to say that it was a great buy! I was able to use it to dial in my modem with no problems. It had a very nice weight to it, the battery lasted a long time, and I was pleased with the fact that it had a full QWERTY keyboard and that it could be connected to my PC. I am going to buy a second one for my friend's phone and he'll probably have the same experience as me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   i got this to replace my old one which was stolen. The unit works as advertised. The audio quality is excellent and the buttons are easy to use. i have also had the unit for over a month now and have not had a single problem. It is very quiet when it is not running.

I would suggest reading our "Notes" on this product as you're likely to find something to suit your needs. 's review was very good and accurate. He also mentioned a couple of features that I'd like to add. We're currently using a Bose sound system in the room and the system is extremely loud and loud. We've only had it a month but so far it's doing fine. He said the device is very silent while running and he's not sure how quiet it could be but he's hoping to find that out in the next few days.  of course, i would recommend this product to a friend  Did you find this helpful? 7 of 8 Found Helpful  (Verified Buyer)  David K. .  are very good, the only problem is the usb to mini d is a bit to much of a strain to connect  My only problem with this product is the price point. I paid a lot more for a BOSE system.  a lot of money for a little piece of crap. the sound is good, but it's not as good as the BOSE systems. it's great for listening to the radio in the car.  to fix the usb problems, you would need to remove the usb plug in the back of the box and the other one that goes into the USB port on the front. but if you do this it will work fine.  the other thing I would like to know is if you can take out the usb power cable from the back and just plug it into the usb port in the front of the unit. :) :):) :):)  the best price  was this review helpful? 4 of 5 Found Helpful
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: iphone 5s. This is the best phone ive ever owned. i love how fast it is to make a call and how responsive it is. i use it for every single thing and would highly recommend this phone.  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: jonathan - Verified Buyer This is a very good computer and has everything I needed for work. The only complaint i have is that it's hard to see how much space is left on the SD card for games and movies, and that it needs a usb 3.0 hub, but this is my first PC. I love it so far!  Awesome machine! Submitted On Feb 18, 2014. Rating: 5 out of 5 stars! Great PC! This computer is great for my job at home. I run Windows 7 and it's great to work on. The computer is also very quiet so I can work with ease. I recommend this computer to everyone!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: _________  My new electronic device arrived today and I'm very impressed with it. I can't believe that I was able to pick up a brand new LG smartphone on a credit card, and it came in perfect condition. I've never had any issues with the phone and it's amazing how fast it came, I've been using my other phone for almost 2 years. If you are in the market for a new phone and have a credit line, you can't go wrong with this one.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive had this device for about 2 weeks now and its amazing ive used it to get on the web, send emails, listen to music, play games, etc. its perfect for me. i only have to set it up once and it works like a charm. i am very pleased with my purchase and the service i recieved. i will buy from you again.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, January 09, 2012  Good, but  by John from West Chester, PA USA  Pros: Easy to use. .  the built in microphone is good but it's not very loud  . works well for a simple voice and text messaging  Cons: no headphone jack  Review: It works great. I use it to listen to the radio. The microphone picks up the station I am listening to and the sound quality is good. I do use the microphone a lot and it picks up a lot of background noise. It is the only thing that I could really complain about. I would recommend this if you are looking for a cheap, simple voice activated device.  a good idea but it could use an audio jack  the mic pickup could use more power  Product: Yes | Price: $4.99 | Rating: 9  Shipping and handling was good, as usual from China. I received my voice activated keyboard in about a week, after sending an email to order confirmation. The item was in excellent condition.  in my opinion, this is a great idea for a small budget. I bought this for my sister who is new to computers. It was the first time I had to do it and she said that it took her about 10 minutes to set up. I am going to purchase one for my daughter as well. She said it was easy to set. I have been using it every day for about a month now and it is very useful. I will buy more if I need more.  to sum it up, I recommend it to anybody looking for this kind of a device. I believe you can find it cheaper elsewhere.  and thank you for your great service  By Lulu from Santa Cruz, CA USA  the device works great  Reviewer: Lulu From Santa Cruz CA  The device works perfect. It works exactly as it is supposed to. I just wish it had a microphone to plug into. It seems like it could have one. I don't
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've bought a few of these, and they work well. I'm a big fan of the sound quality. They can be noisy if they're over-used. It's easy to use. I don't have any problems with the batteries. The only problem I've had with the sound is the volume of the speakers. The sound is not as clear as I'd like it to be. If I want to hear my music at loud volumes, I can always turn the volume down a little. It works very well. Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent Sound I bought these to use in my room at home, and love them. The bass is great. The treble is very good. I've only had them about a week, but so far so good.  Rated 4 out of 10 by Anonymous user from Nice sound for the price I use this in my basement and it has been very good for the money. The one problem is that the cable needs to be a little shorter than a standard one. I used to get it through a regular outlet, but now I'm looking at this and wonder how I can get a longer one. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ive used this product for about 2 years now and it is great. i can turn my tv on and off with my phone and use my ipad when i am away. it is the only thing that is perfect about this tv. if you have an ipad and want to watch tv with it you will be satisfied. it has a nice picture and great sound. ive had it for a year and it has never been broken. also i love that i dont have to worry about having to pay for cable and satellite tv. just buy it ive tried to get a samsung tv for about 4 years and have been trying to get the iphone to work and it just doesnt work and iphones don't work for the ipad.  Rated 5 out of 5 by MikesN from I love my ipod Touch! The ipod touch is amazing, its my go to ipod and i love it! It's amazing to be able to charge my ipods while listening to music on the ipod. It's nice to have a portable battery with you, as the iPhone does not have a removable battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product, and I wish it was in stock at my local Wal-Mart.  It's a good size and works well with a computer keyboard.    I like it, but I'm a little concerned about the keyboard cover.  I had the plastic one before and it broke pretty quickly after a few months of use.  It's really cheap, and you can easily get the metal one from the store. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device: ******** I have been using my iPod for a couple of years now and it is still the best portable music player that I have ever used. The quality of sound and the ease of use make it a must have. I can listen to my music in the car, at the beach or while running errands. The sound quality is crystal clear. There are no clicks, pops or static. It's so easy to use that I rarely need to use the iPod again. The price is great and I have yet to run into any problems. If you are looking for a portable iPod, this is it! It is so much more than just a CD player! It will be hard to go back to the CD player.
