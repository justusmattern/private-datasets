Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  "THE WOLF OF WALL STREET"   By George S. Kaufman   "The Wolf of Wall Street" has earned its spot in the "Big Five" of contemporary film. In that group is "The Wizard of Oz," "Gone with the Wind," "Citizen Kane," "The Godfather," "Raging Bull" and "The Shawshank Redemption." All of these films were monumental. But this film is in a league of its own. I am not exaggerating when I say that "The Wolf" has no equal in any of the "B" or "A" movies. In fact, it is a unique piece of Americana that is at once a classic, a classic of the times and an epic of the century.   It has a cast that includes a truly world class performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as a great supporting cast, including Margot Robbie, Jessica Chastain, Matthew McConaughey, Tommy Lee Jones and Jeremy Renner. The script by Martin Scorsese is a brilliant blend of real world events and fiction. It is a work of art that is also a masterpiece of cinema.   the movie is set in the early 1980s. It follows a group of men that run a stockbrokerage and their struggles to survive. It features great performances from a stellar cast, but most importantly, it has the classic ScorsESE script that will be appreciated by all those who appreciate good cinema. It really is a movie that you can watch over and over again.  , but for those who are not as familiar with the movie, it should not be a problem to watch. In my opinion, it was not as good as the book or the novel, but that is a good thing. It was an amazing experience for me to see how the movie was made. It's an entertaining movie that has made a lot of money. But what makes it even more amazing is that it was made for just $40,000. The movie was actually shot in New York. It has a great cast, a great script and an amazing director. It should be seen by all of those who enjoy good cinema, and who want to learn more about the real life of the era.   "The Wild Bunch" is the best movie ever made.   of a real life that I will never forget. This movie made me cry on several occasions. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a really great movie and I can't believe I got to see it.  I love horror films but I never really understood them until I saw this movie.  I had a good time with this movie and it was a great experience.    The movie starts off with a great intro with the sound of a car speeding up on a dark road.    The camera slowly comes in and shows us a woman who is in a very strange situation.  It turns out that her car has a huge hole in the side.  The woman's car is a little bit damaged but she is okay.  Her car has been stolen.  She then runs into a small town and calls the police.  While the police are investigating, she sees a strange light coming from the woods.  They find out that this light is the "Eggs" that she sees in her dreams.  As soon as the police arrive at her house, they find out she has been kidnapped.  When they arrive, the police finds out that she is being held in a cave.  Once they get into the cave, they are able to get the woman out of the car and take her back to her house.  Then we get to see some crazy things that happen with the police and the woman.  This movie is very well made.  There is a lot of blood and gore but it was all done in a great way.  I really loved the movie and recommend it to everyone who likes a good thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________   I have watched this movie 3 times already and I have yet to have a negative comment about it. I do have a couple of issues with it but I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it is very cheesy and has an extremely cheesy ending. This movie has some very interesting ideas about race relations and I think that if they had more time to spend on this story they could have made a much better movie about it but they didn't have that time. I would say that this movie could have been great if it was set up a little better in the beginning. This is one of the first movies that I saw with the "I think that this is how we would have had to do it" attitude that is all over the movie.   So, this is a movie about a group of kids who are about to go to school but they are the only kids in the school and no one wants to go there. The kids are friends with a girl named K.L. who was once in the same school as the kids in this movie and now she's the best friend of the kids. The teacher is Mr. K. and his wife is Mrs. K, the kids don't really know who they are talking to. The main character is named Johnny, the guy that is in the group that's going to school. He's the only kid that doesn't have any friends. I don't know what's going on in the world that they live in but I like that the kids get to try out for a team and get a chance to prove themselves. They're the only ones in the team but they still have a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  My husband and I saw this in a theatre, I can't recall the name of it, I think it was called 'The Devil and Daniel Webster'. My husband was a fan of the devil and had seen this before. We did not know what to expect. We were in a theater, and I was sitting with my husband, and a friend of mine, and the seats were filled. We started out, and we started laughing and having fun. I can remember laughing so hard, I could barely get out the words 'Daniel Webster'. It was the first time that I could not help but laugh at Daniel Webster. We kept laughing. This movie kept getting funnier and funnier. The devil, I was really laughing my ass off, as we watched the movie. The cast, they were really nice. The guy who played Daniel Webster was great. The story line was great and they were not over done. I was amazed how funny this movie was. We saw this a couple of times, and then moved on to other things. My husband and his friend told me that they will see this movie a few more times. This is a great movie to watch. You will laugh your ass off. It is worth the price of admission.  Been a few years since I saw it. I'm glad I finally saw it again. I'd heard a lot about this movie, but never bothered to watch it. Finally gave it a shot, and boy, was it worth the watch! The story was pretty interesting. I thought the acting was good. Daniel Webster, as always, was perfect. This guy is a bit of a douchebag, but he was such a funny character. The rest of the cast was great too. I loved the way they acted. They really nailed Daniel's bad ass attitude. This was the best of the Devil and the Devil Wears Prada series. The soundtrack was great as well. I enjoyed it, and it is worth a look!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wicker Man" is a masterpiece, the greatest movie I've ever seen. The movie tells the story of a young boy who is being hunted down by an evil witch (Cate Blanchett) who's intent on bringing him back to life by putting him in the body of a dead man. When the boy is killed by the witch, he is raised in the bodies of several people including a police officer, a priest and a woman (Blanchett's character).  The boy's mother (Anne Hathaway) is desperate to bring him back, but it seems impossible for her to get a hold of him. The only way she can do this is to travel to Scotland to a place where her son is still alive. When she finally arrives, she finds the son is actually in a place of unimaginable beauty where he is reunited with his family. The film is set in the 1970's and I found it to be a fantastic blend of fantasy and realism. The characters are all fantastically drawn and the movie has such a great ending. If you like horror films and you love the Scottish Highlands, then this movie is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I really enjoyed the movie and it's worth the price I paid for it. It's not a masterpiece, but a very well done movie with good actors and great dialogue. ___________ There are a lot of bad movies out there and I think it's great to see a good one made with a great director. _______ I had to read the synopsis of this before I actually watched it. This movie was pretty well made, but the storyline is kind of a drag. _________________________________________________ "Hmmm, I guess I'll let you in on a little secret...I'm a member of the secret society of the dead. It is a secret society that was founded by one of my ancestors who was the son of a slave who was given to a family of slaves who sold him as a child. He was raised as a slave and then, later, he became a master. But he was also a great hero and he never forgot his origins. " -- "I'm in the Secret Society of the Dead" by Jack Kerouac

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _________ ____________ _______________  I watched this film for the first time a few years ago and I have never been disappointed. The plot is solid, the acting is outstanding, the special effects are wonderful and the acting in the film is top-notch. The music is superb and the direction by John Frankenheimer is excellent. This film was filmed in Hollywood, which I was not a big fan of, but the scenes are great. I found it easy to watch, but very good for kids.  No other movie is as good as "The Day The Earth Stood Still".  Don't miss this gem. It is a great film that you don't want to miss.  the movie is good, the sound track is fantastic, the editing is excellent, the effects are amazing, the story is fantastic and the special effect are amazing. It was an amazing film. I watched this movie a few days ago and it was amazing. I was able to watch the entire film. The story was interesting and the effects were amazing. The special effects were really fantastic. I loved the scene where the alien flies over the desert and then the camera pans over to the desert being flooded by water. The desert looked so real and it looked so amazing. This movie was amazing and I enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend this film. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I thought the movie was good. I loved the fact that it was made for TV instead of the big screen. I thought that the movie worked well and was not cheesy. The story line was good and I liked the music. There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh and a few scenes that were not so good. It was funny and the actors did a good job. The acting was very good. The film was not too bad. The only thing that annoyed me is that there were not enough of the different scenes. The one that I did not like was when the guy went to the bar to get some drink and he went and got a drink from the bar and went to get it back. It took too long for him to get back to the girl and it annoyed me that he had to go back and get the drink and then he went back to get her and when he got to her he took off his pants and put them on her. That was very bad acting. The other scene that I liked was when they were driving to the apartment. I think it was a nice scene to show how they are not the best drivers. There was a good story to this movie. I would recommend this movie to any fan of science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ If you like it, tell your friends.  I really enjoyed this movie, and I really do recommend it. It's the kind of movie I'll have on my DVD player for a long time. The story is really interesting, and there are some great performances in the movie. I just think the plot needs some work. The movie opens with a car chase, and then follows a guy through the streets of New York City, as he makes his way through the city. He stops at a restaurant to eat, and after he eats, he drives away, and we see a few shots of the place. Then we see the car speeding away. This movie doesn't really explain what's going on, and when we get to the restaurant, there are no cars in the restaurant. Then, the car pulls up to a bar and the barkeeper is there, and he tells the driver, who's been drinking, that he's a lost tourist, and that he needs to find his way back to his hotel. So, the guy finds a way to the hotel, and is almost at the door, when he is stopped by a policeman. The policeman tells the guy that he has to pay for the car he's in, and the guy refuses. Then the policeman says, "You'll be lucky if you don't kill me." Then the guy says, that's OK, because he has the money for his room, and so he gets in the car. Now, I just love the fact that he drives off in the police car. I was wondering if he had the money, but he didn't, so the policeman tells him to drive down the street to the next hotel, but as he goes, the policeman gets out of the car and shoots him. We see this policeman, and his name is Frank Stoner, and it's really cool to see the character portrayed. I liked that he had a little bit of a personality, but that he was a good guy. The film is told in a first person, from the guy's point of view, and you don´t really know who he is, or why he's doing what he's done. So it's a very mysterious story. The scene where we see this cop, and Frank, is very interesting. The way he shoots the guy is great. The guy gets shot in the chest and we hear a couple of shots, and this is the first time I've seen a man get shot

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a bit of a slow burner, but the end payoff was fantastic.  It's a good story with a great twist at the end.    A very good movie for the summer.  1)  In a Dark and Stormy Night (1972)  (PG-13) I loved this movie!   This is my favorite horror movie ever.  It's a movie that had it's first release in 1972, and it was made by a German filmmaker, who was responsible for making some of the best horror movies in the world.  The movie follows a man who lives alone in a small town in Germany.  One night a monster comes to his house and he gets caught up in a night of terror.  A great movie that has stood the test of time.  This movie is a masterpiece of horror and suspense.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I watched this film last week and I loved it! I have a feeling I'm going to watch it again. I had a great time and I love that the film was so good that I actually enjoyed watching it. I liked that there was no talking in this film and that there were no special effects and that it was just an average, run of the mill movie. I think I've seen some really good films and this is one of them. It was just fun. I hope it gets some more attention. I have the DVD and will be buying a Blu-Ray to watch on my big screen. I highly recommend this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I've seen this movie a number of times and the first time I saw it I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. The action scenes are amazing and the story is great. The movie was about a family that lost their daughter to a man with an evil plan. The story has some really good scenes that I'm not sure I've ever seen in a movie. I also really enjoyed the character of Joe. I felt that Joe was one of the most believable characters that I've had the pleasure of seeing in a film. The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that the soundtrack was so out of tune at times. I could hear the orchestra playing at the beginning of some of the scenes.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ (SPOILER WARNING)  I've always loved this movie and think that it is a classic. The story was interesting and it was well done. I don't think that there is anything to complain about. I do think that the music was not so great but I think that is because they tried to keep it as classic as possible. The ending was a little bit disappointing. The reason for the ending is that the character was very weak and there was no real point to the movie. So this was not a bad movie but it is not a great one either. I would say that this is a good watch if you love a classic western or if you just want to enjoy a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Train Robbery  is a film that I've seen countless times and loved.  The plot is very well done, the acting is good and the story is well-told.  As with all Robberies it has a strong American/English setting and the film is set in Philadelphia during the late 1800's.  It was directed by William C. Hart and is the first of a number of Robberie films to be made during this period.  William Hart was a noted director who worked in the late 1880's and early 1890's.  Hart was also an actor, known for his roles in several of the Robber films that were made during that time.  In addition to his roles as the Robbers in these films he also had roles as a professional boxer, as well as a doctor.  Hart made a number his Robber movies during this time and they are still very popular today.  This is one of the rare Robber-films that actually captures the spirit of the era, and it is a good one at that.  I've also seen the Robbery movies that were released in the 1950's and it was a bit too long and did not live up to the standard set by the early Robber's. The Great train Robbery is a film about a young man who becomes the leader of a band of thieves that rob trains.  There are three Robber groups in the film and one of them is lead by Jack the ruffian.  Jack is a bad guy who is in love with the woman of his dreams, and she is the woman who gives him the chance to lead a band.  I thought that Jack was a really good actor in this film.  He is well made and he was not over-acting as he had a very good sense of the character.  While I am not a fan of the story in this movie, I thought it was well done and the performances were good.  Overall, this is a great Robber film. Rating:

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _________ __________ ______________ _______________  My husband and I have been friends for a long time and have been introduced to one another through a mutual friend. He and I are also avid fans of horror movies and we have gone to a lot of them over the years. We are both huge fans of the first movie of the series. I bought a copy of this movie as a Christmas present for him, and we were able to watch it together for the first time in about 5 years. This movie has a very interesting plot. The main character is an alcoholic, and his wife and daughter are both very attached to him. When the main character decides to leave her home, she tries to stay by his side. It is a very touching story, but one that is a little bit too much like a love story. The movie is about two families living in a small town. One family is led by a woman who is completely in love with her husband and daughter. The other family, led by the main male character, is headed by a very arrogant, cold man who treats the people around him with contempt and contempt. Both the families have a lot in common. Both have very close relationships with their children. The mothers in both of the families are very protective of their children, and try to instill in them the values that they should have, while the fathers in both families are constantly trying to keep their daughters from leaving the house and being friends with the other families. In the end, it is the main female character's sister that makes the decision to leave home, and it is she who is in love and cares for her father more than anything else. She decides to stay behind in the family and leave her husband, while her husband decides to take a chance on another woman. The two families are completely destroyed. The father, the main man, is dead and the daughter is left behind to live with her alcoholic mother. The mother's son is completely alone and lost, and the sister and brother of the alcoholic father are all but forgotten. The final scene in this movie is pretty touching, and I found it pretty interesting. The ending of this film was also very moving, and made me really feel for the main characters. The story is very good and I really enjoyed it. This film is a good introduction to the series and I would recommend it to all horror fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Man is a movie that I am glad to have watched in its original version on VHS. The movie was shot on 35mm and the special effects were good enough to create a sense of excitement. There were some fantastic special effects such as the underwater scene which was very realistic and very convincing. The only issue I had was that the movie seemed to run a little long. I was thinking that it could have been shortened to about half an hour but it was a good idea to do that and it was great to see that they kept the original ending. I am also glad that they used the original sound track. It is very good and gives a good sense of what was going on. I hope that this movie will be brought back to theaters one day.  If you have seen this movie and liked it, please let us know by rating it on the site.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** I was going to write a review about the story, but I don't think I have the words for it. It was like a slow-motion roller coaster, with a lot of sudden turns. It really did take me a while to understand the basic plot. I felt like I was in the middle of a big action movie with lots of explosions, guns, explosions, etc. And I really enjoyed it! The action scenes were very well done. I just couldn't see the story going anywhere. I know the ending will be interesting, but as of right now, it is not my cup of tea. The soundtrack was a little bit too loud, and the special effects were a little too real. I wish I could give it a better rating. I hope to see a sequel, because the story is great. I really liked the special effect. It reminded me of something a little more serious than the first one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  My husband and I first saw "Sisters" in the theater at an outdoor screening at a small theater near a freeway in a small town. It was a nice, clear, sunny afternoon. My husband was really excited to see it, as he had heard good things. As we left the theater, we stopped at a gas station to fill our gas tanks. I got out of my car and went to talk to my husband in the passenger seat, and he said, "Hey, I saw a good old time movie tonight. You should watch it, too." "What's that?" "Sister's Day." I looked at him. He was smiling. I went back to my car. We watched it together in silence for a few minutes, then we got in the car again.  It's a good film. It is a good story, about a young woman who is a nun and is pregnant with a baby, who is adopted. It's about a great love, a very good love, that they have for each other. It does show the challenges of adoption and the challenges that people go through, but it also shows a lot of heart and a lot courage. The cast is all excellent, and the music and sound are great. I give it an A.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Damn Movie I Ever Saw" is an impressive movie, and one that has a very unique tone. It is a very violent film, and at times the gore is intense. However, I am very happy to see that the film doesn't go over the top, and that it leaves some of the more gruesome details on the floor. It's an action film, so there is some gore in there, but it doesn't seem to be too much. However the story itself is very interesting. A man goes to his sister's house for a sleepover. However he doesn't sleep. Instead he goes through his sister and brother's room and tries to find something to take away from them. He eventually comes across a man with a gun in his hand, who is the brother's boyfriend. The guy shoots him in the stomach, and then proceeds to stab the man with his own knife. After that he starts to leave the room. However after a little while the brother comes back in and says he is not dead yet. So, the guy goes out of the room, and tries another door. He finds it locked, so he takes a crowbar and breaks the door. Then the brother returns. The man shoots him again, and kills him. However as he is dying, he tells the man he wants to see his girlfriend. He then dies, and the brother goes off to see her. At the end of the movie you are left with some questions. Was the man's girlfriend alive when he killed him? If so, what happened to her? Why did the guy shoot the brother in the chest? Why is it that the man shoots at the door? These questions and more will make you think about this movie, which is one of the best films I have seen this year.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  The best part about this movie was the amazing fight scenes. The best fight scene in a movie that i have seen in a while was the one in the end when kenneth goes into his house and finds the dead girl. The whole movie was like that. A fight scene was always good in a good action movie, but this was like something new. The other good fight scenes were when ken's family is in the house and when the fight with the man with the sword happens. There was a lot of good fight scene but the best one was the last fight. It was amazing. I just loved the ending of this movie. It wasn't something that just happened. It had been planned for a long time. It just worked out. It made me cry. It didn't make me laugh. It really made me sad. I loved this movie! I would recommend this movie to everyone. I really liked it. I love the ending. I recommend this to everyone!

The boy finds himself in a small town in which the woman's husband is the sheriff and his job is to investigate strange happenings. The story takes place in the early 1920s, the setting being a small farm town with a few other farmers and a few small townspeople. The townspe people are mostly friendly and have friendly things to say. The only bad thing is the people have little respect for each other, and there are no policemen. The small town is populated by all sorts of people, but mostly small town people. They are a bit eccentric, but in a friendly way. There are a few nice people in the town who help the boy in his quest for the woman. The movie is set in a little town, but it is very well done.

I would recommend this movie to everyone!  Review is from: The Lost Weekend  The Lost Weekend is an excellent film. The characters are well drawn, the movie moves at a good pace and the story is gripping. The only problem I had was that it was a little too long for a movie like this.

The soundtrack is just wonderful. I'm glad that it is being made again! .

It's very violent, and there is a lot of foul language, but that's just what happens in the movie, and you can't really complain about it. The acting is really good as well.

It shows how the world changes, and shows a mother that had some great qualities, but was very unhappy, and that changed her for the better. **Movie of the Decade: ** Braveheart** **Movie that made a difference in the world: ** American Beauty** **Sci-fi/Horror: ** Alien** **Rotten Tomatoes Score: ** 85% ** **Theater of the Week: ** St. James Theatre, Dallas, TX **Best New Theater: ** Orpheum Theatre, Seattle, WA **TV Show of the week: ** Breaking Bad

McGinley, Fred Astaire, Peter Lorre, Frank Sinatra  Director: Victor Fleming  Country: USA  Plot: Kirby is a high school student who is in love with his teacher, Mrs. St. Joes. One day, Kirby has a dream that he is being chased by a giant monster that is threatening to kill him. Kirby is soon rescued by a young man, who tells Kirby that he was in the middle of a battle with the monster, when a mysterious man comes to help them. The young man tells Kirby about the mysterious person that is the reason the monster is coming to kill them, and Kirby believes him because he is wearing the same jacket that the mysterious man was wearing in the dream. Kirby then goes to his teacher and tells her that he saw a man in a coat with a hat and that he also had a beard. Mrs.St. Joe tells Kirby to tell the police that a man who looked like the man in the coat saved him from the monster. The next day, the police find Kirby in his teacher's class and arrest him. When the police ask Mrs. Joad about Kirby, she claims that she doesn't know anything about him. Later that night, Kirby wakes up and sees his teacher talking to him in his room. He goes to her room and asks her about her dream. She tells him that it was just a dream and that she has no idea who that man was in her dream, but that she remembers seeing him wearing the jacket. Kirby thinks that it must be a prank and that the man must have been the teacher. Kirby gets his parents to sign a piece of paper that says he didn't see the man.

The following day, while playing a game of hide and seek, Kirby finds out that the teacher was the man from his dream.

As a science fiction fan, I've been waiting to see this one since it was first announced. It's a great movie that's really worth watching. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies and most of the horror movies I've seen were bad. This movie is great and I'd love to see it in a theater one day.   I really enjoy this movie. The plot is really cool. The movie is about a guy named Michael (Sam Neill) who's working for an artificial intelligence company called A.I.M. and he's working with his partner and friend, a woman named Holly (Emma Watson). The movie starts with them being chased by an alien ship, which they manage to destroy, but then it comes back and kills Michael and Holly. Then it goes to a space station where Michael and his team are working and Holly is the assistant and he has to help her with her problems. Michael and the rest of the team are all kind of trying to work together and understand the alien and its goals. It has a very cool plot and I really enjoyed watching it.  .   the plot is so good I could watch it over and over again   . the special effects are amazing   (I was really hoping to see the alien in this movie because that's what's always been in sci-fi movies)   __________________________________________________  1.5 stars  Advertisements
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********  You've seen the movie "Dirty Dancing," right? That's how I felt about "Divergent." I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but I don't remember that feeling at all. Sure, I'm not as familiar with the character as I am with Taylor Swift's, but what I remember is that there's a lot of great acting.  The movie is based on Veronica Roth's first novel, and although it does have a lot going for it, I was left thinking that the book isn't nearly as good as it appears. In fact, I think it's a little worse than the movie.  the movie is set in the year 2104, in a world where mutants (who are genetically enhanced) have been hunted down and exterminated. In the meantime, society has moved past the idea of "mutant" (or, for those of us who know what that word means, "human"), and it's now acceptable for mutants to be a part of society. This society has no problem with mutants as long as they don't cause any problems or endanger the public.  for those who don't know what "mutants" are: The mutant race is a genetically enhanced people who are genetically different from humans. For example, some are human and some are mutant. Some have physical characteristics (muscles, skin, eyes, hair) that are not found in normal humans. , but that's not what the movie really focuses on. Instead, it focuses on two siblings, who are both mutants. One is called Veronica, and the other is called Tris. Tris has an unusual ability to transform into a bird (as if it's not obvious by now), which she uses to get around in the world, as she's the only mutant who can. However, Veronica is much more powerful, and she's known as "The Divergent." She is the only one who can change into a human (or bird, depending on how you look at it) at will, and her powers are very dangerous, as they allow her to kill anyone with a glance. Sigh. The problem is that the movie isn't all that good. It is very similar to "The Hunger Games" in that it features a strong female lead, but this is a different film. It's not as dark, it doesn't have the same gore, and it doesn' t really feature any of the things

It seems like a lot of people are going to hate this movie. It is just a good story with good acting, but the story of how a group of girls find out about their father's murder and how the police react is pretty messed up. The best part of the movie is how the girls handle it and how they try to deal with it. It made me cry, and I can't wait to see the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch Video Watch Video Filed under: Movie Reviews  "I felt like a kid on Christmas morning," says director Joe Wright about the emotionally charged tale of a child's descent into the underworld of London's East End.  The film stars Oscar winner Domhnall Gleeson as John (Gleeson), a young man who gets caught up in a crime that's as complex and twisted as his own life. The movie was nominated for four Oscars — for Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor (Gleseson) and Best Original Song — but lost out to "Spotlight," the 2015 film about a Boston Globe reporter investigating a cover-up in the Catholic Church. : "It is so very, very important for me to make a movie like this and to make it so authentic," Wright tells Variety. "The thing about being Irish and British is that we always make up a bunch of stuff, and I just wanted to make up something as authentic as possible." The film's score, composed by the film's cinematographer Mark Romanek, is inspired by the London club scene of the 1980s.  the story takes place in a fictional town called Bognor Regis. The local Irish pub called the 'White Lady' has a reputation for having the best Guinness in London. John is looking for his friend John (Domhnall), who is on his way to visit his mother. When he gets lost, he takes a short cut through a nearby park and meets the manager, who introduces him to the Irish gangsters. It's not long before John realizes that these people are involved in a violent crime and that they have a secret that they want him to learn about. The crime scene that Wright shot on location was the real-life location of the 'Bloody Sunday' protest in Northern Ireland. Wright was inspired to use the real locations, rather than the fictional towns of Bognoran, as he wanted to capture the feeling of being in the streets of London. "I really wanted it to feel like it was happening right in the middle of London, and it's so difficult to do that because of the streets and the architecture," Wright says. The story takes up a lot of John's time. He takes classes in criminology and takes part in various gang activities. In one sequence, he infiltrates a gang meeting in order to learn more about their operation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Citizen Kane (1941)  is a great movie that should be viewed by every movie fan. It is a classic film and it has been remade many times over.  It is very entertaining, and it is a good example of how good the actors are.  I am not a big fan of the western genre but I loved this film. It was a good mix of action, suspense, romance, comedy, drama and it shows a great combination of people.  It is hard to explain this film but it is really a classic. I have seen it about 4 or 5 times and it always gives me a smile.  I recommend this film to all people who want a good laugh and a good story.  The score by Ennio Morricone is a great part of the movie.   The movie is full of action and suspense, which you will get to enjoy.    The ending is very sad but I don't think it's as bad as some critics say.  There is a really good ending and I think it is worth watching.  A lot of people will complain about the acting of John Wayne but he was very good. He has an amazing acting ability and his voice in the film is a lot of fun.  He was one of the best actors at the time and he really showed that he can be a great actor.  One of the most underrated actors in the history of the cinema.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ "The Man Who Would Be King" is a solid drama that manages to give an original take on the King of England. The story is based on true events from 17th century England and the protagonist is John, a man who is searching for his lost daughter. As he begins to find clues about his daughter, he becomes more and more obsessed with finding the woman and the mystery surrounding her. The movie is very well acted and shot. I enjoyed this movie and the plot was very well paced. There was a bit of a problem with the movie during the beginning. There were two scenes that were filmed from different angles that gave the scenes a very different feel. These scenes were used in a different way than in the movie and it wasn't a problem but it was a minor flaw. However, it wasn´t a big problem and the movie was still very good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an original version of the King.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have never seen it, I highly recommend it. It's not the best movie ever, but it's one of the best I've seen in a while. The writing is phenomenal, the cinematography is amazing and the story is good. The plot is really a bit cliche at times but the film never takes itself too seriously and is a fun watch. There are some very dark moments that are really intense and the film is a lot of fun and very funny. The movie is very similar to the original novel but this one has some different twists and turns. Overall, it's a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  I saw this movie about 10 years ago in a theater. It was a good time and I have to say, I loved the movie. It is about a small town that is about to be swallowed up by a big company, and we follow the people who live there as they try to save their small town from becoming a ghost town. This is a very old fashioned movie and is made to entertain and to make people feel like they are living in a very small town. It does this very well. The music was great, the acting was great and the special effects were amazing. I love this movie.  -Joanne
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The best movie I've seen this year is "The Lobster." This is an absolutely beautiful film, and I was very pleased to see that it was directed by one of my favorite filmmakers. I am glad that it is available on Netflix, so I could watch it in my home. I have a couple of small complaints, and they're really minor. First, the movie starts out very slowly, with the camera moving around a small room for a while. It's not a bad thing, but it can be distracting. The second problem is that there are several scenes in which we see the same actors in the same room, so it seems that there is no real continuity between scenes. Also, at one point the director's name appears on a poster in the background, so the viewer has to keep looking to see who it is. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a wonderful film. I think the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is excellent. It was a lot of fun watching this movie. See it if you have time. I hope you like it.  …

It was the first thing that came to mind when I heard the movie title. I'm a big fan of classic westerns and this was a great example. The story and characters were so good that I felt like I was right there with the characters.

The movie was good, but it has some problems. I thought the movie was great and it has great action. It is a great story and it had some great scenes. However, I don't think it was a good story. I think this movie was very predictable. The story of the movie seemed to go very fast and very short. I don`t know why, but the movie didn`t tell me anything, except that we have some aliens in our town and some people who are not nice to them. So, what I really wanted to know is, what is going to happen with them? The movie did not tell me a lot. I could guess, but I could not really know. It also did not show us what was happening on Earth. I really liked this movie. I recommend it, especially for all the fans of this genre.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________   So I don't know if you've seen this one yet or not, but this is a very funny movie. The movie is a comedy about a kid named Michael who has to go to an elementary school in an alternate world where the kids aren't taught about what's wrong with the world. The main characters are Michael, his teacher, a black girl named Angela, and a blond girl named Tessa. The teacher is really mean and always makes fun of Michael and his friends. Michael's friends, the black girl Angela and the blond Tessa are likeable, although I didn't really like them. Michael and Tessa have a good relationship, but Michael and Angela are friends, so I didn a bit of a conflict there.   The movie has a really funny ending, but it doesn't end on a happy note. You get to see Michael grow up, and in a way he doesn't have a happy ending. He has his fair share of ups and downs and he's always going to have to deal with the people that hurt him.  , but if you are a fan of the movie, then you'll like it. It's funny, and there are some good moments.

I have seen it many times, and have watched it again and again.  ...   "The first night I watched it I was in shock! There are some scenes in the movie that really make me laugh out loud! The film has some really good lines, but the one that always gets me is, when he sees the face of the boy he loves, his face just changes color. I saw that one and it was so funny, and yet so disturbing. And that's what it all boils down to. The film is scary, but also funny. The story is very well told and the way it's told, you don't even know who the characters are! I was never very fond of the "angel" as a character in the first film, but she is in this one. The best way I can describe this film is that it is a combination of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" and "Rosemary's Baby." I loved that film, and it is not hard to see why. This film, however, has some very good acting, some very well done special effects, and a wonderful soundtrack. I was very impressed with the film, so much so that I had a hard time deciding which to watch first. I ended up watching both of them! I recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of horror movies, or for anyone just looking for a good, fun film. - June 17, 2009My Review Here.'

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Citizen Kane (1941) is the best movie about the Supreme Court.  This is not to say it is a "good" movie, but rather that it is the greatest movie about an important and fascinating subject.   I am in awe of its brilliance.  The film follows two of the greatest Supreme Court Justices of the 20th Century, William Douglas and Felix Frankfurter.  In a case called Nixon v. The United States (1943), the Supreme court decides to uphold President Franklin Roosevelt's  Executive Order No. 10450 that gives Japanese-Americans interned during World War II the right to stay in America.  The film takes place in a world where the U.S. has just defeated Japan and is fighting the Japanese Empire.  This war is being waged against the Japanese who have now invaded China.  Douglas and Frankfurters have a meeting in which they both state their opinion that Japanese Americans should be given the right of return.  After the meeting, Douglas goes back to his office where he receives a telegram from Frankfurten.  It states that the Supreme Courts will be in session the following morning at 10 a.m.  There will be a decision to decide the case.  However, the Supreme courts decides not to hear the case and only issue a decision that no matter what the decision is, the court will not hear the appeal.  Thus the two men decide to leave for New York City to make their decision.  They do so and leave the country on a bus, which is driven by a white man named Frankie Golding.  Upon arriving at the office of Justice Frankfurthers, Douglas asks for the case file.  Justice Frankfrankfurter gives him the file and asks for Douglas to tell him what he thinks of the case before they make their decisions.  Frankfurt does not think that the Japanese-American citizens should be allowed to stay.  Just then, a man in a red suit (Joe Grant) walks into the room.  He tells Frankfurer that he knows why the case was dismissed and is there to inform him of their decision to dismiss the case.  Douglas tells Frankfriday that he will make a decision on the case after he makes a speech at a meeting of the Supreme Judges at the Supreme Courthouse in New York.  While they are speaking, the red suit walks out of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________   The most obvious difference between the old film and the new is the use of different actors. In the original version, they all have a strong presence. They play very well together and the character of Jules (the old guy) is well-defined. I like how the old guys are all very different from one another and they each have their own unique personality. I think it was the best cast of the original film.   I enjoyed the new film even more. I liked the direction, and the fact that they did a very good job of making it an authentic look at the times. I don't know if you can see it in the picture, but I think they used real locations and used some old props. The film itself is very good, but it's not as good as the original. I wish they had used the new actors instead of the old ones, but they used a great script and the actors did an excellent job.   a lot of people seem to hate the new version because of the movie's subject matter. I can understand why some people would be bothered by it, because it's very hard to understand the story without knowing some of the background. But I was very interested in the story and I didn't feel I was missing much by not knowing some things. I would definitely recommend this film for anyone who loves this movie.   "It was a time when the men of the United States Army had to find their way out of this country. It was a very difficult time to do that, because we had to fight a war against an enemy that was more sophisticated, more deadly, more cunning than the men we faced on the Western Front. The men we fought were the German soldiers, the Russians, the Japanese, the Chinese. And they were a whole lot better trained, a whole heck of a lot better educated than we were. And this was a difficult war for our country." "It is a terrible thing to lose a young man, a brother, to be in this war, and to lose him so suddenly. And we had a lot to lose in that war." "The American Army had a very different idea of how the war was going to be fought. They wanted to fight it like a battle of annihilation. They didn't want to give the enemy any chance of victory. We fought to win the war, to destroy the enemy. The Russians and the Japanese were going to destroy us, and we had no chance

I don't think that there was any emotion in this movie.    The story, the movie was very simple and not that great.  The plot was pretty basic.  And there was no romance in the movie.

His wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and teenage son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are nowhere to be found, and the police have been called in to investigate.

And while Rogen's portrayal of Rogen has been a subject of intense scrutiny, the actor was clearly keen to play the part. "I'm very, very comfortable playing a character that's a bit of a joke and that is a bit sarcastic and that has a very high sense of humour," he said.

As a result of her grandmother's condition, the young girl has been in an abusive relationship with her abusive uncle, and her relationship with the other woman is even more difficult.

It is also interesting to see the other relationship the women have with each other, and the ways in which the woman's family reacts to their relationship. _____________________________________________________ This movie is great for its portrayal of a female character who does not conform to the "feminine" ideals of the movie world.

The story itself was interesting. I can't believe that I like this movie because I usually hate old silent films. It did remind me a lot of a good horror movie made by George Romero.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* **************************** I'm a sucker for action movies, and this one is definitely a good one.  It was well made and really has a great sense of urgency and drama.  I really liked the characters, especially when they get caught in all sorts of crazy situations.  There was a great suspense to this movie that I really enjoyed.  The music was great as well, especially the song that starts the movie.  But the star of the movie is definitely the action and the stunts.  And when they're not doing the craziest stunts they're doing a great job with some really good action scenes.  And the acting was excellent, especially from the cast of characters.  When they were trying to survive in the environment that was in the movie I could tell that they were just trying to make it through it as they went along.  ****************** ********************* I enjoyed this movie and really enjoyed the characters.  I found myself looking forward to the next movie.  I've seen this movie a couple of times and it always gets a good response. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The King of Comedy  (1971) "I'm an actor."  And I was a very young one.  I'd been introduced to stand-up comedy at the age of six, and had never before seen a film with such a strong script.   As I sat in my father's apartment watching a double bill of comedy shorts, I thought, "Whoa!  This could be a career in itself!"  My father's friends, however, were not impressed.    They were, of course, the people who had introduced me to comedy: my grandmother, my grandmother's mother, and my father.  But, as they watched the film together, my father started talking about "the director," and how his "character" was not funny.  I felt as if I were watching a child who was very intelligent but did not have the sense of humor to express his ideas.  As I was growing up, I wanted to be funny. But, I was never very good at it.  The director, John Huston, wanted me to try to be as funny as he was, and so I took some lessons.  It worked.  But I never really liked the work.  My work was a lot of fun, but I felt that it was a little too serious.  And, as I was getting older, my parents said, "You should do some theater."  I thought it was the most stupid thing ever, and said,  "Sure, but who's going to pay to see me?"  But, in the end, they were right, and I did some acting in college.  Later, I got a little bit of work in television, but it was nothing very great.  Even though I had an interest in acting, I wasn't really good at getting into character.  So, I decided to go into stand- up.  When I first saw The King of comedy, I loved it. I felt it was funny, and was fascinated by its plot.  This is the story of a guy who is obsessed with being a comedian and, for a long time, is unable to achieve it. When he finally does, the result is a mess.  His friends are all very funny, but he never is.  He is a very good actor, and he does have some pretty good lines.  Then the film starts.  Here, you have a
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ _________ A great movie! The acting is amazing! The story is great! I was in love with the characters. And I loved the music! I loved all the songs and the music. And there was a great scene when they were driving around and they passed the lake. The water was beautiful and it made me feel happy. So happy, I was like, "Yes! The lake is beautiful! Oh yes! This is what I love about our country!" And it is a beautiful place. And that is why we need to protect it. The song that was playing was a very important one: _________________ _______________________ The story about the two little girls was very touching. The movie is about a little girl who wants to be a girl. She wants to look like a girl, she wants to wear girl's clothes, and she wants a doll to play with. She also wants to have friends, but when she grows up, she won't be able to have them. She is in love and she thinks that she is going to find a doll that can be her best friend. She finds a doll in a park, and this doll seems to understand her. They start to play and they both feel good. Then they fall in love. When they meet again, the doll wants to give her a doll. She asks the doll if she can have a doll like the one she used to play like. The doll is sad, but says yes. But the little girl doesn't like the doll. When she goes to her mom, she finds out that she didn't like dolls when she was young. When the little doll is telling her what a horrible girl she is, she says that she has to find out how she thinks. So, she goes on a journey and finds a wonderful little doll, a doll who has a heart of gold. The little doll teaches the little girls that the only way to be happy is to love. She loves them both and she gives them a doll and says that it is the best thing in the world. When these two little girl get their new doll, they go back to the lake and play and make their doll happy. I loved this movie and I hope to see it in the theater. I hope they make a sequel because it would be great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film tells the story of a little boy who was born with a cleft palate. When he was eight years old, his cleft was surgically removed by a doctor. When the little boy turned ten, he was sent to a residential home for children who were born with disabilities. The little boy became an expert on the other children and made them feel comfortable, but he soon became aware of the adults' prejudices against people with cleft lips. His attempts to teach his peers to accept them were met with abuse and his dreams of being an actor were shattered." - IMDb review. The only thing that I liked about the movie was that it is set in the 1920s. It was well acted and it did not feel like a children's movie. The movie has a great story and the acting was great.  I hope to see a sequel.  This movie is based on the true story of James Baldwin, a black actor who was not allowed to perform in his own movies because of the color of his skin. Baldwin became a successful actor, and one of the best known black actors in the United States, when he won the first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight"  is a great movie and an amazing one at that.  I would have given it a 10/10 but I'm a little disappointed in it.  The movie itself is a good one but it's really a lot of movie.    It's like a trilogy of movies with only a couple episodes.  The story is simple but really well executed.  They have some really good and interesting characters.  It was really cool to see how much they have improved on the characters and how much Batman has grown from his first appearance.  As far as the story goes it was just a nice mix of action, drama, romance, and the usual Batman stuff.  I really liked how the movie managed to make the Joker seem like he was in love with Harley Quinn.  This is probably the best portrayal of Joker I've ever seen in a movie. Batman also grows as a character too.  After his first fight with Joker he's still a very angry and impulsive guy.  But he really changes for the better when he goes into his training and realizes how much of a good person he really is.  He really grew up.  Overall the movie was good and I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why I love this movie: I love that the film has a little bit of a love story in it. It's not all about the romance, it's also about the bond between these two characters and how their relationship changes throughout the film. The best part about this film is how it deals with religion and faith. It does a great job in explaining how both of these things are very important to the people involved. I feel like there's a real heart behind this film. Why I hate this movie : _________ Well, for the most part, I don't hate this film, but I think that there are a few problems with it. I really enjoyed the romance between the two characters, but the rest of the film is a little slow and it felt a bit slow. The movie also kind of dragged on for the ending. I don´t think that it was too bad, but it was a little disappointing that it didn't come out the way I was expecting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  I'm an independent film lover and I've been on a road trip with my family this past weekend. On the way back, we stopped off at an awesome little art-house cinema to watch "Candyman." The film was shot on a budget of $600 and the film was done in just a couple of days. I've seen a number of short horror films over the years but this one was different. It had a real sense of place. The cinematography was crisp and the actors did an amazing job of bringing the characters to life. The director, Joe Dante, took some risks and had some very strange shots in the film but he did a great job with them. This is one of those "get lost in a movie for a couple hours" kind of movies. It's a great, fun little film that should be in your collection.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________  It is a good film, but not great, that is the main problem with it. The cinematography is a little too bland. I really like the setting and the characters and there is a lot of tension in the film, even though I do not think there is much action. However, when the main character (the son) has a confrontation with his father, the action goes completely off the rails. This is the only problem I can find in this film, which is good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Coraline.  It's a movie with a lot of potential. Â The story is well written, the actors are good and the soundtrack is great.    This is a movie that should be in the public domain, and should be seen by as many people as possible.  "Coralie is a witch, and a wicked one at that.  "  This movie is not for children, nor is it suitable for the faint of heart.    The main character is not a child, but rather a woman of many faces.  It is easy to see her in a variety of roles.  But the most interesting part of the movie is the way it handles the relationship between the main character and her father.  There is no doubt in my mind that the movie could have been better if this relationship had been explored a bit more.  I'm not sure what the ending was supposed to be, but it was a bit abrupt.  The movie is a little bit slow paced, and that is probably why some people liked it so much.  In this movie there are a few references to the supernatural.  Most of them are subtle, but they add to the movie's mystique.  Unfortunately there are no monsters or ghosts in the movie, which I think is the main reason why the movie didn't get as much attention as it could have.  This movie could make for a great cult classic.  If you're a fan of the films that made up the 1990's, this movie is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ ____________ The Girl Who Played with Fire (2004) This is a very good film, and a very bad movie. It's like watching the original The Wizard of Oz with the music removed, and I love that. The movie takes place in the 1950's, and is set in the same time period as The Wizard, except it's a little different. There's a girl who was in a circus when the circus burned down and the woman who saved her was a witch who gave her the magic mirror. They are now married, and live in a small house in the country. The Witch (Charlotte Rampling) tells the girl about the death of her son, and she decides to find the girl's killer. She takes the girl to a house where a little boy is playing a game. When the boy says something funny, the Witch thinks it is a witch, so she kills the boy and takes the mirror with him. The girl's husband (Richard Burton) is in a car on the way to the house, when he hears screaming coming from the woods. He goes to investigate and finds the mirror, but not the boy. He finds the Witch, who he kills by throwing her in the water. The Wizard and the Girl Who Plays with Fire _______________ ________ ___________ The Wizard _____________ ________ The Girl ______________ ________ I saw this movie because my wife and I watched The Wizard together. We loved the movie. The characters were perfect, the story was very good, and it even had a few funny moments. This was one of my favorites of all time. The Girl has a very nice voice, and the director used her very well. The way she was written is also very good. She was a great actress, and her character was very well written. She is a good, very smart witch who is also a good friend of the boy she loves. The music in the movie is great. There are some really great songs in the film. The film also has some great scenes. I really liked the scene where the Witch tries to use the mirror to make a curse. The scene was very interesting. The next scene was also very interesting, where the girl and her husband are at the house of the witch. The witch has a dog, which she tries to pet on a leash. The dog barks at the witch, but she doesn't understand the dog, so the dog is going to kill her

The main character is a drifter named Walter, who is constantly trying to find a job, a girlfriend, and a purpose in life. Walter and his wife, played by Marge Gunderson, have an interesting, sometimes funny, but mostly boring relationship, which is not helped by the fact that Walter is a total goofball.

Also, the cop's daughter was not in this movie.   The film ends with a lot more questions than answers.

"We're going to have to destroy her story," Julian Assange said, "and then we're going get on to the real issues."  There's a lot of things that the WikiLeaks releases are not. They're not going to change the outcome of the election. It's not going make Hillary Clinton president. In fact, I think the most likely outcome is that WikiLeaks will make her look worse. And she already looks worse.  the most damning of the recent DNC leaks is this:  The DNC is not a neutral arbiter of elections. It is, in fact, an arm of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The emails, obtained from the accounts of DNC staff members and employees, are damning, to say the least. They show that the DNC was actively working against Bernie Sanders in the primary, and was in fact working against his campaign from the very beginning. , the DNC Chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is a Clinton appointee who resigned after WikiLeaks published emails that showed that she and her staff plotted to sabotage his campaign. The emails also show that top officials at the DNC were openly conspiring against Bernie and supporting Hillary Clinton for months. One of those officials, Amy Dacey, has already been fired.  in a press conference on Thursday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange slammed the DNC for attempting to sabotage the Sanders campaign, calling it a "massive and unprecedented interference in the US presidential election." Assange said that "what happened is that a major party candidate, who is a woman, is being undermined and has her support undermined. That's not just an issue for the US. That happens around the world." . Assange also slammed the press for its "failure to report the truth," arguing that the media should focus on the substance of the emails rather than "fantasy" that Russia hacked the DNC emails and tipped the election in favor of Donald Trump.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. That's all I've got. The film is an entertaining, but over-the-top, action-packed ride. It's like a cartoon, but with real-world events and situations. The movie has some pretty great action sequences, with lots of explosions and cars crashing through buildings. The stunts are pretty impressive, especially considering how ridiculous the movie looks. This is the kind of movie where the action is almost never boring, but it is very well paced. The characters are also very well done. You'll see some of the most iconic characters in the movie (a big part of its charm). There are some great characters in this movie, including the female lead (who is played by Michelle Monaghan), who has a very memorable and believable character. The voice-over in the beginning is great, too. The script is also very clever. This movie is very funny. You laugh a lot and get very involved with the characters. The final fight between the bad guys and the good guys is very impressive, and some of its stunts are impressive, too (especially when the bad guy (a really bad guy, though) is falling to the ground). The movie ends on a very satisfying note, with a great finish. I really enjoyed this movie. The acting is pretty great (and the action scenes are very impressive). The characters all have very unique and memorable personalities. This may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a quick, over-heated action flick with lots and lots of fun, you may find this one worth watching. It does have a few problems. For example, the movie is just not as good as the opening scene (it doesn't really set up anything in a good way, and it's not really believable). Also, some of those scenes with Michelle Monaghan are a bit annoying. I thought she did a good job as the female leads, but I would have liked a bit more time with them. Overall, this movie is a great action flick, with some great character moments. I would recommend it.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The Big Chill is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is a fun and entertaining watch. It has a very nice feel to it. The plot revolves around two friends who go camping. They are in the middle of a long trip and want to get away from it all. After a rough night's sleep, they are woken up by a guy who is on a motorcycle and wants to know who they are. They tell him they are from Florida. The guy goes to find out who they really are. It's then revealed that the guy is a former U.S. Marine who was discharged and went to live in Florida. He was in the army for 4 years and has a lot of family there. He's been doing it for years and now is looking for a real job. He doesn't know how to tell his family so he decides to take them to a place where he can find one. As the guys go on the road, they meet a bunch of different people. Some of them are nice and some of them look scary. The movie is full of comedy and has lots of good laughs. It also has some action and suspense as well. There are also some real dark and scary parts as well as some happy and funny parts. I really enjoyed this movie. It was a very good movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a good horror movie. I also gave it a good rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Would Be King" is a good film. It is a well written, well acted, well directed, and well acted film that is definitely worth the price of admission. It has the usual formula of "the villain is evil, the hero must save the day", but it manages to have some really interesting twists on this concept. The film also manages to be very enjoyable, and I found myself enjoying it more and more. The film is not exactly perfect. There are a few times when it feels as if the director's cut is being used as a substitute for the original version of the film. But, as long as you remember that the director, David Lean, was a veteran of the Western genre, you won't be bothered by this. What I really like about this film is how it captures a certain feeling of the time it was made, in that you get a feeling that it was actually made during a time when there was a real sense of danger to the audience. The whole concept of a film being "a hero who has to save the world" is not a new concept, but the way the film uses this idea is fresh and fun. It is a fun, entertaining, and action-packed film that will leave you smiling. I definitely recommend that you watch this film, and if you haven't already, I strongly recommend that this be added to your film collection. I am definitely looking forward to seeing more from the "Ain't Them Bodies Saints" team.

I was completely impressed with the performance by Jason Statham as he is in his prime and the performances by Statham and Stacey Sher were terrific. The script was superb and this is the best movie to date about this character. This movie is a good watch for those who love action and have not seen the film that started it all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil's Advocate" is a terrific movie.  It is a clever story of a man who is forced to defend his wife in a libel suit.        This is a brilliant satire on the "trolling" of the internet.        The movie is so funny and so entertaining that it is not really worth mentioning.  It is a satire of the modern society where one can have the audacity to say anything without being laughed out of court.  The story is about a lawyer named Tom Korn who is defending his wife when they are accused of being a couple of "douche bags".  Tom is a good lawyer who is trying to defend a very important client who is accused of having a history of sexual violence against women.  "The Devils Advocate" was the first film by director Ron Howard who has won an Oscar for the same movie.

The book is called The Road Less Traveled, and is a children's book written by Ray Bradbury. I have never seen the movie, but I'm so glad that I did!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A friend of mine was born on the day the Nazis came to power. He was a German soldier, who saw many of his friends killed and his own father tortured to death. He had the honor of serving in a German tank division. He saw his comrades killed and wounded. One day he was ordered to withdraw from a position. It was clear that we had been caught by surprise. We had no weapons. All we had were our own wits and the courage of the men around us. The Nazis started to shell us. We began to withdraw in a line, hoping to get a better position. But suddenly, they began to fire on us from every direction. It took a good three days to get back into the position we had lost. At the time, I didn't know that I would be a member of a family that would never again see a happy day in their lives.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why it is a good: ____ This is a great movie for a number of reasons. First of all, it is an amazing story. I have always been a big fan of the Star Wars series, and this movie had me in stitches for the whole duration. This is also the best story told in a movie. The whole movie has a great tone to it. There are a number scenes that you can sit and listen to. The movie also has a good plot that makes sense. Second of all is the special effects. It is clear that this movie was made to be a special effects film. There is a lot of detail put into the special FX. It gives the movie an air of sci-fi. Also, there is a real feeling of danger. There was a scene where a man is shot and the bullet gets stuck in his eye. The eye starts to open and the eye is slowly coming out of the socket. There were a number different things in the movie that I enjoyed. The music was great. It was upbeat and made me feel good. It also made me think about the future and the future of the movies. I think that this is a movie that any fan of Star Wars should check out. If you have a few minutes to spare then I recommend that you check out this movie. It may change your opinion about Star Wars. What do you think?

It's not an easy movie to get into, but once you've gotten over your initial fears and gotten into the story, you'll be left wanting more. This is a true story. There are no special effects in this movie, and no special costumes, but that's not the point. This movie is a great western and if you don't see it, you're missing out on one of the best westerns ever made."

I thought it was a nice twist that the protagonist was an actress. She was supposed to be killed by the villain but he turned out to be her husband. The actress played by Anna Paquin is very good. She is very sexy, and she was really great in this movie. I also thought the villain was played by a good actor. I think he was supposed be a real villain but it was so well done that I just thought he was an evil guy. He was a big, scary guy. The movie was really funny. It had some really good one liners and there was a couple of good scenes. I found it funny that the evil villain wanted to use the actress as his sex slave. __________________________________________ If you love a good thriller, this movie is a great way to end your summer. ______________________ A great movie with a great ending! _________________________________________________________ This movie has great one linerts and really good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My friends and I are not movie buffs. We are film junkies. The best movies in the world are usually the most overlooked. We were thrilled that we saw "Django Unchained" because of its historical context and because it was a "classic." We were surprised by how well "Dirty Harry" had aged in the two years since its release. In "The Avengers," Captain America (Chris Evans) fights with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) for control of the world. In this scene, he is shown to be in pain. The pain is from an injury that he sustained at the end of the first film. The Hulk (Chris Hemsworth) is in pain because of his transformation into a giant green monster. The film ends with the battle between Cap and the Hulk.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I have seen "The Secret of Nimh" several times in various movie theatres, and have been intrigued by the film. The special effects are great. I have never seen a film in which a single-engine plane is shown to crash at high speed and land with a big bang, and that's what the crash was. I remember this film very well. I was a little young at the time and I can remember it vividly. I don't think that I have any memories of the film's plot. It is a short film but it is an impressive film, which I have watched many times. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to learn about the life of a pilot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good film, it has a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies, but it's a very interesting film and it's an interesting character to watch. There are some good acting performances and there are some very good sequences, but the whole thing comes off as a mess and not much goes on in the film.  I liked it when it was a mystery but it came off as just a little too random.    I like a lot about this movie.  The character development is very good, the plot is interesting and it has some good character development, there is a nice twist at the end and the plot twists are pretty cool.  The characters are interesting, but their motivations are just a lot to take in.  And I really wish that the film came off better than it did.  But it is still a good story.  It has a good plot and a good character.  I have enjoyed this movie and I am going to give it a 7 out of 10, but I can't give it an 8 out of a 10.

It is named "Xenomorph" and it is sent into a human test subject named "M.K." for testing purposes.  M. K. is a highly intelligent scientist who has devoted her life to human development and has devoted a lot of her life time to creating the most advanced artificial intelligences. When she discovers that Xenomorphs are capable of reproduction, she immediately sends the Xenomorph for evaluation. The Xenomorph is then sent for evaluation to the military laboratory where the X-Files are kept. There, the X Files are reviewed by a Special Forces team. The X-files reveal that the Xeno's are the result of the human cloning experiment. The human who created the Xenos, Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Weaver, had been using the Xenoids as part of her experiments for decades. When her experiments were found out, Weaver committed suicide, but her son, John Weaver, survived. John was also sent to the Military laboratory where he was experimented on as well. The military team sent for the Xenoid is surprised when the Xenolem is successful in reproducing.  a few minutes before the ending of the movie. This is the most memorable scene of the film. The ending scene is really well made. The film ends with a beautiful shot of the city of New York. The alien gets killed in the film and the ending scene shows the destruction of New Manhattan. This ending scene makes the ending film really enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________________ I was very pleased with this movie. I was impressed with the actors, and the production values. This is a good old fashioned, old-fashioned movie. It is a movie you'll have a good laugh at, and enjoy. This movie does have its moments. I loved the fact that it was set in an old school, where the teachers have to make sure that they teach the right way. The kids are so much better than the adults. It's very entertaining. The only problem I had was when it got into the part of the school where the parents are getting divorced. The movie was really well made, but the parts about the parents getting divorced were not funny at all. It just got old and sad. I don't know if it was just a bad movie, or if it just didn't have the time to really develop its characters. I would recommend this movie to anybody. It has a lot of laughs. I hope it gets a better release in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   1. "The Big Lebowski" (1998)  It's difficult to explain how good "The Dude" is, because the movie is so great. It's not just that it's a great comedy or that it has a great cast (including a great Ralph Fiennes as the Dude's dorky buddy, The L.A. Strangler), but it's also a great film. It takes place in Los Angeles in the 1970s, and it has this weird, beautiful quality. The story, like most "classic" American films, is based on a true story (the real story of The Dude, a struggling actor who stumbles into a life of crime) and it's full of strange characters (a retired porn star, a man who is a robot and a Mexican cartel enforcer). It's a film with a real sense of fun and silliness. It also has a fantastic soundtrack by the great composer Alan Silvestri.  2. "Fahrenheit 451" (1953) , which is one of the best of all time. This film, directed by Ray Bradbury, is one part comedy, one part drama and one part science fiction. It is the story of a library in a small town in the American Midwest, where a young woman has discovered a book that is outlawed in her community. She is able to pass the book around, and soon it has been passed around by the townspeople. The book is a fictional account of a fire that happened in the library on May 1, 1845. The people who are trying to ban the book are the police. The young woman's father (Humphrey Bogart) is the town sheriff, and he has been working for the government to bring the book back. He is trying to put the book in a museum. His plan is that the people who own the book will be so upset about the fact that the book is being banned that they will want to buy it. Eventually, the book gets passed around to a group of scientists (Burt Lancaster, Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman). Eventually, they are able to make a fake book and pass it around to the public. In the end, a group is able escape, and they are the ones who pass the fake book around. The movie is really good, with a great ending.  "Fantastic Voyage" is another great movie by Stanley Kubrick.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** The Good: I am going to start by saying that this movie is awesome! The story is very well thought out, and the acting is top notch. I would not say this movie has a strong story, but there is a great story here, and a good character development for the characters. I love the romance, and I loved the character development. I also loved the art style, and it was very well done. The movie was made by a Japanese movie studio. There is a lot of nudity, but it was not to hard for me to see, because of the movie's time period. The music was great, and also a great theme song for this movie. The ending was good, and this movie had a great ending. The Bad: There was one scene in the movie that was too long. There was another scene that was not shown. There were a few scenes that were not shown that I did not like. I have no problems with the story, and if this movie gets an English dub, I will watch it. I liked the art and the music. The characters were great, so I can't complain. The sex scenes were really hot.

But he had to make a living, and he just knew that he had a lot to say and do that wasn't being said."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The best of the bunch is this, a little slow and somewhat dreary, but with a nice, creepy, sinister atmosphere. It really gets you to think about what happens to people when they're stuck in a life of crime. And the story is so good it never gets old. I've never seen the director's cut, but I have heard that it has been re-edited for the big screen. This is one of those rare "un-watched" movies, and the re-release made me so glad it was. It's a shame that I couldn't see it when it first came out.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from One of the best movies of all time. It had so much potential. This film is a great movie, but not everyone will enjoy it. I think it's the best film of all times. The cinematography is incredible, the plot is really well thought out, the acting is excellent, and it's a classic. It is the best movie of all the time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "I have always been intrigued by the fact that a great number of the best directors of the twentieth century were Jewish. So fascinated was I by the Jewish mystique that I could not help asking myself a question: why did these filmmakers, who could so easily have made a movie about the horrors of war, choose instead to make a movie that was so different from their other works? In one way or another, they were trying to make the Jews into a people that people like me could feel a connection with.  The fact that there are no Jews in the film is in itself an important statement. It says something about the Jews. And what it says is: they are not our enemy. In fact, the Jews have always worked with us, have always helped us in our struggle against the Nazis. This is the message that this movie is trying to convey: that the Jews are our friends.  a good way to show the importance of the Jews  But then the movie does not stop there. The Jewish leaders have not only taken part in the struggle against Nazism, but also in the creation of the new Germany. They helped to build the new Berlin. They gave a lot of money to the Nazis, and in return they received a lot in return. But the Jews did not forget their Jewishness. They made sure that their money was invested in their new nation. And that is why, despite all the hardships they have gone through, they are now so wealthy.  (There is also a brief scene where the Jewish people are seen living in a ghetto and, as a result, there is a scene of them getting a haircut.)  One of the most important aspects of the film that I liked was the way it shows the Jews as a people. For example, the film shows how the Jews had to live in a community for a while. This scene is especially important in showing the importance that the people in the ghetto had in the building of the nation. As a result of their hard work and dedication, the Jewish nation was built. And because the Jews were so important to this new Germany, the Germans had to give them a lot.  The film shows a lot more of the life of the Jewish community than I have ever seen before. I never thought that the Jewish leaders would be shown as such a close and helpful people. It shows how they helped build this nation. The film also shows the importance the Jewish religion had in helping
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Best of Both Worlds' was a fun sci-fi adventure. The script was well written and I really enjoyed watching the characters interact. There were some laughs in this one, but most of the fun was just watching the crew interact with each other. The ending was a bit confusing, but you get a sense of closure in the last scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************************** ********* ************************* The film opens with a short prologue set in the middle ages, before the invention of guns and the rise of the knight errant, before any knights existed at all. This was not a time of "heroes" in any traditional sense, and it is not a surprise that the film's protagonist is a young man named Dillion. He is sent by his mother to live with her sister, a beautiful woman named Nettie (played by Joanne Woodward), in the country town of Linton. As a result of her being a virgin, her father refuses to allow her to be married. This puts Dillion's life in jeopardy, since it will likely be the last time he will see his mother. Netties mother is an orphan who is living with her daughter and her husband. When Dillion discovers that Nett's mother is the daughter of a lord, Dillion is eager to learn who he is, and where he came from. He learns that the lord's name is Crippen. As Dillion attempts to befriend the lord, he discovers that the person in power, Crippe, is a tyrant, who has been trying to eliminate any traces of the noblemen of his past. When Crippin's forces threaten to invade Linton, Dillin decides to take matters into his own hands and sets out on a journey to find Crippon. Along the way he meets and falls in love with Nettiel, the daughter his mother left behind. After a series of mishaps, he learns that Crippenhorn is in fact a knight erudite. This is the first of several "hero" type characters in the film, all of whom are "good guys". *********************** ***************** ********** **************** ******** ************ The film starts off with a nice shot of a forest, where Dillion and Netti are walking. As they continue to walk, Nettis mother tells Dillion about the life of a knight and about how he is always willing to save a damsel in distress. Dillion begins to understand that Coggins evil is the same thing as evil in real life. In order to fight Crippeng, Dillions friend, the knight, he sets out to find the castle in the woods. Dillions first stops at a village where he is introduced to a young girl named Nellie. He also meets a knight

Yes, I've never been to see a movie like this.   and what a movie!  I think the movie is very good.   I didn't like this one, it wasn't my kind of movie. I'd much rather see "Cinderella" or "Snow White" (both of which were great movies). The girl in the movie had a great body, but the way she was portrayed in this movie was too sexy for my tastes. I think she needed a lot more makeup and the guy looked so much like a boy that he looked very stupid. It was a very strange movie and I think the only good thing about it is that it showed a little of what life is like in the Soviet Union.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- It's funny because it's based on a true story. The movie's the movie. I really like it. There are some scenes where the guy is trying to save the girl and he's not really that good. The other people were like "He's a great guy!" But it's still a movie. So if you really love it, then go for it. If not, then don't bother. The girls were really nice. The guy wasn't a bad guy. I mean, he didn't have a very nice story, but you see that he's a guy who loves a girl who is very shy and doesn't talk. But he's really nice and he tries his best to save her. It's really cute. And there's some scenes that are funny, too. It was really fun.  Did you find this helpful? 8 of 8 Found Helpful  Tanya wrote  3/17/2016 8:24:23 AM  Awesome movie! The acting is great and the movie is well made. I liked the way the movie was shot. My favorite scenes were the ones with the two lovers, and when the two guys were playing poker. I'm a fan of a lot of movies and this one was great.  the only problem was there was a lot more sex in the second half than in the first.  for the record, the movie starts at 12:35pm and ends at 10:00pm. -
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Why should I watch this movie: It's a remake of a classic horror movie from the '60s that has never been remade, and it's a nice remake. It's also a great movie that has a lot of laughs in it. It has the same cast of characters from the original movie, and they are all funny. The movie takes place in a college in Maine where a group of college students decide to go out on a camping trip for a week. It doesn't really take itself too seriously, but there is a really cool atmosphere to it. I really loved this movie. The writing is great. The characters are funny, and the story is good. __________________________ Check it out if you like: Horror movies that don't take themselves too seriously. __________________  Sean wrote: Why should you watch this film: Because it's another "It Follows" in the horror genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A.I. Artificial Intelligence ___________  by  Bobby Lee  July 16, 2011  (updated July 17, 2011)  I thought this was an entertaining movie. The story was pretty good. However, the action sequences were a little repetitive. I was wondering when they would go into the alien ship. They did the first two scenes with the alien ships, but the third was when they finally showed the ship. Then they never showed it again. I found it hard to believe that they couldn't come up with something that would make it worthwhile. It was all pretty boring. I guess they just don't want to make a sequel to this.   I liked the characters. I liked how they were all different. They had different personalities. They were all likable and they all had their good and bad points. I really enjoyed the ending. I also liked the music that was used.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" "The Last Boy Scout" was a film I had never seen before I saw the trailer. I wasn't sure if I liked it, but it got me interested in watching it. I think the film did what it was supposed to do, and it was well made.  "I've got the cure for you" In this movie, a boy and his friend are running away from the bullies, but they decide to go back to their school. When they get there, the bullies make it clear that they don't want the two of them back.   The film was interesting because of the character development, and how it was done.  The character was really interesting, and made me want to see what would happen next.  I think that this was one of those movies that was good for adults and kids to watch.  In this movie you get to see a lot of people's feelings about bullies and how they treat others.  This movie had a great ending, and was pretty emotional.  There was a very interesting story line to the film, and there was a lot to look forward to in the sequel.  If you liked this movie or have seen it, then you should check out the sequel "I've Got the Cure for You".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dino De Laurentiis' The Great Escape (1980) is a classic.  I saw it when I was a kid, but it has aged beautifully.   It was one of the first films I saw about the great escape from the Nazis.  The plot is very simple.  There is a concentration camp at a small town.  It is run by a sadistic Nazi.  They are constantly trying to escape.  One day, they are caught and put to death.  When they are being marched to their death, they break out and flee the town.   This is a very clever plot, and it works.  In a film like this, you get a lot of good action scenes and suspense.  Even if it is a bit dated, it still has a lot to offer.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever wanted to see what the world would be like if the Nazis won.   The film also has great acting.  Johnny Depp is great as the leader of the escape.   There is no reason to believe he would be a Nazi.   He is just as evil as the others, but he is not as evil.  David Warner is also excellent as the Nazi. He has a very sinister yet heroic attitude.  You can see why he is so feared.  As for the film's music, it is very good.  De Laurentis is a great director and the film is one of his best.  A must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   ___________________________________________________   BAD GUY (1990)   Director: Don Siegel   Stars: Jeff Bridges, Tom Berenger, Edward Norton   Synopsis: The first in a trilogy of American crime movies by Don Sorenson, this is about a veteran cop in the 1950s and 60s who's been fired from the force for murder, who's in the process of re-joining it, who meets an old flame, a prostitute who is pregnant with his child. She is the daughter of a drug dealer and, as a result, he's a big man on the street. But the cops don't care about him, so he goes back into the life he once knew and starts to pull the strings.   I think this is one of the best cop movies ever made, if not the best. The first half is very interesting and the cop is very well-played. But after that it becomes very hard to get into, the second half is too long. The sex scenes are great and they add something to the film. The story, too, is very good.   of course, it's not perfect and there are some flaws, but for a great crime thriller it's still a good one. It's got a lot of great lines.   to my opinion this is the best American crime movie of all time.   a very good crime movie with good acting and a good story.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The movie is about a girl who is kidnapped by a bunch of gangsters in a city. The girl is tied up and raped. The gangsters are dressed like the villains from the old "Batman" TV series. There is a lot of blood. The movie was directed by an Italian who was really well known for his gangster movies. The action was very good and it was a good horror movie. I think this movie would have been good if it was not for the fact that the girl was killed. I like this movie because it is about something very real and it is a good example of a girl's life. It is a little slow, but it is worth a watch. I also like the fact they added a lot more action in the last act. I don't like the movie. It isn't a good film and it isn't scary. The girls looks are too perfect and the music is not good.

The movie was made in the 50's, with a very dull story, and the only reason why I watched it was because of the "HITCH" part. *I am a big fan of the late Robert Mitchum, but the character that played the "hitch" was an idiot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is a very good movie and is in my opinion one of the best films of 2014. It is one of those movies that you will not forget because it is so unique and original. It has a great storyline with the main character being a homeless man who is looking for a place to stay while his wife is on a business trip. He is trying to make a living by offering free lodging for people to sleep on the streets. This is a great movie and it is a movie I recommend to everyone who is interested in great films. This movie is a classic and it will stay with you long after you have seen it. The story is brilliant and the film is filled with beautiful photography and a good soundtrack. The acting was great, the music was good and the direction was amazing. The main character of the movie is not a typical hero, he is a hero because he is really looking for hope. He was a very likable and likable guy and you will be able to identify with him even though you know what he is going through. This was a great and very well done movie and I am glad I watched it. _________ "The Wolf of Wall Street" is not the best movie of 2013 but it is definitely one of my favorites. It takes place in 2008 and is about the life of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker that went bankrupt after he gambled with a company that had a lot of money. Jordan Belmont goes on to become one of America's most notorious stockbrokers and he is the biggest loser of them all. It was a movie that I watched while eating dinner and it really surprised me. The film was very well made and the performances were very good. I am a huge fan of the films that are made by Jordan Belmond and this was a good one. It may not be as good as "The Departed" but it was still very good and was the perfect movie for a good night at the movies. I will definitely see it again and I will certainly recommend it to everyone. __________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Room (2002) is a great film. It's an intense movie. It has the best actors in the world playing the main characters and it is about a family going through some very difficult times. The movie has a few issues. It is not a great movie and the ending was very disappointing. But it's an amazing movie that is worth seeing. The ending has the entire family at the hospital after the death of one of the characters. They don't know who to believe. And that was a very sad ending. But the movie is worth watching. I will definitely rewatch this movie and it will be on my list. It does not get a lot of positive reviews and the reason for that is because it is a dark movie that has some disturbing scenes. The story is very well written. The actors are great. And I do not think there is a person who does not love the ending of this movie. But I think it's one of those movies that you must see before you see it again. If you want a good dark movie with an amazing cast, this is the movie to see. I will give this a 7/10.  It's a great, emotional movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If I were forced to rank the movies I've seen in my life, The Godfather would be the first one I would want to see. A fantastic adaptation of a classic. A masterpiece of filmmaking. A movie that shows how great an actor can be. It is also the best film I've ever seen. I was so happy to have a part in this movie and I had such a good time doing it. This was the last time I saw The Godmother and I hope we'll see more from her.   I was in New York City for a meeting and one day I received a call from my agent, telling me about this movie, and how it was being shot. I knew I had to go see it. I had a very good time. I thought it was so great that it was going to be on television. I went to the premiere and I remember when I walked out I was just in a state of disbelief. I can still picture it. There was a lot of anticipation and I was very excited. When I walked up to the theater, I couldn't believe that it had all happened. I saw some old friends and it was a very special experience. When they asked me about my character, I had this feeling like they had seen something on TV and they were going to do a follow-up. They had already made some changes to my character so I was surprised they kept it. But I was happy I was there. The film was shot in a very beautiful location, in Italy. It was a great cast and I couldn�t have asked for a better role. I played a very simple character but she was so beautiful. She was a prostitute who wanted to be a movie star. She had a great, sexy personality. The character was so interesting and the director, Francis Ford Coppola, did a great job of capturing her personality. I don�t think I'll ever get tired of watching her. There were so many different scenes that were shot that I was lucky to have some of them. I got to be in several different scenes. The actress, Brigitte Bardot, was wonderful in her role. She knew what she wanted and was a natural in the role. It wasn�t hard to believe the movie was a hit. It had great reviews and it had a huge following. I have a great memory of that time. There are so many great stories that I can tell from that time in my career.

It was a bit slow for a thriller but I guess it was because the director made it slow because he wanted to have the movie as long as possible so he could tell the story in detail. There were so many events that he had no time to do anything because it just kept going. There was a part where he was trying to find his daughter and it ended very well. It had a lot of action scenes and they were well done. I liked the way the director kept telling the story. There are a lot more things that were happening than I thought there would be. The film is a great thriller and it will have you thinking about it for a long time. It took me a long while to realize that the story was true but I believe that it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- > "My Life" is a movie which I've loved for years and I finally saw it this week. I've seen it twice in the theater and again at home. It's an amazing movie about a man who has been on the verge of losing his mind since the day he met his wife. He's never been a patient man, but that's the way it has been for him. The first time we see him he is a man of action and in the second time we watch him slowly fall to the wayside. It took me awhile to realize he was the one who lost it. The way the character is depicted is just right. You can't tell that he's losing it until he's not there anymore. And when he is there he's like a different man. I had a chance to interview the director about his creation of the character. I hope you enjoy his answers.

The Neon Demon was an original movie that was very influential in the genre. I had always wanted to see a remake of this movie. This movie was very well-known in the 70's, and it still holds a place in my heart. It is also very important to mention that this movie is very well written and well-directed. It has a very good plot and it really gets you on the edge of your seat. It starts with a couple who find a body. The couple start looking for the guy who did this to their wife. But the wife is not happy with this, she does not want to look for the body, she only wants her husband back. But this is not easy to do, the couple has to search for clues and to get help. The movie then starts with the wife's story. She has a history of having an affair with a man who died a couple of years ago. She had a hard time dealing with the fact that she could not have this man anymore. But at last she had a dream about her husband in the hospital. And that was it. Her husband comes back from the hospital and she forgets all about the past. But then the man she thought dead comes back and starts trying to kill her husband. And he is a very powerful man. She tries to run away from him but then he tries to kill a couple more people. And the story starts to get more and more serious and dangerous. The wife then realizes that the man is a vampire and she has to fight against him to get him back. It was very hard for me to watch this movie as it made me feel very uncomfortable. I really enjoyed this movie but it did make me uncomfortable and it did not help the plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Dinosaur  is a great animated film. It is not perfect, but it is great and I can't wait for my friends to see it. The story is a little complicated at first. There are lots of dinosaur references. I guess they thought it would be too weird to show them in a children's movie. But it is so good and fun!  It has a great voice cast and some of the best animation ever made. I just love the fact that it has some dinosaurs in it. It has an amazing cast of characters. The film is not a long one and I was happy to see that.  You do need to watch it on a big screen to appreciate the movie.  You can buy The Good Dinosaur on Amazon or at your local Walmart.

I loved how they brought in some new actors and it was a great story to tell about a kid from New York City who got a chance to see his father on the big screen for the first time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. _________. ____________________. _____. (Read the whole review.) _____ ___________. ____. (Watch the movie.) ______________. _______. (What did I think of the movie?) ____________. It's the last of the four films, which have been made from a script by the film's writer and director, David Mamet, with Mamet himself directing. It is a comedy about a man who is a doctor and is married to a woman. The woman is a professional actress and, at the end of the film, she leaves the doctor. The doctor tries to figure out why he's lost his wife and decides to go out and do something for himself. The movie's ending is a bit of a letdown, but there are a couple of things that make it worth seeing. First, the movie is a parody of the classic movie, "It's a Wonderful Life." Second, it is a good parody of that movie. It makes fun of the idea of a man going out to get his own "great life" and getting it in the worst way. It also makes fun at the idea that this movie is really a parody. It shows that it is really about an actor going out on a romantic trip and having his life turn upside down. (I've never seen a movie in which the guy goes out and meets a girl he likes and then has to decide if he wants to marry her, and the ending in the movie shows the guy deciding to marry the girl.) This movie is not about a doctor getting his life together. This is a man being a man. It does make fun at how the movie ends, but it never makes fun enough to make it a bad movie. The acting is really good, the music is good, and it does make a good gag at the ending. The only thing that bothers me is that the movie has an ending that is a little too neat and tidy. It doesn't really give the story of the plot that much more meaning. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ (Read a review of "The Best of Billy Wilder") _____________________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ "The Shining" is a good, but not great movie. Kubrick's film is the culmination of the director's career and the most ambitious movie he ever made. It is one of his best and most cinematic work. It's about Jack Torrance, a doctor who is obsessed with the occult, who believes he has discovered a way to communicate with the dead. He tries to contact one, a woman named Wendy, by writing a love letter to her, but she never responds. Jack tries to talk to her using his mind and his knowledge of the past. After an unsuccessful attempt to contact her, Jack is convinced that the evil spirits he is seeing are real. He begins a ritual to try and communicate with her. But Jack soon discovers that Wendy is not the only spirit in the house, and that the house itself has supernatural properties. There is a strange man in the basement, a dog in the attic and a demon in the kitchen. In the end, Jack realizes that he needs to sacrifice himself to help save Wendy. The only problem is that his obsession with the supernatural and his belief in his own abilities to control the unseen forces of the universe may bring him to his end. Kubrick was the first director to have an entire film shot on film. His technique is also very innovative in that he wanted every shot to be completely seamless. It was very difficult for the actors to find the right shot, but Kubrick always made sure that it was done in a very professional manner. His camera moves are also very fluid and very cinematic. I loved this movie and highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Man Holiday  (2015). This movie is a classic of the genre and a very good movie with a story that is as old as time.  This movie is based on the story of an old man (played by George Burns) who wants to meet his grandson (played here by the wonderful Robert Redford) who has a similar name to his grandfather.  This is a great old movie. I enjoyed this movie. It was well written and it had great acting. The best part about this movie is the way it portrays the old man.  This was a nice way to go out.  The Best Man is one of the best movies about a grandfather. If you like old movies then you will enjoy this movie too.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** ******************* ********** The movie is a little more serious than some other movies. The movie has a few nice special effects, especially for a movie made in 1950s. The story is about a guy named Bill and his family who are the owners of a real estate company. They own the largest real estate in a town. Bill wants to buy some land and develop it. He goes to his neighbor's house, who is a widow. The widow wants to sell her land to Bill. Bill has to convince her that he is the right guy. The only problem is, he is not a very nice guy. He is a nice man but he does not care about his family. When he is trying to sell his land, he needs to get the help of his friend, the manager of the real estate. When the manager is not there, Bill makes a big mistake and loses all the money. When Bill is forced to return the money, he does something really bad and he does it for revenge. The other main characters are a reporter, a secretary, a friend of Bill's, and a little boy. The little boy is named Peter. He has some problems in his life. He does not like to go to school because he does bad things in his head. When Peter gets back to his house, he finds a bunch of books. He reads them and realizes that there is a secret in them. He finds a secret that is very dangerous. He realizes that if he tells this secret, he will die. He decides to tell his parents about it. The main character in this movie is really good. His father is the best kind of father, he gives his son a chance. When you see Bill's father, you feel sorry for him. He was a tough guy and Bill's mother was a crazy woman. It seems like he had problems with her. The whole movie is not like a horror movie. You know that you are watching a good, real movie. I give this movie a great rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The best part about "The Last of the Mohicans" was the music." - Tom Savini (Director)   "I really enjoyed the movie. I think it's a great story, and a very good movie to show young people. It's very different from the other war movies we have made. I'm sure they will make a lot of money. It has a good balance of action, adventure and romance. It was a very interesting and exciting movie to make. I really enjoyed working on it." - David Morrell (Director of Photography)  - Review by Joe Bresnahan   - Review in the New York Times   Director David Morriss (director of "The Longest Day") is known for his dramatic and challenging films, such as "The Dead Pool" and "A Long Day's Journey Into Night," which are among the most popular of all his films. He has also made some of the most critically acclaimed films of recent times, such "The Naked Prey" and the Oscar-nominated "The Artist," which won a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. "The Mohicans," also known as "Citizen Kane," was one of his first major projects. It stars Tom Savile as William Clark, a young British soldier who leaves the trenches to join a guerrilla group in the war-torn country of the French Indochina. The movie, directed by David Moriss and written by William Wyler, was based on a novel by Thomas Wolfe.   This film is a masterpiece of storytelling, with a superb cast that includes William Holden (as William Clark), Christopher Plummer (as Major Richard "Dickie" O'Sullivan), Robert Shaw (as Captain John Mason), and George C. Scott (as General John Clark). The film is full of suspense and surprises, and features a tremendous cast of actors that include John Gavin, Susan Hayward, and Jane Fonda.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ [SPOILER WARNING] As you may already know, there's a sequel to the film called The Matrix Revolutions. This film has a slightly different story, with Neo (Keanu Reeves) having to fight a "dark force", instead of the machine. This movie takes place in the future, and in order to fight the dark force, he has to enter into a virtual reality game, called The Game. It is a little bit different, but still quite similar to The Matrix, and is a great movie. The main reason I like this movie, is because of how the story is told, and the amount of action and twists. It also contains a great performance from Keanu Reeves. The Matrix is a good film, and it should be seen, but it is better than The Matrix.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  1) In the beginning of the movie I thought I was watching a horror movie. When they opened the gate they said it was a sci-fi movie. I thought it was the beginning. But then I realized they were talking about this.  2) It is funny when the ship comes to the moon, I am in my seat laughing so hard I can't think. It is not funny when they go to the planets.  a) When they are on the moon they have a lot of power. They are all over the place. It really makes you think.  the ship is very heavy  b) When the ships come out of the gate it is a very good time.  of course, we see a lot more of the planet in the film  3) When we first meet the crew they all are dressed in the same clothes. But they are all dressed differently. It makes the movie interesting. ,,  This movie is a classic. If you liked Star Trek and Star Wars you will like this. It has the feel of Star Wars. The scenes of the space battles are very cool. It shows what the future of space travel will be like. This movie is not very deep, but it is fun. You will laugh out loud.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My first trip to Canada was in 1990 when I saw my first "Cannibal Holocaust".  I was 12 years old and didn't know what a "zombie" was.  So I was surprised by this movie.  "Canna-zombies" or "zombies with a taste for human flesh" was just another term for "zom-poms" (boobs) that were the bane of the world in the early 60s.  and for some reason this film came out when I was 12.  the first time I saw it, I thought it was a western/revenge movie but after watching it again, I found that it was really a horror film.  for a young 12 year old, this movie had a lot of blood and gore. It had a really good soundtrack. I had seen it twice but only remembered the first half. It was not that good. The second time I watched it, it was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last King of Scotland (1981) I have been a huge fan of John Boorman since his very first film. In fact, I was lucky enough to be present when he did a reading of his novel, The Mothman Prophecies, at the National Book Store in New York in 1971.  The Last Man (1988)  I would have to say that this film was made more for adults than children.  It is hard to believe that Boorman would have been able to bring out such an intense and compelling performance as John Malkovich.    John Malkovitch is a complex character, and he doesn't get enough screen time.  He is almost like a ghost.  I was very disappointed with how the plot was resolved.  A great deal of time is spent in flashbacks to the days leading up to the crash of the plane.  It is difficult to follow.  The film is a great blend of comedy and drama.  The Last Man is based on the true story of a man who was rescued after his plane crashed near the small town of Shirey, New Hampshire in 1971 and was discovered by two hunters.     He was found with a bullet wound in his neck, and it was determined he had survived the crash.  After being examined at a hospital, it was found that he had a rare condition that resulted in him having the ability to change his size and shape at will.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I'm a big movie buff but only have a few hours a week to watch them. My favorite genre is Sci-Fi/horror so my choices are often a mix of the two. This is one of the most well-made movies I've seen. I love the concept. I would have loved to see the crew of the spaceship go through the same experience.  Last night I watched this movie on a big screen with the big screen sound and it was great. The crew of our spaceship were in a little hole in the sky and had a bunch of crazy people trying to kill them and trying to take over the ship. They had to work together to fight these people and keep the ship together. I was very impressed with this movie. I thought the special effects and music were good. I liked that the aliens are not really like us but seem more alien than human. They are very fast and powerful but not super intelligent. This movie has a good ending that leaves a lot of unanswered questions. , December 22, 2008

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  I had heard that the film was called "Sniper" and it was based on a book. I never read the book and have never seen the movie. My guess is that it is based on the book, but the book doesn't really seem to be about the "S" or any of the characters from the book. The book is about a sniper who kills a Russian general and a lot of people in the process. It's pretty good but not as good as it could be. The movie doesn't seem to have much of a story, the plot is pretty weak and doesn't even make sense. The action scenes are pretty good, but they are pretty boring. The film is pretty slow and boring. I'm surprised it was ever made, since the action scenes and slow pacing really take away from the movie, and the story isn't very good either. I thought the movie was made by the same people that made "The Hunt for Red October" and "Black Hawk Down" but I guess not. It doesn't have a whole lot of action, and it doesn't make a lot happen, but if you are into the action films then you will probably enjoy this movie. It is a good looking movie but it is a little bland looking, but I don't think it was a bad thing. I guess it is good for kids. It has a great cover but it's pretty cheap looking. If you have kids and are looking for a cheap movie to watch with them then I would recommend this movie to you. If not, it probably won't be that good.  Overall: ____________________________________________________________________________  So this is a pretty good movie. The "S", "S-1", and "S3" were made in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The story is pretty good and has a pretty interesting plot. The acting is pretty bad but it isn't that bad. I think the acting could be better but I really enjoyed it. The music is really good but it doesn.t do much. It would have been nice to have more music during some of the scenes. The plot is weak and it really doesn't do much, but it still is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai is a fun romp through the Japanese countryside in which our hero, Samura, goes on a quest to avenge his wife's death and win back his kingdom. This film has a story that is very entertaining, but it also has some good visuals and an interesting plot that's pretty deep. The film was made in 1948. It was the first film that starred Akira Kurosawa.  Kurosawa is well known for his samurai films, such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo and Rashomon.  His next film, The Hidden Fortress, is also a very good film.   The film is about a young man who travels to Japan to find his brother who has disappeared.  This film also has a very interesting plot and some great action scenes. I really enjoyed this movie. It had a great cast, and the story is interesting.  The movie is not long at all.  I think the length is perfect for the story, but there are some great fight scenes in this movie that will make you want to see more.  There are some other characters who are introduced later in the movie.  These are very minor characters and their roles are minor at best.  They only appear in the end.  But I really enjoyed the movie and recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie about life I've seen so far this year is "Life Itself" by Terrence Malick.  If you've never seen this movie, it is a film that can be seen as a metaphor for the world and the people within it.  I think the movie is a masterpiece, but not everyone is going to like it. The story is about a group of friends who have been brought together by an old lady named "The Doctor" who has a gift of predicting the future.  The plot is basically a bunch of guys hanging out and having fun.   The characters were all interesting in their own right, and some of them are so compelling that it is easy to see how the movie will end.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies like "Thelma and Louise", "The Graduate", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Sleeper" and the like.  "Life itself" is a story about a lot of things, but it was really about how the characters are all dealing with death.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I have a love-hate relationship with this movie. I loved it at the time, and now that I've seen it again I have a hard time getting into it. It's like I don't really know who these people are or what they're about. This movie's greatest strength is the fact that it gives us a lot of information about the characters and how they're connected. However, the film's greatest weakness is the script. The main problem with the screenplay is that it doesn't give us enough to know about the people in it. The story is not very well developed, and the film doesn't really build up to the revelation that it's not a dream. So it's a bit hard to suspend disbelief and actually believe that this movie is real. The second biggest flaw is that the movie feels like it could have been a great movie but they didn't make the most of it.  This movie was originally a TV series called "The Others". It was a horror movie that was adapted to a TV show. There are a lot more similarities between this movie and "The People Under the Stairs" than there are differences. This is also the only movie that I can think of that could have worked as a TV movie. , 5 out of 5 based on 7 ratings. 7 user reviews. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!...Read full review  Thank you for the review!  I was really excited to watch this movie when it came out last year and I loved it. It's a story about a girl who was born with no sense of time and has to cope with her mother, a witch, who has to take care of her and then her younger brother. It was really fun to watch and I am looking forward to seeing more of this movie in the future.   The only thing that I don't like about the movie is that the movie isn't a very good example of what a horror movie should be. I don`t like the way it is shot. The camera angles are always off and when you see a character in the dark you feel like you are there, but it's not scary. I mean the movie tries to be scary but it is not scary enough. I think a good horror movie needs to be both scary and exciting, but this movie isn`t either of those things. I guess it is a good example for a horror fan of how a movie can be made. The movie has a lot of great ideas but doesn`t follow them very well.

This movie is a good film for people who like horror movies. It's not scary in the same way as some of the other horror movies out there. However, it is not bad. It does have a good amount of scares, the acting is very good, and the story is great. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and it was worth the wait.  4 stars: I loved this movie. The acting is amazing, the scares are great, the story line is great, and it's really funny. This is a great movie to watch.  to watch: the movie starts off slow, then it gets very intense and scary. it does get a little repetitive, but the movie doesn't let you forget what it's about. it's not a horror movie by any means. I like the scares and the scares do make you laugh. it also has great acting and the actors work well together. I think if you like horror films, you will like this movie too. It has a good ending and a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have a choice between The Sixth Sense and the Matrix. You don't. The Matrix was a classic. The SixthSense was a good, but unremarkable movie. In my opinion, it is a better movie than The Matrix. The movie is very good. It is a good example of the 'Matrix' trilogy. The only problem I have with the movie is that it didn't have any action sequences. It had a lot of dialogue. This made it seem like it was more of a film with a message than a film about a man who can see and hear. The characters were a bit too wooden. The dialogue was too easy. The ending was a little anticlimactic. There was a lot to like about this movie. It was a great movie. I liked it, but it wasn't a'must see' movie. Overall Rating: 7/10

The plot itself is very interesting. The acting is really good. The action is very well done. And the soundtrack is great. The movie has a good ending. The ending was a little odd. It's a little confusing and it takes you out of the movie. But in the end, the movie does what it set out to do. It just left you with a bad taste in your mouth. I really liked it. It was a nice movie to watch. I think I would recommend it to people that like action and don't mind a little bit of mystery. I did enjoy it. But I don't think it's worth watching it if you just want a good action movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" is an incredible and haunting movie about the final years of a family and how a castle shaped the lives of two people. I am going to start by saying that this movie is not about a "weird" family. The weird part about this movie were not the strange things that happened to the family. There is nothing weird about the family but I did not think they were strange. What made this movie so interesting was that it showed the struggles of these people. There were times when the parents tried to hide their feelings from the kids and there were times where the kids tried to get the parents to open up to them. When the movie was over I was really sad because I had such a great time watching it. I thought that this was a very emotional movie and that it would make you want to get to know these people and learn more about them. It does all that and more. "We have always lived in the castle" is a movie that I recommend to anyone who likes to see a movie about people who live in a castle and try to hide from the world. The movie is so sad that it makes you feel sorry for them. I felt like I could not even understand what they were going through. I do not think that the kids were acting in a "cute" way. The whole movie is filled with the same kinds of feelings that we feel when we are trying to hide things from the outside world. "I Am a Sword" is about a girl named Sarah who goes on a road trip with her friend Hannah. They are both 18 and have no idea what they want to do with their lives. Hannah gets drunk and falls in a ditch. Sarah takes her into her house and cleans her up. She makes her feel more comfortable in her home. They have a great conversation and Hannah realizes that she has feelings for Sarah. The next day they get into a fight and Sarah leaves Hannah and goes home. She tells Hannah that she is going to get a boyfriend and she wants to tell him that she likes him. Hannah doesn't believe her. They then end up getting into a car accident and Sarah gets knocked unconscious. The driver of the car gets a ticket for reckless driving. When Sarah wakes up she sees a man on the side of the road. He gives her a ride home and when they get there he asks if Sarah likes him and Sarah says yes. Sarah and the man go back to his house and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't want to make too much of this film, but I just really enjoyed this movie. I think it has great moments and great actors and it just was a very good movie.  As far as I am concerned, I have seen every film in the Saw series.  In the middle of a terrible drought, a group of local hunters and farmers attempt to get a water source.  The film begins with the farmers and the hunters walking along the edge of a lake and looking for a water hole.   After a couple of hours of searching, they find the water hole and then some other hunters and a truck driver (who drives the tractor) find a cave where they start digging around for more water.  After some time, they are getting close to the water when the farmer falls into the hole and dies.  He was the only one to die that day, but the other hunters are convinced that they must bring the body to the cave so that they can bury it.  When they finally make it to the lake and start digging, they discover that it is full of water.  As they try to get it out, they run into a couple who are fishing.  They tell them that they are the ones who dug the waterhole and tell them about the dead farmer.  Then one of the hunters shoots the couple who tell them how he fell into the lake, and they tell them to take the dead body back to the camp.  As they pull the body out of the water, the woman who they had shot and killed says "He was a good man.  I wish I had shot him".  The next morning the camp is still not done digging.  One of the farmers is missing.  Some of the people at the camp are thinking that the farmer was a witch, but everyone thinks that they had killed the farmer. When they get to the farmers house, they go in and find his body.  It turns out that he is not dead and is alive but his wife is missing and it is up to the two hunters to find her.  At the camp, the hunters are having a barbecue.  Before the barbecue begins, they take out some meat from the dead farm animals and give it to some of the campers.  But when the hunters start eating the meat, they get some weird vibes from it. The hunters are worried that the witch is back and they get scared and run away.  In the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. _________. _________________.  __________________  Maurice, The Boy in the Spider's Web (1947)  This movie was a little hard to find. I saw it about five years ago and it was a real treat. The film is based on the true story of how a girl, who was sent to a mental hospital for a mental disorder, was accidentally found in a field by the man who found her. She had been in the care of the insane Dr. Arbuthnot who had locked her up in a small room. It is said that she could see things that no other person could. In this movie, she is a little girl who lives with her uncle. The aunt is in love with her and takes her to see a play that is playing in the park. At the end of the play, she goes home and discovers that her aunt has left her there. She has been locked up in her room for a long time, she doesn't know who she is. When she comes out of the room, she sees a little boy dressed in a green cape. He introduces himself as Maurice and asks her if she has any brothers. She says that she has a little brother named James. He then says that he has an aunt. She goes with him to his aunt's house, where she meets her mother. They take her to her room and she is locked up there. When Maurice goes into the room to see what has happened to his little sister, he finds her dead. It turns out that she was a witch. He carries her out of her room. When he gets back to his uncle's house he finds out that her mother and her aunt had died and his aunt was locked up and not answering the door. He gets a note from his aunt that she will come to visit him in a few days and then he will take her home. They get to the house and Maurice takes the note and reads it and he realizes that his aunt has been a witch all along. She told him that her nephew was a demon. He finds his little brother and he tells him that he wants to run away with him. Maurice takes him to the church and tells him to read the bible and make him a saint. The little boy is so impressed by this he decides to stay. He becomes a saint and Maurice becomes his priest. The next morning Maurice goes to his room and finds that his little boy has changed.

The montage then goes to a shot of a girl playing on a beach with a big smile on her face. Then we see her on the beach with her mother. The montages are beautiful and beautiful. ____________________________________________ The movie has a pretty solid plot and it's easy to follow. The movie is mostly set in a house and the house is pretty cool. The only thing that didn't really work was that there was a bunch of other characters in the house. They had their own plot lines and it was hard to follow them. The house was pretty cool too. The scenes with the kids and the parents were pretty cool and I liked the little family that was in the movie. ____________________ The acting in this movie was really good.

Review by: Mike The film starts out with a few nice images, a beautiful sunset, a very well-cast ensemble and a great story. The first act is all about the main character, a writer, and what he does. He takes his job very seriously and his characters are very well realized.   The story then switches to another character who works as a copywriter for a magazine. His job is not as glamorous, but it does involve a lot of hard work and he has a sense of humor.   the second act, or maybe third, is more of a comedy than a drama. It's not the kind of movie that you want to sit through, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. The movie does have some interesting points, but that's what makes it great.   is the story, and it's well told. It follows the same character from beginning to end. The actors are well-acted and their roles are well done. This is a well-made film, with a nice plot. The only real complaint I have is the direction. The editing is a little choppy and the lighting is a bit too bright. It may have been done for a TV show, but the movie really shouldn't be watched with that kind of lighting. The sound effects and music are very good and I love the way the actors and actresses sing.  . This movie has a great look, and that's a very good thing. The cinematography is very well done, and you get a nice sense of space. It feels like you're really there,

It is based on a book by the same name by James M. Cain.  The book was very popular in the 1960's.  And it is well written.  Caan and his partner, Frank B. Rourke, are a hardboiled detective duo.  They go into the dark world of organized crime and try to get to the bottom of a case of murder that is said to have taken place some years before.  In the course of their investigation they learn that there is a long standing feud between two different crime families.  It is in this conflict that the main characters become entangled.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ A very good movie that has a lot of heart. This movie has a great story and good characters. I enjoyed this movie a lot. This is a movie that will stay with me for a long time. __________   Plot: A woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and her son (Jacob Tremblay) decide to take a holiday to Mexico and they go to a vacation resort called the Lago, which is a large, luxurious resort. However, when the family arrive at the resort, they find out that a terrorist organization is threatening the resort and the resort's guests. As the terrorists try to kidnap a couple of the guests, the family decides to try to find out what is going on and what their guest will do if he is kidnapped. I would recommend this movie to a friend, especially if you like horror movies.   Production: This movie is made by a very talented director, Christopher Nolan. This director has a very good style, with the style of the movie being very dark and depressing. This horror movie has really good performances in it and they are great. There are a lot different and interesting places where the movie takes place and it will make you feel very uneasy when you are watching it. The movie is very well shot in it. This film has a special look that will make people think about the horror and it has a good atmosphere to it. I am really happy about this movie. This was a very entertaining movie and I recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies and horror movies in general.  , July 20, 2011

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  ______________   My review:   This movie is about a little boy who is a little girl's best friend. The boy is an only child and his parents are divorced. His father is a truck driver and his mother is an aspiring model. The father is very strict and the mother doesn't take care of her son at all. When the boy was born, his mother left and she never came back. The mother left the baby in the care of a foster mother, who is an older woman who was very sick and was going to die soon. She was not allowed to stay with the boy's father because she had a young daughter, and the father was a drug addict. The girl was very ill and the little boy would stay with her for a few days to nurse her back to health.   One day, the boy gets a letter from his mother and he's going to visit her at her foster home. The little boy and his foster mother go to the foster home and there is a party going on. The foster mother takes care of the boy for a day and then takes him back to his mother. The two women are very close and the two women have a lot of fun together.   the girl is so sick and weak that she can barely walk. When she gets home, she takes the little girl with her and tells the boy he can have his little girl. The young girl has a lot more energy and is a lot happier than she was when she was a sick child. The only problem is that her foster mother won't allow her to take her out and she doesn't know what to do. She just sits on the bed and cries and she has a horrible temper.   that is until the little man comes and takes care the girl. He takes her on the bus and they go on a journey and the man teaches her to smile and that everyone is nice to everyone else. The man takes the girl to the park and there are people that he is friends with. When they come back home, they find that the girl has gone crazy.  - - - -   The movie has an original idea and the way it is presented is excellent.

I've been waiting all week to see it and finally it was on Friday night and we went to a small theatre that has a decent selection of foreign films. I've never seen this in the UK before but I love it and would recommend this to anyone. The story takes place in the 70's in the beautiful, but corrupt, town of O'Hara in Ireland. The film is about two young women and their romance that begins when they go to a dance and is ruined by the fact that they get caught up in a local murder. They get together and escape, but when they get to the country, they find that the country has been taken over by a local gang of thugs and there is a plot to get the girls back. One of the best action films I've ever seen, the actors are great and the action is terrific. This is the best film in the O'Briens series.

You could really tell he loves being an action star and his action scenes are always great. I always thought he was a really good actor, but he can really do some really great stuff when he gets in a good situation. It's a pity that he's only in two films now." - Chris (L.A. fan)   "That was great! My first action movie. It had a good script and a really great action sequence." - Dwayne (LAC)  - - -   This is the first film from The Rock, and his first starring role. He plays a cop who goes undercover to help a drug kingpin. He is assigned to a gang of tough thugs known as The Bloods, who are on the run from the police. He quickly becomes a friend of the leader, Rico (Sylvester Stallone).   The Bloods are in search of an elusive drug called "The Hush." The leader of the gang, Vito Spatafore (Anthony Mackie), wants it for his own use. He wants to make a name for himself in the drug business and wants his men to do whatever it takes to get it. Spatafor, however, is more than willing to kill his men in order to protect his drug. This is what The Rock does in this film.   I have to say, I am impressed by The Rock's action skills. He was able to do a number of things in this movie. He had a great fight scene with Spatafort in which he kills him with a head butt, then takes a couple of shots from the mobster's guns. Then he uses a chair as a weapon. He also gets into a gunfight with the bad guy (Vito Spataford) in a bathroom where he is almost killed by a shower head. He uses a fire extinguisher on Spatafford's weapon to distract him, then shoots him several times. In this scene, the camera looks great and the actors all have a great time. The film also has some great fight choreography, and the music, although I was a bit disappointed, was actually pretty good.

This movie had many negative comments from many people who felt that it was a bad film and a terrible mistake to make. This film has the same kind of impact on people who have no idea of what happened at Waco. It is not a movie that will be watched by people who do not have a good knowledge of the truth.  The film, however well done, is not the story of the event itself. It was a film about the actions of a group of people that I do not believe were in a position to know the facts. They were led by a person that was clearly disturbed by what he had seen. I think it is a great tragedy that the event has never been properly researched and presented. It would have been so much better if the FBI had taken control of the situation and then the media had not interfered. I hope that a movie about the events of April 19, 1993 can come out someday.

Are you willing to sit there and listen to me for 5 hours a day for 20 years? If you are, I will never stop. My answer to you is no. I have never been in the position of being in the public eye. I only know what I saw and what I know from others who were there. -David Wilkerson

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a lot of fun, and for those who like a good old fashioned adventure story, it is definitely a must-see. I've seen a lot more action movies, and I've yet to see one that is more thrilling than this one.  The script is great, and the characters are well done. I'm not a big fan of the aliens, but for the most part, the movie is entertaining. The special effects are good enough, and a lot depends on how you want to see it.  I also enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.  The story is simple and the action is exciting, and it really doesn't get boring until the end.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I am not a huge horror movie fan. I just have seen a few in the theaters, but they have never really scared me, which is why I decided to check out this movie, and what a great movie it was! A very eerie, and creepy movie, but with a good story. The story is very good and you feel a lot of tension, but it's not overly scary, and not too disturbing, the scares are really good. I'm glad I watched this, because the movie was very well made, and very entertaining. The acting was good too. ---------------  Did you like this review?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a great one, and if you like the movie and the soundtrack it's a great movie to watch. The plot is interesting, and there are a lot of things to think about in the movie. This movie is about a guy that has been working as a "scuba instructor" for a long time, and then he has a wife, and he decides to go out to dive. But then, the boat he is on is attacked by pirates, and they are going to kill him. So, he does what any decent person would do. He goes to the harbor and asks to meet the captain of the ship, and this is the captain that was on the ship that was attacked. And they start talking about the attack. The captain is a great character, and it shows the true nature of the people that live on the island. The people are kind, and friendly, and that's what makes the movie so great. There are a couple of times when the movie gets a little heavy, but it's still good. The acting is amazing in this movie. I loved how the actors acted. There's some good actors in this film, and the actors are great. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year, and I'm glad I watched it. This movie is a little bit too dark for me, and even though it's not as dark as other movies in the genre, I still found myself a little uncomfortable. I would have liked it if the movie was more lighter. But overall, I would recommend this movie to any fan of the movie, because it has a lot to offer. I highly recommend this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jul 16, 2017 5:23 PM   Watch The Interview at IMDb.com      Loading...   Watch Trailer  The Interview has been in the headlines for weeks now, and the news cycle has moved on. But there's still a lot of talk about it and the implications of the movie and the hack. We'll go into a bit of the background to understand the events and why this movie matters.  Why The Interview Matters  When you think about a movie like this, it's easy to forget that this is the third or fourth time this story has been told. It's not like the movie was made for a whole new audience. But it's a very good movie, with a lot going for it. I loved the idea of it and it was surprising to me how it made me laugh and feel all kinds of emotions. It is a great movie, and it should be seen by everyone. And if it doesn't work out, I hope that this doesn't become the next Charlie Hebdo.  a lot. It was also a surprise to me that the movie didn't seem to be on the radar of a lot more people. The movie is funny and it had some real tension, which makes you want to know what will happen next. The film has some strong political messages and it doesn' t take itself too seriously. It doesn't pretend to be a serious movie, but it doesn''t need to be. I also thought the movie had some great performances and that it was a fun movie. A lot of people have talked about the movie being a political movie, about how North Korea and Sony are connected. I don't think it's the case at all. It just feels like a movie about a young guy who is in love with a woman, and he doesn't want her to go to South Korea. He thinks they are going to get into trouble if they go to North Korea, but she doesn't like him. I thought this was a very funny movie and it would have been great if Sony had done it on a much bigger scale. But they chose a small scale because of all the politics. They could have done a big movie and made more money.  of a movie, it wasn't a very big movie. I liked that it
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I really liked this movie. The story is a lot like the movie "Passion of the Christ", but this movie is better than the one. The movie was funny, a lot of the movie was like a scene from a movie. And it wasn't boring. The characters were really well-acted, and they all had different personalities. And I liked that they all felt different. For example, in one scene the girl who was in love with her husband (the father of her baby) was telling him that she will die. He doesn't understand her, so he tells her that she is crazy and that she won't die. Later on the father says to the mother that he understands what her mother was saying, and he also says that she didn't die when she said she would. They both understand each other, and it is nice to see that in a movie, not just in a TV series. The ending was really great, and the movie is very sad at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I know a lot of people will say the movie is overrated and overproduced. I don't see it that way at all. The movie's story and action is great, and it's a great action movie. The script is very well done, and the special effects are awesome. It's just a shame the film doesn't go into more depth about the characters. The film focuses on one villain and only one person, and I would have liked to see more about them. The action is awesome, and so are the special features. ____________.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   I went to see this movie at a local theater (we had a lot of fun watching it) and was very impressed with the acting and the story.   The characters were very well done and the plot was interesting.  -The main character was a little boy who has to go to the moon because his father is in space and can't come back. The moon is a very hostile place and there are lots of bad things in it. He's forced to make friends with a guy who is a little bit smarter than him. They must go out there and figure out how to get back home.   (I also enjoyed the fact that the movie had a very good ending. I was sad that the moon was destroyed. That would have made the ending much better.)   -I like the fact the movie didn't end with a happy ending. (It was very sad. I think the ending could have been made a little more optimistic.)   and ________   If you have a child, make sure he has this movie on video, especially if you have an older child.   and the ending:   This movie was so sad and sad it made me cry. It made me feel bad about the things that I have done.  , I think if you really want to make a child cry then don't give them a movie like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (The first two or three times I saw it, I couldn't help but think it was a re-make of a movie called, I believe, The Big Picture. I mean, that's the title. And, it was definitely not a retelling of that one, although it did follow that same theme. I know, it's a very different movie. But, it didn't seem like a movie that was made just for the sake of having a good story to tell. This movie was really made for one purpose and one purpose only - it was to make a good action movie. I'm not sure why a good, good action film, one that really took the action to a level that you just couldn't believe was possible, was ignored by the Hollywood establishment. But that's what happened. And this movie has been so poorly marketed by Paramount. The movie is basically a rehash of a previous movie called The Big Game. So, we're back in the world of the old Big Game, where a man is framed and framed and sent to prison for the murder of his wife and son. Now, we have a new villain named Charlie Chaplin who's been sent to Los Angeles and is the first to set out to get revenge on the man who framed him. This is a movie about a man who really has to find a way to get back into the game, even if he does have to get in it again, because that's where the money is. That's where he is going to be made into a movie star. The rest of the movie is a very, very good action picture. It's about a team of thieves that steals a bunch of valuable jewels, but then when they get caught, they try to take off with a whole lot more. There's a whole bunch of explosions, a whole couple of good action scenes. And I liked the fact that, while the movie was being made, it had the kind of "in between" quality that you can expect from a good old movie like The Big Score. There are all these little things going on that make it seem like it's really happening. And in fact, it is. The acting is good. The story is interesting. And it has the kind action picture feel to it that really makes it a memorable movie. It just goes on and on and it's like watching an action picture on a loop. It is one of those movies that people will remember for years and years to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ [SPOILERS AHEAD] The plot of this movie involves a man who is in prison and wants to get out to go see the world. The problem is that he is too sick to travel to see people and the people he meets are too sick for him to even approach. But, as he gets older, he starts to change and he begins to have a different kind of connection to the world that he has been so locked away from. The film also stars Susan Sarandon as a character that has a connection to this man and is his friend. The ending of the movie is very important because it shows that the man will make it out and be able to leave prison. So this is the last movie I saw by John Woo. It's very entertaining and I really enjoyed it. The last shot in the movie says it all: "It's over. You can't take it back. You won't forget it." The movie is a lot like another John Woo film, Hard Boiled. They both have a lot of action and are pretty good. They are also very different from each other. Hard Boil is a thriller, while this is more of a comedy. The movie also has a lot more character development and more humor. I thought this was a good John Woo movie that is worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. ____________. _______. ________________________.  1/5  So, I've seen a couple of bad reviews on this movie. And I'm not going to sit here and say that this movie is the worst movie ever made. It's definitely not. However, this movie doesn't do anything to make me laugh, cry, or get a smile on my face. This movie is a serious drama. That is to say, it is a film that does a good job telling its story, but doesn't make any big emotional impact. It doesn't have a good storyline. The characters are all in a bit of a state. The plot is pretty lame. The acting is pretty bad. There are only 3 different endings, and they're not all that good. There's one scene where a character gets knocked out, and wakes up a few minutes later. I was thinking, "What happened to that character?" That is one of the most boring and predictable endings to a movie I've ever seen. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the ending. And if you're into a story that doesn't give you any emotion, or a movie that makes you think, this is not the movie for you. If you like a good drama, then you will probably enjoy this movie more than I did. But if you are not a drama person, or are looking for a fun movie to watch with your buddies, then this is probably not the one for you! I can't recommend this movie highly enough. But for everyone else, I would advise you to watch something else. It just doesn't get a lot better than this movie!  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cabin in the Woods  is the movie that everyone needs to see if they want to see a good horror movie.  It is the best horror movie I have seen since the first one from George Romero.  It is not about zombies, or ghosts, or even creatures of the night.  It is about a family that is taken from their home and taken to a remote cabin.  In a very short time, they are faced with a mystery, a terrible truth that will drive them to madness.  The acting is fantastic.  All the actors are so good.  John Gallagher Jr. and Emma Roberts are fantastic. They are able to pull off all the different characters in the film very well.  They are all believable and you will be sorry to see them go.  Also, they really nailed the family dynamic.  There is a great chemistry between the parents and children.  You will see them arguing and having a hard time getting along.  However, when they finally do get along they are so strong.  One scene I like the best is when they get to the cabin. The mom is trying to keep the kids out of sight and the dad is freaking out.  He has to do something but he is a little weak.  This is the kind of movie you want to be around.   The only downside to the film is that the ending is a bit disappointing.  I know they were trying to end the story on a positive note, but it was a little too anticlimactic for me.  So, I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good family film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining is a movie that I have seen a few times since I was a child. It is the perfect film to have with a nice cup of coffee, with a book or a newspaper and some friends around. I think this movie would be good for a couple of days before watching something else. I would recommend this film to any of my friends. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful. This is a film I have only seen once, it is a very interesting movie, but I never got the feeling that I was watching a real story. The only thing that makes this a movie is the Kubrick. The movie is about a family that lives in a small house and have a small dog. They are a very nice family. But, as the movie goes on, it starts to reveal a different side of the family. There are a lot of clues that suggest that there is something wrong with this family. I really liked this movie, I recommend it to people who are looking for a movie to watch. The thing I liked the most about this movie is that it has so much symbolism and symbolism that is hidden in the story. If you have not watched the movie, you should. It was worth the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. And in case you've never seen it: _______. ____________. And if you haven't seen it either: ___________________.  The first time I saw this movie was when I was in high school, and it's the first film I remember watching that really got me.  I knew it was an old movie, but I was still impressed by the visuals, especially the gorgeous black and white cinematography.    __________________  My favorite movie of all time, and I know this might sound weird, but it's not The Shining.    My first viewing of the movie was in my high school cafeteria, and my mother said to me, "What is that movie?"    It was a movie called "The Muppet Movie", and my father said to him, "Oh, it's "The Shining".   My mother was so surprised that I was watching the Muppet movie that I told her, "I saw The Shining in highschool".  A couple of years later, I saw it in a theatre in Los Angeles, and that's when it hit me. I remember thinking "This is it! This is the movie I was waiting for my entire life."  In terms of plot, the movie follows the lives of two siblings: a younger brother, Jack, and his older sister, Wendy.  Jack's father has died, and he's sent off to live with his mother and brother, and Jack and Wendy are living together in a house owned by Jack's uncle.  The movie starts out pretty typical, with Jack and his brother going through the motions of life.  After Jack's brother dies, Jack starts to act more and more out of character, and begins to make odd decisions.  In a strange way, the characters in this movie are like real people, just with a twisted sense of humor and weird behavior.  However, it gets a bit more disturbing as the movie goes on, as the characters begin to act in strange ways.  For instance, one of the characters is so obsessed with his sister that he will do anything to get her attention, even at the cost of his own life.    The story is told through a diary that Wendy keeps in her bedroom, and in this diary, she keeps a record of her experiences in the world.  We are introduced to the characters through these diary entries, and they are a very odd

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I have to admit that I had never heard of The Lord of the Rings before this movie. When I heard the film, I was not expecting to like it. It did not look like a Tolkien movie. The acting was a bit strange, and the action was very slow and ponderous. I was surprised to see that the film was not a very good production. I didn't like the idea of the director and his wife making a film about Middle Earth. But when it was done, it was worth watching. The special effects were great. The sound was good. The dialogue was excellent. The story was a good one, and was not very difficult to follow. I think this is a good film for people who have never seen a Tolkien film. The movie is very good, but the special effects may not be enough for those who don't like fantasy movies. The action scenes were very good. This is a very enjoyable film. It may not appeal to everyone, but if you are a Tolkien fan, then it should satisfy your hunger.  _________________  A friend once said, "A good friend is one you don't have to explain why you love."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I was lucky enough to see this movie a few weeks ago at a theater near me, and I must say, it was the most impressive film I have seen in quite a while. It is truly a work of art, with an outstanding screenplay, terrific acting, and a fantastic cast. If you like good films with a sense of mystery, you are going to love this movie. And if you are not so into the idea of a man with a machine gun and a strange mask, you should not go into this movie with high expectations. This film is a masterpiece, and the ending is just so perfect that it will be a constant in my mind for the rest of my life. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys good mystery movies, and for the fans of the James Bond franchise. If only I could have seen it when it was first released, this would have been a masterpiece. Thank you Mr. Fleming, and thank you Mr Bond for creating a world in which this movie could be filmed. - February 14, 2010This movie was amazing  Reviewer: achilleedream - favorite favorite favorite - September 26, 2009  Subject: Great movie, but... Well I just found out about this movie last night and I am in love with it, I am a big Bond fan and I don't want to ruin my movie for myself but if you want to see a great Bond movie this is it, if you don't care about Bond and are looking for a good mystery movie and good acting then look elsewhere, but if your into 007 and have a sense for mystery then you will love this. - September26, 2009Great movie,  Rating: 4 stars   This is the best Bond movie of all time. Great performances, good plot, and some of the best special effects. This is a very good movie, and there are many people who don't like it, but it is definitely a good Bond movie. This movie really puts Bond in a new light and shows that even though he was an action hero he was also a good guy who loved his family and his work. This was the only James Bond movie that was filmed in Europe. I have been watching this movie in the United States and I love it.   A lot of people say that the plot was confusing. They say the movie is confusing because you don´t know where the good guy is. They also say that it is a slow movie and it is
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I had just moved to a new town and was trying to find a good local movie to watch with a group of friends. The last two movies we had seen were not bad, but I thought I had seen a couple of them. I was looking for a good family movie with good music and lots of action. I also wanted something that I could get a good laugh out of. I looked up this movie on the web and found out that it was good. So I decided to check it out. I thought it was going to be funny, but it was not funny at all. The only funny thing I saw was when a little girl asked the dog if he wanted to go to the store. The dog jumped out of his cage, and jumped over the fence, ran down the street, and made a run for the store! The dog did a lot of jumping and jumping in this movie, and I found that funny, and it made me laugh. The movie had lots of violence and the dog did bite a lot. The first half of the movie was good, but the second half was terrible. The ending of the film made me cry. The story was not interesting and the characters did not have any depth to them. It was just bad. So overall, I think this movie is not worth my time. I just don't see the point of watching this movie and I think I will not be watching this again.  Read more

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________________   "The most important thing to understand about the new millennium is that it's about to end, and we're living in the last days, where everything is about to change." - Neil Young  ______________________________________________________________   I first saw the film when it was released on VHS, and when I saw it again on DVD, I thought it was one of the best movies of all time, and it is. The film is about a man named "Papa" who lives in a town called Parma, which is in the middle of Italy. The town is ruled by an eccentric old woman named "Mama" who is a very religious lady who is constantly trying to get people to go to church and get saved, so she can take over the world. Papa is one of those people, and he is not really a religious man at all, but he is very good at following her advice and trying to be a good person.   The main thing that makes this film great is that every scene is written very well, with just the right amount of humor and emotion. The music is also very good, and the actors really bring out their personalities and their emotions very well. The story is so amazing that you can't help but to feel it, and every scene and character is very well developed.   the acting is so good in this film that it can't really be described. It's like every character has their own personality, and all of them are very well done. This movie has so many different scenes that are all very well written, and they are all so interesting.  ...  This movie is a masterpiece, and I recommend it to everyone. It is a great movie that will make you think, and make you laugh. It will make even your biggest critic of religious films, to watch it, if they want to see something more interesting than your typical Christian movie. The people who dislike religion are really going to love this movie. This film is a MUST see, and if you haven't seen it yet, you are really missing out on a lot of great films. This is a must see for any movie lover, because if you watch it and you think it's just a Christian movie, you're wrong, because this movie is about so much more than just Christianity. If you want to learn about human nature, you will learn a lot about yourself. This will make a great film to watch with your kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ The story, by the way, is the one of the best I've seen. It is set in a world where "magic" is real and the "druids" are the only ones who know how to use it. They live in a place where everything can be found and manipulated. The magic is in the land and in the nature, and there is only one druid, who is known as the "Master of the Earth" (and also known as "the Master of Life") and he can use it to change the course of life and death. The Druid's only weakness is that he is very old and the nature is not so much in his favor. In this world of magic, life is fragile and all things are controlled by the Master of the Land. So, when the Druid's old friend dies in a cave, the Master feels that it is his destiny to save him. When he comes across a young girl, the girl is very different than he is. In the beginning, she seems to be very kind and generous, but soon she is much more aggressive and cruel. The Master, who loves the girl, learns that she is actually a creature from another dimension. Her real name is Deneira, and she has been brought here to be the new Mistress of the land. Deneir's true purpose is to make the Master into a new kind of man, so that she can control him. She wants to see the world destroyed. The Druids and the Master, together, decide to fight this evil and defeat her. The film has a fantastic, mysterious feel to it. When you start the film, it seems to last forever. The story is so intricate that you can't help but to wonder what will happen. What's more, there are so many mysteries in this film that you have to go back and re-watch it several times to figure everything out. The music in the film is just as great as the film itself. The voice-over acting by Michael Palin was perfect and added to the mystery of the film. The ending is just beautiful. The characters in the movie are so great and have so much to live up to. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves good mystery films and is also a fan of John Carpenter.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What did I think of this movie: This was a good film that really was a part of a trilogy. It was well acted and the acting was good. The movie had a good story and really was an excellent movie. If you like the Alien series and want to see some of the best acting, this is a good choice. What didn't I like about this movie:"A" is for Aliens: I don't understand the alien in this movie. He just looks like a hairy ape with big black eyes. I know he is not a human but why he looks so ape-like. And I don´t like how the character has no real emotion. This is the worst thing about this film. I don`t understand why Ridley Scott did this. He was good at making me feel for the characters and at times he was great. This was not that case. The film was not bad but it didn't have a real story. It had a really good script but it was not interesting. The Alien was also not interesting and he was just a big hairy ape. I also don't know why they wanted to do this. What I really disliked about this story was that the director made us feel that this movie was about a real human being named Walter and he fell in a deep sleep and came back as an alien. But in the beginning, the aliens had not come to kill humans, they just came to get a sample of the DNA from the crew. They also thought that the crew was a secret base and they needed to get in to the base. They tried to get the crew but were not successful. The alien had come to get that DNA to create a better race for him to be. He thought that humans are weak and stupid and that is why he had to destroy them. But the real reason was because he didn't want to be alone and he wanted to have a family. When Walter was killed, he became the new Queen of the Aliens. Then, he was able to find the crew and to capture them. He took all of their crew and put them in his ship. When the crew realized what happened, they were able to kill him. When they did, they also killed his ship and all of his DNA. Now, he is dead and no more Alien. But because the aliens want to keep his DNA, they are going to put it into the Queen. This will make the aliens stronger and then, the Alien will come out and

I really enjoyed the story, the acting, and the humor of the characters.

It's a good time. And I'll just put it this way: it doesn't matter how well you think you know a movie, if you don't watch it and have a good laugh at some point, you don�t know anything about it. But this is a good film, a well-made movie. If you like good, funny movies, you will like this one." -B.G. on 8/30/04 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I like a good good time as much as the next person, but there are some films I simply cannot stomach. For me, none come close to the repulsive, tasteless, mindless, and uninspired movie that is: CRAWL. There is nothing entertaining about this movie. It is not funny, it is not entertaining, and it has no soul. This is a film made by a man who has no talent for acting and is more interested in trying to make a buck off the gullible public than he is in making a movie with a message. I was expecting to see a film with a more mature message, and I was not disappointed. It wasn't until I actually watched the film that I realized how much the director, Joe Mantegna, wanted to make money off this film. The only thing I remember about the film is that the film looks great in black and white. It looks great when you are watching it, but it doesn�t look so great when it is in color. The film is not only a gross waste of time and money, but I think it is also a disgrace to the entertainment industry. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary: Crawl is a disgusting piece of crap with nothing to do with art or even comedy. This film is a piece of cheap garbage that will only cause a laugh if you are really, really hungry.

"...The film is very well done. The acting was very good and the story was really cool. It is a very good movie." -Diane P. This is a good looking movie that really has a very cool western feel to it. There are some cool and interesting scenes and characters that are introduced in the beginning of the film and then quickly disappear. There is a real mystery that is revealed as the film progresses and a little bit of mystery is added to it in the final half. This is a movie that is very interesting and the best part of it is that it takes the best of both worlds, the mystery and the western feel and combines them into a really interesting film. The action scenes are very good, and you can tell that this is a film that was made for the fans of westerns. It definitely is a fan film and if you like westerns or are a fan of mystery and westerns, then you will definitely enjoy this film. There was not too much in the way of long sequences of dialogue that made the film a little too long, but they were still very good action sequences. It certainly is a fast paced movie, but the story is very enjoyable and if that is your thing then this is definitely a film for you. This film is definitely worth a watch and you will have a great time watching it. If you like the old west, you will enjoy this movie. If
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ If you have a good time with this movie then you must love movies and have fun with this one. The director and the writer are not known in the U.S. But they do have a lot of fans here in China. This movie is great!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Manda from Fun story about a couple of lovers. A good romance story with some funny parts. This is the sequel to a Chinese film called "Cupid" which was also made in 1996. So they should know how to make a good sequel. The story is pretty similar to the original. The main character, Wang Jun is an average guy with a bad heart who is trying to have a relationship with a girl called Zhao Jun who is beautiful and smart. Wang Jun goes to the U,S. to look for Zhao Jun but has no luck. The film is very entertaining and has a good plot. I love the fact that Wang Jun, the bad guy, is trying again and again to find the right girl and it makes the movie very funny. The movie has a lot to say about love, family, and love in general. I found the characters very likable. Although the Chinese characters were a little bit exaggerated but not bad. The only thing I didn't like in this movie is the "daddy" character. This character was just too much of a stereotypical father. It was just an old guy who only cared about his daughter. I was glad that I saw the movie in Chinese. This made the movie more understandable. It made me feel more at home in the movie. I also liked the song they used for the opening scene. I thought it was a nice song but it might not be suitable for kids. This was the only thing that was not good about this movie. Overall, a good Chinese romance with good laughs and good plot but not the best movie.  1 out of 1 found this review helpful. . Overall I liked the movie and enjoyed it quite a bit. The plot is good and the romance is interesting. I liked it and I am looking forward to the next movie. The ending was really funny. I am also interested in the other movies they have made. I know they are all sequels but I think they are better than the originals. The first one, "Crying to Love", was also good. It is not as good as the second one but still good.  to write a review.

We see the film crew filming the life of a small town in Maine. The towns people have a history of suicide. There is a boy that seems to be the only person in the town that doesn't want to kill himself. The boy and his mother have a long argument and she leaves the town. The young boy, Ben, tries to follow his mother and is seen by a stranger. The stranger, who turns out to be a local man, sees that Ben is in trouble, and asks the boy to take him and his son to the police station. Ben goes along with the stranger and the stranger has a small role in the movie. Ben gets the police to take the boy home, but then the police force turns on the stranger. We don't know the real identity of the stranger, but he was an interesting character. Ben ends up with his mother who tries to get him to talk about the night of the suicide. Ben tries to go to school and the principal won't let him. Ben starts to get bullied and he starts to cry. His mother is worried and asks her friend for help. The friend, who is a local teen, tells Ben that the person who killed his mother was a man that Ben saw in the woods. Ben and his friend then try to find out more about the man, who Ben finds out was a local high school student, who went to a nearby school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. I loved the fact that this movie was made before it was a hit on the big screen. It was actually a movie that I did not know much about when I watched it. I saw it because my son wanted to see it. It did not have the great cast that the great film had, but this movie had some great action scenes and some great songs. I enjoyed this film because it was made in a similar way that the movie made in the 70s. It really helped to make it a fun film to watch. The best part of the movie was the ending. It is something that I am going to remember for a long time. The movie was really good and it would be hard to find a better movie to watch right now. I would love to see the movie again because of the ending and because of what it brings back. If you like to see something new then give this movie a chance. It would be worth the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know if it's just me, but this movie is so great! The main character is soooo awesome! I loved how his story started off, but it's soo much more than that! The romance is great and the love story between the two main characters is really well done! They have a great relationship and it's a lot of fun! There are also some cool scenes of the other characters, and I loved all of them! And the action scenes are soo good! They are just a joy to watch! I can't say enough about this movie! It's amazing! If you haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it, it's really a good film. I recommend this movie to all ages!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  This movie was a great movie, especially for the movie fans who want to see the action scenes with the real fight scenes. And, there were a lot of real fight sequences. There were a number of cool scenes of the characters in the dark with their weapons. Also, there was a lot to see of the great action and of the fighting. This movie is very good, so much so that it is even the movie that is being mentioned to be the best action movie of the year.   This is a good action movie, that is a part of the franchise. There are lots of different fights, with different weapons, and lots of weapons, so you get to see a lot in this movie.   on the other hand, the movie had a lot too be seen in this genre of movie. It is a more mature action movie with a lot more scenes of sex, violence, and of course with lots of fighting. I guess, this movie is a great mix of action, and sex, and a lot on the sex scenes. The sex scenes were great, and I really enjoyed them. They were great scenes, and very well done. The story line was also very good. The movie also had a great ending, and the movie really ended well, too.   and there were many scenes of action and the real fighting scenes.     If you want a great action movie and want to watch lots of sex scenes, then this is the movie for you.  , as the movie is said by the movie makers, this is a "real-life" movie, and is a very good movie to watch. The action scenes are great and the fights are very well executed. I also enjoyed the sex scene scenes, the sex is very hot and very good action scenes. So, if you are a fan of the movie, you should definitely give this movie a chance.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I've never seen this movie but I think it is a good example of a great comedy. There are so many great jokes in this movie. The way the characters behave when there is a problem is hilarious. It was funny how the bad guy would think the best thing to do was to call his own bluff. The movie has a lot of good moments and even though the plot is a little confusing at times, I liked how it was played out. If you like to laugh at the worst of times, this is a movie you should see.

The story is good but there are some plot holes, I can see why people hate the movie. I liked the film though, I felt that there was a little too much action in this movie, I did not feel that there were enough comedy in this one. I think the story was just too fast paced, I could not enjoy this one too much. I was not sure if the movie was good, I really didn't think that it was that great. It has its own charm but I do not think that the film was good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather  (1972) The God of the Godfather (1971) and The Godfather Part II (1974) An unnamed nurse (The Godmother ) An old man (The Big Sleep ) This was the only one of the two films (and the first of the three to be directed by Francis Ford Coppola) to be nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards, but was only ever awarded the award for Best Original Screenplay.  It is considered to be the best of the series and one of the most entertaining films of the decade. A few tales that have been told are:  the story of Francisco Scaramanga who was the illegitimate son of the head of the family, The God of this series and the only one to survive the murder of his father.  The story is told by his son, Al Pacino.  He has a brother named "Manny" who is a "man of God" and who is also a member of the Mafia.  The plot is about a family that lives on a farm in a small town in California in the 1960's.  They live a normal life until their youngest son, Tony (played by Al Pacini) becomes a mob hit man.  A small town is a mob town, and as a hit man, Tony is sent on a mission to kill a federal marshal and the head of the Mafia.  Tony also gets involved in a relationship with a young, beautiful girl named Jane (played by Gloria Swanson) who he met on a motorcycle ride.  Jane is tempted by Tony but her family is involved in the mob and will kill her if Tony goes too far.  As a result, Jane falls in love with Tony and they eventually have a son named Manny who lives in the countryside.  When Manny is 12 years old, he and his family move to a town in the middle of nowhere called "Castle".  Tony and Jane have a very happy life, and are happy until a young woman, played by the great Gloria Swanson, falls in with Tony's family.  Gloria Swanson is the perfect actress and is an awesome mother.  She is also an amazing actress, and it was her role in the movie that first made me fall in love

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. This is the best movie about the first day of training in the Marine Corps I've seen. There's a lot of the Marine's training and drill, but there's also a lot about the guys and the wives and the kids and the fun they have. It has a lot to say about what it means to be a man. I'll add that the movie was shot during World War II so the men were in their basic training uniforms. I don't know how you can do this to a movie, but I do. I have a feeling this movie is going to become a classic. It's funny, it's intense, it makes you feel like you're in a war zone, and the characters are all believable. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you love the Marine movies or WWII movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The film I just finished is not a good film. It is not good at all. It does not live up to the hype it got. It's not a great film, but it is a decent film. There is not much plot. No big surprises. The acting is not great. There are no great performances. The film does not give the best performances either. The movie is full of cheesy one liners and dialog. The plot is really not that good either. I can see why people loved the film. People really wanted to see a film that they would like. They didn't want to see some crap movie with a big lead actor playing the hero. The actors played their part. I thought they were really great and I liked most of the actors in the film except for the lead actor. I really wanted the lead to be a great actor. But he just is not. He is a very average and mediocre actor. The rest of the cast was fine. I liked the cast. The actress played the lead pretty well. She was pretty good. There were a lot of great moments in the movie. There was a lot going on in this movie. It was a fun movie to watch. I think it would have been better if it was about a person and not a movie. The people in this film were so annoying and ridiculous. I had to put the movie down about two and a half hours in. It made me feel really stupid. I am going to see the movie again and I am just going to skip the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters is a fun, good-natured movie that has a fun plot and even a fun-funny, but it's all very goofy. This movie has a very simple premise. A group of kangaroos go on a rampage in an Australian outback, and the people of the town are not amused. As kangaroo and kangahoos run amok, they take over the local kangaros park, and in a series of bizarre antics, the people have to decide how to deal with them. The best parts of the movie are when the kangarahoos have a big fight with the local cops and a few kangaballahs. The kangaloo that is in charge of the cops has the best part of the film. He's the only character that looks and acts like a human, but that's what makes him funny. He is constantly on the edge of going crazy, and yet he doesn't seem to be. He has a lot of lines that are just so stupid, it makes you laugh. He also gets a lot better in the sequel. The only part that I don't think is funny is when the main character has to rescue a little kangara from the kambarok that is running loose in town. This scene is a little lame, but other than that, the movie has some great characters and has a great storyline.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ I have always enjoyed the original trilogy and this film is no exception. I think it is very well acted and the story is very interesting and well told. I love that they have made this film into a cartoon, which is very fitting. I also like the way the movie has been edited, as it has been a long time since I watched a cartoon film. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I had heard a lot of good things about this movie. So when I found out that it was based on the books I was pretty excited. The movie has a very old school feel to it, which suits me very well. The film starts out with a very strong opening scene. There is a scene of a man on the moon. He is in space and looking for something. Then the film cuts to a planet, which has a man in space looking for a woman who is a part of his mission. Then, the man gets into an accident, which causes him to go into a coma. The woman then finds the man and has a nice talk with him. She tells him that she is his wife and he needs to find out what happened to his mission before he dies. So she sends him to a ship where they go and he is met by a group of scientists. He asks for the name of the woman he is with and they tell him the name is Samantha. They are also told that they are going to the moon, which was the mission they were on. Then a very bad scene shows up. When the scientists go to the lunar surface, they are attacked by an alien race. The scene that shows up is very bad. There are too many shots of the aliens and the woman, that it makes it look like it is a really bad horror film. The next scene is where they are on the ship and they find out that they did not really get the mission, but instead they were sent there to capture an alien creature. Then they find a very interesting alien creature, which turns out to be a girl. She is a very beautiful alien girl who looks like she could be in the movies of the 70s and 80s. It is very strange to see her as a child. Then it turns out that she had a little baby alien who is called Kuu. She takes Kuu on board the ship to go to earth. They then go to Earth and are attacked again. The aliens then go into the ship again and kill the woman and Kuu,

This is the movie I want."  -Bette Davis   The Story: "The Sound of Music" (1943)  Bette Désir, the beautiful, rich daughter of a wealthy New York banker, is looking forward to a long and happy marriage. Her wedding is scheduled to take place in August, but after a series of unfortunate events, she finds herself suddenly back in her childhood home. She tries to keep her past a secret from her parents, but one night, in a tragic accident, her father dies. Bérénice Bejo, a talented actress, is hired to replace her. -From Wikipedia   What I Liked:  1) The music  This is one of my favorite musicals ever. There's a reason why it has been so widely regarded as the best musical of all time. This soundtrack was composed by the greatest composers of all-Hans Christian Anderson, Richard Rodgers, and Oscar Hammerstein II. Anderson had a huge influence on Rodgers, who became famous for his score for "Cabaret." This soundtrack is full of beautiful and emotional pieces that make this film the perfect movie to listen to on a rainy day. ....   2) The character development  I loved the main character, Bérenger Bejo. Her background as a ballet dancer is brought to life through her singing. She sings beautifully about the things she cares about. She's so different from her mother that I love her even more. The film's story is really one about growing up. The only reason I could find that this film doesn't have more Oscar wins is that it doesn't feel like a musical. If it did, I'm sure it would have been nominated for many more Oscars. ,,..  3) The beautiful cinematography  One of the best aspects of this film is its beautiful cinematography. The movie was shot in black and white, and the color and lighting are very beautiful. It gives the film an almost dreamlike feel.  (,,, )   4) The soundtrack  The soundtrack is an important part of the movie. You can listen to the music during the movie and it will enhance the movie a lot. The music of "The Song

I was 14 and I was so impressed that I watched it again. I thought it was a great movie and a good role model for young people. My daughter who is in high school now loves it too. It is a very good movie that will make you think. It's not perfect, but it's good. It doesn't have a whole lot going on in it but it is a good time. It has a lot of heart and it is so funny. The scene in the swimming pool is hilarious. It makes me laugh out loud. It had a great ending with the girl in the yellow shirt who was so cute. I like the movie. It was a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________________   I don't think I'm spoiling anything for you if you've seen this before, but I can't stop thinking about the way it plays out.   It's a very odd mix of science fiction and fantasy with the "evil" Dr. Doom and a female scientist trying to stop him, the "good" Dr Doom trying to win her back, and a villain who may or may not be an alien.   of course there are plenty of nods to other Marvel Comics heroes, the whole "the hammer was forged in the image of Thor's hammer" was a nice little nod to the Thor comics, and it was also a nice reference to the Hulk's origin. The whole movie felt like it had a lot of elements of "the other side" or "the gods" or whatever, but the real heroes of the story were the Asgardians, the people who built Asgard.  The best part of this movie for me was the acting, the movie was really good. You could tell that all of the cast really wanted to bring the character of Dr. Doom to life. In the end I think it all just came down to the script and directing. The writing was so good that it was hard to take anything away from it. The actors were great, and the movie could've been great if the director hadn't made so many decisions that made it hard to enjoy the movie.  , but it is very, very funny. It's not a very serious movie, and there are no real moments of emotional tension. It is all just action and explosions. But it has a lot going on, and you feel like the characters are real. Dr.Doom is an alien, he is in love with Dr.Strange, and he is also the ultimate supervillain, who has to be stopped at all costs. I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen it before, I think the trailer was very effective. It doesn't have the same charm as the original, but if you love science fiction, and like an eccentric scientist trying desperately to defeat his foe, then you should definitely check it out.

The movie itself has some very unique visual effects that really makes the movie stand out. I will say that the movie is a little slow at times. There are some times when the movie doesn't even have the suspenseful pace to it. There is one time where I thought it would be over in less than 5 minutes. But it never ends and there is still a great chase scene. The ending is really a surprise. It's really good and it really adds to the film. It really puts a smile on my face and I'm very happy I saw this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ If you have not seen the movie "Ip Man 3" yet, I highly recommend you to see it. The movie is a masterpiece and it has not been forgotten by its fans. The story is about a man named "Ik" who is not very fond of his name. He has to find a solution for his problems. He meets a woman called "Yun" and after they fall in love, they start to work on a movie. They go on a trip to a village and after that they move to a city to work in a movie studio. But after a while the film is over and they have to go back to the village. They do not find the answers that they are looking for. It is not a good ending for a great movie. But it is a movie that has great style. If you want a good action movie, this movie is for you. The action scenes are amazing. The special effects are amazing and the story is great. It has been made on a great budget and it shows in the movie. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves action movies.

The movie is based on a book by the same name by Robert Ludlum and directed by  Peter Jackson.   This movie was not a big hit when it was first released in 1997 but it has since become a cult favorite.  The film has won several awards including an Academy Award for Best Picture in 2003.  You are left with many questions, and some unanswered.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ A little after midnight, in the desolate parking lot of a deserted strip mall in a remote town, a mysterious girl enters the back of a truck with a gun. She takes a few steps toward a lone officer, then draws her gun and shoots him dead. The officer's name is Joe Buck. The film is "American Graffiti," directed by Richard Attenborough and based on a play by Bob Rafelson. It's a great film, but it has a few problems: 1) The film was not released in the U.S. until 1972. 2) The opening scene was filmed in an old, abandoned factory, in a state that doesn't recognize the film. 3) There is a big black smear on the side of the screen, as if someone tried to cover up some footage. The "American Girl" is played by a young girl in the first scene of the film, which is the only shot of her. The rest of the movie is shot from a distance. The girl's name was originally Linda Hamilton, but she changed her name to "American Girls" to avoid being accused of being an American Girl. The only other American Girl on the screen is a blonde who seems to be there just for the sake of a joke. But it doesn't matter. The movie is a very funny movie. It has some good jokes and some bad ones, but is mostly about the two people. The two people are a policeman (played by Joe Buck) and a prostitute (played very well by Susan Sarandon) who works for the policeman. The policeman is a bad man who does bad things. The prostitute is a good woman who is also a prostitute. Their love is the driving force of the story. The story revolves around the cop's love affair with Linda Hamilton (played with such good acting by Sarandon), who's father is a police chief. It also revolves around Buck and his love affair for Sarandon's character, who is played with such a great level of acting that she makes us believe that she's the real Linda Hamilton. It is a funny, exciting movie with a lot of action. I recommend it to everyone. It deserves to be seen. There is one very annoying thing about this movie: the name of the prostitute. She's called "American Women" in the film and "American Woman" in some other sources, but in this film the name is "Susan Sarandon." It's hard to tell if the name was changed

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  This is an interesting and entertaining film that has a lot of ideas, but it is not without its flaws.   The film starts off with a few shots of a strange man in a lab coat and a black lab coat that is not black. The man in the lab coat has a black mustache and wears a lab cap with a black beret. The lab coat man has a lab like head and looks very sinister. We then get a nice close up of a face and we see the eyes are not blue and they look green, and the mouth is not yellow. We get a closer look at the head of the man in lab coat, it is a small head with a very large nose, it looks like a frog's head. The woman in the room is not wearing a lab jacket, it just has a long coat on it. The doctor is looking at the woman, he looks like he is on drugs. The face of the doctor is a bit weird and the head looks a little off. We hear a strange voice over the intercom, it sounds like an old woman. The scene is very interesting, it has a dark side and a happy side to it.  .

The best movie about a bad guy: "I enjoyed this movie a lot because it is a good thriller that is also a good science fiction movie. I enjoyed the special features that are only on the disc. I also liked that it is more like a comic book than a movie. It is not like a film where it is only about the bad guys and there is no plot. It's a story about the good guys and they have to do a lot of things that make you wonder what the point is. I was very impressed with the film and recommend it to everyone who loves a good sci-fi movie and a good action movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________, __________, __________________, ___ __, __, _____ _________  I was surprised to see how good the story was. I am a big fan of the original "Star Trek" series, but I don't like the second film that much. So I was surprised that I liked this one as much as I did. I liked it so much I was glad that the actors were there and not just the voice actors. I enjoyed it. The only thing that I wish they had done differently was that the ship was a little smaller, maybe that would have been a little less of a challenge to design. Also I wish that they had added more action scenes, there was a lot of it in this one. But I guess that is why they made the sequel, that they could have a little more action. ___________, ____, ___, _______, _________________________, _________________________________________,  My Rating: ***** This is my review of "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope". I was so excited to see this movie when I saw it at the local theater in November of 1977. I was even more excited when the trailer came out. Now, it is nearly thirty years later, and I still can't get over how good this movie is. You know it's good when you see a woman dressed as a stormtrooper (I was really looking forward to that scene). This movie has a lot going on. You have a bunch of different groups in the Rebel Alliance, you have a Jedi master, and an Emperor (with an evil laugh). The best part of this movie, by far, is when Luke Skywalker finds a young Princess Leia, who is being held prisoner on the second Death Star. This is one of the best scenes in the whole movie, and it was very well done. I also liked the scene where the Emperor is being confronted by the Rebel fleet. It was really fun to see a whole fleet of ships attacking a massive battle station. But my favorite part was when the Imperial officers and men on the Death Star are confronted by a rebel commander. The Rebels are being attacked by a couple of X-wings, a TIE fighter, and a Star Destroyer, and they are in no position to fight back. The officers and soldiers try to talk the Rebels into surrender, but they have no interest in giving up. Then the Rebel commander speaks. And he gives a speech. This

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We don't have a good ending to this film, but that's the only thing that matters." 5. "Django Unchained" The best Django Unchained of the series. This is a great movie, and a great way to start the series with a great, fast paced, and intense action movie. Djinni's not the best actress in the world, but her performance is perfect in this film. She is able to pull off a great role, and get the character of Django pretty right. It's the same as with all of the other actors, she just has a different voice, and different ways of acting, and they are great in this movie. It takes a little while for her to find her voice, but once she does, it's fantastic. The character of Dom (the character she plays) is a bit of a rough around the edges character, but he is very sympathetic and has a lot of flaws, and he gets a lot right, as well. The only thing to complain about in this whole film, is the music in the beginning. The music is really really good, but the beginning music is kind of irritating. The only thing I can say is that this movie has some great action scenes, and it's the best way to show that. This movie is a little more intense and exciting, than the other two, and that's why it wins the top spot. 4. "Gone in 60 Seconds" Gone In 60 Seconds is a very good movie, but it is only one of the better movies in the series, and in my opinion, it isn't the best of the four. The story of the movie is very well done, and the movie has a good story line, but unfortunately, the movie doesn't hold up too well when the film is all together. The plot of the film goes on for a long time, and there are a lot to keep track of, and I have to give the movie credit for being able to get to the point of the story quickly, but they didn't do a great job of showing the events of the last 15 minutes. The ending is a big let down. The movie really could have done with a little bit of time, to make the ending of the whole story more solid. 5- "The Hateful Eight" This movie is the best movie in the whole series. I can't recommend this movie enough, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _________ __________  I liked this movie a lot, it was good and I liked the plot and the characters and the actors were great. I wish they would have done a little better with the ending though.  A good movie about the Vietnam War, which I really liked. The acting was great. The director is very good. I didn't mind the ending, but I did think the ending was a little rushed. I think they should have left the film as is and not do a special "Special Edition" which I thought was a poor idea. This was a good and fun movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Vietnam and war movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ [SPOILERS] This movie has a lot of good elements, but it's too much to handle. A lot of scenes are very predictable, and it doesn't really make sense what is going on at all. A bit too much is explained. It's a very strange and very disappointing movie. [SPEED] The movie was shot at very high speed. This is a very good feature because it allows you to see what is happening very fast. The story and characters are not well thought out, so the pace is very fast and sometimes it's very hard to follow. The camera is not very good at all, and sometimes the characters are so far away that they are not even noticeable. I really wish this movie would have been longer. [A BRIEF HISTORY] There are many different versions of the story. Some say it is based on a true story, and some say it's just a story of the author and his family. This movie is based in a small town in Florida, and the story is about a guy who is going to a party. At the party he meets a girl who turns out to be his cousin. They fall in love and start living together. The movie is very popular and has been re-released a few times. [AUDIENCE COMMENTS] I have seen this movie several times, and each time I've been disappointed. I always thought the characters were very flat, and didn't really have much to do with the movie. I don't know if this movie was written by the author, but I know it's been rereleased several times. It is a fun movie, and I enjoyed it a lot, but this is a bad movie.

It doesn't try to be "the next big thing," and doesn't go out of its way to be a big budget action movie. It's a fun little movie that never goes out of it's way to impress you, and in doing so, manages to make a great little movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ A few years ago, when I first saw it, I was a little disappointed by the "filler" part. I was hoping for something a little more than just "the good part." However, after the film was over, and the credits rolled, I felt like I'd just seen something special. The film is the work of legendary director Sergio Leone, and features such a well-known cast as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, John Cazale, James Cagney, and even some of the best known actresses of the day (such as Jane Fonda, Faye Dunaway, and Elizabeth Taylor). It is one of the most beautiful and disturbing movies of the 1960's. I'm not really sure where to begin with this movie. It is a film that is both a love story, and a crime drama. In this case, it is about a family of three that has come to the small town of Nuevo Laredo to escape a horrible fate. Their first stop is to get the family's youngest daughter, Isabelle, back to their home town in Mexico. As they arrive, the town is in the middle of a civil war, and Isabelle has gone missing. They are soon taken in by a corrupt local police officer, who is part of a criminal group called The Mob. The officer gives them a false lead and sets them up on a journey to find Isabelle. The movie begins with a man with a gun, and an evil smile, who tries to kill Joe Pesce (who plays the part of the corrupt policeman). The Mob leader's brother is the man with the gun, who was just trying to protect the brother. But, when the Mob leader is shot, he falls dead, and his brother is left alone. The mob leader is soon found dead, but not before he gave a warning to the family, and he also gives them some good advice. He tells them that there is a big reward for any information leading to the whereabouts of Isabelle (who is still missing). The movie ends with Joe Pesces (who has played such a big role in this movie) telling a story of how his father was a criminal. Joe Pescello (who, I must say, was one of my favorite movie characters of all time) was one time, a man who worked for the mob, and who had done so well that he had been able to buy his way out of prison (a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I was a little scared but I loved it. It's like a real war movie and I think it's really good." The following is a film review of a film I saw recently. The film, entitled " The Hunt for Red October " by Stephen Ambrose, is a documentary about the life of Russian submariners, who were captured by the Americans during the Second World War. The Americans were looking for the Russian submarine that sank an American battleship, and in the process, they captured several Russian sailors. The Russian prisoners were put into prison camps in the United States. The crew of the submarine " Red October" is released after six months and they return to the United Kingdom to find out what has happened to their ship. The documentary is extremely well made and you really feel as if you are there.  The film was made in the late 70's and early 80's, when Russia was at war with the Soviet Union. The story is told in a realistic way. The acting is excellent and the camerawork is wonderful. It is a great example of how to film a war story, especially one that involves prisoners.  " The Red October is a Russian submarine. It was built in 1948 and was commissioned by the Russian Navy. On February 26, 1950, the crew of this submarine went on an attack on a US destroyer that was anchored near the Russian coast. This was the first of a series of attacks on US warships, which lasted several months. On November 21, the US Navy announced that the submarine was sunk and all aboard killed. The Russians denied the charges. However, after a court martial, the officers of the crew were tried and sentenced to death for sinking a US warship. They were then released. After the war ended, the Russian government decided that the sunken submarine should be returned to Russia. The government of then President, Nikita Khrushchev, bought the submarine from the British. The submarine was renamed " Red Octopus " and became the basis for the film " The Hunted." "The Hunt for... Red October". The story begins with the crew getting a message from the captain, who says that the sub has been captured by an American submarine. The captain is then shot and taken to a prisoner of war camp. The sub captain is told that the American submarine will not return until the captain is found. The prisoners begin to search the submarine. Eventually, they find a dead Russian sailor on the deck. The prisoner

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________   I don't think this movie was as good as the trailers made it out to be. There was a lot of wasted potential here. I guess it would have been good if the story was better, but it's the same old "bad guy wins" story. I really liked this movie though, even though it wasn't as good. It's a good example of a guy with a great story.   This movie is about a young man who has no idea what he's getting himself into when he starts working for a rich oil man who plans to turn the area around his ranch into a huge oil field. He finds out what he wants to do after getting caught in a terrible accident, but the accident was actually a set up by the rich man to get him killed.  - The story of this movie is amazing, and a very good example how to write a story. You don't need much else. Just great characters and a great plot. The only thing I didn't like is that this movie had a very dark and depressing theme to it. It made the whole thing seem very "dark" and sad. It was hard for me to watch this movie at times.  .  I did like this movie. It wasn't great, but for a movie that's only 10 minutes long, it has a lot to offer. The characters were all interesting and the plot was intriguing. It had a great ending too.

The only way they can get a kick out of playing is to go around killing everyone that they see. And that's just what they do. They kill everyone in the town. And this is a movie about a bunch of kids who kill everyone. A little more plot, but that's all you need. It is a story about the loss of innocence and a buncha kids who are all killing each other. And the best part of this movie is the soundtrack."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ My first exposure to this film was when my mother bought a copy at the local movie store, and it had a picture of a very attractive, very young woman on the cover. I never knew the film was directed by Richard Brooks, and even less knew it was set in the 1930s, but I was thrilled to see the film. _______________ I was a big fan of the book, and I had read about it in many books that I've purchased. I am very glad that I finally saw it. ____________________ I was very happy that this film is a big success. ____________________________ I'm so glad that this was filmed. It's the kind of movie I would have loved to have seen, and the author has done a good job of capturing the essence of the time. ______________________________________ I just love this movie. The music is great, the acting is good, the story is interesting, and my favorite thing about the film is the fact that it's so realistic. _____________________________________________________________________________________ The book was fantastic and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The story is a bit different than most, but the story is still interesting and entertaining. The cinematography was pretty nice. I also enjoyed that they were trying to capture the feel of the time. I would have liked more time in the desert. But I guess that's the kind of thing that you expect in the 1920s.  The music was very good. It reminded me of the movies of the 1930s. I liked that they used music to enhance the story. This movie was a good time.  My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  I can honestly say I've seen a lot of movies and seen many that I liked. I'm not a big fan of sci-fi films or action/adventure films. I do enjoy the good old fashioned movie with a lot less CGI. I've never seen any of the James Bond movies and I never will. I thought the plot was interesting and the action was good. The story had a very interesting premise and a lot to work with. I wish I could have seen more of the world, it was just really cool. I'll admit I wasn't the biggest fan of the cast, they were all great. This was just an action film and it worked very well. I didn't get the feeling the director wanted to make a big statement with this one, but it was still a good action film. I enjoyed the ending of the movie, I guess I should give it that. I really like the movie. The best part is it ends on a cliffhanger. I will definitely be seeing more of this movie. __________________________  This is a great movie. It's set in a future where a group of scientists have made a new form of human-like robot. It was a fun and exciting movie to watch. The film doesn't overdo the CGI and the effects were great. I think it's one of the better James Bond films. This movie has a great story that makes it hard to find flaws. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys James Bond. It had some of the best fight scenes in a Bond film. __________________ , the first Bond film that featured a female lead, and that is pretty much all I need to say about this movie other than it is a classic. The plot is solid and the actors all did their part well. They even played out a very well thought out plan. I love Bond.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Catch Me If You Can" (1944) The first "real" western. The first western that had a western vibe. The only "real," true western.  This was a true western and had some real good action scenes. Â Â This is a great film for a western aficionado and for the first time in the genre, the story is very well told.  The story is simple.        A young man, Billy Black, and a cowgirl, Nellie, are traveling on the road in an old truck and have been drinking.  Then they run out of water.    They get back on the trail and see a beautiful young woman, Annie.  She is carrying a gun.  Billy has never seen a gun in his life and is not afraid of it.  He approaches Annie and tries to ask her for water. Annie asks Billy where he is from. Billy tells her about the outlaws.  They then go to the outlaw's house.  In there they find a woman named Sally.  Sally's husband has been killed and Sally has the child.  It is then that Billy's life changes for the better.  This is an excellent film and has some very good scenes. The music is good.  The score is great.  "Catch me if you can" was the first western and the most popular western film ever made.  When you watch this film you can imagine that you are watching a western. Movie Rank - 5/10 5/11
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cars  has a solid premise and an interesting cast.  It's a very simple movie and it works because of it.  It's just the beginning of the movie and this kid, who goes by "Brock", has a big crush on the new girl at school, Katie.  Brock wants to be the new guy but is a bit shy about being different.    It's an interesting twist on the dating scene in a high school, but it isn't the only one.  The plot also gets complicated as Brock gets involved with a new group of friends.  There's an entire high school full of people in the middle of the first grade who have their own problems and dreams.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might even grow a few extra tatts.     Cars isn't a great movie, but if you can find a way to enjoy it it'll be a great ride.  It may not be as deep as "The Notebook" but it's a funny, action packed, and well written movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A must see for all lovers of horror. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies and the suspense of it all. ___________  I loved the film. A great twist on the genre, and a great film overall. The cast is great as well, and I especially liked the fact that there was a female lead in the film, and it wasn't a token one. This was a horror movie that actually made me feel afraid, which I loved. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those who love horror movies, or just people who like good movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Towering Inferno" is a movie that I loved from the first scene. The film is full of action scenes that are spectacular and it will leave you breathless. The action scenes are choreographed with an incredible amount of attention to detail and it looks like there's a lot of work that went into them. It is also worth noting that there's some amazing special effects in this movie, which makes this movie a must see.  This movie is a fantasy that takes place in a fantasy world and it is really an amazing experience. This movie is also a must watch because it is a sequel to the movie that was released earlier, "Tower of God" which was a good film as well. This is a great movie that you need to watch.                                                               6.5/10

It has a lot of action and suspense. It is very well made. The characters are good and all the actions are well executed. The movie was really well done. I think this movie is great because of how the story was told. I like how the Lord of The Rings trilogy is told from the point of view of a hobbit. It gives us a perspective of this great character and gives us an understanding of how he thinks and what he does. The Lord Of The Rings is a fantastic movie and the Lord Of the Rings trilogy will always be a great movie. ___________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ I was going to go into this movie with the assumption that it was going be a remake of the popular film from the 80s and 90s, "A Nightmare on Elm Street". But the original was not a horror movie at all, in fact it was quite the opposite. I was really looking forward to seeing what the director of this movie was going for, and for the most part he delivered. The movie starts off with a little girl named Lucy getting abducted and taken to a haunted house. Once there she sees that she has been transformed into an old lady by some creatures that she meets inside the house. As the movie progresses we learn that the house has been haunted by some of the most dangerous and powerful spirits that exist, such as vampires, werewolves, and even the dead. The only way out is to fight your way out. Once Lucy makes her way out of the house she realizes that she is the only one that can beat these creatures. Unfortunately she does not realize that there are other creatures lurking in the house, and she soon finds herself in a battle with them as well. The characters in this movie are all very well-rounded. I would not say that the lead character is the strongest, but her character development throughout the movie is very well done. Lucy has many problems that she faces in this film, such is the nature of the story and the creatures that are in this house. She is also very brave, which helps her to overcome her many problems. In the end Lucy wins her battle with the monsters and saves the world. This is a good, well-made movie with a lot of heart and a lot to learn about what it means to be a hero. A great movie to watch for Halloween and Halloween parties.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The Good: _____________________ The film is excellent. This is the kind of film that can make you a believer. It was well done and very funny. It really is a shame that they didn't go into more depth with the characters. They were so perfect that I couldn't believe they were only in this film for 5 minutes. I would love to see more from this film. The Bad: _________ The bad thing about this film is that it feels too good. It doesn't let you feel anything that isn't a good thing. The whole thing just feels like a nice dream you can go back to every night. It is a bit of a mess as well. The story is very confusing, but the ending was a nice surprise. The ending is just what I expected and that is very good. The music was also a bit annoying. The cinematography was good and the special effects are pretty good. I was very surprised how many similarities there were between this film and "The Big Lebowski" - just not in terms of characters. The movie is worth a watch, but it would be better if it was a lot longer. _______________________________________________ What I thought of this movie: - The story of this film was very good, but I found it confusing and confusing at the same time. - The characters were very well done. - This was a great dream and I would have liked to see them go deeper with their lives. - It was a little confusing and had a bad ending. - There were a lot of similarities to "The Lebensborn" - not the characters, but in terms how the characters ended up. - I found the music too annoying. - A lot of people I knew from school thought this was a "dream" and didn't understand it. - "The Great Escape" is a better movie. - Why did the director do this? This is a very nice movie that was ruined by its director. I found this film to be a dream that was better than "The Thing". - The music is great. - If I had to compare this film with another, I would say "The Shining".
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ [The film is a love story between two young people who are trying to escape the problems of their city. The film takes place in their neighborhood. The movie has many good lines and good scenes but the ending is a disappointment. The ending is all about the ending of the film. The two characters are trying so hard to escape. I was really sad when the characters got caught up in the movie. I really like the idea of two young men trying to do something to get away from their problems. However the ending just made me so angry. It made me want to rip the film apart. And that's not something that can be done with a film. This movie just didn't do it for me. It was too happy and too happy. I will not be watching this film again. It just didn´t do it anymore for me.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438300/review)
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ I really like this movie. I think the film itself is good. It's very good in many ways. The film doesn't waste time and doesn't try to explain anything that you don't need to know in order to enjoy it. It takes the viewer on a wonderful ride. It was very well made and the story is very original. There were some good acting performances from some of the actors in the film. One of the best characters was played by Peter Falk. The scenes where he is interacting with the girl and the other characters are very funny and it was very original in its humor. I thought that it was a good, fun movie. _________________________________________________________________________________ This movie was also made for the first time and it looks great. It also is good in its use of sound. The music is really good in this movie and it's a good watch. I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to everyone who loves a good ride. I give this movie a 3 out of 4 stars. ______________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dax from A really fun movie! This movie is great. I like the characters and the plot is pretty good. You can tell that the director did a good job making the movie. The only problem is that there's a lot of repetition and it can be a little annoying at times. The ending is pretty neat. Overall a great movie.

This was the main plot line for the movie, and is pretty much what this movie is about. This movie has all of the action, gore, and sex you would expect from a vampire movie. It also has some of the more realistic vampire movies that I have ever seen. This film had some of my favorite scenes in the movie. I loved the scene where the vampire is on a date with the girl that he has been chasing, and they are in a restaurant with the table around them. The waitress is trying to flirt with him and is looking at him all sexy. It is just so fun to watch this movie.   I was really impressed with this movie as well.

I enjoyed all of my favorites from the movie including the sex scenes, and I think that this movie was a great way to end the movie on a high note.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  You need to add some context in this review. It's a documentary about a woman who was a member of a band called The Cramps. The documentary was about the early years of the band and her rise to fame and fortune as a solo artist. The movie tells the story of her life in depth and it shows the amazing times she had. It shows her love and care for her family and her dedication to being a successful musician. This movie really captures the essence of a woman. She really did care about the fans that were interested in her and was not only an amazing musician but a great wife. Her life and her music were about something much bigger than herself. The film is not all about her but more about the music itself. She was very talented and had many great moments. There are some scenes that you will really enjoy watching. The song selection is pretty good. I think it's the same songs that were in the original version of this film but it does a good job at capturing the spirit of the song and not just the original.  Helpful it would have been much better if it had a bit more of an emotional connection with the viewer.  the documentary was great. the only thing i disliked was that there were a few scenes with a lot of people in the band. The people that were involved in the movie had a lot to say and i felt like the filmmakers didn't have time to really get into that aspect of the movie. It felt like they wanted to be able to tell a good story but they were just not there to do it. - July 1, 2017great documentary

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Gatsby is a great film.  I've been waiting to see it since I was in my teens.    The Great Gershwin is great and the song, "My Funny Valentine," is wonderful.  I am a fan of movies where the hero is an ex-con.  The protagonist is a man who is an old-school detective.  This movie takes a lot of the best elements of a great detective story and applies them to a young man trying to break into the big time.  He does a lot right, but there are some mistakes.  It is hard to think that a movie about a man and his problems can be so great.  However, it is also hard to look at this movie and say, "Well, there is a lot wrong with it."   Gatsby, the movie My friends, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read.  Gatsbys are very rich and famous people live in a town called Gatsburg.  There are a lot things I like about the movie.  One of the things I love is the way the camera follows the two leads.  They really look like they are doing it for the cameras.  I love the fact that they really are doing their job.  These two guys are in a world of their own.  When they go to see Gatsman, a famous millionaire, for some favors, Gats man's assistant, is very nice.  She does not make a move on him until she realizes he is rich and wants to have a little fun.  Another part of the movie that I liked was the way Gats gets a job as a waiter.  For some reason, I really liked the way he got his job.   Gats has a lot to do and I thought he was very professional.  Unfortunately, some of his friends are not very good.  Some of the friends have to be removed from the movie, but they have the best part of a scene together.  A great part of this movie is the fact there is some action going on in the background.  In addition, the director did a great job of editing the movie together. My Favorite Scenes in The Great Waltz The movie has a good mix of emotions.  While it is an entertaining movie, I am not sure that it is a perfect movie. There are some things I wish I would have

It has a good story and is worth watching. _________________________  Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 stars  Review by: A.G.D. on June 18, 2017 :  A movie that should be made into a series. Great performances by the cast and story is well written. I enjoyed the movie and it has a bit of mystery to it that I liked. It's not your standard popcorn movie but that's part of the fun. I can't say I'm a big fan of horror movies but I'm glad to see some of the classics are being brought back and are made better than ever. It also has a nice ending and a bit more closure to the story than some of these newer movies. A must see for anyone who has been waiting for a good horror movie in recent years. ______________________________________________  Final Rating: 5 out of 10  _______________________________________________  Comment on this movie:  I think this movie is really good and I was hoping to see it made into an actual series. I thought it was really good. The actors are really good in this movie and the director did a good job with the story and the character development. I really hope the series gets made. I hope the story continues and that they have a good cast to work with. This movie has a great ending. _________________  of the movie: I thought the movie was really cool.

It had a great mystery to go along with it. It was a bit too short. I would have liked to have seen a bit longer with some more of the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I think that this movie is a good example of how to create an engaging story and an emotional journey. It's not a perfect movie, but it is an entertaining and very emotional one. It also shows how hard it is to make a movie that has so much emotion, and a good acting and story. There are some moments where the story takes a bit of a twist, but the ending is well-written and well-acted. The story has some good twists and some great moments, and it does a great job of telling the story, the emotions and the twists, and I really liked how they used the flashbacks to help give the movie more depth. I really loved the ending and the emotions. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story, and good acting, and has a good imagination."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ [P] [B] [R] [S] [H] [A] [C] [U] [K] [E] [L] [O] [T] [G] [D] [N] [I] [PH] The first thing you notice about the movie is that the name "Alien" is the only word that does not appear in the credits. I guess that the producers and writers had too much respect for their work to go by a title like "The Alien." The movie starts off with a long shot of a ship going through space, and then a shot of some type of monster, then a close-up of the face of the monster, and the first person view of the creature as it attacks the crew on the ship. The creature then comes closer and closer, and a closeup of a human arm being cut off. The crew is cut down to pieces, and when the ship reaches a new planet, a large, red light appears. This is the ship's last breath. A ship that has traveled through space to a new world. That is the premise of this movie. The alien is the thing that has caused the death of the crew of the Nostromo. And this is all made up by the movie's writer, Dan O'Bannon, a sci-fi fan from California. He also is the creator of the film "Star Wars." O'Brien has a hard time writing the script for the movie, so he just makes up the story and goes to the studio and asks for money. The studio gives him money, but not until he has shot it. He makes a rough cut, and they ask him if he wants to do another take. O'Brian tells them that he has to do it, because they had given him a budget of $2.5 million dollars. The second time he shot, the movie was finished in two days. The third time, it took him four weeks to shoot the movie. O'damann is upset that his work is not being paid properly, and he leaves. He goes back to his house, and starts to play around with some guns. He starts making some primitive homemade weapons. One night, he comes across a machine gun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The Phantom is one of my favorite movies and is a great action film. I think it was great to see a film in this genre and not have it look and feel like a film about some sort of conspiracy. I'm also a fan of the way that director John McTiernan brings the film to life with the use of very unique camera work and camerawork that is used for the action scenes. _________________  -JERRY

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Haunting in Connecticut"  is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.  It is a masterful film that has been compared to "The Exorcist", "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "A Tale of Two Sisters", among others.  "The haunting in Connecticut", directed by  William Friedkin, is about a family that has to cope with a series of disturbing incidents.   The story is told through the eyes of a boy named Jake, a 12-year-old boy who lives in a small town called East Haven.  This is the town where the story begins.  The boy is the only one who notices the weird things happening in his small town.  When a girl who was playing at a nearby field falls down, Jake finds her dead.  There are other strange happenings, as well, that seem to indicate that something strange is going on.  In order to find out what is going down, the boy enlists the help of his best friend, Joe, to accompany him to the local high school.  Jake, Joe and the other two boys head to the high school, only to find that it is on a lockdown.  It is later revealed that the school is also on lockdown. Jake finds out that he must sneak in to the school and get a copy of a test for the English class.  However, as Jake and Joe are walking in the school, they are attacked by a ghost that tries to kill them.  As Jake tries to help Joe escape the ghost, he finds that the ghost has a gun in its hand.  He pulls the trigger, but it doesn't kill the ghost.  Instead, it paralyzes it.  But Joe is still scared by the ghost and the boy decides that they must get rid of it.   At first, the boys try to get rid the ghost by throwing things at it.  But it doesn�t work.  Then, Jake and the boys head into the basement and begin to play hide-and-seek with the ghost while the boy is paralyzed.  Once Joe is able to disarm the ghost's gun, he tells Jake to shoot it. This only helps the boy get rid off the ghost once and for all.  "The Hiding in Connecticut is a great movie, a great story, and a great horror movie.  William Friedkkin really makes the film and makes you fall in love with

The theatre has the usual "tickets" of popcorn, popcorn buckets and of course the popcorn buckets. They have a large screen in the front of the theatre and the popcorn is going to be ready by the time you get to the theatre so that you can sit down and enjoy the show. Well the show did not disappoint. The music was great and I really enjoyed the movie. My favourite part was the movie "the movie" because I loved the movie and the music in the movie was great. The movie was just a good time and was fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ _____________  1.4 - The film was quite entertaining but the dialogue and acting were very amateurish. The whole movie is shot on a handheld camera and most of the film is shot in a small room, with a lot of back and forth, which can be quite annoying. But it is quite funny. The script is quite amusing as well. I enjoyed the ending quite a bit, which had me laughing out loud at times. The ending left me a bit unsatisfied, as the film didn't quite come out the way I would have liked.  The film is worth a look if you are looking for something to do. , 2.5 stars  _____________________________________________________________ _________  3.5 - This was a decent movie. I would say it is worth watching. The film is well acted and has good dialogue. There were a few things that didn't seem like they were supposed to be there but that's just how this is made. There is also a nice, simple plot. The plot is quite interesting and does get quite confusing at times but it is very entertaining to watch. The music was very good. I like the film and the music is good enough to make it worth watching even if you don't like the plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ It is a really great movie, even if I do not agree with all the aspects of it. I really liked the way the movie was edited, with the whole story being presented in the first hour or two, then showing the changes from the first film to the sequel, and then ending with the final film. The story was very well done, and it shows the characters' growth. The actors did a good job and I thought they did a great job in portraying the characters. I liked the music, and the sound effects were excellent. The special effects were also very good. I also liked the ending. I think the ending was a bit strange, but that was my only problem with it. It is still a great movie to watch, and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and action movies. I have seen this movie many times, but I still enjoyed it and loved the story. It was a great adventure, and one I will look for again in the future.

Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale's scripts have been written in a way that leaves no loose ends. The movie has a lot of action, but the movie never feels like it is in a constant chase. The character interactions are very interesting and real.   The movie also has a very dark, but very real atmosphere that is almost like a nightmare. The entire movie is an intense experience that I could watch over and over and never get tired of. This movie is very intense, and is not easy to watch.  , with so many aspects, it is difficult to pick one of the main characters that stand out. This is because the movie is so complex. The plot twists are quite unpredictable and it's hard to keep up with. The action is not very impressive, but I suppose that is understandable considering the movie was made on a low budget.   I really loved the movie. It was a great experience and was a very well written movie. The performances of Christian Bale and Heath Ledgers are top notch. The acting in this movie is fantastic and the direction is outstanding. This would be a great movie to watch with someone who has never seen the movies before. The story is very well told and there is a lot going on. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good thriller with a dark atmosphere.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ ______________ ____________ _______________  This is a great movie and is worth watching if you are looking for a nice watch. The story is about a man who has lost his mind and his wife, a widow who is now a madame. She hires a prostitute to seduce a man, who goes into a rage when he finds out that the prostitute is a woman. After the rage dies down, the man and the prostitute go on a date, but the man is still mad about the woman. When he realizes that the woman has a penis and is going to perform with it, he becomes insane and kills his wife. The woman has become a madam and uses the woman to perform in various shows, and the man also goes to see her. She is now his wife and he is still in love with her. The movie is not as good as the first one, but it is still very good and is definitely worth watching. I give it 4 stars because of the originality of the story, but I give 3 stars because the ending is a little abrupt. ________ ___________ __________ ________ ______ ________  A very disturbing and disturbing movie that makes you think, especially for a person who is not a big fan of horror movies. The main character is a man that is now in a mental hospital after killing his wife a few years ago. The man has become insane and has killed more than 10 people in the past and now wants revenge. This movie is one of the creepiest and most disturbing movies ever made. The only thing that can keep you from being disturbed by this movie is the fact that it is an original story that has not been made before. It is also very hard to watch, because of all the violence that goes on in this movie. It's very disturbing to watch and it makes you feel very bad for the people who are killed in this film. The plot is very twisted and very well written and the acting is great as well. This is a really good movie that you should not miss. ____________________ ______________________ ______________________________ ___________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   In the early 1980s, in a city not too far from my hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, there was a small but very active local group of film collectors. These people were interested in all aspects of cinema history and culture and were avidly collecting as many rare, obscure, and out-of-print film prints as they could find.   The two main groups of film-collectors were:   1. The "cinephiles" (or "film nerds") who loved film history and were passionate about the medium.   ist the 1980s and the '90s, the interest in film began to wane. However, by the mid 1990s, there were a few people that were still very much in love with film. This group consisted of film enthusiasts who wanted to share their passion with others. These enthusiasts also believed that film could still be made great again. In 1993, they started a film club, a monthly meeting for film lovers. In this club, they gathered all of the old film prints, video tapes, and VHS tapes they could get their hands on. It was a fun way to share the passion with other film enthusiasts. They also created a newsletter to keep in touch with each other and to educate people about the past.   the film club is still alive and it is called the Minnesota Film Society. This film society is comprised of people who are dedicated to film history, film preservation, and film appreciation. It has over 100 members who share a common interest. The MNFS members are a diverse group, but we all have a common love of film.   a small, but very special film society dedicated to promoting the love of movie and film history. We are an active group that meets monthly. We have many rare and out of print film prints and video tapes. We also have a library of over 30,000 films. We organize a film festival every two years, and in 2018 we held the Minnesota International Film Festival in St. Paul, Minnesota.   in the mid-1990s, a film collector named Robert Stovall and his wife Joanna started the MNFS and started a monthly film club. This club became very popular and started to attract more and more members. Joanna's great friend and colleague, Karen O'Connor, became a member of the MNF as well. Karen is a film scholar and has published many articles about film history in the Minnesota Historical Society journal. She also

There's a lot of stuff going on, but the story is not so much the main reason to watch this movie. It's more about the characters and the performances. And I think it has more action and adventure than I thought it would have. But if you're into the '90s then you will enjoy it.

It explores the heart and the soul of what it means to be a victim. The movie also has a strong and powerful message about the abuse that is still going on in our society.

There is a reason why these guys have a bad reputation, and they are very well done.  They are all well written.  It is fun to watch these characters and see the transformation they go through.    The movie is great, and you will have a good time watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I had no clue what I was in for with this film. I don't think I had even heard of "The Hateful Eight" before the film opened, but I have since become a big fan of it. I am not going to review the film in a critical way as there are only a handful of reviews that have been written on it (most have been highly critical of the film), so this review will only be a review of the movie itself. There are a few things about the film that I thought were cool, but as I said before I was not sure what to expect. The film starts out with a scene that I think is pretty cool, which is a scene where a group of characters go out to a bar and a guy comes in and asks a woman for a dance. He is a little drunk and is not sure how to dance and she just dances with him. I think this is a great scene to show a character learning something new and then moving on with their life. Then the next scene takes place in the snow. This is where the film takes place. It was pretty cold, especially the first couple of scenes. The snow is pretty dark, and you can see the snow and stars in the sky. This also shows that this is going to be a really harsh, brutal film, as you can imagine it is winter. There is also a lot of snow, and it gets very dark. I was glad that the snow was dark, because it made the snow look realistic, and I don`t know if that was intentional or not, but it was a nice touch. The next scene starts off with a guy walking around the town, and he comes across a group who are drinking, and they are all holding a shotgun. He talks to them, and gets their opinion on the town they live in. The main character then walks up to the bar and gets a drink. He walks up behind one of the guys who has a shotgun, and takes the shotgun from him. He tells him that he knows the town and he can take it from him if he wants to. Then he walks up into a house, and talks to the man inside. The man is the town sheriff, and tells him about the murders in the town. The sheriff is very angry and tries to shoot the man. The gun goes off and the man is killed, but the sheriff shoots himself instead. Then we see a scene with a man who is on his way

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ My Rating: ***** *1 out of ***** The plot is very similar to the original Star Wars Trilogy. The only difference is that it is set a generation after the events of The Empire Strikes Back. The new film is called Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and is directed by the same guy who brought us A New Hope, George Lucas. The main character, Anakin Skywalker is the son of the man who killed his parents on Tatooine. After he loses his parents, he goes through a series of trials and eventually becomes a Jedi. There is a long sequence in the film that shows his transformation from being a boy to a man and the Jedi Order is formed. I am really looking forward to seeing this film. The soundtrack is amazing and I am a huge fan of the music in the original trilogy. I'm not a huge sci-fi fan but I am interested to see how the movie is different and the movie does a great job at keeping the mystery and wonder of the original. This movie is worth watching and is a great prequel to the trilogy. It is not the same as The Empire Strikes Back but it is definitely worth checking out. The story was better in my opinion.

It's not the best action movie ever made, but it's not bad either. The action in the movie is very good, and the movie gets better as it goes on. The movie also has a great ending. ************* This movie is a good horror movie. It is well acted, it does a good job of setting up the scares, and there is a lot to enjoy about it. The first few times I saw this movie, I found it to be too much like a horror movie, and I was not a fan of it at all. But after seeing it again, I thought the movie had some really interesting ideas about the afterlife. I am still not a big fan of this movie but I like to watch it a few times a year, just for the fun of it. This movie would be worth seeing for fans of the genre, as well as those who are just interested in a good scare. I will give it a 9/10.  RATING: 5 out of 10

It really makes it look like a story, and not just a movie. It makes you feel like you know what's going on. There is just a bit of mystery to the whole thing. I can see the movie having many more laughs than it does crying. I think that a lot of the people who are crying were probably too young to have ever seen anything like this. This movie does a good job of making you think about it. It was a nice way to pass the time in a long flight and just to relax.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________, "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is an astonishingly good movie. The movie is a classic and you can feel the whole movie in your stomach. This movie is made by a director who has created movies with a similar tone. It has all the ingredients to become a classic: suspense, tension, comedy, mystery, action, and of course, music. "The Great Gatsby" was also a movie with all these ingredients and also a classic. It is also a very well-made movie with a very good story and some great performances. This is not a movie that you can watch once and forget about it, but it is one that you have to watch many times. I recommend this movie to everyone who has a great imagination. This film has everything to be the best film of the century and is also the greatest film of all time.

I felt it was the best movie of the season and probably the best comedy of the year. The characters were funny and relatable.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My rating: _______________ Starring: _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ I didn't see this movie until this year and it has been on my radar for quite a while. It is a very well-done film and is full of good performances and excellent special effects. The movie is about a man named Dr. Alan Landon (played by Richard Gere) who is trying to cure his cancer with the use of a "miracle cure" that he got from a woman named Mary. The film follows Landon through a series of events that lead him to believe that Mary has been using a drug called "Molly" that is supposedly capable of curing him of his cancer. The plot of the movie is good and it is good that this movie comes in at a much lower price than a number of other "cures" on the market. It doesn't have a big star-power in it but the movie does have great acting and a very good plot. The special effects in this movie are also excellent. There are some things in the movie that seem to be taken from real life and you can tell they really went to great lengths to make sure that the movie worked. The whole thing is very well acted and I loved it. I am a fan of Richard Geren and this movie gives him another opportunity to show off his acting talents. This movie is really worth checking out.  Rated 5 out of 5 by TheTurtle from This movie was so good I had to watch it again! The movie itself is fantastic! I think the film is not only well-made, but it is very funny as well. I can't wait for the sequel. The character Alan Latchan is so convincing. The story has great suspense and I didn`t get the feeling that the characters were out of their depth. The actors are excellent. The director, Tim Burton, is a master of his craft. The production values are very high. I loved the special effects that were used in this film. I love how they took the concept of a cure for cancer and made it even more realistic. I could not believe how real the costumes were. I really wish this movie came out earlier.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie a lot. It was good, but it wasn't perfect. It had some flaws. It wasn't like it was written by the best writer, but he was very good. It didn't have a plot, but you knew what was going to happen. The character were not very interesting, but I guess that is to be expected in a movie like this. It would be better if the characters were written better, but in the end it wasn�t too bad. I think it was a good time. It�s a bit old, but that's what happens in movies like this sometimes. I would watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the case of  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, the story and character development is so good, it almost makes you forget about the movie itself.  I loved the whole concept of the hotel and the characters and plot.  The story takes place over three days in the French countryside in the 1960s.  It was a real nice idea and the movie has some great character development as well as some terrific suspense.  Even if I was not a fan of the movie I still recommend it.  There is some great action scenes and some very interesting characters.  Great movie. 4 out of 5 stars Posted by Lina at 8:23 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________ What a great movie. I've seen it twice, and I love it even more the second time around. I can't imagine a better villain than the bad guy in this movie. It's not just a bad guy, he's a villain with a sense of justice and a sense that he has to be the bad one. The bad guy is really scary and he plays the role very well. He was a real presence in the movie. He is not just the bad guys, but he is a real person and you see that. This movie has a great plot, and the actors are great, the directing was great and the soundtrack is great. I recommend this movie to all people who love movies, and to all who hate movies, to watch this movie, it's great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   It is my personal favorite movie of all time. The whole thing is awesome.   And it is awesome from start to finish.   is a wonderful story about a young man who is going through some bad times, but also a young girl who is trying to find a job and is a bit lost.   and it has a great ending.  - The movie is a simple one, but it is worth watching. The actors are good, the music is good, and the story is good. It is very unique and original. I was really surprised how much I liked the ending. - The movie had a few bad points, but I never felt like it was a bad movie, it is just a little bit long. - Some of the characters are not the best, and there are some very bad scenes in the movie. but it was the main characters that really made the movie so great. - I really like the song in the end. - it is a very well made movie.   of course it is very important to note that this movie has a strong religious message, but at the same time it is not really preachy. There is a lot of humor in the film, and this movie really has a lot to say. The movie also has some very powerful themes. I do believe that this is a good and good movie, and I do recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I've never been a big fan of the Star Wars series, but I love the films they made with George Lucas. They did a fine job, and made the best of the story and characters. I'll admit, the first movie is a little cheesy, but then again, so are a lot of action movies of the time. The second and third are good, with good performances from the cast and good pacing. The fourth is pretty bad. There's nothing good about it. It's a total drag, with a cheesy plot, a cheesy ending, and some terrible acting. The fifth is good. It has a great, well-acted villain. The sixth and seventh are okay. The last one is just terrible. It makes no sense and it's just a bad, boring movie. This one, as a whole, is just a disappointment. I've always felt that the Star wars universe is the greatest, but this is one of the worst Star Wars movies, and probably one of my favorite ones, in terms of writing and acting. I really wish the people who made this had been able to make a good film, instead of making this. If they had made a good Star Wars film, this could have been great. If you're a Star Wars fan, you have to give this a pass. It sucks. - April 29, 2006This is a complete rip-off of Return of the Jedi!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* This movie is really good! ********** The best thing in the movie is the ending, it was a surprise! ***************************  The best thing about this movie is that there is no sex, the main character is only in love with the man she is having a relationship with and he only wants to be in a relationship to be with her, she is not looking for sex, she just wants to have a relationship. The movie is great because it is about love and how the person who is in love feels and what happens in a good relationship. If you are looking for a movie about a man in love or just in love in general, this is the movie for you. ********************  I have not seen the movie "Hook" but I have seen it on tv and it is a great movie about the love between a man and a woman. It is a movie where you feel what is going on in the relationship and what the woman is feeling. The whole movie is like this. It gives a nice feel of what the man and the woman feel when they have sex and everything about their relationship is really great. This movie was not very well made but I still love it! *************** The movie "I Don't Have to Live Alone" was made for the television series "I Hate Myself and I Want to Die". This movie focuses on the love triangle between a college student, her best friend and a guy she has a crush on. This is the best movie about love I have ever seen! --------------------------  This movie is about a relationship between a woman, her boyfriend and her best girlfriend. This story about a girl who loves her boyfriend so much, that she would give up everything for him and for her boyfriend. This makes me laugh every time. I don't have to live alone and I want to die for this girl! ---------------  Might be a movie that you don't want to see if you don' want to get married. It has some sexual situations but it is not that interesting. It's a good story about the girl's love life. The main character was very nice, and the movie was very cute and cute and I loved it. -------------  A very good movie about two women who are in love. It was very romantic and really good. ---------------

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a great movie.  I enjoyed it as a kid, and then watched it again as an adult.  The "Bad" and "Very Bad" Review:   A movie that should be on every kid's list of all time is The Land Before Time.  If you were a kid in the 80s, you saw it in the theater, or you watched it on television.  The movie was so amazing.   It was so special that it made you want to see it again and again.  So you went to the movies, and that's when you started to see things that were never shown on television before.  That's when they showed that there were things in the past that weren't just in the stories that were told.  They showed us the things that happened before we were born.  And we were amazed at the things they showed.  Because we were watching this movie at a time when there were so many movies being made about the past, but we still wanted to know what happened before our time.  There were so much stories that weren' t told. And the people in this movie told so many stories.  I'm sure that the movie was a big hit at the time because it was so different.  We just didn't know what to make of it.  It wasn't the type of movie that was shown in the movie theaters.  But, in my opinion, it should be seen by every child and adults who want to learn about history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _________________  5 stars for originality and story   5 star for interesting story  ....   3.5 stars   I will give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars as the characters are interesting and interesting characters make a great movie. I will also give the actors a 4 star rating because I feel like they could have done a better job.   The story has a very interesting twist ending, and is very interesting. The movie had a very good plot line and I felt that it was really well written. I liked that the story was very well developed and had a good twist ending. I also liked the way that the movie kept me guessing until the very end.   (I was also impressed that the author decided to write a sequel, which I am still wondering why he never wrote a third book. That is what I thought after reading this movie).   One thing I did not like about the movie was that I felt like the director did not make enough use of the film's location. There was a lot of action scenes that were not shot in the actual location of the movie.   the location was beautiful in the movie but I do not think that the locations in this movie were enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The Man from U.N.C.L.E.   I saw this movie on a Friday night in 1983, and it was an unmitigated disaster. I don't even remember why it had been included in the list of "top ten worst movies ever made" on Rotten Tomatoes. The cast was very good (I never remember seeing anyone else besides Donald Sutherland on screen), but the director was incompetent. The movie is not a horror film. It's an American film that takes place in a Nazi camp. The camp commander is a psychopath. There is a lot of blood, and some of it looks quite realistic. This is one of those movies that will leave you in shock, and you won't be able to watch it again for quite a while. It was a very poor film, and was one of the last things I saw on video before I finally decided to watch the Criterion release.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "A classic in every sense of the word. A great movie. One of the most intelligent and beautiful movies ever made.

It is a joy to watch and an important movie. Don't miss it." - George D. Smith "This is one of the greatest movies ever. This is a beautiful movie and a masterpiece. You should see it. If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you to do so. It's a great movie." - Gary Gershman "It's a masterpiece of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I just saw this movie, and it was really great! It was good, but not the best, just a great movie that I enjoyed. I have seen so many movies like this in the past, but they just didn't get me. But this time, it was different. I loved the characters and the story, and I thought it was a great way to get into the life of a couple that has a kid that is autistic. And the director of this movie was so good, it really made me want to watch the rest of the movie, I would definitely recommend this movie.  I just saw This movie, but it was great! I really enjoyed it, it had a really good story and it got me into the story and characters. I thought that the character that was autistic was really interesting. The best thing that this movie did was show that autism isn't a disability, but a gift that you have to accept. It shows that autism can help you and that you should embrace it. The only thing that I would change was that they should have shown the autistic kid in a school, that way the audience could relate to him better. It's also a shame that the movie didn't show that the parents didn't understand autism, and they should've seen a therapist. It could have made the movie much better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I liked this movie so much that when I saw the movie's plot I knew I had to see it again. It is one of those films where you're rooting for the main characters. There was a moment when the villain was holding up a huge tank. I thought to myself, "Wow, that's the main villain's tank. Why is he holding it up?" Then, I looked at the tank and realized, "Oh, that is the main character's tank." And then the movie took a turn for the worse and I lost interest. I had been waiting all movie to see what happened to him and I just wanted to see if he would survive. And I saw a couple of flashbacks and I thought, "He will die." I am glad I saw this movie again because I had the exact same thought about it.  But, I was also relieved that the movie ended well. I hope they do a sequel because I don't want to be reminded of this movie." What I like about this movie: "This movie has a lot of great fight scenes. I love the scene in the beginning when the tank blows up. It was a great way to start the movie." "I thought the film had a great storyline with all the characters and what they were going through. The way they did the flashback scenes was really great. They were very effective.  What didn't I like: "I didn't like the movie for the same reasons I didn't love it the first time. The main villain was just a bad guy and not the main hero. I wanted him to be the main protagonist. I was glad that the villain didn't get what he wanted, because I was disappointed in that. He had a good reason to blow up the tank." "When I watched the movie the first two times, I thought that the main guy was the bad guy. But the third time, I really liked the main bad guy." "This was a good idea and it had potential. It just didn't work out. " Overall:  "I love this movie. I think it was good for a movie that had all the elements that make a good action film."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What I love most about this movie is how it captures the essence of a good, true, American family movie. The kids and the mom are all working together, and it really shows that family relationships really do grow and thrive even if your parents are not on speaking terms. The movie is about a young girl's dreams of becoming a police officer. She's a very intelligent girl who knows how to get a job, how to act, and how to be a good cop. She also has a sister who wants to become a police sergeant. The parents are just trying to raise a good kid, and they are trying to do so in a house full of chaos and dysfunction. The mother is a really good mom who tries to teach the kids to be good, but she can't help her husband and kids from becoming so dysfunctional. The father is a bit of a dick, but he's trying his best. The film shows how a family can get along for a while, but as the kids grow up, it becomes harder and harder to find a way to work together. It's really a great family movie that I would recommend to people who want to see a good family movie, but also want to watch a good action movie. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________   The most obvious flaw with this film is that the plot, while well executed, was pretty dull and not much more. But what really makes this movie bad is that this movie does not even try to be original. The plot is very simple. The young girl, whose name is Maria (Ruth Negga), has a friend named Max (Aaron Johnson). Max is an American who is visiting Germany, and he falls in love with Maria, and decides to move to Germany. He tells her that they will have to leave soon, but that he will stay to help her. And that is the plot of this movie. The problem is that it just doesn't work. The story feels like it is trying to be too complex. There are so many unanswered questions about this movie that are not answered. Maria, the main character, never actually knows if she is a Nazi spy, a CIA agent, a KGB agent, or a Nazi who has been brainwashed. Her father, the CIA agent (Michael Stuhlbarg), is supposed to be her protector, but he never comes back to her. The German people, she is told, are all in on the war effort, and are ready to die for the Germans. Her friend, Max, is a complete bastard. He wants to see the war through to the end, even if it means being a Nazi, but his girlfriend, Maria, is more of a romantic. He is so jealous of her that he has an affair with a German woman (Eva Green). She is a spy working for the Americans, and Max is the CIA man who is supposed protect her. Max never does anything for Maria, never tries to help, but she loves him anyway. The Americans are so worried about the Germans that they are willing to do whatever it takes to keep them out of power. The only way they can do this is by making Max the German's new lover. But when he starts to fall in love, Maria realizes what is happening, and tries to stop him, but the CIA people won't let her, and Maria ends up becoming a spy herself. Maria's boyfriend, Max's father (Michael Clarke Duncan), is also a spy, working for another group. When he is trying get to the truth about what really happened, he ends up being captured by the Germans, who kill his daughter, then have Max killed. The last thing this movie tries to do is make you hate the Germans and the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ It's just that: a good film. It's an entertaining film that, even after the first 15 minutes, still doesn't give me the feeling that I am watching something of the highest quality. It is not bad at all. It has a good cast, a great story and even a little romance. It all works, and the director has a lot of fun in this. I can say that the ending was a little abrupt and a little disappointing, but then, it's not the usual way. In the end, it does not leave me disappointed. _________ So, what's the point? Why did I say that I liked it? Well, because it has an interesting story. The characters are interesting and the film has a certain feel about it. It also has a bit of a mystery about it and this is what keeps it interesting. And finally, there's a bit more of a romance. And I'm talking about the romance between a couple who have known each other for years. There is a lot more to this movie, than just the plot. And this is the way it should be. It could have been a bit longer, but there are only so many scenes to tell a story and there are also other films to watch in this genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You're Next" is a terrific action flick with a solid story that manages to be entertaining and engaging for a lot of time. The characters are well written, with a lot going on and the script keeps things moving along. The action scenes are quite good and well choreographed, which is what the director wanted. The best action scenes in the film are the ones that feature Chris Hemsworth as Nick Stokes, an ex-military police officer that's been turned into a zombie, and the zombies he's fighting. The zombie sequences are intense, and are great fun to watch. The movie doesn't have a lot to offer other than a good action movie, and that's pretty much what you should expect from the film. The acting in the movie is excellent and the action sequences are very well choregraphed, making "You're-Next" a lot better than it first appears.

A strong lead performance by Robert Duvall. A very good performance by Peter Lorre.  I have heard many good reviews for this movie and I don't think I'm going to get a bad review. I'm not a fan of horror movies, but I liked this movie. The only negative I have is that I think that this movie is just too long. It was really too long for me to get my heart pumping. I was hoping that it would end in a way that would make the audience go "Oh wow!" but it didn't. It wasn't long enough to make you feel that you could just stop and let it play out. There are some really good parts in this movie but not enough to save it. There is a great scene at the end of the movie where a man is shot and dies but you don't know who killed him. It just wasn't enough to pull you out of it. It's really a shame.  and now for my rating: *****  RATING: ****  *I will be reviewing a film that is not a horror film. ,  This movie was released in 1971 and stars Robert DuVall and Peter LorRE.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ The Last Stand is a film that takes you to a time and place where guns are very, very powerful. I don't know if it was the setting or the fact that it is the end of the Vietnam War but it is definitely a film about a man who has just survived a near-fatal shooting at close range. He goes back to Vietnam to try and figure out what happened and why his buddies got killed and he finds that things are very different there. The story is about a young man who had been a soldier in Vietnam and was later awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart after he survived a close encounter in a village. It's a film where the camera moves from one place to another as the story moves along. The camera moves into a bunker as the man tells the story and the camera goes out to the front line where he tells the whole story in a few different ways. The film is a little short at 2 1/2 hours but it's not bad. It has a nice score and the cinematography is very good. It was released in the early 1970s and it looks very good today. __________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   I was at a bar a few years ago, having a drink with a friend and some other patrons. We were chatting about a movie that I hadn't seen yet. One of the guys asked me to rate it. I did. I really liked it, even though it had a lot of flaws. I told him I had a few more and he said, "Well, this is good."   My friend's reply was, "He said this was good." I was a bit annoyed at his answer, but at the time, I thought I understood his point. "He's just trying to be nice." I didn't know what to say.   It took me a few days to realize that he wasn't trying to make me feel better. He was trying to teach me something. I guess I'd always assumed that when he said a movie was good, he meant it was a good film. But now, he was telling me the movie was really good. I didn not understand what he meant.  ...   Fast forward a few months. I'm at a friends house with a few of his friends and one of the girls asked me, "So how was the movie?"   .. "What movie?" I asked.   in a slightly embarrassed tone. "I've never seen it."   the girl replied.   This conversation continued until one of my friends mentioned it.  -Yeah, I know that, but it was so good that it got me hooked.  , the movie went. I went into the theater and paid for it. When it was over, I asked the girl what she thought of it. She said it was pretty good, but she didn't like the ending.   the film ended and she said "Well what did you think?"   of course I said, well it was good.   is that it?   No. I said "It was really, really good." She said, 'What movie was that?' I told her "I don't know. I've never been to that movie."   I asked her if she remembered seeing it. "Yes, but I don't remember seeing that ending."  , I was really confused. I was sure that she meant the ending, but what was she talking about? Was she talking to me?

There are a few characters, but they are all one-dimensional. I feel like there is no story. Just some people who are in a small town and they do not like each other. It is just an excuse for them to be mean to each other and then kill each other off in a few short scenes.  I would recommend watching this movie if you want to watch a quick film before bed with a little comedy. :)

This is a film about a man who is in love with his wife, who is sick. She wants to be married, he doesn't, and he decides to get a divorce. The reason is because he doesn' t want to leave her in pain, and wants to protect her from her illness. The movie is very interesting, it shows a man's struggle to be a good husband, and a good father, without abandoning his wife. I also liked the way that the film was filmed. The lighting in this movie was great, and the film has an incredible soundtrack, and great acting. It is also very entertaining. It really shows a different side to a man that has an affair. This film was very good and I highly recommend it.

(1st paragraph)   This movie should have been titled "When a young guy refuses to be called a hero." - June 01, 2008Hiss,  Rated 5 out of 5 by T-gw from An excellent movie about a true war story This movie is very well done and it provides an insight into a true story of a real war with a real impact on those who have been involved in it. It is not for everyone as it deals with the horrors of war and has some very graphic scenes. The movie starts with the young guy refusing to be named a hero when he refuses to have his face on TV for a television show, which the TV station has been advertising. Then he goes to a hospital and his name is called out in the waiting room. Then a TV camera is in the room and the young man is filmed and has a picture taken. Then the doctor calls him in and asks if he is the man who is being photographed. He is. The doctor then asks the young men if they were wounded in the war and if they want to be taken to a war memorial to give their story. He asks for a pen and a pencil and gives him a pen. He then writes out a letter to his mother in which he says he is a hero. The doctors then ask him to write out his story in his own words. After he does this, he is told that he is going to go

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* ************* ******** ******** ***** This was a really great movie. The action scenes are great and the plot is awesome. If you like action movies, you will love this. The only problem I have with the movie is that it is a little too long and there is not enough action to go around. Also the ending is not what I expected and the ending was kinda weird. I was really hoping for a sequel. But it is worth watching. You will love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (review of a good flick) (review or recommendation of a very good movie) (a positive review of a bad movie) I think I'd better give this a "good movie" rating as it's a fun film that really has you laughing out loud. It's a bit cheesy but fun. The plot is very silly but the actors are great. The acting is very solid and they really do play the roles really well. The characters are also very well-written. The only problem I found with the movie was that there was way too much action scenes and the last 20 minutes of the movie are just a little too silly. The final scenes were too much and didn't really fit the rest of the film. The film really ends on a really good note and that's really what counts for a good comedy. The end credits roll and there's some more footage from the movie. It seems like the actors and director wanted to show that the movie ended on a good note. The movie does have a bit of a "tearjerker" type ending. There's a really cool and funny ending scene that will have you laughing for hours. It would have been a great ending to a good film. Overall a fun movie that I thought was a great addition to my DVD collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film is a fantastic example of a story told in three acts. In the first act, you see a group of friends, mostly teenagers, who have come together in an attempt to win the prize money from the annual local beauty contest. In this first act we see a good deal of action with the group of kids, as they go through a series of contests. In a scene that I was particularly fond of, the group goes through a mud hole in a local lake. They must swim across the lake and back with the aid of a plank. This scene was one of the most intense scenes I have ever seen on film, with a wonderful sense of realism, and I must admit that I enjoyed it." -J.P. Rating: 4.5 stars, with one star for lack of editing and an unimpressive final scene. The most outstanding feature of this movie is the incredible sense of humor. It is clear that the filmmakers had a lot of fun with this film. As you can tell by the title, the boys have been trying to win a beauty contest, but this was never going to be easy. When they do manage to win, they go on a wild ride through a variety of activities and challenges. This movie is a classic and I hope it will get a new release. It would be nice to see it on VHS as the DVD version is a little slow to get to the good stuff. This movie was shot on location in North Carolina and was made in 1975. It has a very good soundtrack and it is one of those movies that you can watch with the kids and the adults will both enjoy it. The plot is a fun, action packed, story about three kids who get a chance to win $1,000 in the local beauty pageant. It takes place in a small town in North-Carolina and is one for the kids to watch with an adult. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Posted by Joe at 7:22 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** The movie is based on a book by a great author named Peter Benchley. This is one of my favorite movies and I was really impressed by the acting. A great performance by Kevin Costner, a great performance from the director. The book is a very good book, but this movie is just too good, the writing is good, and the movie itself is just so good. I would highly recommend this movie and I would love to see a movie based on this book. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in the book.

It took a while to get to know the characters and how they all interacted with each other. The main character was very likable and the love interest was well developed. The acting was well done. The ending was very satisfying. It had all the elements needed to be a classic. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I don't think it needed to happen. It just didn't make sense.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________   I have seen this movie twice, first in a theater and then again in a private home. The first time I was just mesmerized by the action. The action was great, the acting was great. This is an action movie that will satisfy your desire to see some of the world's most brutal and extreme action movies. The second time I saw this I didn't care for the ending and I felt that the movie lost its way at the end.   A lot of people complain that the action was not realistic. They were right. But what makes a realistic action movie? I don't know if this movie would be realistic if it had not been filmed in a real prison. The acting is very good.   is a great movie, but I don�t feel it was worth the price of admission.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   This is one of the best movies about the war ever made.   As a viewer I don't have much to say, but it was a good film, I just wish I had seen it when I was younger. The fact that it was shot on location in Europe is pretty cool. It has a good pace to it, and the acting is good, and I always loved watching WWII films.   the film is set during the early part of the war, and it shows how the Allies are able to take a few small towns without any losses. They are then attacked by German troops who seem to have some sort of special weapon.   "And when we see that German weapon, we say: It's a bomb!"   The film is told by the soldiers as they get to know each other, and see how different they are. It is a great film, and a very good way to understand the war.   is about the experience of two brothers, Charlie and Charles, who both serve in the US Army during the war and they are separated because of the actions of the German Army. Charlie is a sergeant, who is trying to find his brother, who he was supposed to be looking for. He then goes on a mission to find him. He and his brother have been living together since they were both teenagers. They have no idea what will happen, or what their future holds. They eventually find each other again.     It was a very strong film. The story was interesting and the actors were great. I especially loved the way they portrayed the Germans. They were real, and believable. Charlie even said in a few scenes: "I'm going to kill a man for the first time!"  , and his friend just replied: "Yes you are!"  - Rating: ****1/2 *****   I think it is a very unique movie, it was very well done and I liked it. It's also a good example of how WWII is depicted in movies. The main characters have no choice in the matter and the war is portrayed very realistically. It was also good to see how the actors and their characters became friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I watched this film in a theater, which was good. It was a very good movie, but it did not feel like a horror movie, it felt like a movie that had some suspense, some mystery, some characters that you didn't want to hate. The ending was very good. But I still felt that there were some bad things in this movie, especially with the character of the little boy. I mean, he was a little boy who looked like a doll, but he really was a real boy. His mother was a bit of a bitch, and I don't know how you can love a mother who can't feed her own child. I was not too much impressed with the way the mother did not eat, and how she had to be fed. I guess that it was better to be a monster than a child. But it was very interesting to see a woman eat someone, you know? But I didn't think that she was a horrible woman. She was just an evil woman, but I was a child, so I could not judge her, and she was just a mother, and so I didn`t know how to feel about her. So, the character that I liked was the little girl. The rest of the movie I didn\'t like very much, but the ending was good, and the movie had good scares. So if you like horror movies, I think this is a good one, but you need to watch it with a good adult.

We had a little movie called "Superman Returns" and the "Star Wars" prequels and now this. This was my first real trip to the cinema and I loved it. This is a great movie. It's a great film, full of fun and adventure, with a great score and the best character performances I have seen on film. I loved the way this film was made. I think it's a little dark and very funny. I love the way the special effects look and the fact that they use real cameras, which I never thought would happen on film again. I would watch this film again in a heartbeat. It was great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a perfect movie, but it's the one that most of us want to see.  In a world where the good guys always win, this movie is a reminder of what's really happening in the real world. _________________________________________________________ The last two movies I saw, The Martian  and Gravity, were absolutely fantastic movies.    Both were really well made and had great acting and acting talent.  I can't really say that about this movie.  It's just a good, boring movie. This movie isn't that bad.  The movie isn a little bit slow, but not too slow.  At times it's like the movie tries to be a lot of different things but just ends up going back to being a movie. I think this movie could have been better if it didn't have to keep going back and forth between the two planets.  Also, the ending is really confusing.  However, the movie is great.  There's a lot going on in this movie that I really liked.  In a way, the main character is the same as in the book.  She's the only character that seems to care about people.  As for the movie itself, I didn't really like it.  While I was watching the movie, I was like "what was that?  Why are they doing that?"  It just wasn't that good.  Overall, this was a pretty good movie and it's a shame that it was so bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. You have to be pretty good at making a positive movie to pull that off.  What you need to do is make a good story and get a great actor to play it. But the real trick is that he has to be believable, and not too many actors have been able to pull off believable. ...  And so the movie gets going, with a great scene where the old lady is telling the young guy about her old home, where she used to live with her parents, where her mother and her father used to sing and play piano together. The old lady says that this is the last house she will ever live in. And the young man, who is in love with the girl, decides to go and live with the old folks for a while.  of all of the people you'd expect, she has to go to a house where she's never been before, and it will be like her old world, but he'll be there to make it a little bit more exciting.. But he is so stupid, that it will only make the old ladies even more upset, and he'll end up running away. But, by then, the girl is waiting for him, and she tells him that he can stay as long as he likes. , because they were a good couple, they decided to stay with the house. And this scene was a wonderful one, because the old couple were such a good, they even let the girl live with them. And that is how it is in the movie: they are together, and everything goes right for them, but at the end, when they finally get married, the old woman dies. The girl, who has already lost all of her parents and all of his parents, is still waiting for his return. The guy has no idea what to do, so he leaves for a few months, and then, when he comes back, he thinks it's a good idea to go back to the house where they had lived. He thinks that the old people are dead, and they are not, so the old house will still be there. But he has been to this house so many times, and this time, it is gone. So he goes back to that house, and that's the beginning of the movie. And the old guys, who had loved this girl, are so happy, that they have nothing to say. They were all happy to have found a good home, but
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. (This movie has a lot of heart.) It's not a perfect movie, but it's a good one. A lot of the time, I thought it was a movie for teenagers, but as an adult, I really like it. I can't help but think that the characters are all different and unique. There are so many emotions in this movie, so much love. I feel like I've known these characters for a long time. The movie is so sad and poignant. I love the ending, the scene where the boy's dad was talking to him about the death of his mother. It was a nice way to end it. (I'd suggest watching this before the first Batman movie, just to see how this movie differs from the first one.) The song that the girls sing in the movie is amazing. (They even sang "Crazy in Love" in the end.)  1 of 1 people found this review helpful

I was on a date with a friend of mine (yes, a date) and was talking about how I'd like to see the movie.   The next day he showed me the movie and I went into a full blown emotional state. It was the best movie I've ever seen.   the acting, the music, and the acting alone made me cry.  , the story, the setting, the acting and the music...I could go on and on. But the best part of this movie for me is that the story is so simple. There's no big plot, no "twist," no "out of this world" plot twists and turns. The movie is about a woman who lives in a small town, loves her son and has a crush on a man. She lives in the middle of nowhere and has nothing but time to herself. She finds herself in a life and death situation. This woman, is she a hero? Is she a victim? Or is she something more? In my opinion, she is neither. She's a person with her own thoughts and values. She is a woman with morals and values that are her own. I love the movie for that reason.The movie is so moving. The cinematography, the sound, the performances...everything was so realistic. The sound effects were very well done. There are some really great scenes in this movie, but if you have never seen it before, I would recommend watching it for the first time. This film will make you cry. - May 5, 2009I highly recommend watching this movie!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951). The director, George Cukor, had a dream to make a silent movie and that dream was realized with The Day The Planet Stood Stupid. He had to work a lot of different actors, but they did a good job and created a fantastic world. It's not a good action movie and it's not very funny. But it's a wonderful movie. It's a story about a little boy (James Stewart) who lives with his father (Spencer Tracy) and his mother (Katharine Hepburn) in a small house on the shore of an unnamed lake. Stewart plays a young boy who has never seen the sun and has never been outside his little house. He loves the lake so much that he decides to stay there. His father, a farmer, doesn't think the sun will ever rise. But one day, when Stewart is about to go outside for a ride, he sees a strange sight. A huge bright light has appeared in the sky and it is shining down from a great cloud. The farmer has no idea what it is, but he knows that it is the beginning of a new day. James Stewart was a wonderful actor. He was tall and lanky, but also kind and gentle. He could play any character. He played the young boy in The Day the Planet Stole Sorrows (1949) and also the old man who teaches Stewart how to shoot a gun. He plays a soldier in The Man From Mars (1952) and is also very good as the doctor in The Blue Angel (1953). Katharina Hepburn played Stewart's mother and she is very sweet and a little mysterious. She is a little old lady with a little grey wig and she has a funny, sweet voice. Stewart could also play a little girl in The Red Shoes (1947). He played a child in The Boy with a Silver Backpack (1948). James Dean plays a boy in the movie and he's pretty good as well. He looks a little like Stewart and Dean is also tall and handsome. George Cuker did a great job making the movie. The film was not a very good action film, but it's still a very beautiful movie. It has beautiful, colorful scenery. It also has a lot more music and a lot better acting. The only problem is that it doesn't have much of a plot. It doesn't

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Fell to Earth  was a pretty decent movie.  It was definitely a step up from the first film.  I don't care how many times you see it, and I didn't like it when it first came out, but it was a good film. The action was great, and the movie had great acting from the leads.  I loved that they gave an alien a chance to interact with the human race.  It was a very interesting movie and was well worth seeing.  This movie is a sequel to the first movie, and it picks up right where it left off.  The only thing that disappointed me was the ending, but that's not really a big deal.  Overall, a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is the story of two brothers who are living with their grandmother in the countryside. The father of the two is the chief of a village. One day the brother comes back from a hunt and says that his father has been murdered. The family go to the village and find that the chief is missing. The search for the chief ends when they find his body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. The two brothers get angry and go on a hunt for the killer. After a while they go back to their village and they start to argue about the murder of their father. The brothers think that the other is responsible for it. They think that this is the case because the chief was very rich and well off. The brother gets angry and tells his friend that he is going to kill the other brother. The other brother goes and hides. He is surprised that the brother has gone to the forest. The man goes back to his house and he thinks that the two brothers will go back home. The second brother has a rifle and goes back in the forest to shoot the other. He shoots and kills the other and he goes back home and kills his brother. When the brothers come home they tell their mother what has happened. The mother gets angry at the brothers and she beats the two of them. When they come home the brother of the murdered chief is there and he says that the man is lying. The police comes and arrest the brother. He says that he killed his brother for money. He gets a big reward and the two go back. The uncle of the chief tells the two that they should go back and give the other a good beating. They go back with their uncle. When their uncle sees the brothers they are both in a good mood. The first brother says that if he kills the second brother he will get the whole reward. The one brother says: "If I shoot the man who killed my father then I get nothing." The other says: 'If I kill my brother, then I will get a big deal." So the uncle of his brother shoots the brother and he is killed. The wife of the uncle runs in and tells the brothers that the second is dead. The husband runs in to the room and sees his wife dead. They are both dead.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________  "I loved this movie. It was so good. It reminded me of the old movies that I loved as a kid. It really was a great movie." __________________________________________________________ , written and directed by Stanley Kubrick, was an adaptation of a story by the American author Arthur Schnitzler. The film tells the story of a German soldier who is sent to India, where he meets a beautiful young Hindu woman, played by the legendary Indira Gandhi. The soldier is in the middle of a bloody battle when he meets her, and they fall in love. But their romance is interrupted when the German soldier is captured and interrogated by the local Muslims. The Muslims are obsessed with the idea that the German and the Hindu woman are a married couple, and so they try to kill them both. As the soldier is tortured and beaten, he begins to question whether the woman he loves is really there. The man's journey is one of faith and hope, and the movie captures this perfectly. It also shows us the lengths to which the Indians will go to defend their beliefs, and how little we care about what they have to say. (review written by the author)

It's a little dingy, so she goes in the shower, and I guess she was wearing the white panties from that shoot. It was a little, very brief. Then it cuts to the shower and she's washing herself. It just sort of ends. The next scene shows her back in her room. She's in the white lingerie, with her top on and the black lace panties. It is not the same shot."   __________________________________________________________________________   It's an odd, odd film. It seems like it should be pretty simple to understand. There are some characters that are clearly not from around here, or are just doing their own thing, and there's a few other people that seem to be doing some pretty questionable things. But this film is a fun ride from start to finish. The only reason I gave this film 4 stars is because of the scene in the hotel room. I understand the need for the scene to be there, but it seemed like it was kind of unnecessary. It did not make me enjoy the film any more.   The sex scenes are very good. There's a great amount of action, and it's a lot of fun. The acting was pretty good, as well.   of all the sex scenes in this film, this is my favorite. There is just something about it that just makes me feel good. The actress in this scene, Lorna Jane, is pretty much perfect for the role. She is a very sexy, but also very sexy. Her breasts and ass are both nice, and her breasts are a little larger than you would expect. She has a great body and a great personality. I really enjoyed watching her.   and the guy in this one is pretty good as well, though a little over the top.  .

The characters were all very well made. I can see why this was a hit. This is a great example of how to make a funny movie and not have sex on screen. It wasn't just the sex that was on screen but it is the movie itself. I highly recommend this movie. I recommend it for all ages and everyone will enjoy it. If you have a friend that loves to laugh and be silly then you need to see this. If your not in the mood for sex on a movie then I recommend you go to a movie in a bigger theater. It will be a lot funnier in a theater. I had a great time watching this movie and it is one of my all time favorite movies. If this was released in the 80's or 90's it would be a huge hit!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I'm not sure I'd call this a good film. It's definitely a very strange movie, with its plot, pacing, and cinematography. It has some great moments (the first three acts are very cool and well acted), and the action is quite good. However, it feels a bit rushed at points, and a lot of it feels forced and unnatural. Some of the acting is great, but some of it is a bit weird. I was never a fan of the main character, but I was impressed by his daughter, who was also very well portrayed. I also thought the movie was rather creepy at times. I really enjoyed the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If a movie can only be good for one hour, it is a failure. If it is good for two hours, it's a masterpiece. If a movie is good in the time that it's made, then it's great. If you watch it after a long time, it becomes a bad movie. The last part of the movie was not that good, but I liked it a lot.   The film is about a movie star. In his last movie, he has to do a film that is so famous that no one can remember his name, but he is forced to do it. He has to get a part where he has a bad performance, but that's not the most important thing. He's a movie movie star, and the studio has promised to make a movie about him that he doesn't know anything about.  , it tells a good story about the actor, but it lacks the quality to make the film great.  . I liked this movie a lot, but the last part was a bit boring. It was also boring in the beginning, but after it was a good scene.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate (1962).  I know that's not really a bad movie, but I really enjoyed it.  There is a scene where a woman is having a manicure when she's taken out of her trance by a man.    She wakes up and it's a strange world.  She is at an underground station with no windows.  Then she sees a man standing in the distance.  This was a great movie and I'd recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "Crazy Heart" is a wonderful movie about a man and a woman who are both going to have a change of heart. We meet the man at the age of 17 and he is a very intelligent and bright young man who has decided that he has had enough of a boring life. He goes to a psychiatrist who says to him that he should try to kill himself, but he will have to live his life with the help of a group of people, the "psychic police." He is taken to a remote location where he is told that he is going to go through a psychic experience and the person who will be his guide in this experience is a woman. The man is told to put on a black suit and a white shirt and when he comes out of the psychic experience he is seen by all the people as a completely different person. He gets very upset because the psychic police told him that his father was dead and that he was the only son of a dying alcoholic. The woman tells him that she has a secret to tell him and he goes through all of the experiences in order to find out who the woman is. The film is very suspenseful and is a fantastic watch. The director, William Friedkin, gives this movie a great deal of energy and passion and his performance is fantastic. This movie is the film that I would recommend to any person. It is very difficult to believe that a film that has so much promise can be so disappointing. "Crazys heart" is not as good as it could have been, but it still is a great movie.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is not like a lot of movies are made. This movie was written, directed, produced, edited and acted by the same guy. The same guy that brought us the brilliant "Saved By The Bell". He did an amazing job with this movie and he was in it too. It was very funny, sad, touching and very realistic. It made me feel like I was watching a movie of my friends from grade school and that is a good thing. I was very impressed with this film and I hope that it will help kids to understand that you don't have to be so cruel. It is also a great way to tell a kid that if you don`t want to be bullied, don` t be. This film is a must watch and a must see.  Rated 4 out of 5 by daniel from funny and sad I really enjoyed this movie. It had a funny story and some really sad parts. My kids had a blast laughing at the characters. We watched this together, they all loved it and so did we. I think the movie would be a great family movie.  is my favourite movie. My favorite character is Kevin Hart. I love the movie because it was funny, but it was also sad and sad at the same time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a child and a child.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an amazing movie and is one of the best films in the genre.  It has everything a horror movie should have.    I thought it was great.  And it is also one of my favorite films.  It's not that it has bad acting but I really don't think they should have let them use a real actor for the role.  The movie was awesome and very entertaining.  I liked it.  There was a great ending to the movie and there was a really great ending for the character of Jason.  The ending was very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  ______________. ______________________ .______________ _______________________  . _______________    I watched the movie "The Matrix" back in 1999. It was my first time seeing the movie, and I loved it! My favorite part was the scene where the main character was talking to the computer on the floor of the Matrix. The movie was not very good, and a bit cheesy. The only thing that kept me coming back to it was the beautiful visuals and sound of the film.   So, in the movie we follow Neo and Morpheus. Neo is a computer genius, and he is working on the matrix. He is going to use the power of the matrix to bring peace to the world. The evil and greedy humans are trying to take the power away from him. Neo's journey in the matrix is very interesting. He gets a lot of different visions. He sees different kinds of people, and they have different purposes for him. He also has a very interesting relationship with Trinity, a girl that he falls in love with. The main characters are well written and acted.   the one thing that i thought was a bit weird was that Neo's clothes are not exactly the same as Morpheus'. Morpheus' clothes are more like a trench coat and jeans. Neo wears a lot more flashy clothes and some really nice looking sunglasses.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. __________. _______.  "I think you've been listening to me all day, now give it back to me."  The only bad movie I've ever seen is The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, but I'm not talking about the movie, I'm talking about me. I was watching this movie, not because I want to be a good guy or a bad guy. I think I'd just as soon be a bad person. But I had to watch this movie to be able to tell you that the ending wasn't right. That's not the point of this movie. The point is that it's a movie that makes me think and question everything I see. I don't know if you've seen this movie before, but the plot is that a man is going around killing men because he's jealous. There's a lot of talk about the hero's lack of a soul, which I thought was rather stupid, because I'm pretty sure there's no way a man could be jealous. Then, he gets caught, and his friend (who, I kid you not, I believe has a name) is killed in the attempt. His friend says that the man he was supposed to be helping (in the film) is the man who saved him from the man that he was jealous of. He goes on to say that he couldn't save his friend, but that he could help him because he has the power of a God, which is the power to kill. Now, what's wrong with this story? I think it's that it makes you question everything you see. Because, you know, that's what movies are supposed to do. Movies are supposed create questions, questions that make you think and then, if you're lucky, they'll make you feel. It's what makes them a good kind of art. And I can't wait for the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why is it that every movie has a villain? In The Great Gatsby, the most despicable character is that of Daisy Buchanan. She is a woman who is in love with a man who doesn't reciprocate her feelings. She goes to the Grand Canyon, where she encounters a woman, Gats, who is a great lover. She falls in love, and has a few moments of joy and happiness. She leaves her husband, Nick Carraway, for him, but Nick is unable to reciprocate this love. The great thing about this film is that Daisy Buchanan is an honest, caring person who loves her children, and her husband. In the end, she makes the choice to betray her own ideals, and betray Nick. That is why she is such a villain. A villain like that would never get her own way, and the film would have been a complete failure if she didn't. This is why I loved this movie. It has a great female protagonist who is not afraid to take a stand for what she believes in. It is a perfect movie to have a good laugh. There is nothing worse than a movie with a great villain. I know that Daisy is a villain, but that doesn't mean I hate her. I love her! And, she is the best character in the movie.  Review written by David D. Burd  ______________________________________________________________  I am a big fan of Fassbinder. I think his filmography is quite extensive and is probably the best way to appreciate his career. So when it comes to Gatsbys I was intrigued. So far the only film I had seen was the one that was nominated for a Golden Globe (Gatsby). And when I saw that, I knew I had to see the movie that was the best picture winner, and I am glad I did. Fassbender has always been a good actor. I always liked him when he played a character who was a bit more evil than what I expected him to be. But here he is playing the character of Daisy. He has always played people who were not the perfect person, they are flawed and human, they make mistakes. The character of Nick Carrera is played brilliantly. His character is a good man who is very protective of his family. He was always there for his family and loved them very much. He is not a bad man, he is a very loving person, and he tries to protect his family from

One is that it's very uneven. The movie could've been more focused on a single character, the girl's father, instead of just the entire town of Rookwood. Also, I really wish that the movie had a more serious plot to tell. This is only a teen romance movie so there isn't much depth to the story. The only thing that really works in this movie is the performances. I really liked the acting of the teen girls. They are all so different and you really get a feel for who they are and what makes them tick. They have their own unique personalities and you get a sense of them developing a relationship with one another. The story is so far from being believable that it becomes more about the romance between the two teens. And I would have preferred the story to be more focused more on this one girl. There is so much more to this story than she is given credit for. The ending was so rushed and confusing that I felt like I was left hanging, with no resolution. It felt very unsatisfying and it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make it seem like the two teen girls would get married. The final scene was also a bit disappointing. There was so much tension and tension was built up. Then, suddenly the two girls were just on the floor of a car together. This scene was so abrupt and left a lot of questions unanswered. I wish that it would've been a bit more involved in the story and given the girls more screen time. I know that this movie was very popular at the time and the plotline worked well for a teen movie. It was good for that time. But in this time it feels like it is missing something." -Anonymous

However, after their adventure, they meet a woman who offers them a deal: she will marry them in return for helping her find a magical sword that could give her life back. After the wedding, the prince and princess travel to a mysterious castle, where they find the sword, and their adventure continues! _______________________________________  This is a good animated film. The story is simple and the art style is good, but I wish the princess was a bit younger and her hair was a little more blonde. However that's my only complaint.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ (average: 4.5) _____________ (average.5 rating)  I'm not going to lie to you. The first film in the series was pretty disappointing. The second film, however, was the best. The third film was a solid addition to the series. I really enjoyed the fourth film. This one was also a little short. However, the fifth film was very good. The story and the acting were really good. I found the fifth and sixth films a little slow, but it was still a very enjoyable film. I enjoyed watching the seventh film even more. The final film is definitely my favorite. It was an emotional roller coaster. I was completely invested in the characters and I enjoyed every second of it. The last scene is pretty much a masterpiece. The music in this film was also good. It's a little more somber than I would have liked, but still good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The Good: I have a problem. It's not that I don't enjoy the film, I just don't like how it was made. A lot of people seem to love it and I'm a huge fan of Paul Verhoeven, but this movie is not his best. It is very good, but it suffers from a few flaws. It feels rushed, the plot is a little convoluted, the acting is very bad, the story is very slow paced, and the characters are all very shallow. The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly: The Good is very interesting, it has a very high level of action, and even though it doesn't quite go all out, the action is very well choreographed. The Bad is very obvious, there's too much going on at one time. The UGLY is pretty much a generic, one-note character, he's a complete dick, and you'll see why in the next paragraph. The BAD: The BAD part about the movie is that the story never really builds up enough to develop a strong plot. The movie is very long, and there are no real twists or surprises to the story. The characters are very one note, they're all just a little bit too shallow to be interesting. The Movie, and a little later, the series: I think this movie could be considered the "second" in the series. I think there are a couple of things to say about this movie, and I'd like to share with you what I think is wrong with it. The first is that, I really hate this movie. The second thing is that I just feel that Paul Verhoven is the worst director in the world. This movie just feels rushed and unprofessional. Paul Verhovend doesn't understand how to shoot a movie, so he just doesn't bother. And the acting isn't that good. I don�t know what the director was thinking with the acting, it really isn't very good. It doesn't have that feeling of being genuine. I also don't really get why the characters were made so one-dimensional. They are so boring that they don't even give the audience any choice. It just seems like they were written to make the audience feel bad about themselves for liking the movie. And that is a real shame, because there is a lot to like about this film. The plot is very, very slow and doesn't really go anywhere. The action is extremely

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is that the writing and the acting is so good that you don't even notice the bad acting.  If you love good acting, then you will love this movie.    As for the plot, it is not a good one.  The story is about a man who has lost everything and is on the verge of suicide, but is rescued by his son.  His son asks him to stay with him.  He does so and they live together.  They become a team.  Eventually the son has to leave his father and they go to live with a friend.  I found the story and the story was so interesting and the characters are so realistic.  It is very difficult to believe that this is a true story, and it is because this is true.  This is the best movie I have ever seen.  If you like movies about true stories then you should watch this movie because it is the story of two friends that made a team to survive.  I have to say that this movie was very hard to watch.  When I first watched this movie I thought that I would like it, but I just didn't like it.  Even the director of this movie made a very good movie. I have seen other films that were so bad that I had to turn it off.  There is one scene that is just so wrong that I wanted to throw the DVD away.  And there are many other scenes that are so bad, that you just want to throw it away.   I had a difficult time watching this movie and I don't recommend it.  I really wish that someone could have written a screenplay for this movie, so that it could have been good.  But I have to give a good recommendation to this movie as it is so much better than other movies I have watched.

The story is a bit too complex for me, but the script is solid and the film is very good. ________________________________________________ The Bad ___________________________________________________________ "Mystery Science Theater 3000" was a great show, but "The Bad" is very poor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that I will go into this movie with a negative attitude, but I feel that this is a great movie, and one that can be appreciated for its plot, and its character development.  Although it does have some of the same tropes that many films have (including its protagonist's name being "Dewey") and a lot of the plot points are a bit of a stretch, the movie does a really good job of showing that there is a place for a happy-go-lucky, quirky hero, and that there are people who can love and respect him even though they have to struggle with the fact that he's a bit crazy.  I think this movie is a very good movie, even if it's a little weird at times.   This is one of the few movies that really shows a character who has a heart of gold.  The story is well-written, and the movie has a very nice ending.  This movie also includes a very cool, and creepy music track, and it's very catchy!   My only complaint is that the movie doesn't really follow through with its ending.   The movie ends with Dewey's son leaving for college.  At the end of the movie, the father tells Dewey that he wishes he could've been a part of his son's life, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.  I do not think that this movie would be as good if the ending had been better.  Overall, I think this is an excellent movie that is worth checking out.  It is well worth watching, and I think that you should watch it, too.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I am an adult who has never been sexually abused, but I am one of the thousands of people whose parents sexually abused them. I was 12 years old when I started having sex with my father and I have never stopped. He was my guardian and my father was a doctor, but he never told me he was abusing me. When he was married to my mother, he used to take me to the doctor, and he had a doctor friend who would give him injections of cocaine to make him look like a normal man. I still remember the day he used this trick. He went to the dentist and was supposed to have a root canal. He didn't want me to go because he wanted me to be with him. I knew he was trying to make sure he didn't lose me to a girl I had a crush on. So I got in the car and drove him to the Doctor's office. I didn't have a clue where I was going because I had to drive him to an old lady's house so he could get the cocaine. He came to the door, and I went with him to his car. He told me to put my foot down, and then he got in. He started having me have sex with him in the backseat. I told him that I didn' t want to do it, but that I needed to go to the store to get a bottle of shampoo. He wouldn't listen to me. He said that he had no other choice. I asked him to drive. When I got to the gas station, I asked my mother to come with me, but she wouldn't let me go. My mother told me that I had no business being there, and that I shouldn't go in the house. I tried to tell my mother that I couldn't get any help there, but my mother wouldn't believe me. She told me I was just a stupid little girl. I got into my father's car and he took me to my grandmother's house. When we got there, I told my grandmother about what had happened. She took me into the bathroom and told me not to tell anyone. I cried all night. I don't know what would have happened if my grandmother had let me tell anyone that my father had abused me. My grandmother didn't tell me that she had a daughter that he was having sex too. My father was never punished for this, but his doctor friend was. He died before he was supposed too, but
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the third time I've seen this movie.  I saw it in my first grade class.    The first time, the teacher had been talking about it.  The movie wasn't even on the school's list of what we were supposed to be watching for the day.  I saw this movie with my father when I was in the 5th grade.  It was just one of those days where the teacher said "Hey kids, I'm going to show you a film we have on our list. " We didn't really understand what it was, but we were excited.  We sat down and watched the movie for the first time.  I can still remember the feeling of excitement on my father's face.  My brother was a few years older than me.  He never watched this movie but he was a big fan of the "Sgt. Pepper" album.  As the movie was playing he turned to me and said "Daddy, what did you think of it?"   I said I thought it was a very good movie. He looked at me and asked if he could see it. I was a little scared of my dad's reaction.  At the time I thought he would want to watch it in a theater.  After we saw it a second time, he said "That was the most amazing movie I've ever seen."   He was a huge Beatles fan.  His father died before my brother and I were born.  In my opinion, this is one of the most profound stories of the Beatles.  They told the story in a simple and beautiful way.  You don't see this movie often because it is so out of copyright.  But if you have the opportunity to see it, don't let it pass you by.  This movie will make you think.  If you're like me, it will make your day.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  It's a great movie! I love it and you won't be disappointed.  This movie is a great example of what is wrong with modern society. A couple of guys are on a trip to a lake to swim and enjoy a peaceful day. The trip is interrupted by a group of teenagers who have a problem. They want to see a dead animal. What is a dead fish to a bunch of teenagers? The adults try to solve the problem but they fail and the teenagers decide to have a threesome. But, as the movie progresses, things start getting out of hand. The story starts to get disturbing. I don't know how the director was able to pull off the film but the violence and nudity was disturbing. It wasn't just a few guys getting in some hot action. They actually go out and fight each other. The way they fight was a lot of fun. They also go into some weird places. The nudity was so realistic. They went to a nude beach and there was a dead body on the shore. The dead body was covered in blood. The next scene shows a girl with a dead man tied up to her bed. There was blood everywhere. The director knew exactly what he was doing and he got the ratings he wanted. The movie was a success. People love this movie because of the violence. It's the only movie I have seen where the violence is really brutal. It doesn't matter if the fight is between two adults or two teenagers. There is a lot blood and a lot more nudity. The only other movie that was really like this was the great movie Fight Club. In conclusion, this is a good film. The violence is realistic. It was a very fun movie to watch. But the ending was kind of a bummer. The girls are supposed to have sex but it doesn't happen. This would be a very good movie if the sex scenes were included in the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: s a shame that the last half hour or so of this movie is not a good one. The movie had great action and was good enough to make me think that this movie could've been good if they had kept the action on a longer time frame. I thought the film was pretty good but I would have been better off watching a different movie or if I had the time and money to watch a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It is a great movie. You can see the whole movie. It is about a man and a woman who are living in a small apartment in the middle of the city. They live a life without any excitement. One day they have a very bad accident and are hospitalized. The woman has a cat that she lives with. The cat is very cute and funny. The man is very strict and very quiet. The only good thing about the movie is that the man is really nice. I wish the man would get married. The movie is a good comedy and has a lot of great scenes. This movie was very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hannibal" is an extremely well-acted and suspenseful film.  I'm very much a fan of this director and the way he made it.  And it's very funny too.  It's got some great gore and violence and the movie doesn't make you feel any better about killing someone.  The way you feel about the person you're killing has been totally changed and you're glad they're dead.  But there's something a bit sad about the way they go about it. This is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  The film is very enjoyable, very realistic.  - Great acting, well done. .  the plot is very good, well thought out. - Well done character development.  a lot of people liked it and i loved it.  is a classic film about a little girl and her father. the father, in fact, has an interesting and very different character. the mother is quite the opposite, i loved the mother. i did not like the father very much, and i think i'm a bit of a hypocrite as well, i like a lot the mother and the father but the father was just too bad. the wife, though, was pretty great. i think she was a little bit over acted and she was too perfect, but i still like her. i don't like the film very much at all, the plot was just very poor and boring. i wish it would have ended a little better and been better directed. overall, i thought it was great and i really liked the movie. a classic!  i would recommend it, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I am not one for gore, but I'll admit, I did enjoy this movie. I like the ending and the ending is a good ending. The movie is good, but it has a problem. It was made in the 70s and the action scenes are bad. I'm not saying they are bad, but they don't seem like real action scenes. They look more like they are done with a camera and a stunt man. It's kind of like if you watched a James Bond movie and when they were on a helicopter, they made you think they were flying over a big city, but then they shot them through a window and they looked like they were in a small area with houses in the background.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. It's all about the ending.  The story of "The Devil's Backbone" was written and directed by a great filmmaker. And the ending is so wonderful. I love the fact that the director kept telling the story in a way that didn't make it seem as if it was ending all together. We know that in a minute, something will happen that will change everything. We get to know what that something is and it's so awesome. The final fight scene is so good. There's a great way of portraying the character of Don Quixote and his relationship with Sancho Panza. The way they fight is so intense. It feels like they've been together for years. I just love the ending of the movie. It was a real treat to watch this movie and to see Don Quijote and Sancho fight it out in a big way. . It was an interesting experience to see a movie like this. It wasn't as easy to get into as I thought it would be. There were some parts that I found a bit tedious and the movie was over way too fast. I think that I would have liked to see more of this movie because I loved it so much. I was also surprised by the ending, but that's a different movie. I'd recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ ____________ _________ How could this be the case when there are more than one movie on this list that are more powerful? I've never been so moved by a movie before, it's one of those movies where it takes the breath right out of your lungs. This movie is not a simple thriller but a philosophical thriller that asks "what if". What if a man who believes he is going to die is given a second chance to save his life by a man that believes that the universe is nothing but a computer simulation? In the movie the main character is an employee of a company that makes the computer simulations for the government. His job is to design and build the simulations. In one of his simulations, a man has been captured by terrorists and the terrorist leader offers to trade him in return for a large sum of money. The main character decides to go to the terrorists and ask if they are real or not. In the simulation he finds that the man has died and he is in fact alive. The terrorist leader tells him that they are not real and that the simulation is a computer created by the government to help them fight terrorism. The man in the simulation, who is in reality the real terrorist leader, is waiting for him in a room. The real terrorist tells the man that he has come to save him and in return, he will let the man go. He will not kill the man but rather let him go and then he will kill the real man in front of the computer. He tells the main protagonist that the real terrorists will kill him and will give him a new life. The computer then takes over and kills the real main leader and then the man is able to free himself and he returns to the real world and sees the woman he loves, who has also survived. The terrorists who were captured by the real leader are also free and they are about to kill him when the computer shows them the man who has been saved and that they have been in a simulation too. The film is about freedom of the will and the power of the human spirit to achieve what it wishes. It's a movie that will make you think. It will make your heart beat faster. This film is a must see. I know this is a controversial review because it's a thriller but I must say it's worth a watch. The movie is only two hours and fifteen minutes long but it's not a movie for kids. The story is a slow burn that takes you from the beginning

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.   I saw this movie in the theater at the beginning of a very long day of work. It was a very interesting movie. It made me think about life and the things that happen in the real world. I can only think of three things that would make a good example of a good life. One is that I met a man at the grocery store that I had never met before, and that we have been friends ever since. The other is that my husband was in the Navy, and he had his family in the city. My husband is a very private person, and I had been very jealous of him and his wife for a very short time before they got married. The third is that we had a cat, and my husband had to take the cat to a vet to be treated for a bad eye infection. My mother had been an alcoholic, and the cat had to be put to sleep. The movie made me realize that sometimes it is not about the money, it is about the people and what makes a difference in their lives.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ (2011) ____________ is a fun and interesting film about a group of men who are attempting to steal an oil rig off the coast of Venezuela in order to profit from its wealth. The film is based on the true story of a group called the "Caravanserai" who attempted the same thing but got caught. The story revolves around a group who are determined to be the first to steal the oil rig. The main protagonist of the film is a former soldier who has just been discharged and has decided to come back to his homeland in search of work. He meets a young man who is also interested in this venture. The group then splits up, but the main character is determined to find the oilrig and take it. The director, Roberto Benigni, has created a fun film which can be enjoyed by those who like the adventure type of films. I would recommend this film to those who enjoy good fun films. __________ (2012) ______________________ is a very enjoyable film from the director of "Breathless" about a man who comes home after a year in the army to his wife, only to find that she has taken on a new job as a waitress. When the husband tries to confront her about the change in her life he is attacked by the waiter who was working with her. After the attack the husband finds himself in the police station and finds out that the waiter is not who he appears to be. The movie is a good comedy, as the director tries to get a sense of the man and the man tries to find out why his wife has suddenly become this way. _____________________ (2011/2012) A beautiful film about an older couple who have been married for 30 years. The couple, who are very close friends, have been living a very private life together. They have a lovely home, beautiful lawns, and a dog. When they were first married, they had a housekeeper. Now they are going through a divorce and the housekeeper has quit. The husband is a lawyer and wants to go to law school. However, his wife is a nurse who has been working there for 30 year. The wife is very proud of her profession and loves her patients. __________________________________________ ___________________ (2011): ______________________________________ (2010): _______________________ (2009): ________ (2008): ___________________________ ____________________________________________________________ (2007): _______ _________________ (2006): _____ ____________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There is no way I could recommend this movie, even if I did like the director and the film. It is a good story and a good cast. The cinematography is beautiful, but it is not worth a 5 star rating." Read more The Great Wall  is not an action film, nor is it a western. In this film, Chinese soldiers, led by a commander named Sun Wei, have to stop the Mongol invasion from across the Great Wall. The movie begins with the characters going to the Great wall in search of the Great Khan, but soon find themselves on a quest for the Emperor. The story is based on a Chinese novel by a British author. The Great Wall was released in China in 2016, and the movie has already earned quite a lot of money in China. I will admit, this movie is not for everybody. It does not contain a lot violence, and a lot is told in an indirect way. I would say that a lot about the story is not really explained. I guess that a few viewers will find this movie a bit hard to follow. The story of the movie is about a battle between the Mongol army and the Chinese. Sun Wei is the commander of the Chinese army, and he is also the son of a Chinese general. Sun is the son's name in the Chinese novel. The Mongol army has a great number of chariots, and many of the chariots have been lost in battle. This is where the story starts. Sun sets out to find the lost chariots and to find a new route to the Mongol Empire. Wei is very wise and intelligent. He knows a lot and is able to find solutions to problems. He is also very brave and does not like to lose. It was not really easy for him to take the Mongolian army on. The fight between the Chinese and the Mongol is pretty intense, but there are also some good scenes, especially when Sun Wei goes to the Chinese camp. There are a lot more Chinese characters in this movie than there are in the book, but they are not as interesting. I did not like that the story does not go back to the past, and there are no flashbacks or explanations. I think that a movie should explain things and not leave things open for the audience to decide. The director is also not able to do much with the Chinese characters. The only Chinese character who is able and willing to fight the Mongolians is Sun Wei. Even
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The film is about a man who's father is a professor and has gone missing, the film is told in the first person, which I think is a good thing because it allows us to be the man who is trying to find him. The director of the film, John McNaughton does a good job and it's good to see his style. The film has a good soundtrack, the cinematography is great and the music in the movie is just great. It's an easy watch but not too much. There are some scenes where you will be reminded of the first Indiana Jones movie. But if you want to see this movie in its entirety, then you might want to check it out.  Review by: John

Reviewer: bertrand - favorite favorite favorite - October 28, 2005  Subject: I saw this movie on TV in the 80's. I was 6 at the time and it was the last film I saw in high school. It was about a kid who is a star quarterback at a small college in New England. His coach decides to put him in a game against a team from a bigger college in California. The kids have to go back and forth and have to play a game of football, which is the same thing as basketball but is played on the small college field. After winning, the coach shows up to see his star QB, and gets his autograph and the game is on. The movie was about two great players who knew how to play the game, and how to handle it. They were a great team. - October 1928. I saw it on TV at 6 years old in my small town in New Hampshire. The game was a varsity vs. a viello team. I got chills when I saw the last play. It took me a long time to figure out what I was seeing. - September 11, 2005I saw this film on TV

It was a good, but not great, movie. The acting is great, the story is interesting and you can see why the movie is made. It is a fantasy, but a very good fantasy. There are some very good scenes, but the story suffers from a lot of problems. The characters are weak and they are not well developed. The plot is so-so and doesn't have much depth. There is a scene that is so confusing, that it almost makes me feel like it is not a movie. I could not figure out what is going on. There was so much wrong in this movie that it would make a very bad movie. If you are a fan of the series, this is a good flick to see. However, I am not sure if I will be watching the rest of the films, because it seems to have been made so badly.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I watched this movie because I had seen the trailer and wanted to know what it was about. The trailer said that it was the story of a girl who wanted to marry her cousin's guy but he wasn't interested. So she took off to meet the guy but was caught by his friends and his cousin who said he wanted her. The girl did not want to marry him and he was not interested so he ran away and then she ran after him and then he got away but then the girl found out that he had run away from her when she was going to meet him. This was a good story and I think that there is a great movie here. I'm going to give it an 8.5 out of 10 because the movie is good but the characters were not very interesting and the movie was too short. It was a nice movie to watch and I wish that it had a longer length.

I think if there was more to this story, this would have been a great film. But because of the ending and the good acting, it was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. This film was a must see in the 80s. A must see for those who want to see good cinema and want to watch something different. It is not as well known as some of the other films from this era but I think it deserves more recognition. I recommend this film to anyone who likes good cinema, a good story, and good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "There are so many ways in which a film can be good, and I find that the most satisfying ones are the ones that don't make a ton of sense. A movie should never make you question what you just saw. If you're too concerned about that, then you're going to get bored. If it does make sense, then the audience is going to have a blast, because it was really cool to see some characters come to life."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I saw was The Wizard of Oz.  It was a good film with an amazing cast.  The movie was a fun ride for all ages.  As a kid I could not get enough of the film.  I could see the Wizard's adventure.  Then as an adult, I could enjoy the story that Dorothy was in as well as the characters and their interactions.  This was a classic film that I enjoyed every minute of watching.  If you have a chance to see it, you must watch it.  For me, I just wish it would have had more.  Perhaps they should have made a sequel.  You never know.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I am a huge fan of Star Wars and the prequels so this movie was pretty much a no-brainer for me to watch. I am very glad I watched it because the film had a really good cast and it was a lot of fun. The acting was great, especially Alec Guinness as C-3PO, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Mark Hammill as Han Solo. I thought Harrison Ford was great in the movie, I wish he would've done more, but that's a bit of a nitpick. George Lucas is not the greatest director ever, but he was the best writer and director of the prequel trilogy. I think they really put a lot into this movie and I think a lot went into its success. I don't think it was just a flop because I think people like what they liked about it. It was a fun film. It's not the perfect film, but it's fun and I like the movie. I give it a 8.5/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ This movie is a masterpiece, and if you're a fan of the genre, you will enjoy it a lot. __________________________________________________________ 1 star for the soundtrack; it's good, but not as good as some of the other movies of the series. 2 stars for the acting, but you can tell they are all young actors and the film lacks that old-fashioned old Hollywood atmosphere that makes the old-time movies fun. The story is just fantastic, and the ending, while it is bittersweet, is very well done. This is definitely a movie that has to be seen, but I don't recommend it for those who want the "good old- timey" movie. _______________ This movie should be seen by everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ A movie that will keep you guessing and wondering until the end. It's very different from the other two movies. The story is about a woman who goes to a house for the first time to look for a new apartment. But she doesn't know it's a fake, and her mother is not there at all. She decides to try and help the people at the house. The movie is very funny and really a story about what it is like to be a woman in a different world. This movie is definitely a must see for anyone who likes funny movies.  Rated 5 out of 5 by dannyj from Great movie I watched this movie for the fourth time last night and was still smiling at the end I also liked the scene where the woman was cleaning the house and she came in the room and her friend went on the bed and the guy on the bottom of the bed got on top of her and she said, "No no don't get on top, it's too late" and she turned around and walked out. She looked so nice in the movie  Reviewed by Gertrude from It's a good time. A little bit of a silly movie, and that's what I liked about it.  to my mind the best scene was the one with the dog on the table. it was a bit strange but funny.  and the best thing about this movie was that the woman in the house had an excellent sense of humor. she said some nice lines.

I would recommend this movie to any movie buff and would recommend it to anyone that likes a good sci fi movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I like this movie a lot, but the story is so bad. It's not that bad, but it's very boring. I really think the main characters need to be changed. The main guy is a total douche. He doesn't want to learn about life, or even be happy, he just wants to have fun. His girlfriend is a nice girl, but she's so boring and annoying. And then you have the girlfriend, but he doesn't care for her at all. They don't even have sex in this movie. It was just boring and sad. I hope the sequel will be better. It has to be a good story. I'd give it a 7 if it was a bad movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Movie! I am a huge fan of this movie and I thought I would watch it again. I found the movie really interesting and it is not just the main character. The movie has a good storyline, with lots of character development and a great plot twist. The music was awesome. The best part is the end. I enjoyed it very much.  and I really enjoyed it. I think the reason I liked it is because the plot was well done and it was good to see a couple of different characters. The characters were interesting and I liked that they were not only the main ones but also some of the supporting characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I've been in a rut lately. I'm not sure why. The last two films I've seen have been good but have been plagued with awful editing and story issues. The first was The Matrix Revolutions and I liked the plot. The second, Prometheus, was terrible. I felt that the story was rushed and it was unclear who was going where and why. I was also a little disappointed in the film's visual effects. They looked great but they were not as spectacular as in the first film. The visuals were also not as realistic as in Prometheus. This time I felt like the filmmakers wanted to be different and make a sci-fi film. That was the same thing with The Dark Knight Rises. There were moments of beautiful visuals but it felt like they were trying to be something different and the results were less than satisfying. The Last of Us The last time I watched a video game movie was in 2007 when I saw The Last of the Mohicans. I thought it was the greatest movie I had ever seen. I saw the film in 3D and I was amazed at the visual effects on screen. I still love that film, but it was a lot of time ago and I've not seen many video games since then. The Last Of Us was a video-game adaptation and I loved it. It was so much fun to see Joel and Ellie's journey. The cinematography was fantastic and the story-line was good. There was also some great action sequences. The best part of the movie was Ellie and Joel's relationship. It made me want to hug them for days. It's such a simple thing but it made me laugh and cry. I think The Last in-game was the most realistic game I have ever played. It took place in a zombie apocalypse. I've never heard of such a thing happening in real life but that is exactly what the game was about. I think that there are a lot more realistic video games out there but I just haven't had the chance to play them. I can only hope that they come out in the near future and I can play them when they are released. I would love to see them as a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If it's good enough for you, then it's definitely worth watching. I've only seen this on the big screen (the smaller one), and it really shows off the talent of the actors. The only issue I have with this movie is that it's kinda slow in a few spots. But, that's the nature of a documentary about a guy who had been a professional baseball player.  Helpful good movie. I really like it and think the director did a good job on it. I like the interviews that the people in the baseball field talk to, and they do a good impression of the people. It's also good to see how the people who are in the film felt about the situation. I thought it was a good film. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a little history on a famous game. . If it're good enough. I actually like this one a lot better than "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit". The story of this movie doesn't really add up that much, but I guess it's the only way to make a movie about a baseball game. It was also a good looking movie and the cast was all good. I liked the baseball player's personality, and his reaction to the "game" was funny. I also thought the movie got a bit heavy in the end, but that could be because it's really long and I think that's just how the movie is. Overall, I thought this was a great movie that is worth checking out.  and. It's definitely a great film and worth watching if you like baseball.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of all the movies from the "Pulp Fiction" series, but this one is by far the best. The actors are all great and the film is very well made. I am not sure if it's because I watched it on the big screen, or it's the fact that I don't like many action movies, but the film had me in it! It's really hard to describe this movie, because it's such a great mix of different genres. It's hard to pick a favorite scene, because they are all so great. The best part of the movie is when it's about the friendship between Jake and Mia. I know the story is a little strange, but when you see the two actors playing these two characters, you realize how great they are. The music was also very good. The whole movie was a nice change from what we normally see in these type of movies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a great mystery story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** A movie about a group of children living on a farm, trying to make a living. The story of the film is really sad and I thought it was really sad when I watched it. The movie is about the people who are farming, the children and the adults. The adults are mostly trying to get rid of the children so they can make a profit. There is a girl that is really good at farming and she is not really happy with the adults but I loved her. There are a lot of bad things about this movie but I don't think they are too bad. There were some times that it was a little sad but it didn't make me cry. This movie is a good one for the whole family to watch. I thought the movie was not really funny at all. The bad things happened and the kids did not really feel bad about them. They didn't cry or laugh about it either. It was just a little bit sad and it made me feel bad for the people that were living there. The only good thing about this one is the ending. It makes me smile. It also makes me happy that this movie made me laugh and cry at the same time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ [Note: The original version of this review appeared in The Village Voice and was entitled "Bruised & Scared", but we were too busy watching The Lord of the Rings and so decided to rename it to "Bread and Circuses" because that is how it was written. A lot of our readers may find it more accurate, but the title was chosen because it is a bit of a mouthful. Also, "Buncombe" and "Buck-Fee" are very similar names. --Ed.]   This is the story of a poor, but loving, black man who moves into a white neighborhood and has to find his place in a white society. His story is about his struggle to be a respectable person in a society that he is not used to. And his struggle is not without success and success, for he eventually finds himself on the wrong side of the law, and ultimately finds a way out of the situation he finds himself in.   It is a good film. It shows the struggle that the black man goes through. It teaches the story about the black struggle and the importance of education. It is a true story about what it means to be poor in a world where the rich have more. It also teaches the importance and necessity of education for those who have not.   a good story about a black man and a poor white man trying to survive in a racist society, a struggle which they both ultimately overcome.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   Story: The story is very simple and it's great that a movie with a simple story can be so effective. The plot revolves around the main character, a man who finds himself alone in the desert. The only other person he can turn to for help is a young girl he finds in the town of Desert Falls. The story revolves around their adventures, but it is the characters who drive the plot. The main character is very young and very inexperienced, and that makes him a good and easy to root for character. His character is the main thing that will drive this movie home, but there are also a lot of other characters to enjoy. They are not as well developed as the main protagonist, but they are fun to watch as well. There are some funny and touching moments between the characters. The film has a lot to offer as a story and a character driven movie. This is a great story and the characters are great. I really love the characters and the movie has a story about a man, a girl and a desert and it does an excellent job at telling that story. The ending is also good, but again, it's not a movie where you get to see a whole lot of the characters die. The movie has more heart than I would have liked, but the ending was a great ending.   Characters: The main characters are the main characters. They're the characters that make the movie great. The girl is a little bit annoying at times, but she does have a lot that makes her likable. The desert boy is a bit weak, but he has his moments. They both do a good job of developing the characters as they go through the movie. I love the desert girl, and she has a strong relationship with the desert boy. The boy is not a complete bad boy, but I don't think he's a total bad guy. He has a few moments where he's very bad and the girl is not always right with him. The character development is great and you really see how the main lead changes and grows throughout the movie, and it all makes the characters more than they are.  ....  What did you think?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I've only seen this one. I've never been to Hollywood but this is pretty cool. I can see why it got a remake. It's a cool, interesting story and the cast are great. The only thing I can't really say is that it isn't good. It was pretty good but the movie felt a bit like it had been put together too quickly. I'm glad that I saw it though. It definitely has it's moments but it wasn't very interesting. It didn't seem like it was ever going to be very good and I guess it should have been but it's just not what I was expecting. I guess this is a film that really is best enjoyed after you've had a couple of drinks and are more relaxed. It might not be your cup of tea but it does have some good parts. Watch it if you like an interesting story. I wouldn't say that it's the best Hollywood movie but it was definitely worth seeing.

The plot was not very good and the acting was not that great, but it was still pretty good, and the story was very well done. It took place in a future where a plague has destroyed most of the world's population, and people have become very dependent on the Internet, but there is a problem with the virus. The virus is actually being controlled by a group of people who want to see it destroy the world. I thought the plot was good, but the acting in the movie was very bad, and it made me very uncomfortable to watch it. But there was a good story and it had a lot of action. It's a very good movie, but its acting made it seem like a bad movie.

When a high school student named Kaito finds out that his crush is actually a girl, he takes it upon himself to break up with her. However, the only way to do so is to become a "bakuhatsu" - a ghost - and steal the spirit of the girl's former boyfriend, so that she can't find him. The film is about the lengths Kaito goes to in order to have a true relationship with the girl. In the end, though, he realizes that it's the girl that's the problem. Kaito is the one who should've broken up with the other girl in the first place.  The movie was directed by the Japanese film director Junichi Sato (a pseudonym). It stars Miki Kishida as Kaito, Shizuka Ito as Chieko, and Hiroki Yasumoto as Kazuaki. It was released on February 10, 1989. It won the Golden Lion Award for Best Film at the 20th Venice Film Festival. The film has received a lot of criticism for its lack of plot development, and for its overuse of flashbacks. However it has been a popular film in Japan ever since its release. It has been re-released several times since its initial release, and has become very popular with anime fans in Japan.  The film received the award for Best Director at the 18th Japan Academy Prize Ceremony. It is also the first film in which Shizuku is played by a woman. The cast also includes Junichi Kawajiri and Junichi Akutsu.

I am a little disappointed with the ending of this movie.    In the movie the guy (I think he is an ex-cop) gets shot by the cop (played by Gary Busey) and he goes to the hospital.  Then the cop is there.  The guy is dead.  I was just hoping that the guy would come back to life.  He has the body parts of all of his friends around him.  It is a very sad ending to this movie, but the guy does come back and I guess he is alive.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  "Babe" is a fun, funny, and heartwarming film. It stars a great leading man (Brad Pitt) and an equally good supporting actor (Sandra Bullock) as two women who meet, fall in love, and eventually have a child. The love story is played out with the utmost care. It is not a typical love story, as the love of the two women is as real as the romance between the two men. It's an emotional and touching film, and it's also a film with a great soundtrack, with a lot of great songs in it. The story is very entertaining, and the acting is top notch. The whole film is set in the 1920s, which is a time when things were still very different, and still very beautiful. The film is full of great performances and fun action scenes, and Brad Pitt gives a great performance.  I'm not sure how the movie was filmed, but I believe that the film was shot in a lot less locations than the film is meant to be set in. I believe the movie is filmed in different locations from a small town to the city. The movie is a little over an hour, and I think it was shot a little too fast. However, this was an enjoyable film, because the movie had a great story and a great acting performance. I hope that this film is released in a bigger way so that more people will see it.  the film "Babe: Pig in the City" has great scenes and great acting performances, but there are a couple of things that bothers me a little.    The film is based on the novel of the same name written by the great playwright George Bernard Shaw. The book was published in 1921, and was a best seller in its time. The play was made into a movie, which was released in 1920, and has been a big hit in its day.   I think that the movie could have been a little more well known. It seems like the film got very little promotion and it was never shown on American television. The fact that it was only released in Europe and in America is also a little weird. I know that the book was first published in 1929, and that it became a bestseller again after it was published again in 1931. However it is possible that the people in the film industry are just not familiar with the story. This is also an example of how movies are made. Hollywood is

I love the fact that this movie is a western. I'm a big fan of the western genre. I can think of a few movies that are westerns but this one is definitely up there. The movie itself is very well-paced and the story really picks up after a couple of minutes. The dialogue in the movie is good, the action is awesome, and the characters are great. The ending of the movie was just perfect. I am not a fan of long ending scenes but it was great to see a very emotional ending.

It is a wonderful story about people who try to do the right thing and are caught up in a very strange and surreal situation.  The movie does not tell you everything that Hocksey went through in his life, but you get a feel for the story that H.G. Wells and Wells' brother-in-law, Charles Laughton, wrote.  This is a good film that should be seen by all who are interested in photography.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________I was so excited to get this set! When I first saw the trailer for it I had a feeling it was going to be awesome, it looked pretty cool. My favorite part of the movie was definitely the ending, I thought it was a really good ending. The movie was all about a guy named Joe who was a truck driver who had to take a job to get a new truck and was hired to go to the lake to pick up some fish. The lake is really big and there were many fish and he had to go in the middle of it. As soon as he started to move he was bitten by a fish. He then had to swim in the lake all the way back to the other end to get back to his truck. The only thing he could think of was that he had a lot of fish in his truck and it was taking too long to get them. I thought this was a pretty cool movie and it didn't disappoint. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch a good thriller. I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 stars!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________, _________, _______, _____, ______, ____, ______________________. This movie is good, and it's got a good story and a good cast. The only problem is that the movie is pretty bad. I guess that's why they didn't make it a remake, because it has a lot of problems, and not the least of which is that it doesn't have a good script, and the acting is a joke. I don't think the movie was good, it was just a bad idea, because this is the same writer who made the first Terminator, and I think he's trying to do the same thing again with a different character and a different setting. So, this movie is not bad, but it is not great either. I would recommend this movie, but if you don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger, I wouldn't recommend it.  I don't know if this movie will make a profit, but I think the marketing of this movie should have been a little better. The movie doesn't explain what's going on in the movie. There's a lot to be done with the story, but the movie does not do it very well. The way they were trying to tell the story didn't work at all. This is a movie I would have given a better rating, but as I said, it's a bad movie, and you don´t really have to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  I've never been a huge fan of westerns but I loved this movie, and I didn't even realize it. The movie was made before the western boom, but it still shows the impact that the genre had on American cinema. The action is amazing, and the plot is easy to follow. The acting is very good and the characters are well thought out. The story takes place in the 1890s, and it is interesting to watch the evolution of the two men in charge, the local sheriff and the bigoted but good natured vigilante. It was hard to find a copy of the movie, so I am including a picture of the front cover. The picture has no information on the movie itself, but you can tell that the movie is from the 1890's, because the man on the cover is holding a gun and wearing a suit. This movie will appeal to anyone who loves westerns, because it is very well made.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* The film starts out with an interesting and intriguing character who we get to know, named Tom. He is a truck driver that is doing his last road trip. He and his wife, Mary, are traveling from Kansas to California. They are in a small town called Big Springs, Texas, and he gets the idea to stop for a few days to have a couple of beers. The night before, he decides to sleep with his wife in his truck and when she wakes up in the morning, he's gone. After some digging, he discovers that his truck is missing and he starts to search for it. The next day, he sees a strange man who he calls Mr. B (played by John Carradine). Mr.B is on a road trip as well and has lost his truck as well. He starts to ask questions and finds out that Mr.Tom is actually Mr. A, a guy from New York who was looking for a ride from Tom. The film follows Tom and Mr.A for a while, as they travel the road and make new friends. It's interesting to see a western that takes place in Texas with some pretty amazing landscapes. The story has some good action scenes, as well as some very good characters that we are introduced to. The action scenes are pretty intense, and the characters have some nice back stories and motivations for their actions. The movie also shows a lot of humor, as Mr. Tom and his crew are a lot like a comedy team. Tom is a big fan of Westerns and his friends all love to talk about them, as if they are just a part of their daily life. They have a lot in common with the Western heroes of the past. As a result, this movie really does feel like a Western. The characters are a little like the cowboys in the West and are great characters. They all seem like good guys who just happen to be in a western. This film really shows the differences between the old West and the new, and it shows how it can be a great place to live. If you are a fan of westerns, you will enjoy this movie. If not, you may still enjoy it, and there are plenty of good Westerns to be found.

The actors are good and the story is good. The music and story are just perfect. This is a good watch for any kid or any adult. It's a family movie and kids can enjoy this.  Review of DJD: ********** My daughter and I had seen this movie years ago and we loved it so much that we bought a bunch of t-shirts for our family. It is a fun family movie that has a great message of love and kindness. The story is about a boy and his best friend that go to a town that is full of horrible people. They decide to go on a vacation to help the town. The first thing that happened was a girl falls in love with them. When they get to the town, the townspeople treat them with so much love that they never want to leave. The boys go to the mayor and ask him for a place to stay. He says, "Sure, let's have a party." The boys are so excited and want to go. The mayor and the town are so happy and it all goes well until the boys are on a train that's supposed to take them to a party. The train goes off a cliff and they never get to that party. A boy on the train says, I hope I never get on a boat or plane because this could be me. The movie ends with a good message that says there are people in the world that are different and that it's OK to love them. This movie was an amazing movie and I'm sure I'll see it a few more times.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ What could be better than seeing a film where the villain is a really well-done actor. The film is about a criminal who comes into contact with a group of young men who have been sent out to destroy a special piece of art. The art, a painting by a genius inventor, is a weapon of mass destruction and the villain, a ruthless madman, is obsessed with it. The story goes that the madman and his wife get the painting and when he sees that it is a masterpiece he takes it home and begins to destroy it. One night he comes across a group who have come to destroy the painting but instead they bring it back to life and give it a purpose. The next day, they begin to destroy their own creations but the mad scientist escapes the room and takes a gun and shoots the group. When the police show up, the mad man is arrested and they have to decide what to do with the art. Will they destroy it or let it live? ___________________________ The film really does a great job with the villain. I felt that the character was well developed and developed in a way that made me care about him. The way he kills people with his gun is not something that is shown in a movie often and it was awesome to see it happen in a film. The villain was also a really great antagonist. He has a lot of motivations and is very cunning. I was also really intrigued by the art that he was after and his desire to destroy and destroy and have the world see how amazing it is. I really enjoyed the way that the film was shot and the cinematography really did a great thing for the film. There are some really great special effects in this film. I loved the way the character's face was done. The shots were a great mixture of close ups and long shots. I also loved how they added a little bit of humor to the film, such as a character getting the artist's work and showing his work to his wife and how he was surprised at how good it was. ______________________________ Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I thought the movie was quite good. The script was excellent. It was also well written, with a good pace. I liked the characters. They are very good. I really liked that the movie didn't go into a lot of detail about the life of the hero. The hero, who is an engineer, was in his 30's, and had a very interesting life. I felt like he didn't need to be all that much explained. The story is not very long, and the film was well made. I hope the author will write another movie." "I just wanted to say that the story was really good, and it's an interesting one. It's a very unique idea, and that is what I like about it. It is not just a normal love story. It tells about a man, who has the chance to have a normal life, but decides not to. The whole story is about how a person chooses to live life and what he chooses to forget. It does not need much explanation. It just makes you think, that sometimes people need to take a risk and not follow the normal paths, and go for the unexpected ones. And that's what happens. It makes you feel like the protagonist. I think the story is very good and that it will be interesting for the readers to see the ending." What was the last movie you saw?  The movie I saw was called "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."  So, that was the one I want to review today.  But, I want you to know that this movie has not been made by a big Hollywood movie studio, it is made by an indie studio called "IFC Films."      The movie was made in Sweden and Sweden is not in the big Hollywood studios.   In the movie, "The girl with the dragon tattoo" is a girl who is a famous actress.  She is famous in Sweden because of her role in "The Lord of the Rings" movie.  The movie is a Swedish movie made in Swedish by a Swedish director. The director of the movie is David Fincher.  He has directed a few films, but this is the one he has directed the most.  David F. Finche is the director of "The Social Network" movie, which was a very successful movie. The movie has a big success in the movie business and has been nominated for a lot and won a lot.

The director (I'll call him "Mike") has an amazing sense of humor, a great sense of action, and a wonderful sense of characters. He also has a wonderful touch with his dialogue, and is able to bring out the nuances of a character that you really feel for. This is a movie where you see the characters in action and then you feel their pain. The ending was the best I have seen in a long time. The characters really do get a second chance, and Mike does a great job with his script. I also enjoyed the music. The music is really great.

The film itself isn't too bad but the ending really sucks the life out of it. The characters are all likable but the one that sticks out the most is one of the police officers. His character is one that could have been really well done but the story didn't really take off from there. There's also a scene where he goes through a really bad drug experience but that's it really. The movie does have some good performances, some great action and even a few good laughs. But it all comes to a halt when the ending happens.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   "Dangerous" is an interesting film, especially for the time. It's about a small group of kids who live in a small town that is about to be annexed by a bigger town. The kids are all pretty ordinary kids who go to school, do their chores, play outside, go to sleep, eat breakfast, and then go to play outside at a playground. There's one girl who is a little trouble maker, who's the only girl who doesn't like the rules of the playground. She runs around with her skateboard and jumps fences. There are other kids who are also trouble makers and they all go to jail. They spend their nights at the local library and then have to go to their homes to sleep. There is also one boy who has a special talent for painting. He loves to paint and he loves to be admired by the other boys. When he is in jail, he's not allowed to paint because his painting is considered a distraction to the other prisoners. But he still loves to do it. The film was written by a writer named John Hughes and produced by a director named John Badham. The story takes place over a four day period. The opening scenes of the film take place during the four day time period. One of the most interesting things about the film is that the four boys are all played by the same actor, Paul Newman. There were no new faces to the actors and there was only one actor who was playing the same character throughout the film. When you see Paul Newman in a movie you are pretty much going to love him. This is one of those films that I really like because it has a unique style that really brings it to life.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I've Seen It All" is a great movie, and a very nice film. The plot is pretty good, with a great sense of humor and very well acted. I thought that the film was shot very well. It also contains a very funny scene with some really great dialogue between some of the characters.  The film is set in a large apartment building in the middle of the night. The apartment has many people living in it, all of them with different personalities.   They are all on a night-shift, working, at different jobs.  A man, known as the "Big Head", who is known as "the biggest guy in the world" is sleeping in a bed in the living room of the apartment.  He has a very interesting personality.  The film was filmed in Hamburg, Germany, and was released in 1982. The soundtrack was done by the British band, The Cure.  This is a movie for everyone, especially for anyone who enjoys movies about people who are not happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  I'm a huge fan of the movie, and it was pretty amazing.  The best thing about the movie is how the actors all play different characters. It was nice to see all the different sides of each one of them. The movie was a pretty good thriller. I'm glad it was as good as it was. The actors did a great job of portraying each character and the chemistry between them was great. The best thing is how they portrayed the characters. I was really surprised that the main character was so evil. It's pretty hard to get good performances from actors who are this evil, and I'm happy that the movie gave each one a chance. I liked the ending of the film because it was very unexpected. I think that there could have been a lot of more suspense in the movie if there was a lot more action. The film ended pretty well. I enjoyed the movie a lot.    If you like suspenseful movies, this one is a good one to check out. The first thing you'll notice about this movie is that it's a thriller. The main character is a cop who is trying to find out who is really responsible for killing a bunch of people. He comes across some very strange characters, but he's able to find a way to find the real killer. The acting was good. The character was really evil, but it was fun to see him do evil. The ending was a little unexpected, but I'm sure you'll see why it was necessary. The whole movie was good, and if you're a fan of good films, you'll probably enjoy this one.   Overall, I give this movie a 8 out of 10. It had a lot going for it. It looked great, the acting was great, and the action was great! I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good films.

It really shows that guys can have sex with their wives or girlfriends and still be married. This is also the first movie I have watched where I thought the guy was going to lose his virginity to the woman he had sex for the first sex.

I thought the whole movie was very funny. The movie starts off with a woman who's husband has an affair with his secretary. After he finds out she is pregnant, he tries to kill her. He also tries to rape her but she's able to fight him off. He leaves the hospital and goes to the local bar where he meets another woman who also had an affair. They go back to his house and he tries killing the baby by placing a hot poker in the crib. After she's in the hospital she is able to get away but when she comes out she sees the baby. The next morning he wakes up to find the baby dead. I didn't see the movie because of work but I thought it was very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The film was made by the great American director, Sergio Leone, about a man who becomes a drug addict. He starts with the worst of luck. His wife is having an affair, he has no job and he is not in a relationship with any of his friends. His mother has passed away and the family is broken. He does not have a steady job and no money. He is living on his savings, and he does not want to go to the hospital because he is afraid of dying in there. He thinks about the money that he has. In the beginning, the story does not move at all. The main character is always in the hospital. His life is so dark and it is a hard thing to see him in such a situation. He tells his friends about this problem and the friends do not want him to go back to the house where his family was. He tries to find a job, but no one wants him. One day he meets a prostitute and she gives him the money to go out and buy a pack of cigarettes. He goes out and the money helps him a little. He meets the boss of a restaurant and tells him about the pack of cigarette. He takes it to his friend, the waitress, and she agrees to give him a room. After that he finds a job and then the money goes better. He gets married, has a kid and his life starts to improve. In this way, his life is a bit like a fairy tale. But then the main character gets a car accident and loses his wife and he begins to use drugs. This causes him a lot of problems and he has to deal with all of them. His family is in a bad situation and his daughter is also in a difficult situation. The film shows the problems of the drug addict and how he tries to deal or solve them. It shows the life of a man in a poor situation. _____________ The music in this film was composed by the legendary, Sergio Martino. This film is considered by many as one of the greatest Italian films. The director did not give in to the pressures of being famous and he made this film because he had a passion for film making. In my opinion, this film is a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to everyone who is looking for a great movie with a great story and with a beautiful, emotional soundtrack. This movie is a great piece of art. I give this movie a 10/10!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ A couple of years ago I went to a movie in a theater with my wife and I had seen a lot of movies in the theater so we decided to go see "The Dark Knight". When we got there, we were able to see the trailers, and I thought this was going to be great, but it wasn't! I had to go to the bathroom and my wife went to the restroom as well and when we got back to the theater, the guy at the concession stand said he didn't have any food in the theatre, and if we wanted something, we'd have to go back to my car, and the movie would have to be rescheduled! So, my wife didn't want to get back in the car with us, so we left. So, the movie was about to start when we heard the movie theater staff calling for people to come out. So the guy was yelling at people and people were going out of their seats. I saw people on the ground, trying to get up. My wife got up to get some snacks, and when she went back to get her snack, she found that she was being restrained by the theater staff, and they were trying to handcuff her. She was trying to scream, but they were yelling, "Don't say anything, we're not going to hurt you. We are going to handcuffle you so we can take you back to your car." My wife was not in control of her body and she wasn't trying to fight them. So when she said "I'm not going back to where I was" they said "You are going back into your seat!" I started screaming and yelling and they finally took her out of the car and put her in the back seat. We were all standing there in disbelief. When we were leaving the theater the guy told us that they were going to lock us in a cell for the night, and he was going get us some food. I didn't understand what they were saying, but I didn''t want to go home! We went to my girlfriend''s place and talked to my family, and then my parents were trying get a hold of me at work, and my brother was trying his best to find me and the rest of my family. I couldn''t get in touch with them. Then one day I just got a phone call from my dad, and asked him if he could call me and ask me some questions. So I went over to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  Bruno Bertocchini (1917-1978)  (c) 1974, Columbia Pictures. A French producer and director, Bertocchi was a master of the comic-drama. His work includes such films as "The Three Musketeers" (1941) and "The Two Faces of Eve" (1960). His most popular work was "Le Monde," a melodramatic comedy that made its debut in 1953.  "Le Mondo," a French-language film, is the story of a young man's attempt to find a lover by trying to solve the mysteries of the Mondo Club. Bertocchio plays the owner of a Mondo nightclub who, with the help of his chauffeur, is trying to find an ideal mate for his daughter. The film is very stylish and funny. : I think it's very funny. The only thing I'd like to add is that this is a great film and I can't recommend it highly enough. I also really enjoyed "L'Atalante" which is about a boy who wants to be a great swimmer. He goes to a pool and then realizes that his swimming instructor is a woman. It's a funny film and very beautiful.  "Le Temps" is about two young boys who have a love affair. I thought this was one of the best films ever made. It is a good example of a comedy that doesn't rely on the slapstick of the '40s. , I didn't find it to be very funny but I think that's because it was made in the '50s, when the humor was very limited. "Le Témoin" is a very simple film that has a lot of symbolism. It seems to be about love but is actually a very serious film. "La Vérité" is based on a book by the same name. It was directed by Claude Chabrol and written by Jean-Luc Godard. The movie is about love, but it also shows some social problems. I think this is the best of Chabral's movies. "Lagoon" was made by the great French filmmaker François Truffaut. It has a very sophisticated and sexy movie. "The 400 Blows" is an interesting movie because it deals with the problems of people who are very much afraid of death. The director, David Lean, was very interested in what it means

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ "The End of the World" is a movie about a person who discovers a bomb that's been planted on an airplane and manages to get rid of it. The movie is very interesting, because it shows us the different people that were involved in the process. The people that did the actual work were called "The Secret Service", but they're actually just hired actors. They had no idea that they were being used. They did not have the right skills, or the right experience. They just did what they were told to do. The other people who were in charge of the bomb were called the "Special Agents", and they were all trained as "Special Forces". They were the ones that actually carried out the operation. The actual work, the real bomb, was carried out by a "Bomb Squad" of "Special Operators". There are a few scenes that make you think that there's a little bit of a conspiracy going on, because people who are supposed to be involved in this bomb, are not involved in it. They're actually working as actors. You have people who're supposed to have the skills and experience, but they didn't. They didn't have the proper skills, they didn t have the correct experience, they were hired by the Special Agents, and they're just doing what they're told to. They don't have any real experience, and there's no real skill. This is a very interesting movie to watch, and it does show us how difficult it is to get the bomb off of a plane, especially if it's a plane with a bomb on it. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in watching a movie that's very interesting. I give it a 7/10. I hope you enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed watching it!

The ghost, as the ghost would have it, was just a poor guy who was going through the motions. He had nothing to lose. I've seen worse scenes in horror movies, and this was a really good one. It made me laugh out loud a few times. There was no way the movie could have been any better. There are some good lines and it was well directed. I'd give this movie a 10 out of 5 stars, because I think the ghost could have done better. I'll see the movie again, because it was really scary, and it made me look for my camera and get my film.   I was going to write a review about this movie, but it was so funny.

It is too soon. I do not want to be too soon."  _____________________________  It's about the year 2027, the year of the first artificial intelligence, the movie "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" is released. The movie shows a future where mankind is divided into two factions: the Terminators and the humans. The humans, a group of soldiers are forced to work for the Terminator program and fight the human enemies. The Terminators are a superior fighting machine, which are able to do everything that a human can do. They are able in some cases to survive without human assistance, and the Terminator is the only one who can bring peace to the world. The human enemies are the people who oppose the Terminators. The people are forced into working for the program.  (There is a scene in the movie when the Terminator kills a child, which makes you question the morality of the Terminator. The Terminator is only a machine, and therefore it cannot understand human emotions and cannot feel compassion for people. He could only kill the child in order to keep his secret identity. This makes the movie very controversial, it was a movie that was controversial in the 80s. The main difference between the movie and the book is that the film shows the Terminator killing the child. The book has a scene where the Terminator does not kill the kid. The story of the book takes place during the first years of the film. I personally prefer the movie, it has more action, more action is better, but the movie has more story. The ending was a bit unsatisfying, but in the end, it still had the ending that

This sequel is not as good as the first, but still very good. It is also one of those movies that you will remember forever. I think that this is the best movie in the series. It was a very good movie and I think this was the best sequel to the first movie, "Cirque du Soleil," and also the best film of all time. The story line was good, and the car chase scenes were pretty great. The characters were all great and the film was fun to watch. I recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The film opens with a brief shot of a man on a motorbike, a white-and-blue motorcycle with a black seat. It's a perfect, dramatic moment, setting up the whole movie's tension. Then, in the first few minutes, we see the film's protagonist, Michael (James Caan), sitting in a chair in a hospital room. He's in a coma, and we can only see his eyes. His wife, Diane (Shelley Duvall), enters and is surprised to see him alive. They talk in a hushed, quiet tone, like they're at the end of a long conversation. Michael's eyes remain closed. He looks very tired, and as he speaks, he doesn't look at Diane. The camera, following Michael's body, looks at Diane, who stares at him, unable to believe what she's seeing. Michael doesn't speak, either. It seems he doesn' t remember a thing. The movie's pacing and story line are simple, but powerful. We see Michael in the hospital for a couple of hours, trying to remember how he got there. Diane takes him to his room and puts him to bed. She sits in the chair next to his bed, and his eyes slowly open. As he looks at her, he can't bring himself to look at her. He wants to leave, and she is very afraid. But she knows that she's only helping him remember his past. Diane and Michael spend some time together, and it seems that he's coming to terms with the past. He still doesn't remember his wife, but at least he knows she's alive. He calls her, and they talk. They seem to be talking about something personal, but we don't know what it is. It could be a memory, or it could be something more. They discuss his marriage, and the things they did in it. They are trying to come to terms, to find out what they did and why. As Diane looks at Michael, she begins to cry. She starts to believe that her husband was in love with her. She knows that they didn't do anything wrong, that their marriage was fine. As the film goes on, Diane tries to convince Michael to come out of the coma. He refuses, and he seems to be coming to realize that he and Diane are going to be together forever. The film's final act focuses on Michael, sitting at the edge of his bed. He

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. _______________. ____. ______. _____. ____.._____. _____.. ___________. ____________________. - A Good Day to Die Hard  The last film I reviewed, I wrote a negative review of The Departed. But after seeing Die Hard I can't help but change my mind about it. This is one of those films I've loved since I was a child and now as an adult I am still captivated by it. I really can't explain how I love it so much. It is so realistic. I remember when I was about 6 or 7 years old I got this VHS tape of Die Hard. I loved this movie because I always thought it was so cool. I would always watch it with my father and he would always make me watch it. But he was the kind of dad who would always be a little drunk and he was never really a "bad guy" so he would never really go for it. It was always me and him together. So this time around I decided I would just watch Die Hard with my dad. This was a pretty good idea. But it was the only time I watched it. That is why I am going to start a list of things I love about this film. And they are all things I would never think of watching a movie about.  First off, there are no special effects in this movie. There are some explosions, and we get a good look at some of the action sequences. But none of the effects or special effects were done to any great effect. They are all very realistic. The movie just looks real. The action is real. There's a scene in this film where the guy is about to shoot a guy and then a bullet hits him. And he falls to the ground. There is a blood splatter on the ground, the floor and he is really hit. The blood splat looks real and you can actually see the blood on the floor. And the guy who is on the top of the building is actually on the third floor. He looks so much like he's on the first floor and you think, "Why are we not seeing this in the movie?" But that's just part of the movie and I think that it really sells the realism of the film. The way they handled the camera work is really good too. The camera work never looks like it is moving or anything. It just seems like it's in the
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If you want to give a movie a bad review, make it bad and bad about a very specific movie. You should know, of course, that I do not mean "bad" in a generic way (it is, after all, a movie). "Bad" is a specific kind of bad: bad about something specific. This is a movie about the Vietnam war, specifically about a man named James. He's a young American kid in Vietnam, where he is stationed as a Marine. One day, a group of young Vietnamese boys, mostly boys, are sitting on the beach when suddenly they hear the helicopter. They see a bunch of guys on board, with guns, and suddenly there's an explosion. James, who has a young girlfriend named Jennifer, gets in the chopper. He hears screams and gunfire, and he knows that this is not normal, because this is the Vietnam War. It turns out that James is the last survivor of a group that was going to try to get the American soldiers to evacuate the village they are occupying. This village is called "Gardenia," and it is full of children, and most of them are wounded. When James gets out of the chooper, he finds that the kids are still alive. The helicopter pilot and James are in a very close proximity, so they are very scared. The chopper pilot is also scared, because he is a man of action. He is about to fly over the gardenia, and when he sees this, he will definitely die. Then James will jump on the helicopter and save him. James takes his gun, shoots the pilot in the leg, and then shoots the kids one by one, one by another. It's a great, very tense scene. The movie ends on a great note: James kills his first Vietnamese boy and kills his last Vietnamese girl. The end. So far, so good. The problem is that James has killed a girl. When he sees the girl, he thinks she's his girlfriend, so he immediately jumps on her, and starts playing with her. She cries, and says that she is not his girlfriend. She has a boyfriend. It doesn't take much time for James to find out that she's right. He doesn't know why he shot the girl. James is angry and he kills her. He has just killed a little girl. But, of the four Vietnamese kids, only one is still alive, and James kills her too. He then

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The movie is about the life of a girl who is on the run from a killer. She meets a group of soldiers who want to take her down. They are called The Special Forces and are a special force who are sent in to take down anyone that is a threat to the American government. The movie has good acting by the actors and is very interesting. The Special Force is not that well trained and not very good at their job, but they do try to get their job done. The film is also very good because of the background story and how the Special Forces are portrayed. The special forces has to fight for their country and the movie shows the different ways they are able to do that. The story is also good because there are many different people that are involved in the events that are going on in the film. It is also nice to see the film as it was meant to be seen, which is a very long time ago. The acting is good and the music is good as well. The way the movie is told is also interesting. It takes place over a long period of time and the time period is in the 20th century. The only problem with this movie is that the ending is a bit rushed and the ending could have been better. It could have also used some more editing in the movie. Overall the movie was a great one and I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  The film opens with a group of men sitting around a campfire talking about how they are going to kill a man they call "Mr. G." who is said to be in possession of a large cache of guns. The two leaders, Billy the Redneck and Bill the Cowboy, get the idea to kill Mr. G by using the "Redneck Killers" in the area to distract him. They decide to use a group called the "Cowboys," which is a reference to the fact that these guys have their own "cowboy camps" in their area. Billy and Bill decide to take care of Mr.G by first shooting him in the leg, then shooting him twice in the head with an old.32 Colt revolver. After this, Billy and the other guys head off to camp. At camp, Billy is seen giving out candy to the kids. Later on, Billy finds out that the "Mr G" has a cache of weapons and is heading to town. He and the others head to town, with Billy being the leader. Billy is joined by Bill, who is a "Redleg." The Redlegs are a group made up of Rednecks who are used to being around other Redneck Redneck groups. Billy, Bill, and their group of Redleg Redneaks are seen shooting the local Sheriff, Sheriff's Deputy, Sheriff, and Sheriff's deputy. At the end of the film, Billy, Billy's Redneck friends, and Billy's wife are all in jail, but they escape from jail after Billy's group leaves town.  Overall, this movie is good. It is a good action film with a good storyline and is good to watch. It may not be the best action movie ever, but it is a pretty good film.

It's amazing how he manages to make me love him in the most horrible and annoying way.   I love how he is such a down to earth person, but he's very funny. He's a real actor and the only reason why he is in this movie is because of the director, which is why he makes it funny, but at the same time makes me really hate him. This guy has everything, he has everything going for him, and it's all about his money.  , but the movie doesn't stop there, it continues by having some good action scenes, and there are some good scenes of sex, that is great for a movie.   the best part of this movie was when he starts having sex with his wife. This is one of the most beautiful scenes in this movies, I'm sure you've seen a lot of action movies but never seen a woman get naked before her husband. I'm pretty sure you'll be shocked.  . So if you like action, you will love this movie. If you don't like action you will hate it, because it is so horrible.   a good comedy movie with some good acting.

The ending of the film is well done and well acted, but it does not go far enough. The film is too short and has a bad ending. There are plenty of other stories in the universe that are equally or more interesting. If the film had been more interesting, I think it would have been better. I will keep watching other parts of the universe but I will have to put this one on the list of things to watch out for in the future. .  I was so sad and disappointed. I know I'm not alone in my feeling of disappointment. I can't help but think that a movie like this should have had a longer run time, like 3 or 4 hours, instead of only one. There's too much information that could have been given to us about what is happening on a global scale, and if it was so short, then why not let us see more of it? I was also wondering about the movie, as well. I was hoping for a deeper, more detailed look at what is going on in this universe. I didn't think I'd see a story so good as this on the big screen, but to my surprise, this movie is great. I would recommend it to everyone who loves space movies and sci-fi. The story and characters are very interesting. It makes me wonder what is real and what is not. I also enjoyed the music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Man on Earth (2011) I'll be honest.  I am not a big fan of this movie.    I've seen it twice, once on DVD and once on TV.  The movie is so bad that I've had to read a few other reviews to get some idea of what I am in for.  In case you've never seen it, it is about an old man who gets a new wife, but has to wait until she dies to pass away.  But that's not the worst part.  I guess the movie had a problem.  I was never sold on the premise that a man who is a centenarian can't have a normal relationship.  And, to be honest, the whole story has the feel of a soap opera.  It also seemed to be a bit contrived.  Some of the characters seemed to have been put in to add some excitement to the movie. I guess that's the point, isn't it?  But I don't think the film was as bad as the reviews made it out to be.  For me, it was okay, but it didn't really grab me.  However, it did have a few memorable moments.  One of the funniest moments was when a group of old ladies in a room all start crying.  While they all cry, there are people watching them, thinking they are the old lady who died.  Then the old woman gets up and asks the others "why do they cry?".  And the next thing you know, they are all screaming and laughing hysterically.  Also, the ending was pretty great.  This movie had no idea what it wanted to be and never really found it.  After the credits were rolling, I was hoping that it would end with the old man passing away. But, that didn't happen.  So I guess we can say that this movie didn't quite live up to its expectations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really loved this movie. The plot is just as much fun as the movie itself. The story is about a girl who was a child prostitute who decides to go back to her mother's place after finding out about her father's involvement with her pimp. She gets some money from her father, and decides to make a new life for herself, so she decides to become a teacher. She meets a student named Chino who is very shy. She decides to be his teacher's helper and help him become a normal guy. When she discovers that she has a brother who also is a teacher, she becomes upset because she believes that he will do the same as her. Then, a day comes when a girl from another village wants Chino to teach her. She asks Chino what he thinks about it and he tells her that he is not a teacher and that she should ask her mother. She does that and the girl tells her to leave, but he refuses. She wants to get back at him, so Chino has a talk with her, and convinces her that she needs to go to her village. Chino takes her there, and is about to give her a letter for a job when the girl's mother comes. She tells Chino that her son has left the village, and she doesn't know where he went. Chinos says that she will not let his daughter go alone, so they go together. They find a man called Zico who is the mayor of the village and who has lost his daughter to a curse. He says that the girl was his wife and that they had a son together, but that the boy was taken away and that he has been searching for him. Chico says that it was his responsibility to look for his son and that his wife must know where they are. After that they are attacked by Zico's men, and Chino manages to save Chino's wife, but they are both killed by the Zico men. The next morning, Chino is about leave for his village and sees that Zico is waiting for him outside. He tells him that he needs a job, and that a girl needs a teacher for her little brother. Zico says he can help him get the job. Chaco accepts, and Zico takes him to his place, where he has a big house and lots of animals. The movie ends with Chino in a room with Zico, and he is asking him where he is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Saving Private Ryan" was an excellent film.  I've seen it twice, once when it came out in theaters and once when I watched it on DVD, and I've always been impressed with its impressive technical performances.   Its dramatic focus on the bravery of men in battle was a great theme, and the actors did an amazing job.  The story follows a squad of American soldiers in the final days of the war as they are ambushed by German soldiers.  The film's script was written by Stanley Kubrick and his wife, Christiane.  Stanley Kubrick died in 1999, and it was Christiane Kubrick who oversaw the editing and scoring.  This movie was very well received by the general public and the military as well.  I'd like to see a re-release of this film because I think it is a great one.  As of today, I can't find it online, but I'd be interested to see if anyone else has seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  The first time I saw the film was on my parents' 35mm projector at their house in the late 60's. I was 6. I had just found out about this film at a friend's house and my mother was convinced that this was one of the best movies ever made and my father would love it. It was the last film I ever saw before moving out to the big city where I would live for the next 14 years. When I saw it again on my second viewing in the mid-90's, I was amazed at the film's visual style. It wasn't too long before I decided that I wanted to make a movie with that look. This is the story of a small town in upstate New York and how a small group of people try to save their town. I've always been intrigued with the concept of the film because of how people react to what happens to them. The town is full of the usual "every man for himself" people who just don't realize how their actions can have a bigger impact on the world. The story is told in a very simple and clear way that makes it easy to follow and understand. It's a film that is easy to relate to and it's a very positive film. It shows the world through the eyes of people who are doing what they think is right but ultimately what they are doing is not right. This movie is also about family. I think it's very important to show the relationships between people in a movie. They are what make a family. If you want a happy ending to this film, then you will not like this movie. But if you want something that you can watch and think about and learn a lot about family then this film is for you. It will make you think about what it is to be a family and you can see the way people react in a negative way when a family member is in need of help. The ending was a little bittersweet but I was happy that the ending made sense. The movie has a lot of great actors and you will see them all in this movie, but I think I will always think of the great Steve Martin in this film. This film is one of my favorite films from my childhood and it always makes me laugh. I always feel like it is one part of a trilogy of films. I hope that this movie will be a good influence for kids who want to become filmmakers.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  (A.K.A. The movie where everyone is sooooo cute and the main character gets a girl. Also, the ending is so great)   So, it's been a long time since I've seen this movie. It's a really good movie, in my opinion. It takes the basic elements of a romance movie and makes them much better. I've heard a lot of people say that the movie was too slow and didn't get much out of it. The thing is, that's not true. It gets pretty good and I do think that the pacing could have been a little better, but it was still pretty good. The story itself is really interesting and I think that it was well written.   The movie is centered around a guy named Chris (played by a really cute guy named Aaron), who is having a really hard time trying to find someone to date. He is single, and he thinks that the only thing that will make him feel better about his situation is to find a girl who is looking for a guy like him. He starts to go to a local club, where he is a regular. He meets a girl named Rebecca (played beautifully by Anna Kendrick). She's very cute, and she has a crush on Chris. It seems like she's looking for him too. Chris has no idea what's going on, but he decides to try and figure it out.  , but the main thing that I like about this movie is that it does a great job of telling the story without being heavy handed with it. This movie is very easy to watch, and I didn't feel that it went over any time constraints. You can watch this movie for a long period of time and not be bored. It does a really nice job of showing how a guy is able to move on and move on without anyone saying anything about it. It shows a lot about the emotions that people go through, and it's a nice message to take away from this movie too.  -This movie really shows what you're supposed to do with someone who is really interested in you. There are a lot more things in this movie that you're not supposed to tell someone, and there are a few things that you should tell someone. You really do have to be careful when you're talking to someone, because they might find out what you've done. They might find that you like them a lot, or that you don't like them as much

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The Great Escape is a film which was a very hard to watch at times. I thought that the characters were very flat, and they could not be in any way believable, they seemed to have some kind of mental disorder, I mean even in the most difficult scenes there were characters that were totally out of character and completely out of place. One thing was very clear in this film, this is not a film made by the American director, it was made by a Frenchman. I guess it is a bit too late for an American to do a movie about France, it would have been very interesting. But I suppose that it is not too late to make a film about a country that is in a very difficult situation in its life and which has a great influence in the history of the world. I must say that the most interesting characters in this movie are the American soldiers, the one that stands out is Major David H. Rennie. This man has been sent to the Congo by the US Government in a situation that nobody knew what would happen, he is to help the natives fight the war. The problem is that he has not been very successful in his job, he doesn't know the native language very well, and his English is not that good. He is only able to communicate with the natives in the simplest terms, and he can only communicate with them if he has a gun. I have to say that this man was the most believable character in the film. This is not because of his character, it is because of the way he is presented. The film shows a man that has never been to the jungle before, he has never seen the natives, he does not even speak their language, he just understands their gestures, but he does have a very good idea of how they think, and this idea comes from the very first moments of the movie. I mean it is very clear that he is completely lost, it makes no sense to him why he has been put there, but when he starts to understand the natives better, he starts getting a feeling about what is going on. In a way it is similar to the story of St. Francis of Assisi, the story was told by St. Louis, but St. Francois is not portrayed in the same way. And this is how the film is told, very simple. The story does not seem to be very important at the start, but it is later that we find out what the story really is about.

The story and characters were really well developed, but it was not a movie to go out and see, or a movie that you have to watch in a single sitting. It was a nice movie that was well told and interesting. It had some good scenes, but most of the time it was more of a journey than a movie. I do recommend watching this movie if you want a good laugh and good drama. I would recommend it for all ages.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********I've had this movie on my shelf since I saw it at a small local theater in the mid-70s. It was in its original 3-D, so I think it was a pretty cool experience to be in the middle of the action and see the camera pan around the entire room as the bad guys came and went. The acting was pretty good, but they didn't have the best costumes, so some of the faces look a little weird. It's not a bad movie, but the special effects are a bit cheesy.*********

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1941) is one of those movies that was made as a cheap motion picture.  The plot is a rehash of the classic tale of a woman with a nasty reputation who becomes a prostitute.  It was made for a pittance of the cost of a film made a few years earlier, and it was shown only on Saturday night.  In the end, it was a pretty good picture, but it didn't really do much to sell a story that was so boring.  And this movie was a lot more like "The Little Black Sambo" (1932) than "The Best Whorehouses in Texas".  So, why did it have a great success?  The story of the woman with the nasty reputation was very similar to the story of The Little Black Chippewa Girl (1931) that was in my collection for years.  So the story was familiar, and the people involved were very familiar to me.  I found it easy to believe in the woman's reputation and I found myself very interested in the man's story.  And I was also very interested to see how he became a whore, and why he did it.  For years I have been wondering why this story was so popular, but I finally figured out why it was popular.  One of the people who appeared in this movie, the famous actor, Clark Gable, is a member of a prominent and well known family of actors.  His grandfather, the legendary Clark Gables, was a well known and popular actor in the 1920's and 30's.  He was one of the few black actors of his time.  Clark Gabled had a very famous father, and his mother, his aunt, and one of his uncles were also very well known black actors. Clark Gabel, a talented and successful actor, was also a very successful writer.  At age 15 he wrote and starred in a play called "The Man With the Golden Arm" in which he won a gold medal.  When he was 17, he wrote his first screen play "The Blue Bird" and received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award.  By the age of 20 he was one half of a comedy team with his best friend, Howard Keel.  They both starred in numerous movies together.  After they divorced, they formed a comedy duo, the "Gables" and performed in hundreds of movies together and became

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  I am a huge fan of this movie and it was a real treat to see it. There were some great surprises in this movie. I think the most shocking part was the ending. The end scene really had me thinking, I wonder how things will turn out next. The ending was also very clever and it is great to see a movie make such a strong statement and not hide it behind a silly story. The movie was not bad at all. The acting was very good, the music was great, and the ending was very cool. I really hope that this movie is used in a way that the story can be told and that they will be able to use it in the future. I was very excited to see the sequel, I would love to see how they would try to make it a movie that will last a while.

The story line was not interesting. The only thing that made it worth watching was that the action scenes were just amazing. It was not worth the money, and I am sure the only reason I watched it was because I had to see a new action movie. I am not going to watch it again. It's just not worth it. I hope they bring it back. The people who wrote the script did not really do a great job at putting together a good story line.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** (9.6/10) ***** "The Last Jedi" has all the ingredients that make a great Star Wars movie. The cast is great. The action is awesome. The special effects are amazing. The plot is really fun. The characters are all great. Even though the story is slow and not as exciting as the previous movies, it is still a great movie. I liked it so much that I'm gonna watch the other movies. There are so many other great Star wars movies. I'm still looking for one with a Luke Skywalker and a Darth Vader. This movie was perfect for me.  I just hope that they make a new Star Wars film that is similar to this one. It has so much potential.  and thank you Disney for another great movie!  -J-

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Dark Tower  Subscribe to The Dark Zone on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToDarkZone   The Darkest Tower - A movie that will not only entertain you but will leave you with a smile.       The Dark Tower, a multi-film franchise of Stephen King's magnum opus, is set to be released in theaters on August 4th. The first installment in the series, the film The Gunslinger, came out on January 17th, 2015 and became a critical and commercial success, garnering a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. The second installment, The Dark Towers, is slated to arrive in theaters next year. The film stars Idris Elba as Roland Deschain, Matthew McConaughey as the Man in Black, Tom Taylor as Jake Chambers, Abbey Lee, Jackie Earle Haley, Fran Kranz, Katheryn Winnick and Ron Perlman. In The Darkers, the journey of Roland Deschace and his allies is taken to an even darker and more twisted place than ever before, as the world around them begins to change.    In an interview with Vulture, director Nikolaj Arcel and star Idris elba talked about their relationship with King, how they came up with the film's mythology, and how the Dark Tower came to be. The Dark Gunslinger was an absolute joy to make, as Arcel says:  Stephen King is one of the most brilliant writers of his generation. When he writes, he writes like a madman. He's very, very, I think, generous with the way he lets you feel. His novels, which have so many layers to them, are like a great painting — you feel as if you're peeling away layers, and all the parts start to come together. That's what we're going for with The Darker and Edgier, the first part of the film.  The Darkened Lands was a film I had no idea we were going to make. Stephen King is very generous with his time, and we just went with it. I think Stephen King loves us enough to let us do whatever we want, so we just kind of went with the flow. I don't know how he feels about us doing a movie about guns
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   I don't even want to say it but if you can get a copy of the movie then you have to watch it.   The movie is an homage to the classic "Jaws" film, with a few twists. The movie is about a man who finds a giant shark in the ocean and it has a huge hole in it's head. He uses a gun to shoot the shark and kill it but it comes back up to kill him. The guy has a shotgun and shoots the shark in it. But the shark starts to change it's shape and it turns into a man. It takes the guy and takes him back to it's home. The shark's home has a big pool with some kind of monster in it but they have to use a boat to get into the water to find it. It turns out the man is a robot. But he is very good at swimming. The robot uses the gun to make the shark attack the man. He has to get to the surface to rescue his friend and the shark has to eat the man to get rid of him.  So in the end the guy has to take a shark back into the sea and kill the shark to get it's DNA to make it a human.  . ,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ A classic is a good classic. A good film is a classic. _______________ It is one of the great tragedies of history that it was such a wonderful film. It is a movie that could be watched in one sitting. There are only a few minor things I would change about it. There were two scenes I did not like, one was when the young woman (the main heroine) and her mother, the daughter, and the husband (the protagonist) are in the kitchen making a pot of soup. The young woman is making a nice soup but she keeps forgetting to put in the salt. The mother (the father) tries to put the salt in but she can't. The father and the mother go out and come back to find the daughter in tears, the husband at the window trying to talk her into putting the salt into the soup. _______________________ I enjoyed it a lot and loved the characters. I have to say the only one that was a bit annoying was the wife. She was a typical wife and never showed much emotion. I always loved the way she acted in that movie. __________________________ A movie for my generation. I loved it and can't wait for the sequel. I recommend it to all lovers of a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Django Unchained" is a great movie and one of the best action films ever made. It has a great soundtrack by the way.  I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino.  I can't say I am surprised that the movie has received a ton of Oscar love.   The main problem with the movie is that the only thing it has going for it is the great score.  It has great action and an amazing script by Tarantino but it really comes down to that great score and its awesome.  Django was a slave and he was whipped so bad that he would never be whipped again.  This lead to him being tortured and abused by a plantation owner and many other plantation owners who didn't care that he was a good slave.  He was forced to work long hours and beaten daily and when the day was over he was beaten even worse.  There was no mercy in the plantation owner's heart.  And this is where the movie comes to a dead end.  The movie does try and tell a story and has some great action scenes but the story doesn't develop at all.  Even though the film has a lot of action scenes and some very strong performances.  But there is nothing that truly drives this story forward.  I have no idea what is going to happen in the movie but what I did see didn't make me want to see more of it.  Instead, I wanted more of Quentin's brilliant score. I am not a huge movie buff so I can't vouch for all the movies in this movie.  All I can say is that if you are a fan of the Tarantino films and if you like action and a good story, then you will love this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I have always wanted to write a movie review for a movie but never got around to it. Well I finally did and I thought this was a great movie. It was good. It's hard to tell but in this movie we get to see a few things that were not shown in the original. For example there is a good scene in the beginning of the movie with the girl getting a little bit of attention. It got a little too long but I think that is what I was expecting. It did have a good story to it, which I think was what made it worth seeing. There were a lot of little details that made this movie. The music was good and the director did a good job of making it look real. I think this is a great way to get some of the things that you need to see in a movie and I think it will help with the ratings. I give it a 8/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In case you haven't seen it, the story is just as good.  Kirk, the captain, is having a nervous breakdown when he sees a strange craft, and then finds that there are people on board, including an elderly woman. It seems that her husband, who died in the space shuttle, was not aboard the craft, which is strange because his body was never found. He and his wife are still alive and on the ship, and she believes that he has taken the ship's name, and is trying to bring her husband back. Kirk and the crew, including the Captain, have to fight for their lives against the evil alien creature that is attacking the ship. This is not a space battle movie, it's a horror movie. It has the most horrifying effects that I've seen in a movie. You will cry at one moment, and you will be screaming at another. The movie is not for the faint of heart. The actors are good, and the movie has good music. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't show any of the movie during the scene where the old woman talks about her husband.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)*************** I have seen a lot of movies over the years, and for some reason, this one was a little hard for me to get into. It was not because of any particular aspect of the movie, but rather because I have always found myself unable to relate to the main character. There is no doubt that there is something very wrong with the man. He seems to have been raised in a very peculiar way. For example, he seems to be so afraid of having to interact with other people that he seems almost completely unable to do so. That makes him a bit of a lonely character to me. The other characters are also pretty dull. But the story of the hotel and the characters who work there are a little more interesting. The story is also not that deep. But that does not matter, as you will not be able to see the ending. That being said, the film is a real pleasure to watch. The cast is good, and the direction by Wes Anderson is fantastic. I love the music by Benjamin Britten, and I especially love the piano. The Grand Budapest is a good film, and it should be seen by all those who have a soft spot for a nice film with a little bit of humor. I think it is a film that will not only make you laugh, but it will make you think as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (The Good) The Good: _______ (The Bad) The Bad: _____ (The Ugly) The Ugly: _______________________ (My Rating)  A nice start to the series, this is a movie that is fun and enjoyable. The movie has a nice plot that is nicely executed. If you haven't seen the other two series and are new to the anime/manga, this movie would be a good start to them. It is not a very good movie. If there was a sequel, it would be even worse. The story is weak, there are some good points, but there are also some bad points. The main character is not very interesting, and the girl that he falls in love with is not as attractive as the girl from the other series. The ending of the movie is very bad. It just ends with the girl running away. The characters that we love the most just leave. The only good thing about this movie is the movie quality, the animation and the music. The art is great. The soundtrack is good. The plot is good, the characters are interesting, but it is not much of a movie. I give it a 3.5 out of 10.  Helpful in the movie, and I think it was important for the characters to see each other. If it wasn't for that, it probably wouldn't have been much of an anime/movie. I like this movie, but I don't like the story that it has. The girl from this movie was so bad. She was so annoying and so bad in the movies. I just thought she was a very annoying character, but she was very funny in this movie. She is like a cat. She has no personality at all. The guy is really not that interesting. The boy is also a little bit annoying. The way the story is told was a bit of a let down. I liked the art and the sound. I didn't like this part of the story. I think that it should have been the other way around. I did enjoy the music and the animation. I also enjoyed watching the girl and the guy having sex. I enjoyed watching it. I thought it was a good way to end the series. I guess that it would have been better if they were more of a couple.Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was entertaining and fun. It has a good plot, it is funny, and it has

It was a really funny movie and I wish they would do more of it.

It is about the relationship between a married couple and the relationship of a husband and wife. The movie was shot in Europe and the filming was in the countryside and the movie was very romantic and funny. This movie is very funny and very romantic. The main characters are so charming. This is not a serious movie but it is a very romantic movie and I like that. The music was very good in the movie and the lyrics were very funny. The acting in the film is very good and the story line is interesting. There is no plot twist and it is very sweet. This a good romantic movie to watch and a great film. I recommend this movie to all. I give it a 10 out of 10 and if you are a lover of romantic movies then this movie is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- If you like action movies and you don't mind a bad movie with a terrible ending then I highly recommend this one. You'll find out pretty quick that this is not the real story of the movie. Instead this is a movie made for the sole purpose of making money. I can't tell you how many times the ending of this movie was rushed and there was no real build up to the movie to the point that you could believe it was a real movie. There was a part where a man is running and he gets shot by a guy in a car but the guy is nowhere to be found. There is a huge chase with many cars, motorcycles and even a helicopter. We are told this is the real ending of the film and we see the helicopter come down, but no one else is in the helicopter. Then the helicopter crashes and we never find out who the pilot was. There were other very bad acting choices made by the actors that really added to the film's failure. The worst acting was by the lead actors. Their voices were so bad that you knew they were making up their lines. You would feel so bad for these actors when you watch this movie. This movie was made to make money and you'll see they didn't even try.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________   The movie is about a kid named Tommy, and a girl named Jenny. Jenny is a friend of Tommy's dad, and she is also Tommy's first crush. Jenny falls in love with Tommy, but he does not feel the same way. Tommy is very shy, and Jenny is very strong. He is not ready for love. He always has to ask for approval, and if he asks too many times he gets teased. Jenny and Tommy are always together, and Tommy wants to break up with her. One day, Jenny leaves Tommy, then he sees Jenny again. He wants to take Jenny back, but Jenny says she does not want to. They decide to stay together. Jenny gives Tommy a birthday gift: a sword, a gift that Tommy has wanted for a long time. Jenny's parents are worried about Tommy's relationship with Jenny. They do not know about Jenny's secret sword. Jenny tries to get Tommy to come out to them, but Tommy is not sure he wants to.   This movie is a romantic comedy. The movie starts off with Jenny and her parents having a talk about her feelings for Tommy. Tommy tells Jenny he does want to break-up with her, but that he does feel like they are together. They end up getting married, and are a happy couple.   the movie is really funny, but the action scenes are very well done. There are also some really touching moments between Tommy and Jenny. The action scenes were really good. I loved the scenes where Jenny's dad beat her with a hammer and Tommy came in and helped her.   to finish up this movie, there is some good music in this movie. It is great to hear music when you are watching a movie. The ending is really good too. There is a happy ending, and the whole movie is perfect for the right movie.   The movie is rated PG-13. I am not sure what the rating is for this movie because it is a little more mature than some of the other movies that are rated PG. This movie has a very mature tone, so I am really glad that it is rated.   "Frozen River" is a great movie. I have watched it a couple of times now, and I think I would definitely recommend it. If you have a kid, I would recommend this movie for them. This is a perfect movie for the kids. I think it is perfect to watch with them.

This movie is about the loss of a beautiful, happy life, and what it means to live a full, meaningful life. This is a movie that has everything. From the acting, to the writing, to even the music (which I didn't think was great but it got better over the course of the movie), this movie has it all. The acting is excellent and the characters are believable. The movie is filled with so many beautiful moments and the actors were able to bring each one of them to life. It's very hard to find a bad thing to say about this movie. It has everything and it's not a typical horror movie. If you like a good horror movie, and don't mind a little bit of gore, you should watch this movie, if you haven't already. I've never been a fan of the horror genre, but I was surprised by how much I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who has never seen it. I'm very happy that it was nominated for a best picture Oscar, I hope that the movie makes it to the big screen. I give this movie a 10/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: or his "Aurora Borealis" (1962), Orson Welles (the actor) does a very fine job as an out-of-work filmmaker in a fictionalized version of the events leading up to the "great war" of 1914. He is a man with nothing left to lose, and a good deal to live for. The story centers around a man who has gone mad, and who believes he has been chosen by a deity to save the world. He tries to follow in the footsteps of the great heroes of history who have fought and died to save their world, and tries to save himself from himself by doing what is right and saving the people who love him. Welles has a way with the camera. The movie is filled with fantastic shots, and some great moments that are sure to make you look back at your life in a new light. This movie was very influential for many years. or all of Welles' films, "Ave Maria" is my favorite.  …

I have been a die-hard horror fan ever since I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, and had seen so many of the slasher flicks I had to have seen this one. I was at a friend's house and watched it on my family's VCR, and my parents had to watch it on their VCR (they were the ones who made the decision not to buy a TV at the time) when they got home. They both loved it and said they had to see this one too. I watched it in the car with my parents and it made them feel very comfortable. The movie wasn't too scary, and you were right in the story as you watched the killer get his comeuppance.  My favorite moment in the movie is the end, where you are at the house when the killer comes in and you see him standing at the window of the front door. It just makes you feel that you know him and that he knows you. - July 15, 2010It was my 1st movie!

He had just been stabbed by his own son! I remember feeling a great amount of sadness. My heart stopped for a moment. I didn't know what to do. I was so sad. But I did what I had to do to survive."  (From the film 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' )  Rated 4.00 out of 5 by 2 people from Great movie. The director has done an outstanding job. I thought the story line was really well told. The acting was very good. I loved the movie. (Posted on 4/15/2017)  From a family that lost a loved one, to a man whose son murdered him, this film follows the quest of a police officer (Jake Gyllenhaal) to bring justice to the murderer, and his struggle with the fact that he has no idea who he is dealing with. (A crime thriller and a psychological thriller). The film is set in Miami, Florida. The film follows a young detective, Jake Gyllenhall (Gyllenhaall) as he investigates the murder of a family. The detective is told that a boy, named Frank, was killed by his father (John C. Reilly). Frank is also a young police officer who has been assigned to Frank's case. Frank has an odd ability to see into the future and is able to tell when his father will kill him. Gyllengall soon learns that Frank's father has a son that killed his own father and that Frank is to be Frank's last witness. The Detective must decide whether he will let the killer go free, or if he will take him down. Gylfeld is a very good actor. He has an incredible energy and a great look and sense of humor. The movie is filled with great acting. The story is gripping. The action is realistic. The ending is a good one. It is a bit hard to get into it at first, but the more you think about it, the more it makes sense. I think it is worth seeing, if only to see Jake Gylfell play the part. He is wonderful. (Review

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   If I had to rank all of the movies I have seen so far in terms of overall quality, I would rank them in order of how much I enjoyed them.   1) "Trouble" (1999)  2) "The Last Samurai" (2003) .   ______________________________________   There is a bit of an inconsistency in terms that I see in reviews. On one hand, a lot of people seem to enjoy the movies, but on the other, there are also some who seem to have a very negative impression of them. My feeling is that the majority of the critics who are negative are actually the ones who were expecting something different from a movie about samurai. So, if you enjoy the movie, I can understand your dislike of it.   The plot is basically about a group of samurai (played by Tom Cruise, Sam Neill, Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, Sean Penn, Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman) who have a reunion in Japan to see the last of their masters. The samurai's are trying to decide whether they should continue to live as samurai and hunt for the next master, or change into modern society and live in peace. There are also other characters (including a samurai woman) who help the group along the way, while the main plot of the movie focuses on the samurai.   the acting was mostly great. Ben Foster (Troubles) is a really great actor and he is given a lot to do. The other performances were mostly okay. There were some good performances and some good acting, but there were also some bad acting. The worst part of the acting in this movie was Tom Cruise. He did not have the best performance, but he was the worst actor in the movie. The good performances were all from Tom Cruise except for one or two. The bad performances were from Ben Foster and Tom Cruise and they are the ones that really pissed me off. I did not like Cruise at all in this one. The only good thing about the movie was the soundtrack.  : __________________: I was very disappointed in this. I was expecting a very different movie from this. If you look at the plot and the acting, you will not be disappointed. It is not like any of the other movies I had seen in the "trouble with the samurai" series. The main plot was very boring. The characters were not that interesting, but the movie had some nice music. The

This will be one of my movies that I will watch again. ___________ See more __________ See less ____________ See all ________ _________  My Summer of Love (1946) - This is one of those movies that every good film fan should watch, especially if you are a big fan of movies like "Citizen Kane" or "The Wizard of Oz". This movie is very much like a dream. It's a beautiful film with a great cast and a great soundtrack. The movie is set in a beautiful town that was built by a rich man, who lives there with his beautiful wife and their two children. When they move to another house, the rich man has a dream that he wants to buy a farm in the country and build a beautiful home for his wife and his two children, who he believes will inherit his fortune. Unfortunately, the house is built on the wrong spot and a fire starts in the house. He starts to leave, but the house burns to the ground. The rich man's wife gets very scared and goes to sleep. The two children are asleep. When the house burned down, she went to look for her children, but she couldn't find them.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ _________ A good film, if not perfect. The first half of the film was a bit slow. The story is interesting and the characters were interesting. I didn't mind the characters. They were all well done and played by the right actors. The rest of the movie was just a bit too long. I don't know if the characters needed to be longer, but I think it could have been shortened a bit. I'm not a fan of fast paced films. I prefer a slower paced film. However, this film was just too long and not as good as it could be. The ending was also very bad. I wish the film had gone more with the characters instead of just with the plot. _____________ ____________ _______________ If you like fast paced, action packed films, then this movie is for you. I think the story was interesting and well done. It was a very fast paced film and the action was pretty good. The characters were also very well done as well. I thought the music was very good and the cinematography was good. It wasn't my favorite film of the year, but it was still good. __________________  2017-01-28 21:42:32  I thought the story in this was very interesting. The action was very great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ It's a good thing I was only going to see this movie in the theater. I've heard so much bad about it and I'm just going to say it. I'm not going to make fun of it for being the same old cheesy movie. I thought it was pretty good. I mean, I'm old enough to have seen many cheesy movies. I just never got tired of them. But this was a pretty good one. It's one of those films that was actually good in the beginning, and it never really got good. It just kept going. I was never bored of it. It was just a good enough movie that you can enjoy for a while. But it never grew on me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a well-made film with a good script and a solid cast. I liked the movie a lot.  I had a good time. I have seen this film a couple of times and I enjoyed it each time.    I also had a couple friends who had seen it and it was really good fun.  I saw this on a movie night on a Monday night at the theater and I went to see it with some friends.  It was not the best film on the dvd but it was a good fun film. I would give this film 4.0 out of 5 stars.   This movie is about a man who has just been married and he finds out he is getting a divorce.  He decides to go out and see some women to see if he is still interested.  So he gets a date and the date tells him she will go to a club with him to see some movies.  They go to the club and she tells him all about her life and what she likes.  When they go to another club the woman has a car accident.  She is killed.  The man takes his date to the morgue where the coroner says her heart was a mess.  Then he gets back on the road to see the woman.  His wife, who is very angry at him, thinks he killed her.  This is the guy's last chance to get the woman back.    The movie was about a very nice guy.  If you have never seen a movie about a guy who has to go through something like this then this is a good one.  I enjoyed this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The film's title is inspired by the fact that most of the movie's characters are "ghosts" or "demons" or something of the sort. The story follows a man who is searching for a woman who disappeared while hitchhiking. The only way the man can find her is to travel through a ghost town in order to find the person who murdered her. Unfortunately, there are a lot of things that are not quite right about the film. The ghost town's inhabitants are portrayed in a very unrealistic manner. There are so many ghosts that one gets the impression that they are actually ghosts of the people that are now dead. There is also a lot going on with the "demon" who kills the woman. It is hard to tell who is who because the film never really tells us. The people also never seem to know who they are, even though the story clearly suggests that it is the man who will one day find his woman. The acting of the film's characters is pretty good. However, one character that really stood out for me was the one who was the demon. The character is not only very entertaining, but he actually seems to be in touch with the spirit world. The film has a lot more plot than one might expect, but the film really lacks any sort of suspense or excitement. This may be because the story is based on a true story. The plot does not really concern itself with what is happening, but instead focuses on the journey of the man. The main problem I have with the film is that the film seems to focus on the characters rather than the story. Although the story does not concern itself in too much detail with the characters, it does have a few of the characters that are very entertaining to watch. The characters in this film are very well developed. One of the main characters even has a good supporting character. The way that the characters are portrayed, especially the main character, is also very well done. However the way that they were portrayed was very unrealistic. The actors in this were not only good, but they were also able to portray a lot that the story lacked. This makes the film more interesting than it might otherwise be. If you are looking for a good ghost story, you should look no further than this one.

The first movie, 2011's The Dark Half, was an epic and exciting adventure, and while I didn't care for it very much, it had the potential to be a truly great film. With a much better script and a much more developed story, the second movie, The Dark Horse, has been a much different movie than the first.    The Dark Forest (2012)   One of the most underrated movies of all time, The Black Riders are a group of four people who travel the country in an old school bus in the 1950s to find a missing boy.  This movie is one of the best in the series and one of my favorites, and the story is great.  I have not seen it in a long time, and I am glad I finally did.  The movie also has a great cast, and even a good score.  It is a very short film, and a great movie for a very quick watch.  Posted by The Film Detective at 10:16 PM I'm a big fan of The Dark Night Rises, but it was a bit of a disappointment for me. It was a good film, but not nearly as good as The Dark Prince. I really enjoyed the first film, The Gunslinger, and this movie was definitely a step up in terms of visual and storytelling quality. The action scenes were amazing, and there was a lot of them, which made the movie much more exciting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Great Escape "  is a film that I am in awe of.  The film is about a young British officer in the Royal Navy who is captured by a German U-boat in World War II.  The story of the film is quite interesting.  The film does not give you a lot of information about the ship or the crew.    You are just given the gist of the story.  If you are looking for information about a ship you will be disappointed.  It is interesting that the movie does not do a good job in explaining how a submarine works.  You have to take your eyes off the screen for a minute and learn about the submarine and its history.  I am also not a big fan of this movie as it is a bit slow at the beginning.  But by the end of the movie it is very suspenseful and exciting.  This is the best film I have seen in a long time.

If you like action movies, you will love this movie. Great action scenes, good acting. It has great sequences and a great plot. A good story about a woman that tries to survive in the desert. This movie gives you the sense that this woman can't survive in a desert. She is not strong, but she does try to survive. You will also see that this is a movie about survival. I would have liked more to be said about the characters. I just wish that we could have seen more about them. I think the story was interesting and I thought that I would like the movie even more. I loved the acting, and the story. A nice movie. A movie that you will remember for a long time. I also would like to give a few words about the director. I was very happy that he made this movie with his wife. I have seen many movies with great directors but this is one of my favorites. He is very talented, and he made a great movie that is very different from other movies. It is not a war movie, but a movie that shows the survival of a woman. It makes you think about the survival and gives you a feeling of what it would be like to survive alone in the world. It also shows the effects of a war on the environment. It gives you an idea about what it must be like for a person in the future. This is a good story, with a good acting, great action scenes. I highly recommend this movie, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it. *************  Rated 4 out of 5 by jdw from A great movie I am giving this a four stars because of the film and the cast. The film is a great story about survival in the arid environment of the desert in southern Iraq. The main character is a woman named Laila, a young woman who works as a prostitute and who has a father that has died and she is raising her brother who is also a prostitute. She finds out that the Iraqi Army is coming to destroy the area and she must leave with her brother. She does not know how to leave but she knows that the only way to survive is to make a run for it. Her brother and her family have no money and they have to live in this area for a few months before they get out

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  The Best of the Best  (1992)  By: Stephen King   The best horror films have a special ability to evoke a strong reaction from the viewer, even if they're not exactly scary. There are a few that will leave you in a state of absolute terror, but the best are the ones that leave you with an emotional response that will haunt you for the rest of your days.   I've never been a big fan of Stephen King movies, and I've never liked any of his characters. But I do have a lot of respect for the man, and his ability to write a story that keeps the reader hooked to the end, while making you completely uncomfortable. And The Mist, with its creepy setting and eerie atmosphere, is one of those horror films that pulls no punches.   the Mist (1992) is the best horror movie that Stephen King has ever made.   to be fair, it is the only horror movie he's ever made, but it is still the best. It is one that you'll never forget, even after watching it a hundred times. The Mist is the story of an old woman named Annie who is haunted by a ghost who has been haunting her for many years.  - Stephen King on The Mist   the Mist is a perfect Stephen King story: a small town that has gone to hell and back is thrown into a nightmare of horror and terror. It's a story about family, and about the terror that haunts all of us at one point or another.  ...   Stephen King's novels are not always scary, but when they are, they are very scary indeed. In The Mist you are gripped by the horrors that engulf the town of Mistaken Point, New York, which is inhabited by a large number of mentally ill people. When a local man, Dr. John Gulliver, goes missing, his family becomes increasingly concerned about his fate. As their fears become more and more real, a dark shadow rises on the horizon, threatening to consume the town and its people. The best thing about this movie is that it is so good.   a film like The Mist cannot be explained in a couple of paragraphs, but here is a brief breakdown of what makes it so good:   - The Mist has one of the best opening scenes of any horror film I've ever seen. A small town in a very bad condition is being thrown into total darkness. You can feel

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I've seen a lot of films. It seems I'm always missing the good ones.  The film is a true gem, with a powerful and very moving plot and a strong cast of characters. It is an intimate story, and a truly powerful one. , with Robert Loggia ( The Godfather ) in the title role. He plays the son of a small-town butcher. The film is set in the small town of Chateau-Lavaux in the Provence region of France, about 30 years before the First World War. There are a few other characters, some of them played by the same actor as Robert Loggins, and they are the ones who help in the plot, but it is Robert Loggs' character, Gertrude, that really holds the film together.Gertrudes' life is full of hard work and hard times. She has a son, who is about a year younger than her. He has never been educated, and is a hard worker and a good worker, but doesn't know how to read. His mother is a very strict woman, who takes care of him very well. The boy is always with his father, and often goes with him to the fields. When he is not working, he is playing. He is very happy, and his father always takes care about him, even when he is a small boy. One day, he and his parents are walking along the street, when a car passes. They have a pleasant conversation with the driver, and then the boy starts to cry, and cries some more. His father takes him into the house, and gives him a bottle of whisky, which he puts to his mouth. As soon as he has drunk it, he starts crying again, and starts to get up. The father tries to comfort him, but Gertrs starts to throw a tantrum, and even punches the father in the face. Gertris gets up, and walks back home, crying all the way. The scene is very moving.The father is very upset. He goes to the local church, and tells a priest that Gertras has been crying because he didn't get his whisky. The priest says he is allowed to drink a little more than usual, and that it is OK for the boy to drink some more of his father's whisky. Gercrides doesn't want to go back to the house and talk with his mother

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ __________ _____________ _________ _______________ ______________ ____________  1.3 out of 5 stars This is the kind of movie that I was looking for. I saw this a few years ago, and I enjoyed it very much. I am a big fan of the old Star Trek series, and the way the series was brought back to life by this film is fantastic. The old series was always about space battles and not about the human struggle in space. The Star Trek films were about a very real, very human struggle of trying to get along with your fellow man. This movie was about a human struggle. In a very touching way, Kirk was the only one who seemed to have a real problem in trying to cope with this. I was not able to figure out who the alien was. He seemed to be someone very close to Kirk, but I could not quite place it. In addition, it was a very emotional movie. This was not a happy movie at all. I felt that this was a film about a man who was trying to help a fellow man, who was struggling with the same problem. I thought this was very touching and well-done. I enjoyed this very much, and highly recommend it. This is a film that will not let you down. ________  2 out of 1 stars The movie is an odd one. It seems like a story about a guy who was shot, and then lost his memories, and went back in time to find out who had shot him. It's not the same as the classic Star Trek movies, where time travel is used to find a murderer. This time, time travel was used to help the character solve a murder. I didn't think it worked. I mean, it's a movie about a murder, but not a time travel movie. I have to say that this movie does not hold a candle to the Star Trek universe. The plot is pretty much a plot, and not a very well-written one. There are a couple of good moments in the movie. The alien in the opening scene was very well done, and even though the plot wasn't too good, it still had me hooked. I really enjoyed this movie, and would have loved it a lot more if it had been longer. It was a little short, but it was well-paced. It made me sad, and at the same time I felt happy. I don't think I would have
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ (4.5/5) * The movie is very, very good and very well acted. There are many great moments in the movie. The characters are all well developed and the story is very well written. It has a strong emotional connection to the viewers, but not a strong plot. This is probably the only movie in the world that has this connection. (4/5). ____________________________________________________________________________ * A very well done movie. If you like dark and suspenseful stories, this movie is for you. ______________________________________________________________________ (4) * There is a lot of action in this movie and it is not all in good taste.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________   "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a classic. I love Sergio Leone's Westerns and this is one of the best. There are some scenes where Leone was trying to make his characters "cool" and the only thing that worked was when he gave them a gun. The bad part is that the gun was never used once and the characters didn't use their gun in any action scenes. There is some good acting in this film but the best acting is reserved for the good guys.  "It's the Good, it's the UGLY" was a classic western and this film has the same vibe. I think this film should be watched before "It's a Wonderful Life". This film is also worth watching on its own because of the great acting and some good music.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why is this movie bad? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, the plot is horrible, and the violence is disgusting. Why did they decide to use the same movie as the film with the same title and the same director? What the hell is the point of this movie? I was not a fan of this film, but my friends were. I would recommend you do not watch this film if you are under 18.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight.  If you haven't seen it, go see it.    This is not your average Batman film.  I had no clue what to expect from the movie when I first saw the trailer.  The Dark Knight was the perfect example of how great the Batman films are and why they are considered among the greatest of all time.  I had no idea if this would be a good film, or if it would be as good as the others.  When I first watched the trailer I just assumed this was going to be another Batman ripoff.  It wasn't.  This was a good Batman movie.  In the first 15 minutes you get a nice intro showing Bruce Wayne as he was in his early days.  Then we get to the first Batman fight scene.  We are shown Batman's fighting skills, and how he uses his batarang to cut through the thugs.  After a couple of fights Bruce's skills are shown.  He is able to get to a helicopter and get to safety.  Batman takes out a couple more thugs before we get a big fight scene with Batman.  At this point Batman is really putting on a show.  Here is a good example of a scene where you have to see the fight to understand what is happening.  Bruce is able get some of the thugs to run off by shooting them.  There are some more fight scenes in the movie and a couple in the helicopter scene.   The movie was fun.  Like many Batman films this one is filled with action, and it is exciting.  One thing that I did not like about the movie was how the action scenes were edited together.  They cut together scenes where there were no weapons being used.  Also, the movie does not seem to be very good at showing Bruce's anger.  Some of the scenes were just too dark.  You don't really see Bruce's rage.  Most of the time he is just calm.   This movie is very violent.  All of the action in this movie is great.  Unfortunately, there are a few scenes that I thought could have been edited better.  For example, there is a scene at the end of the movie where Bruce and some thugs are fighting.  Now if Bruce had a gun he could have shot one of the guys, but instead he just kicks one of them. I also thought that the fight scene between Bruce and Bane in the prison was

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Chill" is a good, solid film, even if it's not your typical, campy comedy. The cast is pretty good, with Steve Martin as the wise-cracking, but always hilarious, lovable librarian, who has no problem telling you about the "big chill", the "Great White Flood", and other such things. In fact, the whole movie is a fun, fast paced adventure. The story itself isn't the best, and it doesn't go anywhere, but it's funny, and that's all that really matters. The "big" climatic scene is quite good. It's just a little over the top, but there's something about it that really works. It also doesn't hurt that Martin has the best laugh in the movie, and there's a nice scene in the final sequence, where the whole town is singing and dancing. Martin is so good in this film, and the rest of the cast is also very good. The music is pretty cool as well, but I think the "real star" of the film is Martin himself. If you haven't seen it, don't even bother looking it up on YouTube, just go see it.

It is a very well done movie. The story is interesting and the cinematography was good. This movie was not really about sex but it was a movie about two lovers in love and they love each other deeply. The characters were real. The movie is well written and the ending was a good ending.

I really enjoyed this movie. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The characters from this world were great.

The story is very good and it is very entertaining. The art is excellent. The soundtrack was very fitting. The ending was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you don't want to be spoiled, or you don' want to see a "best of" list, then don't read the review below.  I am not a "bad guy" who wants to spoil your movie experience.   So don't be mad if I don't talk about what's going on in the movie.  I don' t want to ruin it for you, but I want to give you the chance to read a spoiler free review, and I am not doing it because I want you to see it in a certain way.  So what I'm going to do is give you a summary of what happened in the film, and then you will decide if this is the right movie for you.  This film follows the story of "A" and his two best friends, "B" and "C".  They are all from the same town, and have been friends since middle school.  "A", who is the "smart one" of the three, decides to "go to the big city", to "make his own name".  He meets up with his best friend, "C", who he meets in a bar.  But, they quickly get into an argument over the way they think, and how they act.  They end up fighting over something else, and this is when "B", the "funny one" turns up.  Now, B is a loner, but "A' sees this as an opportunity.  B shows up in A's life, and convinces him to join a "group", that is supposed to be a "buddy group".  B, who seems like he has a problem with his "self", is supposed, in this movie, to help A make friends.  After getting in the "buddies", "B' is supposed  to help his new friend, A, get a job.  He then starts getting "involved", and they end up at a rock concert.  Then, "A'" "goes to a party, and falls in love with a girl.  The movie then cuts to A' and B's apartment, where they are about to have sex.  A thinks this is a mistake, but B tells him that he can't.  That is when A's "self" shows up, and tells B that he needs to make a choice.  What choice?  A, is supposed "to kill
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ [Poster for the movie] It's an old movie that's still entertaining to watch. The story is about an American pilot, John (Spencer Tracy) who has to fly his P-51 Mustang fighter for the British in a mission to attack a German radar installation. He manages to get his plane down in time to save a group of civilians. The movie is about flying as well as the story. The characters are really great, you get a real sense of the pilots in those days. The cinematography is fantastic as well, I never thought I would be able to see a fighter pilot at work, in a fighter plane. The soundtrack is great as well. There are also a few other pilots who appear in the movie as well who are also very well cast. The actors are good in this movie and you really get to know their personalities and strengths. This movie is an old classic, if you want to see an action film with a good story and good acting, this movie is a great choice. ____________________________________________________________________ [Pilot's Log] [This is a pilot's log, which is often used by the military to record events or to make sure that things are done properly. In this case, it's written by John's wife and son and his mother, who was also a pilot. He's in the process of taking off on a mission when he receives a coded signal that indicates the radar is on the ground and not in the air. He makes a decision to head for it and is told by his commander to go in and see what's going on. The radio is jammed and the pilot must find a way to re-establish contact. He meets the Germans, and the situation becomes a very tense situation, but the pilot's coolness in the face of danger, and his determination to do the right thing, keep the situation under control and help the people in the village escape, keep him in the good graces of his commander.] I was flying the Mustang #43-2-0-0 that we nicknamed the "Buster", for the sound it made as it plowed through the air at full throttle. As we climbed out of the valley on the evening of December 21st, we were told that the Germans were going to attack. We were told not to make any movements until the radio signal came through that the enemy had been knocked out. I was told to fly by the radar. I tried the signal. No signal

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Rocketeer" is a really good movie that is a very good sequel to the movie "The Rock" starring John Glenn. This movie is very faithful to the original movie and the story of the pilot, Dave Scott who is sent into the moon on a mission to find the alien planet that was crashed on the moon years ago. Dave Scott gets very into the mission and soon becomes the only man who can land on the alien moon. This is a great movie with some great scenes and special effects. The action in this movie is really amazing. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than director Peter Sellers. I really recommend this movie to fans of "The Fly" and "The Right Stuff". I also recommend it for those who like a good western. The movie " The Rocketeers " is a must see movie for any action fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hush" (2014) was a solid movie that could have been much better. The story, and the acting, are good but not outstanding. It has some great scenes and is a bit of a thriller, but not a great one. The characters, especially that of the lead character, are a bit annoying, but then again that is a common occurrence in many a thriller. I will not be buying the sequel, but if you like the movie, then there are plenty of good ones that come out every year. It is a good one for the summer time, with some great action scenes.  If you like thriller and are looking for a good action movie, you should give it a try. "The Dark Knight" (2008) is a great film. It really does take us back to the 60's and gives us an excellent story. It was good enough that people watched it in theaters, and then it was remade. It did get a lot of negative reviews, but I can understand that because it was a remake, and not a completely new film. If you like superhero movies, then this is a must watch. If not, then you will probably be disappointed.  "Hacksaw Ridge" (2016) is an excellent movie. This movie is a true story of a World War II hero, a man who refused to be a prisoner of war. His name was Desmond Doss, and he was an African American who fought in World War Two. The movie is well made, and has great performances. It will leave you with a very strong feeling of empathy, and that is important when we are talking about war. It also features the very good performance of Andrew Garfield as the main character.  The film is about an African-American soldier who has a very difficult life. It shows his story of growing up in poverty, and fighting for a place in the army. It gives us a lot to think about, and this is what you should do with a film that has this many emotions and takes us back in time. This is a movie that will keep you thinking, and will be with you for a long time. #2: "Hell or High Water" (2017) is the sequel to "Hell and High Water". It is the story of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who is the first person to be elected President of the United States in 1960. He was shot in the head and died from the wound. The first

And yes, it was great to see a good-looking and talented woman, and to see her have a romance with a man of the same profession. This was also a very good, funny, and funny-looking movie, which had a lot of fun. And there was a good ending. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good looking movie, it's the one where you see a bunch of men, and not one woman. The girl was a good actress but not a very good actress, so you see her doing different things, like getting raped. You see some women with black eye and bruises.  The one who is the killer is very sexy, and I'm sure that she was a real killer.    There is a guy who is like a killer. I was really interested in that part, but it was too hard.  The plot was too complicated and I couldn't understand it.  I like that it is a nice and nice-looking movie.  In a movie that is about the mafia, I think the mafia is the one that is a bad guy.  This movie is not like the mafia movies from the 80's or 90's.  There are some good characters in this movie and the people are all well-designed.  My favorite is the man who is a real detective.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I like this movie, but it has some problems. I like the fact that it tells a story from the point of view of a girl. However, I don't like the way it does this. Instead of telling a story of a boy, the story is told from a girl's point of VIEW. In the beginning of the movie, the main character is a little girl. In a flashback, she is shown as a child, and then in the middle of the flashback, we see her as an adult, and so on. It is very hard to take in all the information. At times, it is hard to follow what is happening. In one scene, a girl in a dress is being tortured and murdered. I have to say that this movie has a few graphic scenes, but they are well done and in no way disturbing. I think that this is a good, but not perfect, movie. _________________________________________   The girl that was kidnapped by a girl is kidnapped by an evil demon that has the ability to seduce any woman. When she is about to be raped, the girl gets an idea and kills the demon. The girl is then free, but the demon is still around. One night, he shows up at the girl's house and tells her that she will become his wife if she will give him her virginity. The demon's only condition is that he will have sex with her every day, and that she must sleep with him as much as possible. After that, the demon starts to get violent, and tries to rape her several times, but she always manages to escape. After a while, she manages to get pregnant and takes an abortion. The movie ends with the girl being sent to a mental hospital to recover. She is then released, and she gets a job at a candy store.

This movie takes a very serious look at what happens to an innocent child, when his mother and sister are killed. The child grows up and learns about the reality of violence and is able to turn around and live his life. He has a wonderful relationship with his stepfather and is also able to find peace in his life and family. This is a movie that everyone should watch, especially if you are interested in the world of the Vietnam war. The Black Stalf is the movie that brought me back to the Vietnam conflict. The movie is also great for those who are interested, to learn about the people that were on the ground during the war. It is a great movie to learn more about those people and the war itself. The book The Black Horse is also a great read. It can be purchased on Amazon or you can find it in bookstores.  No reviews yet.  the Black Stallions: A Memoir of War and Redemption by Daniel P.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ This is a very nice movie and is worth seeing if you have seen it before. This movie was not made to be a "classics" movie, it is just a very enjoyable movie. This is definitely not a movie that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. This film has a lot of humor, a lot more than you would expect from a movie made in 1960. There is some sex, which is not as common in 1960 and the humor is not very subtle, but it's there. The movie is set in New York in 1959 and focuses on a man named Ray, a car mechanic and a prostitute. Ray and his partner are both very nice people and have a good relationship. They're not exactly the best people, but they are not bad. There's a man called Paul who is Ray's best friend and they run in the same circles. Paul is a rich and well-to-do man and he is also an alcoholic. Paul has a big house and a lot to lose. Ray tries to help Paul but Paul wants a lot from Ray and he keeps pushing him into things. The only good thing about Paul is that he is an alcoholic and he doesn't have a drinking problem. Ray is a good man who is always looking for someone to help him out. Paul takes advantage of Ray by giving him a lot and when Paul is done with Ray he has nothing. Paul also gets a lot for himself, he becomes a doctor and becomes very rich. Ray gets a bit resentful and jealous about all of this and he begins to hate Paul. Eventually, Paul gets into the same type of trouble and it gets to a point where Paul has to kill Ray. Ray then becomes a very powerful man and becomes a drug addict and he kills Paul to get his revenge. I think the movie is about the consequences of people and how they act when they have too much. The first half of the movie was pretty good. It had a lot about drug abuse and about the relationship between Ray and Paul. The second half of this movie is where it falls apart a bit. I don't think it's a good idea to make a movie in which people are killed for no reason. I also think it would have been better if they had just made it a one-hour movie. The last part of the film is not that interesting, it's just boring. I wish they would have left out the sex scenes. Overall, this is a great

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ This is a great movie. I loved it. The movie is set in a time when there was a huge rebellion against the Romans. We learn a little about the rebellion. We get to see some of the people involved in it. I love the fact that this movie is a "true story". It is not a fairy tale about some guy who has a dream. It is about real people, about the people that were involved in the uprising. It does a great job of showing what life was like in Rome. The only problem is that it was so slow. It was a slow moving movie. It did not seem like there was much happening. But I loved the movie. There were many characters that we got to know, some of them had a big part in the story. It all came together to tell a great story. There is a part in this movie where we see the rebels meeting up in the woods. They are talking. Then there is a big explosion and everyone is killed. I thought that was very realistic. Then it tells how they were taken to Rome. We see how they are taken into a house. We hear what is going on. Then they are given a bunch of gold. They try to take the gold. Then we see a big battle. I am glad that it ended. This movie has some of my favorite scenes. It tells the story from the rebel's point of view. The rebels are talking about how they should be fighting the Romans, instead of trying to take their gold. That was great. I liked how the rebels talked about the Romans and the things that they had done to them. I also liked how they talked about how the Romans were doing to them, because of their religion. I think that was good too. I enjoyed the fact the movie didn't show the Roman Empire being destroyed. I really think that would have been a waste of time. This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It has a lot of great scenes. If you want a good time, go and see this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If there's one thing that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire  gets right, it's the movie's ability to make the audience feel as if it's one of the teens, because it's impossible to forget that Katniss Everdeen is a teenager. She's still getting used to the harsh reality of what she's being forced to live through and that's part of the power of her story. She doesn't care that the Capitol wants her to starve to death, she doesn't really care about the rebellion, she's just so confused about why this all happened to her. It's a tough place to be, and it's what keeps Katnus going even as she feels like she's slipping away from the world. When Katnisse finds out about the Hunger Games, she gets really excited about it, because she thinks she'll finally be able to go and participate. But the Capitol tells her that she can't go because she's already dead, so she's forced to participate. That makes her even more depressed because she wants to go but she knows she'll never be able. She knows that she'll die eventually and she's scared that she won't be able ever to live with that knowledge. And that's what makes this movie so brilliant, because even though Katnits has no hope of surviving the Hunger games, it also makes you want to watch her die. She wants to be happy, she wants her sister back, she loves her parents, she has a sister and a brother and a whole family she loves and wants to protect, she just doesn't want to be part of that. She has so much love to give and she wants it. She just can't bring herself to give it. So, yes, The Hunger games: C, despite the terrible ending, does give us a lot of emotions and it does make us feel what it's like to feel like a teenager in this messed up world. This is a good story, but it's still a story, so there's no reason to think that the movie is any more than a collection of pretty images. And while those pretty images may be beautiful to look at, it won't make you feel any better about your situation. The Hunger films are beautiful to watch, but they're still not life. They don't make us believe in the possibility that life is worth living. I don't know about you, but I'm sure there's a lot more I could say

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  5.0 out of 5 stars ______________  I would never recommend this movie, but it is a good one. I have seen a lot of bad films, and this one is pretty bad, but I'm not sure I would call it that. The story is about a group of people who have been in a mental hospital for over 50 years. The movie starts with a man named Ray in a wheelchair and a girl named Sue, who is his caretaker, talking about how much they have changed. Ray, as a boy, was the only one who was ever in a chair and was in a lot worse than Sue. This is a movie about a man's life in a hospital, and that was all well done. The rest of the film was a little hard to watch. It was a bit confusing, and the characters seemed like they were in a bad dream. But that was a good thing. I enjoyed it, but at times I felt like I was watching a bad movie. I guess you can't be too careful.  4.0/5 stars ____________________________  in a movie that was pretty bad and made me feel very confused, but a good job by the director.  "THE CAST OF THE DAWN" was released in the year of 1987 and was based on a true story. I don't think this movie is too bad to watch, but its not too good. The cast of the movie is very good, and I don´t remember the names of the actors very well.  a very good movie, and a great cast, but you might be better off watching a movie like "THE BIG LEBOWSKI" instead of this movie. :)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sick of this old, sick of this stupid movie..." (Meryl Streep) It's always good to see actors still working in film.  So we get to see Meryl Stree, still doing what she does best, as the tough but sexy matriarch who runs the home for the "poor, sick and elderly."  As always, Streep is terrific as a tough woman in a very tough world.    As a child, Meryl was a victim of child abuse.   When she was nine years old, she had a terrible asthma attack.  Her father was a doctor, and he sent her to a nurse, who gave her an anti-bacterial medicine.  The next day, she began to feel much better, until she felt a very painful cold.       The doctor was not familiar with asthma, so he gave her a stronger medicine. But the cold never went away.  She went back to the doctor for help.  He told her she was "brought up to be a good girl."  He gave her more anti-infective medicine. The next morning, she felt much better again, but then the cold came back.  It was a painful cold and lasted for a week.  Finally, the doctor told her to "take a long bath."    The nurse called the doctor to come in and get her.  His response was, "This is my business.  If you need help, go to the hospital."  In fact, the nurse said that when the doctor was asked about the cold, he told her, "I know what the problem is, but I'm not going to go get it for you."  It's really interesting to note how much this mother's world revolves around her children.  They are very important to her, and she will do anything to keep them from getting in trouble with the law.  Streep's character has an amazing physical and emotional strength that makes her a powerful role model for all young women.  I always liked how she always had a soft side to her.     She's also a very strong woman who will fight for her children and fight to get her money.  And she's a great mother.  This movie is really an amazing example of what women can do when they're treated right.  (A lot of times, we hear about the "damsel
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The Last Samurai is a great movie about samurai, the real samurai. It is not a war movie or an epic of the old samurai, but a story about a samurai in his way. He is the last of the samurai and the world is at his mercy. His wife has given up her life for him. He has a young son who is very good at the sword. He travels a lot and has to learn about life. He does not get the same respect as his father. He also has a very good friend who is the master of the sword and his name is Takamori. There is a lot of action in this movie and it is very entertaining. It has a beautiful story. The film has a lot more heart and it feels as if the character of the man is real. He suffers so much that his mind is destroyed. His mind is broken and he starts to do horrible things. But he still lives. He tries to get his son to get the sword back. He must learn that the sword is his friend and that there is no such thing as honor in a sword. His character is the main one in this film. It was very interesting to see the way he is treated. I loved how he is in pain, but still does not give up on his dream. I think this movie is great because it shows the pain and the way of the real warrior. The last samurai has a strong and very powerful character. He shows how the world and life is cruel and does not respect one's will. I love how the samurai can do everything to protect his son. He learns about himself, and he is so strong. This is a movie that will be watched by every samurai and warrior. It shows that one does not need to be a warrior to be strong. __________________________ I give this movie a 9.5/10. ___________________________________

The story is about an old guy named Tom Hanks (Tom Hanks) who is looking for his missing daughter. He goes to his old hometown, to his great-grandfather's house. Tom goes in, but there is nobody there. He gets very sad and angry. He starts going crazy. He talks to the old people, telling them that he is the son of his great grandfather. He explains that he wants to bring his daughter back to him, but they are not going to help him. He tries to get help from some people, but no one will help him, because he is crazy. After a while, Tom's daughter shows up, and he starts having fun with her. The old people are having a party, and Tom has a great time with his daughter.

He is going crazy because he does not know if David is really his son, and what if he is a demon. Eventually, Tom is about to go crazy. At the end of the movie, the whole story comes together. David has found Tom's lost daughter, and it is not Tom. It is the spirit of Tom's dead great- grandfather. ____________________________________________________________________ (Click on the movie below for my review. It was not so good.

The series has evolved into a fine film and the second one in the trilogy is really good. It's like the first one, but not quite. And the story changes a little too. The first movie is just a straight up thriller. It starts out with a murder and goes on to reveal the hidden side of things. The next movie has a more political tone. It is not a very good film, but I do enjoy it and you may too."
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ A man in a village named Mr. Olesen decides that he has had enough of being beaten up and robbed. He goes to the village chief and asks him to take care of his people, but the chief says, "I am not going to protect you. The world has changed, and I will not defend you from it." The man then goes out to the country, and begins to grow and learn how to defend himself. Soon he discovers the art of shooting arrows. He builds himself a bow and arrows, and becomes very successful. But as he is making money, he gets in the way of the law. One day, his son, a thief, gets into trouble and is taken in. The boy tells his father that he wants to help him out. The father tells him that he is not allowed to help the boy, and that he must help himself. The son then takes a large amount of money and leaves his father and runs away. After a few days, the father has the courage to go out to his son's hideout and catch the boy. The man tells the father that the boy is not worth his time and that if he keeps on chasing the boy and taking money from him, the boy will become too powerful for him to control. The farmer tells the man that he will give him a large quantity of money for the boy to take him to the forest. The old man then tells the son that the old man wants the boy for himself, and the father tells the boy that he cannot let the old people take him away. The last thing the father does before he dies, is to tell his son that he loves him. The young man is very upset that the father did not tell him what to do. The next morning, he wakes up to find that his father has gone. The story ends with the boy thinking that if the old woman in the village does not forgive him, he will be forced to kill her. This story is a very simple, yet very powerful story about a man who must protect himself and his family. A good, simple story. I would recommend this story to anyone who is looking for a good story.

If you believe in something and you're willing to make the effort, then there's always a chance." - Robert F. Kennedy   I know it's not my movie but I hope you like it. It's a true story about a little girl named Doreen (who is in the picture with her parents) who was raped by an older man. He raped her and then they had sex. But when he left she ran to the house and locked herself in the bathroom. He had a key so he could get in but when he came back he didn't have a key and was afraid of the locks. She locked herself down in the toilet and then he started to rape her.   So then she was able to get a key from her mother and then she locked herself up in the shower. He finally came back and was able unlock the door but the girl still wasn't able to open it because of the water pressure. She was about to go to the bathroom again when he saw her in the mirror. He came to the door and said "You are in the bath tub, what are you doing in there?" She was terrified because she didn't know what he would do to her if he found out she was in the tub.   (Note: this is a great movie because it shows you how little a child can get away with in this society.)   The way she was treated was horrible but the movie does a good job showing you what it really was. This was a great story and it was well written. This is a movie you can see in the theater when you want to see something that has a message. This movie has a lot of real life situations that happened but it's all in a way that makes it seem like a movie.   "The Rainmaker" is a good documentary that shows how we treat our children. It shows what a child has to go through and how hard they have to fight to get what they want. This documentary shows you the importance of education and the importance children have to have a good education.   a very good documentary about a very bad thing.   and a very sad thing. The story is about a child who was sexually abused by a man when she was 12. The man had been raping her for a few years and she knew what he was doing. The girl

I had been wanting to see it for a long time and finally saw it at my local movie theater in Chicago. The movie was soooo good. I really enjoyed the movie. It was so funny, and it was so well-made. This movie was funny and sad and funny and tragic. It's so funny and so well written and so sad. I think this movie is the best movie I have seen this year. I will watch it over and over. It just so happened that I was at my theater on a Saturday night. I went into this movie thinking it would be a lot of fun but it was really sad. And I loved the movie so much. I was crying throughout the movie and it made me laugh a lot. So it was great to see a movie that was so sad, and yet so funny. I recommend this movie to all. This is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ (2014, Theatrical Trailer) __________  I'm a bit of a sucker for romantic comedies and this is one of my favorites. I'm not sure how the filmmakers made it this good and I'm hoping they're just crazy! The film follows a couple on a date. They have a fun evening that turns into a nightmare when the couple decides to leave town. As they're leaving, a car pulls up in front of them and a man gets out. He takes one look at the couple and decides to attack them. It turns out that the man in the car is the main antagonist and it takes the couple a few minutes to figure out that he is the real killer. The woman gets into a car and the man takes off. The movie is fun to watch and is definitely a good thriller. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good romance. The film is rated R, but that's not a bad thing because it has a very PG-13 rating. I would love to see a sequel but I have a feeling it won't happen. I have seen the film twice and each time I had a great time. It's funny and romantic and just has a nice twist to it.  Did you like this movie?

It was a good time."  -D.L. Hughley   "I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that enjoys action movies. I am a big fan of action movies and this is a great one. It is definitely a must see for anyone that loves action movies." -Gina Carano   About the movie:   The year is 2019. After a series of terrorist attacks on cities around the world, a new war is beginning. The world's largest military forces are engaged in a conflict with a group of terrorists known as The Syndicate. A man from New York, played by Matt Damon, must join the fight against this new enemy.  In order to do this he must join forces with a rogue cop (D. L. Hughly) and a former Marine (Jon Bernthal), who is now on the run. The two must also join forces in order to stop a powerful terrorist leader, played with evil genius by Charlie Hunnam.  the director of "Allied," Matt Damon is back and the best part about this movie is that it is about action. This movie has all of the action you would want. It has great action and has a lot of action scenes. In my opinion this is the best action movie in a long time.  "The Nice Guys" was directed by Gerard Butler. It stars Ryan Gosling, Russell Crowe, Michael Keaton, and Jeremy Renner. It will be released in theaters on July 22, 2019. The film will be rated R for some violent content. It also stars Kate Hudson, Robert Downey Jr., and Kate Winslet. -Cindy

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The Man Who Knew Infinity" (1998) is a movie that makes a good first impression: It has a lot of potential and a strong story. It has very original ideas and is a nice departure from most films of the genre. The plot follows a couple of friends who go to Japan to take a vacation. Unfortunately, their holiday takes a tragic turn when they encounter a group of assassins and have to choose whether to take them down or let them live on. The film is well acted, well directed and has a nice soundtrack. The performances are very good and it makes you wonder how the two leads, Takaaki and Yuko, ended up together. The two of them are also very funny. The movie has some good special effects, especially the "magic box" used to transport the duo around the world. The cast is very good, especially when it comes to the supporting characters. The lead actor, Tatsuya Nakadai, is also very good. It is a shame that the movie was not given a more favorable score. "TheManWhoKnewInfinity" could have been a great movie, if only it was given a chance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  2015     Rated: PG-13 for thematic elements and some brief nudity, not for the faint of heart or squeamish about nudity. The main characters are very believable.  The director of the film, David Koepp (who is best known for his work on The Sopranos and other crime dramas) was a former police officer in the U.S. and made this film during the "Miami Vice" days of the 1980s. The Miami Vice cop played by Mark Wahlberg (and whose name was changed to Paulie for the film) and his partner played by Dolph Lundgren and James Caan are two of the best officers ever on TV. Their bond is genuine and they work well together. . 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gravity" (2013) The only movie in history where the gravity-worshipping, spaceship-launching, astronaut-slaying, space-going "Avengers" are actually "Ace's" in disguise, they come out looking like the "Aces" of their day - with a few modifications. There's the same sense of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and of having to find your way out, which is something I've seen in "Star Wars" and "Star Trek." There's a lot of science fiction-like action - including some space battles and a nice closeup of the "Star-Spangled-Balls" that the "Marvel" superheroes used to keep themselves from falling out of orbit. There are some good space sequences. There is some humor in this film, and some character development. The "Aves" are a funny-looking group of aliens that are not quite like the stereotypical ones from the films they appeared in. There seems to be more in the way of humor than action in this movie. However, there is a lot going on - and there are several plot twists, a lot to be determined about. I was actually watching this film for a science fiction convention I was attending, and it was my first science fiction film. I can't wait to see how it does in the "big screen" for me. I am sure this movie will be a hit at the convention, since I saw a lot more science fiction films than I thought I would. There was a scene where "Starling" is in her room and a very attractive alien girl comes in - it reminded me of the way the "Starsky and Hutch" show-off girl would sometimes go in and talk to the housemates on the show - only this one was with a "real" alien. It was a very nice touch. It also was the first time I had seen a "Starbuck" movie, and I thought that was a nice touch too. I didn't notice any scenes where the aliens talked in their own language - though I didn's hear it in the other "Starbucks" movies I saw. There were a couple of good moments when "Starhawk" and his ship "The Wasp" were on the verge of crashing into the planet, but a very big "bad" asteroid was in their way. The asteroid is a really nice idea, and a good way of adding drama to

I do not like horror movies at all.  So when I saw this movie I expected it to be like other horror movies.  But no, it was much more than that.  The plot was so well thought out that it was scary.  And the actors were amazing.  They had to act their way out of it because they were in the movie, but they were great in their own way.  One of the best performances in a movie this year.  The ending was the best part of the movie.  If you can get past the horrible acting, the slow plot, and the lack of a real ending, this movie is really great.  This movie is so good that you should see it over and over again.

I had to stop the movie several times to catch my breath after laughing so hard at the ridiculousness of the situation. The movie had some very nice twists. And it had the best soundtrack I've heard in a movie in years. And for a movie about the most stupid idea imaginable, it had some really good lines. One of my favorite lines is the line "You were the man of my dreams, but I can't have a woman of his." And the movie is over with and we're back to reality and the girl who had the most horrible idea in the world is back home, where she has to deal with the fact that she lost the most important man in her life. The film ends on a very nice note and I felt a bit bad for the girl because she was such a dumb idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like to watch a good action movie with a good plot, good action, good characters, good cinematography, good sound, good voice acting, and good music, then this is the movie for you.  It is not very good, but it's a good one.   The story is good.  I'm not sure what the real problem with this movie is.  It is good to watch and it is a good story.  I'm not a big action movie fan, but this movie was pretty entertaining.  A great action movie.  This movie will make you laugh and it will make your heart pound.  The only thing that made this movie not great is that it has a plot, and it had a lot of action.  If it had no plot, it would be a pretty good movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an action movie that will make their heart pound and will make them laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is awesome. It is also a very funny movie. The plot is pretty interesting and it keeps you guessing. The characters are very good. The story is also interesting and I enjoyed it. The ending was also good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is into good movies. It is also worth watching if you are a fan of comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. __________. ____ ____. _____. _______. _______________________. (I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the movie I'm reviewing is good, but not great. I don't know, it just isn't that great. But I'm giving it a 5/5 because it's a good comedy with a great ending. So if you haven't seen it, go out and watch it, but if you've seen it before, it's probably best not to go back.) So, the movie starts with a guy named Mike (Ben Stiller) getting on the phone to his friend Tom (Jason Alexander) and asking him if he can come over to his house to see his dad (James Woods). Tom tells Mike that he can't come over because his dad is in the hospital and he'll be gone for a while. So, Mike is left with his brother Dave (Adam Sandler) and his best friend Tom. Dave and Tom are in the movie business together, and the movie industry in general. They have a great time on the set and make fun of the people who work on the film. At one point, Mike says to Tom, "We'll be fine. Just watch us, OK?" Tom says, "Yeah, sure, sure. We'll see what happens." And that's when Mike gets really scared.  It was great to see Sandler and Alexander in this movie, but what was a bit weird was that the two of them were never really on screen together. They were mostly playing off each other. Sandler, being the smartass that he is, didn't even think of asking Alexander for an autograph. Instead, he just signed his copy of "The Book of Mormon" and gave it to Sandler. Sander then asked him if they could make a sequel to this movie. And Sandler was just like, "Why don't you tell me a story about this time I got on the wrong end of a joke." And, of course, that's what happened. Sandel got on stage at a movie premiere and was asked by an actor if he was going to do another movie. Sanderson said that the answer was "no." But, he asked, "Is it because I was on the right side of a bad joke?" and the actor said yes. Sandberg then joked, "Then that's all I need." I don?t know
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1941) - a masterpiece of a film, made by one of the greats, Sergio Leone.  I think this film would have been a contender for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1941 had it been nominated, and I think the film would still have been great even if it had been nominated.    In other words, the film is just that good.    The movie is the story of the journey of three good friends on their way to the Mexican border.  The Good and the Bad (1940)   It is the trip to the border that becomes the most dramatic scene in the film, and for that reason alone, it is the most memorable in the entire film.  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is also a film about the search for justice, and it is this search that is at the center of the film. The U.S. Marshal (Samuel L. Jackson) is a good man who believes that justice is not a fairy tale.  He is a man who will go to the end of the earth in order to get it.  His friends are all good men who will do anything for justice.  These men are not the kind of men we like to be around, and they are all willing to do anything to get at the truth.  There is no place for the Good, for the Bad or for the U. S. Marshal in the U S. government.  As I said, it isn't a very good movie, but it is a great film, with the most iconic image in all of cinema.  When we think of the Good Men of The Good 'ol Boy Scout, we think about the Scoutmaster.  In the movie, the Good Scout is the U, S Marshal.  This is not the most romantic story in the world, but in the end, it gets us to the heart of the matter.  I think it was the film's success in the United States that made it such a success.  It became a classic in the States, but was also a classic worldwide.  With the success of the movie in the West, Leone made several more films in the 1950s.  Some of his most famous films include The Good, The Bad, and The Wild Bunch.  I would like to end with a quote from a review by Roger Ebert in which he praised The Good and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My rating: ______________________ _____________________ _______________________ ___________________ ____________________ In the early nineties, I had a friend named David, and we were both avid gamers. David was an avid video game player and played many of the early games that were released. One day he came home from work and found me playing Quake, the first game that I was truly addicted to. I was playing on my friends computer, and it was a real thrill to play against him. I thought that David must have seen me playing the game, but then he showed up at my house and we played for several hours. I eventually won and David became very angry, and when I asked him what was wrong he told me that I didn't look like a real gamer. "Oh David, what is a real video game? The games are just computer games!" I replied. "Yes, but you are playing on the real computer, the one that I am playing on, and you are just sitting there like a dead man!" He retorted. It was during this time that I started getting into the more graphic games like Quake, Unreal, Duke Nukem, and Half Life. This led me to playing them more and more, and then I was hooked on the whole world of computer games. I remember one night after a few drinks, and a couple of beers, when I was sitting at my favorite computer, I played the Quake 3 Demo. It was just like playing a video game. It looked like a movie, it was realistic, and I could see the characters and the surroundings around me. I played it for a while, and before I knew it, I was addicted to playing it. After playing it for so long, I began to lose my mind playing the games. It became so hard to stop playing them, that I would never stop playing and I didn´t know if I was ever going to stop. I always tried to think about the game for a few minutes and then try to stop, but I couldn´t. My parents would often come home from a night out and find me playing these games. One night I had to go out, so I told them that I had played Quake all night. They asked me what I was doing and I told him that I just wanted to relax. I just needed to take a break from the games and play a few more games. My mother told me not to bother them and that they just needed
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- A film with the "honest" feel to it. The plot is straightforward, and the movie is very interesting. It takes a more subtle approach than the first movie. The film was released in 1993. It shows a story of an Indian man who comes to New York to seek work. He is able to get a job, but it's a lower level job, with less pay. The movie is about his relationship with his friend, a man from India. The friendship between the two is very strong and very real. The chemistry between them is great. I don't know the name of the movie. It was made in India and I don´t think it was ever released. The only way to see it is if you have the original DVD. This movie is a must see. It will give you a sense of "I" and "you".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" is a movie that I think is well worth the watch. It's one of those movies that you'll remember for a long time. I remember watching this movie on a summer vacation with my father, a few friends and a few dogs. We all enjoyed it and my father especially loved it. It was the first time I'd ever seen "The Good Fight" and it blew my mind. I loved the story, the fight scenes, the acting, the characters and the music. If you are a fan of the "Good Fight" then this movie is a must see. I highly recommend it to any fan of Sergio Leone, John Wayne, Marlon Brando, John Barrymore or even Clint Eastwood. If there's anything I can do to make this movie better then maybe I will. I'd love to see some of the other characters from the movie like Lee Van Cleef or Charlie Chaplin. Also, I'd like to see a bit more action in the movie, like a fight scene or two. I know it was just a summer movie but it was so good that I can't believe it hasn't been released on DVD yet. I really hope it is someday. I've been waiting for a chance to watch it and now I know how I'll feel when it does. I think the movie is worth watching again just for that scene where Marlon and Clint are in the hospital together. It is a wonderful scene and the best scene in the entire movie. I wish I could have seen it again. If you like this review, please share it on Facebook or Twitter. I hope you will.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "When the sun sets on the West, the world is dark and full of ghosts." I was never a fan of Stephen King's books, but this movie is well done. The film follows the story of a man who's wife disappears and who's son is taken by a group of people, all of whom seem to be in a hurry to get away from it. But I don't think they're in a rush to get out of this dark world they have created. I loved the way they used real footage to portray the West and the people who live there. The actors are all great, but I was especially impressed by the way Peter Dinklage (who plays a young man named Jake Chambers) played the role of the father of the young boy who is taken away by the group. I think he was brilliant and really took this part in a very real and interesting way. The movie has a lot of interesting moments to it and I especially loved the final one. It's a bit disturbing, but then again, what could be more disturbing than the disappearance of a young boy and the kidnapping of a girl, who is soon found in a barn? I think that's a good lesson for all of us to take to heart. I give the movie a 6 out of 10. ___________ "The most terrible of times is when the good guys lose." _____________ I've never seen a movie quite like this. It has the feel of a true horror movie, but it's also an action movie. There is nothing more exciting than an action film and this one is no exception. There's a lot going on and some scenes are truly scary. The story is very interesting and it takes you to a very different place than any other movie I've ever seen. I enjoyed it a lot. I gave it a 7 out of a possible 8.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What more can you say about this movie? The plot is not great, but it's really not a plot. It's just a story of a boy and his dog. He is a boy. His father is a big guy, and he is a bully, so he is not allowed to play with his son. He was always too big for his dog, but he found out that he can actually play with the dog. The dog is the smartest dog in the world, and it doesn't want to play. The only time it is ever good is when the boy takes the dog to a playhouse, and the dog plays with it and does everything for the boy. It is a really good movie, and is worth watching, but be sure to take a lot of pictures. The best part is the ending, and that is the best part of the movie. The boy and the big dog are still friends. He and the boy even come back to the playhouse for a reunion. The movie is a good way to see how a dog can make a big man play with him. This movie is one of the best things I have ever seen, and will stay with me forever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dredd (2014) It's hard to believe that this was released last year, but it is so good.  The art direction and cinematography are great, and the story and acting are great.  The story is a bit simple, but the characters are complex and memorable.  It is easy to see why the story is so well-written and why people will love this movie.   One of the things I liked about this movie is that there are no big set pieces.  Instead, Dredd has a more grounded story, and it works.  I think the movie could have been even better if it were released sooner, and I hope it is released soon, because I think it would have made a great sequel.  A good movie.

After two decades of being on the sidelines, Harrison Ford has finally got back into the director's chair of a Star Wars movie. The movie has been described as the most "stunning and imaginative" of the series, and it definitely delivers on that promise. I am very happy to see Ford back as Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher was excellent as Princess Leia. I have seen it three times now, and each time I am just as excited as I was when it came out. The trailer for the film was a little underwhelming, and the actual movie is a little less than spectacular.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The Last Samurai was an excellent film that was made better by the excellent cast and superb cinematography by Roman Polanski. I found the film to be a bit too predictable. The last two action scenes were great but they were very predictable and almost didn't work at all. But the last battle scene was outstanding. The film also had a great soundtrack. It has a great score that really helped the film and added to the realism of the situation. But as much as the soundtrack was great, it's the character development and the way the characters were portrayed in the film that made it an excellent watch. The story was about two brothers who were brothers in arms. Their fathers were both killed by the same samurai and their mothers were killed by another samurai. The brothers both wanted revenge but they had to do it together. The two brothers were very different. One brother was a great swordsman and could not be satisfied with merely killing. He would do anything to avenge his father. The other brother was more like a good boy. He was very polite and did not want to kill anyone. He tried to reason with the samurai and persuade him to stop. But his older brother wouldn't listen to reason and instead went after the samurai. Unfortunately, he was killed in the process. This was the only reason why the other brother didn't kill the samurai but rather gave him a warning. The young samurai was quite an interesting character. He had a father like attitude but he was also quite the coward. He did not even try to defend himself. But when he saw the other samurai was about to kill the younger brother he had just been talking to he turned on him and killed him. It was a shame that the young samurai died like that. It didn't help the overall plot of the film. The only problem with the film is that the ending was very predictable. Even though Polanski has been accused of being a predictable filmmaker, I found that he did have a certain degree of predictability to his movies. But this is what makes the film so great. This is not the kind of movie where you can predict the plot. The action scenes are well choreographed and there are many times when the characters' actions are so dramatic that you can't help but to laugh. But it doesn't matter if you don't know the plot of a movie. You still have to see the movie to enjoy it. I hope that the next time Polanski makes a film he will do a better

The film is shot from behind in a variety of different locations, which creates a sort of disjointed feeling, especially when a character is talking to the camera. The characters' faces are often blurred, and sometimes their voices are distorted. There are several instances where the filmmakers crop the action or cut in on characters that don't even exist in the story. The editing in this film is almost unprofessional and distracting.  The second problem is the movie's tone. This movie is the first installment of a planned trilogy, and the film does not take the time to develop the characters and relationships between them. We don't learn much about the character, and we are introduced to some new ones. In the second half of the movie, the story becomes almost non-existent. There is only a few scenes that are not directly related to the main plot.  in fact, the only reason the film gets an A rating is because of the way it ends. I really hope that the filmmakers of this movie will take the chance to explore more of the characters in future installments.  is a good start to the Bully trilogy, but the second movie, "BULLY: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY," will not be quite as successful as the first one. ,  Share this: Twitter  Tumblr  Facebook  Google  Pinterest
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The only thing you can say about this movie is it has the most beautiful girl. I loved this movie. I don't even know what I was thinking when I started watching it. I was totally into this movie and it's one of my favorites. I've been watching movies all my life and this was one of the first I saw that had me laughing so hard. I love this movie because of the beautiful girl in the movie. The plot is amazing. It's really a simple plot, but it is very well thought out. It doesn't waste any time. It takes place in the 90's and the main character is a girl named Katie. The main character wants to be a porn star but she can't do that. She starts working at a hotel where the owner of the hotel has a son who is gay. The owner of this hotel is a man and the father of the son wants to get his son to come out of the closet. Katie tries to help the owner to be out of his son's closet. I really enjoyed this movie as it was very funny and I didn't hate any of the characters. I enjoyed the movie very much and I think everyone should watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. _________. __________________. I'll have to look that up... I'm not sure what movie this is, but I'll bet the guy in the movie is talking about his new found "friends" in the military. The best part about this movie is the ending, as it makes me wish I'd stayed in the Army, and fought in Iraq. I just wish the story was a bit better. There is just so much going on in the film, that I can't really tell what's going on, and I can only guess that something is going on. The ending is good though, it's not too hard, and it's just the right amount of cheesy. I really liked the ending. I think this movie would be a great movie for a birthday or wedding present for someone, or if you just want to see a good action movie. I have seen many action movies, and this movie doesn't really stand out. The action scenes are great, but not great enough to make the movie great. It's fun, but there is nothing special about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I was born in 1957 and this movie is my first movie. I am a big fan of the original. I watched it again last night, it's much better than the first. I love the plot, the characters are likeable. There is a big story about an American man who is taken prisoner in China. When he is finally released he comes home and goes to a bar to meet his girlfriend and they go to a restaurant for a drink. She tells him she is pregnant. He decides to keep the baby and they spend the rest of the movie fighting over who is going to get the baby. There are a lot of sex scenes, but nothing too graphic. The movie is a classic and has an original plot. I would recommend this movie to a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* This movie was so good. It was a great way to introduce people to the concept of "The Godfather". I am a great fan of Francis Ford Coppola and I know what he was doing with this film. The acting was great. All the players were great. I am so glad I watched it. It is great watching this film as a kid. I loved the gangsters and the gangster life. I love the story about the woman and her daughter. They were great characters. I have seen this movie more times than I can count. It had a great feel. I just wish the plot was more involved. It didn't have enough to do. I wish they would have given us more information about the story. It would have made it so much better. It took away from the story and left so many questions unanswered. It left you wanting more. If they were able to add in a little more to the story then I would have a 5 star review. It wasn't very good. The film is not a masterpiece. It has a lot of great ideas but it didn't work out.

This film is so realistic and the characters so human.  of course the story isn't the only thing that impressed me but this is one of the most realistic films I've seen. It's a good story and good actors but there is something more behind the scenes that made this film more than just a good film. It is not about a guy who has an accident. It isn't about his family and friends. It has everything in the background that makes it a real life story. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* I have seen this film a lot of times, and every time I watch it it is different. The plot is very well done. The acting is excellent. The story is interesting. I love the way the film portrays how different cultures view one another. It is very easy to see why some people want to hate the film, and others love it. The soundtrack is amazing. I've heard this film and this soundtrack on the radio and loved them both. The cast is great. I have never seen a movie that has this many talented people in it. I also like how the film takes some time to let you see how the different cultures see the world. There are some very strange scenes and scenes that make you think and then the film does not take the time to explain why they are so strange. The only thing I did not like was when they did the scene of the priest and the girl that has a dream. It was a very weird scene. I understand that it is meant to be a dream but when the priest is talking to the girl, the girl looks up and smiles, then her eyes seem to open. There was a scene where the priest was trying to cure a little boy, and when he told the boy that he was a witch and that the witches could kill him, the little boy was screaming and running away, and the priest could not do anything. So he got up and went to the kitchen and pulled out a knife and cut the boy's arm off. It took a few minutes to understand what he did and then it made no sense. It seemed like the film was trying too hard to make a point, and it wasn't very effective. Overall this film is a great film and I recommend it.

They had already seen all of the Star Wars movies and they thought it was the best one. Well I am going to try to get one for myself and see if I like it. It seems that there are a lot of people who have seen it that have a lot to say about it.

The movie opens with a short prologue where a group of characters, including Nick Carreraway, his father, and a woman named Mary (played by Carey Mulligan) are discussing the financial state of their gambling operation. When Nick's father says that they are losing their shirts, Mary's reaction is a bit more harsh than expected: "We're losing a fortune, and I don't know what to do. We're losing money at a rate of six thousand a week!" Nick then replies: "The thing is, I have an idea." He then explains that the gang are planning on robbing a jeweler's store.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hail, Caesar!" is a great movie.  It's got the comedy of a great musical and the action of a good superhero movie. And it's also a really fun and entertaining movie.   It's a big, fat action movie. It has lots of big action scenes.  So there's that, but it also has the romance of a big romance movie. There are a lot of great characters in this movie, including one of my favorites, played by Marlon Brando.  There are lots of action sequences, some funny, some not so funny, but all good.    I just love this movie. I think it's the best of the old school "heroes in trouble" movies. It's also one of the best superhero movies I've seen.  And, of course, there's lots of laughs.  This is a movie that's got lots of fun scenes. The only thing that I don't like is that they didn't make it a 3 hour movie. Maybe they didn"t want to show every single minute of this movie...so maybe they could have cut it a little and made it a bit longer.  But it's a good action movie, and it"s a good romantic movie. So, overall, I think this is a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I loved this movie. It's funny, it's smart, and it has a nice plot that builds. I would recommend this movie to everyone.  A couple years ago I got into a minor battle of wits with a fellow student and I was shocked by his reaction. I thought to myself, "how can you be so rude?" and "why are you so rude?". Well, my friend is a huge fan of this movie and I can tell he's a huge Fan of the Book, but this time I think he's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder and it made me smile. The movie follows a high school student named Jack who is the class clown, and who has to deal with the fact that he is an only child. He also has to face the fact he's going to college and he doesn't really know what to do about his new found career. Jack and his best friend Jack Jr. go to a party and are in a game of dress up, which is a lot like a cross between dress up and high school. The kids don't get very far in their costumes until a little old lady asks them to dress up as her son's "fans". The movie begins with this kid's parents being killed in an auto accident. They are killed when the car they were in was hit by a semi truck and rolled over. The car exploded into a fireball and the whole accident went on to destroy the kid's house. He has to go through a very traumatic experience before he can even get on with his life. A few years later, Jack's father has died. He goes through a long period of depression and then finally moves back to his old home town. While he is living there he finds out that his father's old roommate is dead. Jack is told that his friend was killed because he had been a witness to a murder that happened the same day. Jack then decides to go back to college. However, he finds he doesn´t really have what it takes to be a student. So he decides to try to find the killer. This leads him into a whole series of different people that have died, and have to find out who is behind this. He finds himself in a battle of wills with his best friends that has a lot of action and fun in it. There's some pretty funny and pretty good stuff in this movie, but there is a small problem that comes up later on. There are

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ "A movie that is the perfect blend of comedy, horror, and science fiction. It features some of the most imaginative visuals and music ever created, with a plot that could easily be mistaken for a short story." "The film is based on a novel of the same name by a man who also wrote the original story of "Blade Runner", which is a brilliant piece of science fiction with its emphasis on how human beings are affected by the presence of technology. The film was made by a team of people who have a very strong sense of humor and they have captured the essence of what made Blade Runner such a good film, which is that the future is a dark place, but also a place where you can make a difference. The movie is full of a lot of humor that will make you laugh out loud." "An excellent film from the 70's, but this one is not a rehash of the old. The director, Denis Villeneuve, has created a unique film which is both a new take on the story and a completely original story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ _________________ This is an incredible movie. I was watching it for the first time in a movie theater, but I already loved it. The story and characters are simple and the writing is amazing. It's about a family that has no money, and a young boy who has lost his father. They go to an uncle's house for food, and when they get there they find a young man that was shot and killed in the middle of the street. The uncle is there with a rifle, and the young man was his son. The young boy tries to get the gun away from the uncle, but he keeps shooting. Then they are forced to leave the house and try to get back home. At the end of the movie, the uncle tells the father about the young boy, and how the uncle killed him. The father starts to cry and say how he loved his son, and that he should have known better. The boy looks at his father and says that he did know better, and he would do anything for him. So the movie ends with the young son looking at his parents, who say "we love you". The uncle says to the boy "you're a man now, you're a real man" and the boy looks into the eyes of his father, and says "yes, father". And then the film ends. A true masterpiece. I loved it so much that I would recommend it to anyone, especially to a young person.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________   "The Day The Earth Stood Still" is a fine example of what made science fiction exciting in the 1950's. The novel and the movie were both made by the same studio: Universal. They did both well.   I can't say that "The Day the Earth St stood Still" has any of the heart or compassion of other science fiction movies. It doesn't even have much of the sense of fun and adventure that is characteristic of the genre. It is, however, very entertaining. The first half is an adventure story. The second half is a serious look at man's search for the origins of the earth.   is a very clever script. The characters are all very interesting and the story is both a mystery and an adventure. In this respect, it's more similar to the story of the movie than to the novel.  . I think that the movie was better in many ways. The story had a much greater sense of humor, a greater sense for drama and adventure, and a greater level of suspense.   of course, the story could have been much better if the actors had done a better job. They had some terrific moments, but many of them were a bit clumsy. I remember a scene in which the characters were walking in a city and the camera was following one of the characters as he got on a bus. He suddenly got off and walked into a store and was surprised to find that the doors were locked. So he ran to the store and tried to break open the door with a rock, but it was too big. He was very much like the character in the novel, who didn't realize how big a door was. The movie version had a terrific, but very silly, opening scene where the characters are walking in the desert and a large rock comes out of the ground and crashes into a large sign, sending it flying. The audience laughed so hard at that scene that I don't remember it. The humor was still there, but a little too clumsily.   in a way, the movie version of the book is a better adaptation. The original book was more difficult and had more suspense. It was a much longer book and the actors in the film had a better sense for the scene. There were more action scenes, but the movie just didn't have the humor or drama of the novel or the novel's ending. This movie had a lot of action scenes but little suspense or comedy.   "The

And find out what is going on. And he has no idea what is in store for him. It was a very good movie and I recommend this movie to all who like movies like this. It is a movie that you should watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch this video to find out why "The Good Dinosaur" is a movie that you have to see. I've always been fascinated with dinosaurs and the fact that this movie came out only a few years ago, and yet it managed to capture me perfectly is a testament to the talents of director Bob Peterson. The movie tells the story of the little boy who discovers a dinosaur skeleton in the back of a dumpster. After finding the dinosaur, the boy finds that the boy's father is the fossil collector who dug up the dinosaur. The boy is then given the choice to keep the dinosaur or keep his dad. The story begins to move forward after the boy and his father find a dinosaur egg. The baby dino is very little, but the fact is that when you watch the movie, you will realize that it's actually quite the grown up character. The Good Dinosaur is an amazing movie, and the dinosaurs are amazing, as well as the way the dinosaurs look. There are only a couple of minor faults in the movie. One of them is the fact there are two versions of the dinosaur in the film. The film seems to alternate between one version and the other. Also, the movie doesn't make much of an effort to explain the dinosaurs in detail. I mean, you don't need to understand dinosaurs to enjoy this movie, but if you want to really learn more about them, you might want to go back and watch "The Lost World: Jurassic Park". The movie doesn´t have much action, and it also doesn't have many scenes that are truly thrilling. This movie will certainly get better as time goes on, but I give it a 7/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I have watched this movie at least 6 times now, and I just love it. This movie is an epic, a movie that makes you think, a great movie, a masterpiece. It is a movie about man who's wife just died, and he is looking for a new wife. He goes to see this woman and meets a lady that reminds him of his wife. So the guy is looking to marry this girl and they start kissing. The movie starts with the couple being very good friends and even going out with each other at a bar. However when they are on a date they start to fall in love and the movie shows that it is really a love story. The guy is very honest and truthful, the girl is very beautiful and is really into him, and they have a lot of sex. The ending of the movie is awesome, and really sad. But I am so happy that this movie exists. This is a great movies to watch.

"The one who makes me laugh, is a mother and the one who is the main character is a child. You will not see the same story repeated, the characters, make you feel that they really love each other, even when the mother says, she doesn't like it, she would not be the same if she was in this situation, you will see the child trying to be a good boy. "This movie is so realistic, that you will not understand how you felt when you watch it, and when you finish it, you are sad, and want to see this story in real life, this movie will make you want to try this kind of movie again, I recommend this movie to everyone, it is so sad and beautiful, and it makes you think about life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this at a theater.  The movie was good, I liked it a lot.   This is not a classic, but if you are a fan of sci fi and like space, it is worth watching.  The movie started with the main character, who is a young woman named Nana (Samantha Morton).   She is in a space station that is orbiting the earth.  She has been trapped on the station since her ship has crashed in the ocean.  The movie started in the middle of the ship where we saw a large spaceship that was not there when it was destroyed.  When the ship crashed, it came to life and took off with a pilot.  We then got to see the ship and crew.  It was about 3 years after the space ship came to live in the station.  Nana is one of the crew. She was born in a world where there are no wars.  This world is called Oceania.  At one point, the people who were on the ship decided to go back to their home world, and Nana was one of them.  As a result, Nana has never known the things she has been taught about life.  So when she is thrown into a war, she goes along with the other crew members.  One of the main characters, is a pilot named Bob.  He was a former soldier in the war.  After a couple of missions, the crew finds out that there is a new enemy on their side that wants to destroy their home planet.  Bob wants to save the world and fight back.  In the first half of the movie, N Nana is a really nice character.  Even though she is young, she is very capable.  I really enjoyed the movie and it was well made.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it at all.  For me, it was really a bad movie.  There are some great ideas in the movie. I just did not like it at ALL.  Some of the characters were really annoying.  Also, there are some scenes that made me cringe a little.  Overall, it just is not my cup of tea.  However, I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars if I could.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********  "The Great Beauty" is an excellent film. It's got great characters and a great story. The only thing that bugs me is that the ending is a bit of a letdown. It would have been better if they just left it open ended and just ended it there. But other than that, it's a great movie.  *If you want to see a good "action" movie, then look no further. You won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is an excellent movie. It's a great movie in every sense of the word. The script is simple and straightforward and the story has a very simple premise. There is a guy named Jeff Lebowitz (John Goodman) who has a hard time in his life. He lives in a small town called Blue's Clues. He is very lonely and doesn't have any friends. He has a crush on a girl named Diane Lebowitz (Elizabeth Hurley). He has been invited to a big party at the Lebowskis' house, but the invitation has been changed to a huge event. When he arrives at the party, he meets the Lebowskis. They tell him he has a gift and that he will have to come up with the money for it. He comes up with $100,000. When the party starts, he's drunk and starts throwing chairs around, and a fight breaks out. The Lebrowski family members start to fight with the guests. Jeff finds the money, but doesn't want to give it to the Lebowskis. He goes to the police to report the crime, but they don't believe him. They find the money in a bag and he's arrested. They give him a lawyer, but he refuses to give him his money back. Eventually, he gives it back to the lawyer, who uses it to buy a new car. He takes a big hit in the stock market, but somehow he still has the money. He gets a job as a janitor at a local restaurant and meets a girl who seems to like him. He starts spending more time with her, and she starts to get pregnant. Things start to get serious. He wants the baby. The movie is funny, and the LeBowskis are hilarious. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is a great film and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh and a simple story. The ending is good, too. My rating: 4 out of 5 stars.  The film "The Big lebowski", written by the Coen brothers, was made in 1997. It has been well received by audiences and critics alike. The film is a comedy and it's really funny. I liked the story of the movie very much. It was very interesting and I was interested in what was happening on the other side of the screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film is filled with memorable and interesting characters. There are many memorable moments in the film, and the performances are superb. It's a great movie that will stay with you long after watching. There is a great scene where the main character (the main character) is in jail, and there is a huge, heavy-set man who is chained to the wall. I felt that it would be interesting to have a man chained to a wall. It wouldn't have made the same impact if it was just a big man." - The New York Times "It is a terrific film. It will not leave you wanting for another one. I saw this film in its original 70mm format, with an additional scene that is added in a 35mm version, as a bonus feature on the Blu-ray, and I would recommend this version over any other. I don't know why it isn't in theaters and I am very pleased that it is available on Blu-Ray." - John F. Knoll, Cinema Journal
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A young man who works for a private detective agency is killed when his car breaks down. He and his colleague go to the scene of the accident and discover that the victim was a famous writer. The next morning, a mysterious person appears in the same office and kills the detective. The detective must now hunt down the killer and solve the mystery of this new murder. _______________________________ Summary: _______________________________________________ "The film is very similar to "The Birds", in that it's a thriller about a man who has been hired by a famous author to find his murder victim. The only difference is that the man is a young man and the woman is a woman. The woman is killed at the scene and the man must find out who killed her. __________________________________________________ "My name is Joe. My brother's name is John. I'm sixteen years old. I've got a job in a detective agency. My father was a detective. My mother was a nurse. I got my start in the department by getting a promotion to detective when my father was killed. I have a brother and a sister. They are all grown up. We've been through a lot together. But, my life isn't all roses. I was raped when I was ten years old by a policeman. When I got out of jail I tried to get into a real detective's office. But it wasn't my type of job. I couldn't handle it. Then I met a girl named Sally. She had been raped by a different policeman. I thought that I could be a good detective if I was honest. Sally is a real good detective. She helped me in my first murder. She gave me all the evidence and she even gave me a witness who'd been in the area. So I went to work. After a while, I was on my own. So one day, I went down to the station and picked up Sally and her friend and I took them home. The police wouldn't take us seriously. They thought that we were a bunch of young guys who were going to run off and do something crazy. But we were honest. We told them everything. We were real detectives. We looked into all the angles. I even put Sally's fingerprints on the murder weapon. She didn't like that. She wanted to get me killed. So she gave me her fingerprints. After all that, they finally arrested my brother John. But then he broke his plea. I helped John in

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  _____________, a young woman living in Los Angeles, has had it up to here with her ex-boyfriend. She's sick of watching him make up stories about her and cheating on her, so she goes looking for some action of her own. After seeing a film called The Big City, she decides to go to a porno show to try to get her boyfriend back. But as she's waiting for the guy to come on stage, a man comes in and shoots her in the back of the head, killing her instantly. The killer is revealed to be a high-school dropout named Paulie, who works as a porn actor in a local theater. Paulie wants his girlfriend back, but she won't go back to him. She has a boyfriend, a local man named Ron, and Ron has to take her to a movie, where she'll meet a nice guy named Paul. But before Paulie and Ron can make it to the movie, Paulie is murdered by a jealous rival, and Paulie's body is found in the parking lot. Paul's girlfriend, Jennifer, has been having an affair with Ron, but it doesn't matter because Paulie shot Paulie in the head. The murderer is found guilty of Paulie's murder and is sent to prison.  Paulie is sentenced to death by hanging, and the judge asks him, "Are you sure you're not guilty of murder?" Paulie replies, "No, your honor, I am innocent of the murder of Ron." The judge then gives Paulie a chance to repent. Paulies asks the judge if he's aware of what kind of life he's led and how much pain he's caused his girlfriend. Paul is so happy that he begins to cry. Paul says, "I know that I'm a criminal, but I've made a big mistake in my life, and I am sorry for all the pain I've caused my family. I will not let them down."  In prison, Paul meets an inmate named Eddie, who is on death row for murdering a police officer. Paul goes to visit Eddie, but Eddie doesn't want Paul in his cell.

Eddie then tells Paul to leave and not come back. Paul doesn't listen and starts to pray to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a huge success and will go down as one of the best action movies of all time.  The movie was about an escaped convict named "Vulcan" who is sent to prison.    The prison was run by a big evil corporation that has a monopoly on the prisoners in the prison. The story starts with a prisoner getting the "cure" for his hangover.    When Vulcan gets out of prison he finds that the prison has changed.  The prison is now run by the evil corporation, and the inmates are now "slave labor."  Vulcan decides to try to stop the evil company from owning the prison, but he must first fight the prison guards.  In the first few scenes the movie is great, but it becomes really boring as time goes on.  This is mainly because the movie was really old.  They tried to re-use a lot of scenes from the previous movies, but failed.  It was really annoying when you watch the same scenes over and over again.  The good:  The story of the movie takes place in the 1930s.  There are a lot more action scenes in this movie.  These action scenes are amazing.  While it is not as much fun as the previous movie, the action scenes were still pretty cool.  However, this movie is not very long.  If you don't have a lot to watch, it would probably be a waste of time.    The actors who played the main characters were great.  John Wayne plays the main character, and Bruce Willis plays the prison guard.  Wayne and Willis both had great performances.  One thing that I really like about this movie, is that the movie didn't have any nudity.    This movie was just as cool as the other movies in the franchise.  Although the movie does not have a huge amount of violence, it does have plenty of violence.  Also, this was a very underrated movie, so don't go into it thinking that it is "not good."   This movie has everything that a good action movie should have.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys action movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ It's a film about a group of people, a very young, but very mature, group of guys. They are the best of friends. They have a group in their high school, but they never hang out with each other. They just hang out and do homework. But one day, one of them, Mike, is at a dance. The whole school is at it. It's just like a huge party. It turns out, the one person who doesn't show up is Mike. It was a very tragic and dark day for Mike. The film was very good, but I found the ending of it really sad. It really makes me feel like it could have been better. It could have had more humor. I also thought the ending was a little bit too abrupt. The next time I saw it, I thought maybe they should have had Mike come back a little later, but the way it ends, it didn't really work. I think the ending could have worked better, but it was very entertaining. It had a lot of humor, and it had a great cast. If you're a fan of the movie, it's definitely worth a watch. It does have a lot to live up to, and I think it does a great job at that. I highly recommend this movie, and if you're looking for a fun, good time, this is the movie for you. It has a great soundtrack, a great character, and a great ending. Overall, I give it a 4 out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ _________________________________________________________  A nice old movie. The old man who's on the train gets shot and is dragged to the hospital. There he is treated, but the doctor wants to operate but he says he can't do it. The doctor tries to reason with the old man, but he gets angry. The next day the doctor comes back to the house, and he wants to get rid of the old people. He has to take them to a big old room where he tells the old folks that they're going to be put to work in a new railroad that's being built. The workers are not going to have a lot of money, but they have to do what the doctor says. The guy who is to be shot gets mad. The train arrives, and the old folk go down to the engine and the guy gets in. The woman who's in the house goes to the bathroom, and there's a shot, and then the old woman gets shot. She dies in the bathroom. The man gets mad, and goes out of the house. The young woman is also shot, but she's okay. The guys take them away in a big wagon and go to the railroad. The doctors get mad, but nobody cares. When the old lady dies, the doctors try to keep the old guys from taking any of the money. The boys are still mad, so the doctor takes the money, and leaves them in the wagon. The boy is shot in the shoulder, and is left for dead. The last thing he sees is the doctor pulling a handcart up the hill. The shot ends, and that's the end of that movie.

The film was a bit hard to follow, and some of the dialogue was a little difficult to follow at times. It did not have any dialogue at all. However, this film did a great job of showing us the beauty of the ocean and it did a good job of capturing the mood that we had while watching the film. It also gave us a great story, and a great ending that had me laughing for quite a while. I also liked that the movie did not make me feel guilty for not getting to see this movie because of the fact that it was out of theaters. I would definitely see this film again.

If you enjoy a good laugh and are looking for a good film with a good storyline and good acting I highly recommend this movie. I loved it. The main characters are not perfect and the story doesn't change. The movie will not change the way you see it because it has to do with the way people are and how they act. The film is funny but the main characters may make you laugh. I don't know if you like a good good laugh or if you prefer a better good laugh. This is a good example.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You're Next" is a movie that will make you think. It's a movie about people with a common trait that leads to a lot of tragedies. It takes the idea of a killer being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and the idea that it doesn't matter who does the killing, people will suffer. This movie has a ton of things going on, but it's all tied together in a very emotional ending. The acting is great, the characters are well fleshed out, and you can feel for the characters in this movie. The script is good, but the film does feel a little too slow and boring for a horror movie. There are plenty of moments of suspense and mystery that you'll get to enjoy. The movie does have its moments of humor as well, and I would recommend watching this with friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ "The Manchurian Candidate" is a thriller of an exceptional nature. It is not just a movie about a secret government agent (John Malkovich) trying to uncover a plot to assassinate a U.S. president. It's a movie that puts the plot to use by putting an audience in the shoes of a sleeper agent. The plot involves a group of agents sent to infiltrate a communist conspiracy and to kill one of its members. While it may be a movie like a book or a film, it is not a book, nor is it a film. "The Day After Tomorrow" and "The Hunt For Red October" are better, more entertaining movies about similar plots, and "Stalag 17" is also a better movie than the book. In the end, the plot does not hold up and "Red October" is better than the novel, although "The day after tomorrow" is an excellent movie.

In an alternate universe, Hitler would've never become Chancellor, and this film would've been a lot less racist and a lot more interesting.

They were just evil, but their motives were understandable, and in some cases, they were downright heroic. It's a shame that the movie has been forgotten, but it's nice to see that there was a time when the Nazis weren't the boogeyman we know today. "This film, even if it was made today, is still a masterpiece of historical propaganda." 4. The Day the Earth Stood Still I'm pretty sure this is one of the best science fiction films ever made, if not the best. If you don't know this, then you're missing out. It was the first ever movie that had a sentient alien life form (the alien in question being the E.T. in question), and it was also the first movie to be set in outer space. If you ever thought you saw a movie where aliens landed on Earth and started taking over, then this is your movie. There's a scene where a little girl sees a spaceship and she runs over to see what's going on, and the alien girl is just standing there, looking around. It kind of makes you feel like you're on Earth, but with aliens. There are also a couple of scenes in the movie where the aliens are talking to each other in the alien language, and it's a really good way of telling us who these aliens are. Also, there's a great scene where the people in a spaceship look down on the planet below, and there's one scene where an alien lady with a baby walks out of a spaceship with the baby in her arms and they both stare at each other. The alien lady has a face that looks a lot like an alien's and her eyes are kind of purple, and she has a sort of moustache, but she's also a woman. And of course, this is where the whole alien baby thing comes from, because it was only a few years later that aliens would be born in the movies. This film also makes the point that humans should be concerned with
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Man Who Wasn't There (1984) is a movie that has nothing to do with the original film. It is a remake. It doesn't look any different, and doesn't sound any different. The only difference is the actors. They have been replaced with actors who look more like the original than the new. The new cast members do a fine job. The plot is pretty standard: an actor is hired to play a man. He doesn't want to do the role, but he is too old for another one. The man, who is a scientist, wants to play the role anyway. The scientist makes the man do the part. The actor is not too impressed by the scientist. He is impressed by his own acting ability. He plays it very well. The film is about a man who wants to see his wife again, but she is a few years away. He decides to get the job done. The director gives the actor a lot of freedom. It does not feel like the director is trying to make a film with a plot. The actors do a great job in their parts. The original was a very good movie. This one doesn't even make it into the top five of the worst movies of all time. It's a terrible movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   I really liked the movie. The acting was great. I liked how the movie started off with a story of how a guy went to a movie and a girl was like "oh yeah, I'm going to be a star in a movie" and then a week later he was the star of the movie, he was in love with a girl and his love was with a movie. They were great characters. I thought the movie was good. The plot was good, the acting was good and the story was good because I knew the ending to it and I know what happens.   The problem is that it ended, but it wasn't the ending. It was the movie where the guy was just there to be the movie star and the girl was just like "Oh yeah, it's my turn to be star" and he wasn't there to save her, she was just on her way to be movie star. It's a movie about a guy going to a bar, a girl is there, he goes to her, and then he doesn't save her. He was just the movie guy.   in the end, they didn't tell you what happened to him. The movie didn't end. It ended at a bar and then the guy doesn't come back to the movie movie star girl. So that's the end of the story. That's not a good ending. That was a good way to go out, but that was a story. So there was nothing to get excited about. That story was never told, and it never really ended.  -Dirk  Read More Reviews

He gets a job in a software company, but soon finds out that the company is run by the very evil Mr. X, who wants to use cyberspace to make humans extinct. Cyberspace is not just an amusement for cyborgs, but a weapon. Cybormy is a world of magic, where cyberships can be transported between dimensions. Cyberpunk is all about the danger of the new technology and how it can corrupt a person.   The script was very original and very funny. The acting was good and it was interesting to see how cyberpunk influences people. The plot was pretty good. The ending was kind of cheesy, but not really a bad thing. The action scenes were fun and interesting. I really liked the music and the cyberpunk setting. The voice acting was also good. I did not like the movie a lot. I think it is a good comedy with a good story, but it is not a good cyberpunk movie. The story is very cheesy and I do not think it was well written. The cyborg story is not very interesting. It does not fit in with the plot and I think the cyborg character is not well developed. I do think that the ending was very good and the ending is very interesting and funny. But the ending does not explain how the cybership actually works. I also think that it is too long and it takes too long to get to the ending. I liked the ending, but I felt that the movie could have been better

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The thing that I liked most about this movie was the character of the father, who was trying to find his son. The way he was portrayed was quite the opposite of how he really was. I mean, he was a good man, but he really had a lot of issues and was quite sad. I loved how the son helped him. The son was a great character. The father was the most important character in the movie. It was really hard to see how the father was able to find himself. I think the movie would have been better without the father. The movie was quite a funny movie. I really enjoyed the jokes that were made. It made me laugh. I also liked the fact that the movie was a bit on the serious side, which I think was great. Overall, I really liked the movie and it was quite good. I liked the storyline and the characters. This movie will definitely make you laugh and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  The only reason I was able to finish this film was because of a friend of mine who told me he knew a girl who had the same movie on her shelf and was interested in it. I was only able to watch this because of this friend and the fact that I saw this movie when I was in high school. So yes, the movie does feel very much like a high school movie. There are a lot of cliches in this movie and the dialogue is pretty cheesy, but I think it's good for a highschool movie because it's easy to see the kids and their issues and the movie is not really focused on the characters in the movie but on their problems. The acting is pretty good as well, especially the kids. I think this is the most realistic highschool drama that I have ever seen.  So I'll just get straight to the review:   Story:  This is basically a high-school drama about the main characters and their problems as they grow up. They are the main character's friends in highschool who get together and have fun. The movie is pretty much about the girls. , but as it turns out they don't have a lot in common with each other so that makes things interesting. There's no romance, but there's a very cute friendship between the girls and it's very cute and funny. The story is very interesting and it feels very natural to me because I've seen a lot high-class high-drama movies and none of them had this kind of story.   Plot:  of the movie. The plot is pretty simple. The girls all have a boyfriend or two, and they all love each other and don't want to break up with them. But one of them has a secret that could get her into trouble and she can't tell them about it. So the movie starts out with the main couple being really excited and they're looking forward to having sex with eachother. But when they actually get to have sex, the girls don't love eachother and they don in fact break up.  . I found it really funny that one of the main girls is the only one that's really smart in the school. But she is only smart in her class because she's very beautiful. The other girls don?t really seem to like her and the other girls aren?t interested in her either. She is the smartest girl in the class, but she's just

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  My family loved this movie. The movie has a great story line, lots of action, lotsa sex and lots of laughter. It was good to see that the makers of this movie knew what they were doing and how to do it. __________________________________________________ "Gonna Fly Now" was the name of a song that John Denver sang while driving on the highway in his car. It wasn't the most original song, but it was a catchy tune. The song was so catchy and the movie so entertaining that the whole family loved it. The whole family laughed a lot. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis, who was a great director, and it was directed with a good budget. The music was wonderful and John Denver did a good job with his singing. I was a big fan of the movie, but the last third of the film left me a little disappointed. I liked the character of "Hollywood" more than John Denver. But that is my opinion. If you are a John Denver fan, then you will love this movie! _________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight"  is not a bad movie.  It's not a good film.     It's not an average film.    The only thing I would change is the scene with a man trying to catch a woman, who was walking across the rooftops of Gotham.    I don't think the man could have caught the woman, but the woman would have caught him, and then he would have been captured by Batman.  There is a scene where Bruce is running away from the man.   Bruce is running towards a building and the man is coming down the stairs.  Then Batman appears in front of him.  Batman doesn't say anything, just comes at him.   Then he falls and Batman pulls the man off Bruce.  In the next shot, Batman is on top of the man, and he has a gun pointed at his head.   It looks like Bruce was being tortured.  This scene could have been a great part of the movie, if not for the stupidly awful acting.  The acting is bad and it was just plain silly.  There was no point of the scene, and Bruce has already run away, and this would have only made it funnier.  But this was a very good part of a good, good movie. The last scene, of Bruce running through the city, is really great.    There are so many things I love about this scene.  One, it was a great way to end the movie. Two, Bruce runs through Gotham and the city is so beautiful.  Three, the way Bruce runs was a lot of fun.  Four, Bruce ran through the streets, and I loved the way the camera stayed with him as he ran.  And five, the sound of the city was amazing.  I thought it was so good that I had to include a few seconds of it in the review.  A few seconds, but a few, that makes it great.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  There's a line in the movie, "I can't stand it when my favorite team loses." - The movie has a lot of good points. It has great music, a good story, a fun character, great acting. However, it is very much a sports movie. It is a bad sports movie in the sense that I feel that it does not do justice to the sport that the characters play. It doesn't give the players or coaches their due. They do not do enough to make us care about them. I also feel that the story line is very shallow. The movie is told from the point of view of the players. We never really get to know them. We see them in their natural environment. They are in a tournament, they are training, they have some practice games, but not much of the actual games. So they are pretty much just there to get a good score, and we never get to see how they really are.

The acting is superb, the action is epic, the fight choreography is perfect and the final showdown is a real thrill ride. It is a perfect example of a story-driven action movie and it is a film that is not only worthy of the praise it has received but also deserves the attention that the film has gotten in the past decade. I also like how the director did not give away too much of the story as to what is happening on screen. The movie ends with a bang and the audience is left wondering what will happen next and why.

It is a good film that would have been good even if it wasn't made by a Canadian and it is also a film made by people who know how to do it.  It is a very well made movie and it makes a good case that it's not as bad as the critics say. The film stars Robert Carlyle, Susan Orlean, Jim Broadbent and Mark Strong. It was made in Canada and the movie was filmed in Alberta. The cast is very good and the acting is also good. The story is not very interesting but it has a lot of heart. The ending is quite touching and it also shows that not all bad movies have to be bad. It's a good enough movie and the cast does well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The Best Thing I Ever Had" is the best movie I've seen. I've never been a fan of the 80's or 90's so I couldn't watch this when it was released. I bought it because I was curious and I couldn´t believe how good this movie was. The acting is great and the story line is unbelievable. There are some parts that are a little hard to follow and the ending is a little weird, but it is still worth watching. I don´t know if the actors are really that good but I'm sure that they don't play these parts for the sake of it. There is a lot of violence in this movie and a little bit of sex. There's also some strong language in this but you can only understand the dialogue in english. Overall, I think that this movie is worth watching and I highly recommend it to any fans of 80's movies or 90´s movies. I highly suggest this movie for the fans of good movies. If you are looking for a good 80's movie, give this movie a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (You will need a good rating system to rate movies like this one). This is a very good movie. I saw it when I was a teenager. I remember being blown away by it. I loved it! It was about a boy named Chris. His father, a man of few words, was an old school tough guy. His dad was a man that never gave up. He was tough and no one in his family had the guts to challenge him. But he was never afraid of anything. Chris was a bit of a nerd but he could hold his own. He had a good heart and he loved his father very much. He would come home after school and help his father on his ranch. When Chris was only a boy, he got to know his father's brother. The brother was a pretty cool guy. He loved to read and was a great artist. Chris always had a lot of questions about his brother and the brother didn't have much to say. One day, Chris found his brother in a back room at the ranch with a knife in his hand. He told his father what happened. Chris told his dad that he wanted to know why his brother was acting like that. His old man didn't say much. But Chris didn't need any more. He knew he wanted answers. So he asked him. Chris's father said he couldn't tell him much. Chris wanted to hear it all. But his father was too afraid to give him any answers. He wanted to protect his son. Chris would always wonder about what happened to his brother. He thought that he had been killed. He never believed it. After a while, Chris got a letter from his brother asking him to come home. Chris didn�t believe it. He didn�ve been back to the ranch and there were no signs of his brother anywhere. It bothered Chris that his brother had just been killed and he didn�ts believe it at all. Chris decided that he needed to find out what really happened to him brother. So, he went to the school and told his teachers. The teacher at the school asked him if he had a brother named Chris and Chris said yes. She said she had a Chris in her class and that he was a good kid. She also told him that he wasn�t in the class. But she said he wasn't very good and that she thought Chris had gone to California and never came back. Chris thought she was crazy. But the teacher told

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars" (1977) was an exciting film about a young man who becomes a Jedi and is later trained to fight against evil, and who travels with two Jedi. I loved the first part and the sequel was also good. There is one very short scene, which could be cut out, but it is a very good scene that explains some things about the characters. The last two Jedi are really fun, and the film has a really good ending. The best part is that the original trilogy was a lot better than this, with better special effects and some good special effects. It's an awesome movie and I would recommend it to any Star Wars fan. It is also one of my favorite Star Wars movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   I don't care how bad the acting is, or the acting of the director, or how badly the plot and the screenplay are written. There is something about the style of the movie that just hooks me. It's like a good romance. It makes me want to see it. I know it has a lot of problems, but it makes me go "yeah I'd love to see that".   So the movie is a couple, and they are just about to move to their new home in a new neighborhood. It looks nice and it has good landscaping. It has a nice swimming pool. It is in a beautiful neighborhood. The two couples move in, and their relationship starts. One guy is very romantic. He has a girl on his arm and the other guy is really serious about his career. He can be very nice to the other girl. But the problem is that he can be quite possessive of his girlfriend. He tells her what to wear and when to do it. She feels very much like a slave. He doesn't take no for an answer. He won't allow her to call him "Daddy" or "Dad". He won`t let her do the things that he wants her to do. He wants her around him. He needs her. She is his toy.   It is the guy's girlfriend who is the first to discover that her boyfriend has a little secret. Her boyfriend has been spending most of his time with this other guy. Her dad is really pissed off about this. He tries to get him to come home and take care of his daughter. She can't do it because she has a baby on the way. So he sends his son out to get the guy. He is a tough guy and is willing to do whatever it takes.   to get this guy to come back home and care for his daughter, he has to take care and pay for his girlfriend, because he doesn't want to pay for a kid that he never saw and will never see again.   The boy brings the guy home. The guy is a bit shocked to see his old dad. But when he sees his daughter and the boy is gone, he comes to terms with the fact that his dad has always loved him.  .  : I thought the movie was good. It had a lot more of the romantic love in it than I expected it to have. I loved the chemistry between the two couples. I really liked

I watched it at my office recently, and I was very impressed with the cinematography, the acting, the sound and the score. The acting is excellent, the writing is very strong, and the story is intriguing. There's a very nice ending, but I'm a little disappointed that the ending wasn't more complete. It was an excellent film, with some good action scenes and the final battle between the two teams is spectacular. It also has great special effects. I highly recommend this film, and my only comment is that there could have been a little better explanation about how all of the blood was made, but overall it was a very good movie. If you are a fan of this genre, I would highly recommend watching it. It has an excellent ending and the ending is worth watching. Also, I was surprised by the gore factor of the movie, because there were very little blood scenes. ____________________________ _________________________ ____  Date: Wed, 15 Jun 2001 22:35:08 -0700 (PDT) From: jonathan@truesomewhere.com Subject: Blood Sport movie review Dear all, I watched this movie on VHS.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ It's a small movie, but it has a lot of heart. It was filmed in New York in the 1980s. There were about 30-40 people in the cast. The director was named John Schlesinger. He was one of the great cinematographers. He had a great eye for lighting and for the way the actors looked and moved. He also used a lot light on the actors. The movie is about a man who has a heart attack. His wife is on a road trip and is driving the wrong way down a one way street. The car hits a tree. It is only a car, but the actor who plays the husband has a broken back. He's not going to make it. His heart is still beating. He gets out of the car and begins to walk. He has a few moments where he is trying to convince himself that he can walk again. It's pretty amazing. Then he starts to see lights, and they are all coming out of his eyes. He is looking at a man sitting on a tree stump and he starts talking to him. It turns out that the man is Jesus Christ. It really makes him feel better. He begins to believe that he will be healed. There are many people in that hospital, and people that are trying to keep him from being healed. He says he doesn't want to be saved, he wants to be happy. He wants to walk again, and he wants a car. It takes a few tries for him to walk, but he does it. It looks like he will never walk again but he walks back to the car. The next morning he wakes up and his wife is waiting for him. The man is back to normal. His head is still hurting but he is walking again. His story really touched my heart. I love this movie. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because I thought it was a little long. I think it's a good thing that the director didn't want the movie to be so long that it would have lost its emotional impact. This is a great movie. It has a great ending. It will be in theaters for a long time. It should be shown in high school or college film classes. It might even be worth seeing by a couple of people.  I don't know why I love John Schiesinger so much, I guess it's just that he's one of those guys who can make a movie about anything. A
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie with good story, and it has a lot of humor and fun. The main character of this movie is an average American high school student who has never been on a trip abroad, so he is a little confused and surprised by what he sees. The story is good and very enjoyable, and this movie will be one of the best ones to watch on the weekend, especially when you're tired. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good thriller. It is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!  This movie has a few good scenes, a few bad scenes and a lot of great scenes. It's an enjoyable film with a good story. There are some funny scenes, but that's all there is. A lot of people complain about the way that the action is shot and that the characters move a lot. This movie has very good action and the characters are moving well, but it's still a bit boring. The story is interesting and the action scenes are good, but they could have been done a lot better. The special effects are good. It looks pretty good and has some very cool moments. There is also a great special effects scene in this movie and the music is also good. The only thing I don't like about this movie is the ending. It is very weird and doesn't make sense. This film has some good scenes. The acting is very good and the actors did a great job. This is a good film. The ending is a bit too weird. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of martial arts movies. I really enjoyed this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I saw this at the BFI, a great British Film Festival. This was not a great movie but it was a great piece of drama. The acting was good, the plot was good. If you want to see a good drama with an important theme about life, the war and death you should see this movie. The film is in German and I am not sure if I have seen the movie in German before. This is not a very good movie but I think you should watch it anyway. I think this film is about the end of an era, when people were not as scared of death as they were at the beginning. I am glad that this movie is made and hopefully it will be made in the future. I hope that there will be more films about the Second World War.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great movie! The movie was great! Great cast, great story, and great characters. The story had great meaning and I think it is the main thing that makes the movie good. The sound and cinematography was great and really helped to make the film look good. This movie was a little slow but it made it more interesting. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good action movie. I saw it with my dad and he liked it a lot. I love this movie because of the characters and I loved the story.

I really liked the character of Ray. I like that the characters in the first two movies were not so serious. They made fun of themselves. They weren't so serious that they didn't have a sense of humor. They were funny. I enjoyed the humor of the two movies. They kept me entertained and didn't let me down. I had a great time. I would like to see a sequel, and maybe the series. _____________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "This movie was not at all what I expected it to be, but it wasn't bad either. It was just what I was expecting from a "Cobain biopic" which is about the most pretentious movie I've ever seen. "This is a movie about an art-rocker, not a rock star. In fact, this is a really dumb movie, in a bad way, but at least it had some fun and interesting aspects. It really does look like a "cobain biography" and this is definitely one of the dumbest biopics I've seen. I am not a fan of this movie at all, but I do not dislike it either. I like Cobain, but this movie is just plain dumb and I don't even understand why they even made this movie. This is a film about a guy who is a complete dick, but he's not a dick. I guess this movie tries to be about him, but if you actually know who Cobain was and what his story is, you would know this is really a biography of someone who was a complete pussy. He didn't want to rock out, he didn't do the drugs, he wasn't into women, and yet here we have a movie where he's the rock star who is also a fucking douchebag. I've been watching a lot of rock documentaries lately, and this movie really does not deserve the title of "rock biopic". At least not the "official" one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ My rating: **** This is a pretty decent movie with a nice ending. It is a movie that will probably not be very enjoyable to those who don't really like horror movies, but if you are a fan of them this is a great choice. The story is pretty basic but the movie is quite creepy and the story is very interesting. This is the only movie that I know of that has this many elements that are all different. The movie has a few action scenes and a few horror scenes but nothing too crazy. This movie is worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Last Witch Hunter "  was a wonderful movie that had everything going for it. I had a wonderful time watching this movie and even though it's a remake of a classic horror movie it still had a freshness to it that the original never had. I hope they make more of these. This movie is a good example of how horror movies can be made. It's a slow build and it keeps you on your toes and is extremely scary. The actors were great. The special effects were good and the movie was just a great experience. This is a great movie to watch on Halloween night. I highly recommend this movie to all horror fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* **************************** ********************* I was pleasantly surprised with the ending to this movie, and I have to say I am not surprised that I loved it as much as I did. I was a bit confused by how much I liked the ending at first, but after a while, I realized that I had not been given the whole picture. The film does not really tell you what it was about. The first part is about a guy, who is in a small town and tries to find out who killed his wife. There is a lot of information that is not explained. The second part is the story of the couple. There are a few moments when the film seems to be moving in a direction. There seems to not be any story behind this film. Then a voice over comes in and the film turns into a horror film. There was no suspense or anything. Then, the next part comes in. A few times the voice over said "Don't look behind you", and I was thinking "What the hell is he saying?". But, after a little while, it gets more interesting. A young girl (he looks like a girl but is really a boy) is walking down a dark alley with her mother. The mother was killed by a killer. She was just a little girl when she died. The little girl is in trouble. She needs to find a way out of the dark alley and finds a way. This part was just very, very interesting. The girl gets in a car and drives to a hotel. At the hotel, she goes into a room. When she gets out of her car, the girl sees a little boy. The child is tied up and blindfolded. The next scene is of the little boy in the room, with the girl, who takes a picture of him. Then the girl goes to the hotel to meet the boy, who wants to help her. Then we get a shot of the girl and the little girl. The camera follows them. The boy is very frightened. He is crying. When the girl is talking to him, he doesn't answer. He doesn't understand what is going on. She tells him to relax and says she will help him. The movie goes back and forth a few times, but we are never told what is happening. Then there is a big scare, and the girl seems to get frightened. The big scare is at the hotel. When they get out of their car, there is an

The actors are the same people, the scenes are the old ones. I like this film, because it has the good parts and the bad parts. The good parts are the good characters, and the sad parts are not as sad as the others. The ending is very well done, and you know how things are going to end. I didn't expect anything from it, but it's the first film by my favorite director. I was happy with the whole film, and I'm glad I watched it." - Richard Corliss "This film has everything. A love story, a mystery, a story about people who just can't seem to be happy. This film has a good, solid plot, and it's just a shame that it doesn't have any of the magic that made the original "Love Story" so memorable." - David Denby "There's nothing else like it. The film, in a way, is just like the movie, a love story that goes through the ups and downs of a relationship. But unlike the movie it has a lot of depth to it, which makes it even more moving and enjoyable to watch. If you like movies that are not all action and the usual plot twists, and if you like a good love story then you will definitely enjoy this film." - Stephen Graham "The film has all of the qualities of a great love story: love, loss, heartache, sorrow, sadness, romance, all of which make it a truly wonderful movie. It also has great actors in it, and an interesting plot that has a bit of a twist. I found myself watching this film over and over, trying to figure out what would happen next, and what the meaning of the film was. The movie was worth the price of admission, and not just for the wonderful performances, but also for the excellent plot and characters." - Michael L. M. Haddix "I don't have the words for the emotions I experienced as I watched this film. There is nothing that could possibly be added that would not just be a lie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. ____________. ____________________. I've seen some really good movies over the years. This movie isn't one of them. It is so bad, I can't even remember where it started. This is not a movie to be watched in a theater, it's not a good idea to show it to anyone at all. The acting was awful and the story was bad. If you've seen The Devil's Advocate or something, you'd know that the story line here is just as stupid. The film is about a lawyer, played by a young Steve Carell, who wants to be a better lawyer. The movie follows his quest to become a better person, but then the movie just goes off the rails. Carell is good in his role, but he can't act at all, and the rest of the cast just is bad. The director of the movie, Chris Columbus, didn't even bother to hire a director for this film. The guy who wrote the script (Christopher Nolan) is credited as the director, but when you look at the credits, it shows Columbus directing, with Nolan as producer. This means that Columbus had nothing to do with the writing of this movie. The script was horrible. I could list a dozen things that Columbus didn't do that could have made the movie better. The one thing that did work, was that it had a good cast. It's not worth your time. If this movie were made today, the cast would have to be at least 30 years younger, because that was a pretty young cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________   There are two aspects of this movie that make it good. The first one is the good acting, and the other is the fact that the plot is well-written and it is never a simple or predictable. It is a very emotional movie, and is made even more so by the fact of it's story and characters. This movie was definitely made for a film festival.   The acting is very good, and you see a lot of real people. The movie is very realistic and you can tell that the people in the movie are just ordinary people. This is a movie that doesn't focus on any specific characters and the story is told through a lot characters. The acting is great, and we see the characters in a way that we know them. The performances in this movie are very good.  :)   ____________________________________________   This movie is also a very interesting one. It was made for an audience that likes a lot fantasy movies. The story is very emotional, and it shows us the pain that people go through. We see people that are just like us and go through the same things that we go through every day. We also see a story that is a little bit like The Wizard of Oz, and that makes this movie very unique. This story is about the man and woman who go to a magical world and fight evil. The film was also made for the adults and kids who love fantasy and adventure. This film shows us a little more of the story than most fantasy films, and this makes the movie better.   to top it off, this movie also features a great song that will make you feel like you are there. The song that is sung by the hero of this film, is a wonderful song and will make your heart feel like it is flying.     I really enjoyed this movie, because it showed us a lot about people, their lives, and how they cope with their problems.   ( :
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ - I'm going to say this movie's one of my favorite movies of all time, it is a really good time. The best part of this movie is that there are no "tricks" to the movie like some of the other movies of the 80's and 90's, it just shows what the characters really are about. It shows the human aspect of what they are all about and the way they interact with each other. It is a good time to watch this movie. - The movie has good soundtracks. - I don't think that the movie will be a big hit at the box office. It may only be a $3-4 million film, but it has a good cast and a great story. It will not get any awards or even close to that. ____________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Both Worlds  is a pretty solid science fiction movie. It has a fairly simple plot which you could do on a two-page storyboard. The plot involves a group of people on a space station that has been destroyed by a virus that kills its victims in minutes. One of the people on the station is Dr. James T. Kirk, a man with a very specific idea of how he thinks a man should live his life. He wants to see what is on the other side of death. He is sent on a mission to this planet which is home to the Klingons. There he finds that the Klingonese have built a huge city to live in and they have very few rules. There is a whole lot of humor in this movie. The characters are not very interesting but the movie is good enough. There are a couple of good action scenes but they are not as good as some of the action in the original Star Trek movie. Overall a good but not great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *******************************  The movie has a great plot with a good cast. I enjoyed the character's personalities.  -Harrison Ford as a pilot who finds himself in the middle of an epic war.  a great story with the right mixture of action, suspense and character. -I liked the cinematography and the special effects.  the movie had a great atmosphere. :  It's an epic tale that starts with a small group of soldiers who are stationed at a remote air base. Their job is to provide intelligence and support to the ground forces of the United States. The soldiers are under orders to not show any emotion, so when they see their commander get shot down in a dogfight, they're shocked and upset. Then a few months later they are ordered to return to the base to assist a new commander who has just been put in place. But as they are about to get ready to return, they are attacked by the enemy. It's a classic war movie and a very good one at that. I loved it. I didn't have a problem with the pacing at all. It kept me interested in what was happening to these soldiers. The only bad thing was the ending. It made me feel like the whole movie was a joke. I found it odd that the soldiers were all in a state of shock. I thought the movie was over before it really got started. I understand that the movie is a movie and it was made for entertainment purposes, but it could have been better. But then again, that's why you watch a movie. There's nothing wrong with the movie, it was just not a good one. It was a great movie and I really enjoyed it. **********************  This movie is epic in the best sense of the word. . The acting was excellent and the plot was very good. This is one of the best war movies I've seen. It has great action and the characters are all likable. I have a feeling the ending will leave you wishing for more. A very good movie.  The movie is awesome. The special effects were great and the cinematographer was great. This was a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not only a great horror movie, it's also a great comedy.  The film is about a little girl who has been raised by an abusive family and is terrified of the dark. Â  Her only friends are the creatures she encounters at night and a girl named Roxy.   They are in a house at the edge of the woods and are trapped when a demon comes and takes over the house.     Roxy does not understand what she is and tries to warn her, but it's too late.  The director,  Brian De Palma  has made some of his best movies and he shows no signs of stopping.  The film is based on a novel by Stephen King,  and was directed by one of his screenwriters,    Roger Ross Williams.  Williams had written another book with a similar premise,    The Exorcist.   It was an idea he had for a film when he was younger, but when it came time to direct, he did not have the experience necessary to pull it off.  I guess he had some talent in him.  And so,  De PalMA  was given the chance to take the idea and turn it into a great movie.  It's scary, it looks like a horror movie from the seventies,  but it has a good amount of laughs and is a good watch.  In addition, the film is very well-paced and well-written.  Brian DePalma has made some good films, but I think this is his best.  Recommended to fans of horror and comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is good movie but there is some bad parts. For instance: 1. They are all white men in the movie and they were all the main actors so they all had the same look. 2. The first sex scene between her and a black man is weird because he has the same face as her. 3. The sex scene with her friend was so boring and was very short. The ending was not nice because the movie was so short. 4. The movie was really bad with some bad scenes and the bad characters were all white males. 5. The best scene was the one with the black guy. It was good to see how the black man treated her and how he looked like. 6. There were some good and bad parts in the sex scene. 7. The last sex scene is not good because it was just to sad and it was very long.  Overall: This movie was very good and worth to see. The actors were all good and all the scenes were great. The only bad thing about this movie was the ending. It wasn't very good. I give this movie a 8 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do not watch this movie if you are an anti-war, pro-peace, peace-loving person. _____________ It is a great movie.  It is a film about a great soldier.       The film is made with great care and attention to detail.     The cinematography is well-done.     The acting is top-notch.     The movie does not contain the typical anti-American propaganda.   There is no anti-Semitism or racism.  There is no war-mongering.  The only thing that is offensive is the movie itself.  It is made by an Israeli Jew (it should be noted that this is not the first time that a Israeli Jew has directed a film).   He was very pro-Israel.  He was a patriot.  This movie is about a very interesting man, a great war hero who is a bit of a rebel, who is very concerned about his family and his country.  I am a great admirer of this man.  His wife is very strong-willed and very intelligent.  She is very outspoken about her political views.  Her son is a nice guy.  His son was very smart.  As the story unfolds, you realize that his son was also a good kid.  And the other kids in the neighborhood are not bad either.  You realize how far Israel has gone in the last 50 years and you see how much it has changed.  What does it say about the world today?  What is the world coming to?   Is it worth it?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Martian  is a movie about a man who decides to stay on the planet of Mars to do some research for a book he is writing.  He meets a woman named Melissa who has been stranded on Mars and they end up in a relationship.  The Martian is not just a science fiction movie but a drama as well.    I enjoyed the movie.  It has a lot of action in it and there is a lot to see in the movie as the plot goes on.  The movie is about a guy who is trying to get to Mars and has to stay there in a very difficult situation.  In the beginning of the movie the movie gives us a little bit of information about what it is like to live on Mars.  We learn that Mars has a dry climate and that there are different kinds of plants on the Martian soil.  Then the movie gets really interesting when we see that the guy is stranded on the ground on Mars, trying to figure out what to do with his life.  If you are interested in science fiction movies then I recommend The Martian.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! A great movie. A good movie for a good time. A great story with a great twist. This is a movie about a man who was shot in the head by a man he just met. A woman walks into his room and tells him he has a gift and that he is going to get a second chance at life. He does not believe her and tries to shoot her. His head is not the only thing he is dealing with. The man who shot him is coming after him with a gun. They run to a motel where the man is waiting for them. The woman who gave him the gift is a prostitute. When the woman sees the man come to kill him, she grabs a gun and shoots him and escapes. The movie is really a great story about how a man must deal with his grief. It shows how life changes. There are a few times where it seems like it was not written with a strong story. But the movie does what it needs to do to tell its story. It gives us a glimpse into a world that many have never seen. It has great acting from everyone in the movie and it is really good to see people who have never done anything on film acting so well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story with twists. I think this movie would be a great movie for the kids too. The characters are all interesting and the movie keeps up a good pace. The ending of the movie is very good and shows that this movie will not be finished. It will continue. The only problem I have is with the ending. It just seemed a little off. I thought it was a little rushed and not that well thought out. But I can see why they did it. I guess I would just recommend this one to those who are looking for a great action movie. I give this movie a 4.5 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  The film stars Michael Keaton as the voice of a "mole" who works in the New York City subway system. This mole becomes an instant favorite. The film is set in a very small New York, and Keaton, who is a bit of a lightweight, shines here.  Keaton is a very well-rounded actor, who has a very unique presence. The character is very interesting, and it's very fun to see him grow and develop as the story progresses. I found myself looking forward to his adventures. .  and he gets a nice scene at the end of the film.    The soundtrack is also pretty great. The opening credits have an excellent arrangement of "All I Want for Christmas is You" by The Beach Boys. There's a very nice jazz tune that is played when the movie starts. And a couple of songs are played by the voice actors when they're talking to the "moles".  . The voice acting was pretty good. The actors did a good job with the roles. And there was a good amount of laughs to be had.   Overall, this movie is very entertaining. It has some really good characters and some really funny moments. There were a few parts that felt a little repetitive, but overall I found this movie a lot of fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I had read all the reviews for this movie, and I was worried that it would be just like the other films of this genre. I was pleasantly surprised. The script was very original, and the story was very well-written. I found the characters to be interesting, but I found it hard to take them seriously. I mean, if you're going to make a film about a guy who tries to make it as a Hollywood actor, you should have a better idea of what he is like. If you're making a film that deals with such an important subject, you shouldn't leave out important details. In my opinion, the film is more about the characters than the actors. The movie didn't have many scenes that were very funny, but there were some very funny moments. The characters did get more emotional as the story progressed. I really enjoyed this film. I think that it was a good watch. The acting was excellent, and it had a very interesting plot. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** A young girl discovers a magical item, the "Kumiho" (祈髪), a sacred treasure. The Kamaitachi, a legendary monster, has been killed and its body is found. But it seems that only a small portion of the monster has been recovered, and the creature is very old, as it has been dead for ages. The girl must go to the island to retrieve the "Gomu Gomu no Kama" (つもうのカマイ), a mystical stone that has the power to destroy the Kumiho. The island of the Kumi-Kusa (海海地賊, "Sea of Fire Island") is located on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. This is the movie with one of the most beautiful scenery in the history of Japan. A young, beautiful, and mysterious girl who has been traveling to Hokkaidō to acquire a magic stone is introduced in this movie. The main character is Yuki Todomatsu, who is a 17-year-old girl who is living in a remote island with her mother and sister. She has a very strong sense of responsibility and responsibility for her life. She is very close with her little sister and loves her very much. One day, she is walking by a stream, and a small baby is crying. This baby is the "Sasuke" (菊し) from her village. Sasuke has a long and rich history, and was originally a very powerful and noble creature. However, after the destruction of the "Naga" (ナガ) that killed his tribe, Sasuke was left on the shore of the sea, helpless and powerless. However a girl named Risa, who has the same blood as Sasuke, and has a strong sense for nature and the spirit world, rescues Sasuke from the waves. The movie tells about the adventures of Risa and Sasuke, as they travel around the world and get involved in many different adventures. This movie is the story of two sisters who are destined to meet. This story is a wonderful story, with beautiful scenery, a very interesting story and a strong and beautiful main character. In my opinion, this is one of my favorite movie in the entire history of cinema. I have seen this movie twice, both times in a theater. This anime is very good for young children who love stories. It is a movie for those who
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- What I would like to know is: Did they add a lot of "funny moments" (in the story, in the animation and the sounds)? (They didn't have any. The story was great. The animation was great.) How about adding a little "darkness" to the film. That's a good way to get the attention of the viewers. I saw the movie at the theater in the morning and at the time of the night, I thought that the movie was a bit boring. However, I must admit that after some time, I was amazed that I watched this movie. The music was great and the story was very entertaining. I really enjoyed it and I'm going to watch it again in the next few days. ---------------

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I saw "Star Wars: A New Hope" when I was 12 years old. It was the first film I had seen with a special effects budget. I was in awe, and when I got home I looked at the movie poster and realized that I had been looking at the wrong movie. It turns out the poster was supposed to be the one from the old "Star Trek" series. I didn't know that at the time, but after a few more Star Wars movies I learned how to recognize the Star Wars universe. I am a fan of all things Star Wars, from the movies to the books and games. I've never seen a Star Wars movie that I didn´t love. I loved "A New Hope", and I hope you'll like it as much as I do. "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"  The best of Star Wars. This was my first Star Wars film, and it was a real treat to see the original cast on screen again. George Lucas has made a film I can't imagine not being a fan about. Star Wars is a galaxy that is so rich in mythology and history that it could be our own if we could only understand it. Lucas has captured the essence of Star wars, and in the end of the day it is a film about a journey of the soul and the mind. If you want a film with no plot, with lots of special effects and the original voice actors all in one, this is the film for you. It is not about the action, or the characters, or even the plot. It has all that. This is the movie you see when you wake up in the morning and say "I love Star Wars". A New Life  An amazing film, full of beautiful special effects, an unforgettable score and wonderful acting. This film has it all. It captures the essence and wonder of Star-Wars. A New life has a very nice balance of humor, action and drama, and I loved it. It really was one of the best Star Wars films, and my favorite film of all time.  Star Wars  This is a wonderful film that manages to capture the essence, the wonder and the magic of Starwars, without sacrificing any of the plot or the action. I recommend this film to all those who love Star-wars and to all fans of the original trilogy. . -Starwars.com  .

I'm really glad to see this film and it really gives me the feeling that I'm living in the 70's. The music was really good too. It has a very good atmosphere.

It had great story, great characters, and great acting. It's a good film and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The story of the film is a lot like "Fargo," in that a large number of the people involved in a seemingly insignificant event (a man's arrest for murder, his wife's kidnapping, etc.) are all related to each other in a way that is not as simple as it seems at first. And just as the film's story is somewhat similar to the original film, the movie also shares a few similarities with "Farewell My Concubine." While "F" is set in the same area as the "Concubine" film, and features some of the same characters, it is more of a "Fitzcarraldo" type of movie. The plot involves a large amount of people involved with a robbery (a "thief's gallery") which is eventually foiled by a very unusual group of people. The film is also somewhat similar in tone and setting to the earlier "Mafia" film (in which, of course, a gangster is involved). However, while there are many similarities between the two films, this is a more "straight-forward" film that still has a lot of surprises. While the first half of the movie is fairly predictable, the second half is a great example of what a crime film can be. It is interesting to see how the story of this film changed throughout its run (from a small movie to a feature length movie), as the first section is more or less the same as the later "M" movie, with a man who doesn't understand the value of family and relationships, and who has a "bad attitude" towards his wife. The ending of the "M", though, has a different tone than the other two films; the ending is not a "good-bye" to the characters, but rather a warning about how to handle situations which are more serious. This movie is a nice "first look" into crime-thriller movies in general. The movie does not have a particularly strong plot, and the ending has a somewhat ambiguous feel, but this is not really a movie for people who are looking for a plot or a strong plot. The story is fairly simple and straightforward, but the characters are so interesting that the movie keeps the viewer engaged, even when the plot is not very "convincing." This is a very interesting movie that is well worth a watch.

It's just a movie. The kids, and the adults, are not "friends" in the true sense of the word. I would've been much more impressed if they had been friends with each other, or if their parents had been willing to take them to a restaurant with them (and then had to take a cab back when the movie ended, or something) rather than have them spend their week with a group of strangers. I am still amazed that they had time to make a movie when their parents were so occupied with their work, but hey, that's life. I don,t know what they were planning to do, but it seems to me they should've gone somewhere more quiet. ___________________ Score: _______ 1/5  Director: Don Simpson Cast: Dennis Quaid, Michael J.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ A man is being attacked by a woman, who is carrying a gun. He gets out of his car and sees her holding a gun to his head. He fires at her, and hits her. He is being arrested by the police. When the police come to arrest him, he says, "I don't have a gun, I don't know why you're arresting me," and he shoots himself in the head.  Answers to these questions would be very easy to find. But, as a psychologist who has been studying suicide for more than 25 years, I have been able to find no reliable evidence that people who commit suicide are suicidal. I have never been able, for instance, to find a single study that has ever shown that people are more likely to commit suicide if they are depressed. Nor have I ever seen a study that shows that people commit suicide when they are feeling high, even if they have no prior history of mental illness. And I have yet to see a study showing that people do not commit suicide under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or even under the effect of sleep deprivation.  a. No reliable evidence exists that people have more or less of a mental illness, and thus more or fewer suicidal ideations and behaviors, when they commit suicide. There is no evidence that a psychiatric illness is the cause of suicide. b. No consistent relationship between a psychiatric diagnosis and suicidal behavior has ever been found. It is a mistake to think that psychiatric diagnoses lead to more suicide, or to that people with psychiatric diagnoses are more or more likely than others to commit suicidal acts. The fact that people don't commit suicide in a particular way does not mean that their suicidal ideation and behaviors don't exist. Indeed, the data clearly shows that some people with suicidal ideators and behaviors commit suicide, but most people who die by suicide do not have suicidal ideator and behaviors. For example, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) shows that of all the deaths from homicide in the U.S. between 2000 and 2005, 40 percent were committed with a firearm.1 However, only about 1 percent of those who died by suicide had a psychiatric disorder.2 And, in a meta-analysis of more than 40 studies of suicide, the only psychiatric disorder associated with suicidal behavior was major depressive disorder.3 In a meta analysis of all suicide deaths, the largest proportion of deaths (32 percent) were committed by people with a history of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so bad I will only watch it when the movie is on in the theaters or the tv. The actors are bad and the director was a complete idiot. I really felt the director wanted to make a big money making film so he hired the actors that he thought would make the movie a big hit. The movie didn't even make a profit! It just made him a big sum of money but he is a very greedy person! He got paid so much money to make the film and he should have just quit making the film because it wasn't a good one! It was just like a bunch of poor people living in the woods in a forest where they don't have anything to do. They have to go out in the night and they have to catch rats because they don t have anything else to do!  I think that this movie was very bad for money so the director should have quit making this film and just made a better movie like "The Deer Hunter" or something!     The Deer Hunter 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 6.8 6.9 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5 8.6 8.7 8.8 8.9 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10 to 10 9.999   
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I can't believe I just saw this movie. The acting is awesome and the characters are well written and developed. It's one of the best animated films ever made. The songs are great too. I was amazed at the animation and the way they brought in the animals from the jungle. I thought I was going to be able to see some of the creatures in the jungle, but to be honest I'm still amazed. There are a few scenes that really get to you, like the scene where a girl and her pet lion dance in the rain together. The rain in this film is so realistic and so perfect that it's almost too pretty. The jungle is the perfect place to be, and I can honestly say it's one I'll never forget. It was the perfect film for me, a movie I would've seen when I was a kid, but never did. It will always hold a special place in my heart.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. _________  _________ I was watching a movie called The Godfather. The director told me he wanted a certain look. He told me that he would send a set of makeup tests. He took me out in a black dress and I looked very sexy. The next day I had to do the test. It was a black wig with blue eyes. When I walked on to the stage I was told that I had made the cut. They said, "The man that was seen in the movie, is now the Godfather."  _____________________  I remember being in the shower and getting a phone call. It said my agent wanted me to be in a film that had just been shot. They were calling me back to a house in the mountains. I was to meet a girl. They had a real estate agent there. He had a big smile on his face. He was dressed up. He asked me if I would go out with him. I told him that I would never do that. I went out and it was a very good experience. The only problem was that I was too embarrassed. I never want to see that guy again.  _____________________________ . I have a friend that was in an Italian movie in the 80's. The Italian guy was an alcoholic and a crook. The producer took him into the back and got a gun out of a safe. He then proceeded to shoot the guy with the gun. I had the pleasure of meeting him.    I have an aunt that I saw in a movie a long time ago. She is very beautiful, but she looks like a piece of meat. Her voice is terrible. Her face is always swollen. Her body is fat. She was in a restaurant and the waitress noticed her. The waitress told the guy that she saw a girl who looks like her and he started to say something. The guy then put a gun to her head and shot her.  the waiter told me. I don't think she got her money. The movie was called "Lucky Guy."      . There was a woman that I knew who died of cancer. She went to a hospital in Florida and the doctor found out that she had cancer. It wasn't too far away from the hospital and the hospital told her family that she would be released. She didn't get out for a while. They kept checking on her and she was still dying. Finally the family

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ It's a bit of a long movie and a bit hard to follow. It's all about the two guys that are at the front of the party and the two women who are at his side. But what makes this movie so good is the chemistry between them. The scene in which the two men are talking about the women's bodies is so funny. And what's funny about it is the way that one of the guys starts talking about how they are both attracted to the same women and then, to the point that he asks if they can go back to the women they were talking about, one of them starts talking to him about her. So funny! And the rest of the movie is all about that one. And I just like the scene in the movie where the two of them are at their favorite club and one of their friends comes in and asks them if they are going to do anything together. They both say yes. And the friend says, "What do you want to do?" The guy says, I want to have sex with her. And then the friend replies, "And you're going to have to pay for it." It's the most honest thing that you'll ever hear from two guys in a club. You can watch this movie on a rainy day. The movie doesn't end when they leave the club. They go back into the club where one of his friends asks them to go back and do it a second time. And they say, No, we're good. But then the guy says to his friend, I wish you hadn't told us to go home so quickly. The funny thing is that they both had sex with each other. So when the two friends see them in the street they both ask if they had done it. The friend says no, and then the other guy says no and then he says, No and then yes. Then they walk away and the friend who got to have it pays for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great thriller. It's the kind of movie where the viewer knows exactly what's going to happen, but you are not sure what is going to be the next twist. There is a certain thrill that comes with watching something like this. The writing is really good. The characters are real, and not at all clichéd. I enjoyed the story and the characters. This is a must see movie.

But the film is very well acted, very well directed, and the music is great.  I really loved the ending, and what it was saying. But I can't imagine how the story could have been better. I hope this movie will bring me more joy than pain.  and the next time you're watching a movie, please don't judge it just by the first 10 minutes, because it's only 10 minutes. It will last an hour, and you'll be happy about it. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I want to hear what you have to say about a film you have seen.   I can see why people like this. It has a very cool premise. The guy is a robot, who's mind has been downloaded into the body of a human girl. This body, as well as her mind, has been infected with a virus that's spreading to other people. So the guy gets the girl to an island where they both work as caretakers for the people on the island.  -The girl is cool and has a good personality.  -I think the movie could have been a lot better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   Starring:  Kirk Cameron, Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Robert Forster, William Shatner  Written by: Kirk Cameron  Directed by: James Cameron  in: 2001   Plot: In a future where mankind has colonized the entire galaxy, a group of humans known as the Colonial Marines are sent out to find the most dangerous criminals and rogue colonists in the galaxy, known as "Mutants". While they're on their mission, they are attacked by a small group of Mutants, led by a woman known as Cassandra, and their mission becomes a suicide mission when they are forced to fight a battle on two fronts. As they are fighting back and forth, they discover that their attackers are actually mutants themselves. After this, the plot thickens as it turns out that they are the ones that have been stealing all of the precious minerals and other valuable materials from the planets they have colonized. The story gets more and more confusing as the plot twists and turns, and it becomes very hard to understand the events going on. The acting in this movie is very good, but it is a little too heavy for the story to carry, and some of the acting is really cheesy. The characters are all very well designed and it is great to see the Colonial Marine's helmets. The special effects are all done very well, and they have all the action and action sequences you could ever want. The score by Kirk Cameron is pretty great, and while some parts of the movie can get a little heavy, it does have a great soundtrack to go with it. The ending of the film is a very good one, and the movie is really great. This movie is worth watching, but only if you have a sense of humor and can enjoy a good sci-fi film.  Categories:Action

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was just the way I liked a good western, and I loved how they kept it simple. It's like the old west with an extra dose of humor.  The actors did a good job, but I had to wonder why they didn't include more of the extras on the DVD.  So the film opens in Texas where a man and his horse are attacked by a bear.  The horse was thrown into the river, and the man, trying to save his horse, is killed by a knife thrown by the bear.  At the ranch, the owner is waiting for the sheriff to arrive.  He tells him that the horse was attacked by some other horse, and he thought he had to get him out of the way.  When the sheriff arrives, he finds the horse dead, and then discovers the body of the man.    He is not very happy to find the body, and calls for a deputy.  It is the horse's friend who tells him the man has been killed by the man he was riding with.   When the man and the horse are brought in to the sheriff, he asks them if they killed the other horse.  After some back and forth, the horse tells the sheriff that they had not, and that he had jumped on the back of the dead man. The sheriff takes the man's horse to the cemetery and asks his neighbor for a horse. He takes the horse to where the other man's corpse was, and they see the man there.  His body is so horribly mutilated that he looks like a dead human being.  Then, when the sheriff tries to get his horse back, the man shoots at him.  This time, the sheriff is not so lucky, and dies.  A doctor from another town, thinking the sheriff has died, runs out to the scene to help, but it is too late, the victim is already dead.  We follow the doctor as he looks for the man with the dead body, but he is unable to find him.   The doctor goes to the jail to get a report, and finds that the man is already there, and has a gunshot wound to the head.  But before he can do anything, the Sheriff's horse runs out and jumps on top of the Sheriff, pulling him back down.  And it is the sheriff who dies.   Then we get to see the dead Sheriff's body lying on the ground, and it

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The Good: ************** I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and very enjoyable to watch. The acting was great, and it's a bit of a slow burner, but it will pay off. The story was a good one. I did have a few questions about a couple of the characters, but they were answered in the end. It didn't feel like a one time thing, it kept going. The ending was also nice. ******** The Bad: ****************** I think there was a little bit too much plot in the movie. There were a lot of things going on in this movie, and a few things that just didn't make sense. I guess the author had to write a sequel, so he threw out a few of the things in this story. The movie also ended on a little cliffhanger, but there's no real reason for that. I think a sequel would have been better, but the movie did its job. I also felt like it had too much of a plot, but not enough characters. I like the main character, but I think it would have helped if there were a couple more characters. There was one person that really didn't get much development. This movie is a little too short, but that's what I get for reading the book. This is one of the few movies that really made me laugh out loud. ************ The Ugly: ______________________________________ I can't believe that I watched this movie! The characters are all kind of lame, and they just don't make any sense. The way they all talk is just kind of dumb. The main character is a bit creepy, and he's so weird, I don't know why they put him in a movie like this. I would have liked a better ending. ***************** Overall: ------------------------- I really liked this movie and I liked the book! I liked it so much that I bought the book for myself, and I am going to read it again. I don' t think I will like the sequel as much as the first, but if I get it, I will re-watch this movie again. This was a very good movie, but unfortunately, it was also a bit too long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Shining"  is a Stanley Kubrick film and it's really not a bad one, and it is well worth seeing. This film was originally supposed to be a direct sequel to "The Shining", but Kubrick decided to change it into a film about a girl who is sent to a mental hospital and who has to deal with her family being in love with each other. The film was filmed over a period of four months in order to create a strong suspense, and the film does have an ending that will stick in your mind for a long time. "The Thing"  The "Thing"  is a movie that is not about a creature, but about people, and that's what it is about. This movie is based on the Stephen King book of the same name, and I've never read it, but I'm sure that this movie is about the same kind of people. This is the story of a young woman who is going through a bad breakup and she is looking for a man who she thinks she can help. Unfortunately, she gets mixed up with a creepy cult called "The Others", who worship a man that is called "the Thing". The film is about how they find her, how they attack her and then they try to convince her to take part in their ritual. The Thing  I think that this is one of the better horror films from the 1980's, and this is mainly because of the acting of Tom Hanks. The main character is played by a woman named Mariel Hemingway, and she's a very nice actress. She does a great job and gives a very convincing performance, and there are a few scenes that really scare the shit out of you. She also has a nice, quiet moment in the film that really makes it work. The other great actor in this movie that I liked was John Hurt. He has a very different role than Mariel, and he has a much darker, more intense role. He is definitely an actor that I would like to see in more films in the future. "It"  This is a horror film that is pretty scary, but it has a lot of humor in it, and you can really relate to some of the people in the movie. I really enjoyed this film, and if you're a fan of horror films, you should give it a try. It is definitely worth a watch. Overall Rating:   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If a film is really good, there are going to be a lot of bad films made about it. And even when a film does nothing wrong, and is merely good, some people still don't like it.  And if a film isn't good, and the bad reviews aren't really deserved, then people will write them off as cheap, cheap trash.  The thing is, though, that I've seen some really great films about the Holocaust that people just won't watch because of their own personal biases. _____________________________________ So with all that said, I'm not going to watch this movie. _______________________ I'm sure that the director of this movie is a decent guy who wants to do a good job in the movies he makes. But as a Jew, and someone who's seen some truly terrible movies in my time, I don't want to watch the movie. It's not even a good Holocaust movie, because most of the movie's content is taken from other movies and it's just a rehash. _________ ____________ The first few minutes are a lot better than this one, but it doesn't take long for the movie to go off the rails. ______________________________ I have never seen a movie that is so bad that it's good.  ______________________________________ I would never have believed that the Holocaust could be made a good film. I'm going to have to watch The Last Temptation of Christ for that. _____ ____________________________________ It's always nice to see a Holocaust movie that doesn't make the victims into some sort of boogeyman.  _____________________________________ _____________________________  ________ ___________ The problem with this movie, besides being a bad film, is that it is too slow.  The first couple of minutes are so boring that you'll start to wish that the movie would just go away.  I have to tell you that the ending is absolutely terrible.

I saw it on the big screen and I enjoyed it. I thought the acting was great. I enjoyed the story and the characters. The music was great and I was happy that they put it on a big screen. The story was very good and the ending was just great. The way the film ends was very well done. I think it was really the right ending to a great movie. It is a good idea to use a big, bright screen for a movie, as it really helps the image. The movie was good enough to watch. I liked it. It had a great ending and the actors did a great job. I would recommend this movie to everyone who liked the movie "Back To The Future". I also enjoyed this movie because I like all the characters in this movie. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I really liked this movie! I loved this movie and I liked how they went in a different direction and the film didn't feel like a direct sequel. I loved how they took a more light hearted approach to the story. The acting was very nice and they had great chemistry between the actors. The action scenes were great and the movie was great for adults. I also loved that this movie was about love and not hate. I like when a movie has a happy ending and a happy message. ___________________________________________________________ This movie is a great example of how not to make a movie. There are a lot of things that could have been done better in this film. They did not even mention the movie in the credits. The film was not even mentioned in the beginning of the movie. The characters were not introduced in the movie and were not given much of a chance to develop. They should have at least mentioned that the film was about a young boy and his dog. The director did not understand that this film would be a success. He wanted a big budget, big name director and that is why they chose a film that they knew would be popular. I can understand the lack of knowledge of the film, but they should have known that the movie would be so popular. The ending of the story was really weird. It was a very out of place ending. I know that people will say this is just the way it is, but this was not the best ending I have ever seen. This ending really annoyed me and I think the director did a poor job. _________________________ I saw this movie with a friend. We

Hill on Scribd           The student's parents had a hard time believing what happened. "I didn't think that was possible," said his mother, Jennifer Hensley, an educator at the school.  It turned out that the student's name was spelled wrong on his birth certificate. He'd gone by a different name when he was in middle school, so his parents thought he must have switched names for some reason.  The student's real name was Robert Joseph Hundley, but the school staff called him Robert Hundleys-Kemp. His birth certificate listed the wrong middle name and the name on his passport was his first name.  (He had a name change at age 11.)  He had just begun at a special education school in the school district, but he had a tough time adjusting to it. : An unusual story of a troubled child's school experience. The student was referred to the school in August 2012, about a year after his parents had moved to the neighborhood. The school staff said he was not in the right class for the grade. The students in his special education class were more advanced than the students in the regular class, so the student didn't fit in. He started with a special class that specialized in students who were socially disabled. .  and in the first weeks, he had been acting out, hitting his head, hitting himself, kicking and screaming and other bad behavior. So the school placed him in a special classes. The staff gave the student a new name, which they thought was his real name. "But his parents didn't believe that. They thought it was a name he'd used in middle and high school," Hensly said. "

The acting in this movie is not bad. it was all good and i was entertained. the actors did a great job. but the acting is not enough to make this movie scary, but if you want a movie that is really scary, give this one a shot. - May 2, 2007A good movie  "This movie is a great example of a low budget horror movie made in a very small budget.   of course, it doesn't work for me. the movie is just a little bit too "dreadful" for me, it's so low budget that it's impossible to make a movie scary and this is what the movie has, it has no budget, it was made on a small budget and you can tell it's a "real" movie, it really scares, i would give it 4 stars if it was a little more budgeted. - April 18, 2007Funny, but not scary  ...

This is a good film about the West in the 1850s.  I liked it.    It is a nice change of pace for a western.   There is some great dialogue and action and it's very fun.    The cinematography and direction is very good.  I really liked it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was the best movie I saw this year.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was a movie I actually liked. 」 A film I really enjoyed:  " The Last Man on Earth " by Joss Whedon, and the best thing I've seen in a long time, and it doesn't get any better than that.     The last man on earth was a lot of fun.   A great movie.  The final nail in the coffin for the critics:   There were some decent critics in my opinion, but not enough.  And the movie didn't help them.  They are going to lose a lot more of their readers, and I'm sure they have a lot to answer for.  " 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ _________________________ __________________________ This was the second movie I saw this year that had me screaming with laughter and being in the right place at the right time. The first movie was "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" where it was a comedy about a loser and his girlfriend and I thought the movie was funny and funny it just had to be a movie about a guy who gets a job at a supermarket and he goes to work but doesn't have a clue and he's going to get fired and he ends up going to the store to get a hamburger and he eats the burger and then he goes back to his apartment and then has to go out and buy a new hamburger but then he's fired and then it's a good time and a bad time and he just has to make sure that he gets his job back. The movie was the first movie I've seen where I couldn't laugh at all and it was just funny. It was funny to watch a guy eat a hamburgers and then go out to buy a hambuger again. I thought it was funny how he was in the store buying a hambogger and then was in his apartment in a hurry to get home to buy his new hambugger. The whole movie was great. ______________________________________________________ ______________________________ ______________________ This was a great movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and the second time I saw it I was crying. This is a great story of a guy that's trying to get over the loss of his wife and he takes on a job in a grocery store and his whole life changes in a very funny way. It has an old school comedy feel to it but I thought at times it was over the top and some of the jokes didn't really land. The cast is great and they all really do their own voices. I think it's the best film from the guys that made "The Goonies" and I think "The Princess Bride" would have been better. It's a great film and I give it a 8.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********  The first time I saw the movie I was completely underwhelmed. It looked very cheesy and the acting was terrible. But I went to see it a second time and the story made sense. And it's good to see that it's not just a bunch of characters running around and trying to solve a mystery. It's really a story about the consequences of that mystery. The character development is pretty good. The plot itself is pretty convoluted but it makes sense in the end.  I thought this movie was pretty good but I do feel like it needed more characters and more plot. The main character does not get enough development. But the plot itself was pretty interesting and I would have loved to see the film with a more serious tone. I would love to see more of a horror/sci-fi movie about a man and his dog. I'm not sure how the dog was supposed to react to that. The ending was pretty weird.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The story of "The Great Train Robbery" is about a young man who is trying to rob a train. The movie takes place in the same period and has the same train car. The only thing that differs between the movie and the original book is that the robber is an Indian and the book tells the story of a Chinese girl who is the accomplice. "The Train Robber's" movie is not a masterpiece, but it is a fine film. The actor in this movie is excellent. The acting was not bad but the story and characters are so different that it's difficult to make it into one movie. The film is a classic in the western genre. I give it 4 stars.

I would have to agree with the reviewers who called this movie "not my favorite". This movie has a very interesting storyline and has a great plot and characters. This is a great sci-fi movie. There is an alien who was brought to earth by the government and was the best scientist the government has ever seen. This alien was given the ability to teleport. This ability is a power that he has but he has a hard time with it. When he finds a girl he loves he wants to make her happy and she seems to have everything he needs. However, he's unable to control his ability. This allows the government to try to control him and he starts to go out of control. There were also other humans who he loved and who loved him back but they were too busy to help him and now he is in a horrible situation. This was a very fun movie to watch. This could be a good way to learn about the world of science fiction. The film also has a good ending and I hope it is not the last one in this series. - June 19, 2008This movie is not my best favorite  Overall a good film.

It was a simple, good and not-too-complicated plot. It had a good balance of drama and humor and it did not take much time to get to the real plot.   Art: 8-10 - This is the part where I give my rating to the art. The characters are well drawn and the backgrounds are pretty good. I especially liked the detail and details that the character's face had. The animation is also pretty good but there are a few scenes that were a bit too slow.   a lot of action scenes were a little bit choppy.  .  -Sound: 9/10   The soundtrack was pretty well done and I thought the voice actors were good. The ending theme was pretty great and I really enjoyed listening to it.   in conclusion, this is a very good and good-looking movie. The art was very good.   at the same time, it had a lot more than a lot and not everything was explained, but the story is good and the ending was good. This is one the better movies of the year.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My name is Mike. My job is to see if we can make this place a better place. I have always been a skeptic, and a doubter, but not a doubtter. I can't imagine a world without drugs.   I like to think that I am a man of integrity. I am not. I would love to be a man who knows the difference between right and wrong, but I can see clearly that it's just a matter of time before drugs will take over the world.   a movie I found very disturbing. It was a little scary at first.   the film has good plot and a good script. i can't tell if it was made by a real drug dealer or just a movie made by him and some of the actors to try and make some money. it was scary at the beginning but after a while, it made less and less sense. i was scared at first but after about 15 minutes, it was just too hard to watch. i think that this is a very good movie if you are into movies about drugs. but don't think that i think the film is good because of that. I think that it is a good film because it is about drugs, but i really think that some of people who are watching this should think about themselves. if you can think of any drug you think would make a great movie, please let me know.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  A fun, fast paced, and entertaining thriller with plenty of action and lots of laughs. I can't help but think of a similar story that has been told several times before.  __________________________________________  This movie is a little too much like 'The Thing' (1982). It takes place in a very similar setting (the ruins of an alien spacecraft). The aliens use their telepathy to mind-control humans, so that they act out the same behaviors that they see in other humans. It's interesting, but doesn't really connect to the original movie. It has a few surprises (which are very much worth seeing). But overall, it's a little overrated. It gets a B+ from me, because it's so much fun to watch and I'd love to see another movie that took place in this setting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Knew Infinity"  was a great movie.  It was a very good science fiction movie that had a nice blend of good acting and good effects.  The movie had a plot that I really liked.  It had a couple of different plots.  One plot was about a group of space explorers who are trying to find out where they came from.  The other plot was where they were trying to take a new planet from it's native people.    Both plots were good.  But the movie ended up being very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  "The film follows a young boy, Jake (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who goes on a journey with his mother to find his brother who has gone missing. The film is set in the '50s but the setting is not so far from the present day and we get to see the way we deal with our problems in a world that is becoming a lot more complex. It is interesting how the boy and his mother handle the situation. There are a lot of things going on and it takes a while for the audience to see all of it." -C.H. S.   "It is a pretty good film and I would say that it will hold up for a long time. The characters are very good and the actors are great. I think it's great that the director didn't try to shoehorn in a lot too much to keep things interesting." -P.W.  , a film that has a similar plot but is set almost 20 years later, offers a fresh perspective on what it means to be a kid. I'm not sure why it's called the "Kid's Version" of the story but I like it a lot and have watched it a number of times. The cast is top notch and the plot is surprisingly compelling. The music is a little dated but still very effective. The acting is solid and the movie is very well-crafted. The story and characters are both realistic and charming. The ending was surprisingly satisfying and I was happy that it was done in such a different way. It's a great film that I'm glad I watched. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is a very funny, very fun movie about a bunch of hippies in Denver.  There's a lot going on in the movie.   This movie is full of great dialogue, great acting, and a good plot.    The plot is interesting and fun.  In the movie the Dude (Jeff Bridges) is at a party with some friends.      At one point he tells the Dude that he's going to see a movie. At the movie, a bunch (!) of hippie dudes are hanging out at the theater.  The Dude sees a woman watching the movie with a guy.  She's got on a big pair of glasses.  "Why do you have a pair of sunglasses on?"    The guy says, "Because she's a blind lady!"   The Dude thinks about it and says,  "You got her pregnant."   This is when the movie starts.  When they get to the theater, they see a guy sitting in the audience.  This guy says he's from Canada and he has a problem with the Dude.  He asks him to get out of his seat.  In the next scene, the Dude goes to see the guy,  but the guy just stands up and walks away.  So the Dude is sitting there waiting for the guy to show up.  Then he hears a noise and turns around to see someone coming up behind him.  It's the blind lady.  But, the guy is walking away.   He looks around and says "You gotta be fucking kidding me."  Then the Dude says,  "What do you want?"  The blind lady says,   "I've got a blind date.  I'm waiting for her to come over."  "What?"  "I'm just waiting for you to leave me alone."  The dude turns around and walks off.  What a great scene.  There are so many things going on.  They're not even in the same movie. The movie is based on the true story of a bunch  of dudes in the 60's that went to see this movie.   It's a great movie and a fun movie to watch.  After the movie it's a nice drive back home.  A lot of fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- 1. Star Trek (2009) - Star Trek is one of those rare examples of a good Star Trek movie that has not been ruined by being a direct sequel. There are many people who hate the Star Trek movies, but the ones that love them, will appreciate this film. It is one hell of a movie. 2. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - This is one movie I do not recommend to younger children because it is very dark and very scary. But if you are old enough to enjoy a good horror movie, you'll enjoy this. 3. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Striketh Back (1983) - I loved this movie! It was like a good science fiction movie from the early 70's that was updated for the late 70's. It was very original and still fun to watch today. I will say though that it is quite dark and quite violent. 4. The Dark Crystal (1982) - The Dark crystal is a great movie. It has a great story and is an amazing sci fi fantasy. I remember being very happy to see that a new Star Wars movie had come out and this movie was a prequel. 5. Jurassic Park (1993) - Jurassic Park is one heck of a classic. I was very happy when it came out because it was one of my favorite movies. 6. Star trek: First Contact (1996) - A lot of people do not like this movie because of it being a sequel. It's a good story and a good film. But the story of Star trek is so original that people are still talking about it today. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is still a great film. 7.

This is a good, old-fashioned western with a good story and an entertaining performance. There are many westerns that are not good, but this is a very good western.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________" (Babylon 5) - March 1, 2012The good: The movie has a very unique style that is reminiscent of both the art of the Star Wars movies, and the art in the movie "The Last Starfighter" (which is an excellent movie, but not a Star Wars movie). I think it's interesting to have a movie like this in a fantasy genre, because it has elements of the old school adventure movies. I also like the direction and acting, and that it has a good amount of humor in it. The music is also great and very fitting to the story. The characters were all well done and the acting was spot on. The bad: The script was not the greatest and was very hard to follow. I have not read the original book and was surprised to find it in a movie. It is also hard to keep up with the story, but the characters are all likable and the story is interesting and the characters grow. Overall, I thought this movie was a good addition to the series and was not disappointing at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jan 11, 2017 By Chris J. Koester If you have never seen this movie then you have not lived in the world. It is a great film and I highly recommend you watch it. It has the look and feel of a great 1940's movie and that's what you will get. It does not have the flashy acting of the modern movies, which is what makes it so great. It's like a classic film with a very old school feel. It takes you back to a time when great films were made, like "The Wizard of Oz", "E.T." and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". You see the people that were in those movies were all so different and unique. These people were all ordinary, but they were great actors and they captured the life of those characters. It was a time before cell phones, when the movie theater was the only place where you could go and enjoy a great movie. This film shows us a time where movies were made like movies were back then. We see the characters in the movie going about their daily lives. They are walking around and doing their jobs. You also see some of the great movies they were in such as "The Three Musketeers" and "Ethel Merman". It is amazing to see these old movies. It really brings a sense of nostalgia to the audience and it makes you remember what life was like back then for those people who were alive back then in the 1930's. This movie also has great music. It sounds like they took the music from the songs in "The Big Parade" and added a bit of jazz to it. This is a movie that I recommend to everyone. You can watch it on a rainy day or at a time of the day when you want a classic movie. You don't need to have a big budget to watch this film. You just need a big heart and a lot of time to sit back and enjoy it. If you haven't seen this film yet, I recommend you do so. You will not be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  A fun and action packed movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of martial arts movies and is looking for something fun to watch. If you are looking for a movie with a strong plot, I would definitely recommend this. The movie is a bit slow at times, but if you are able to stay with it you will be satisfied. If the movie is too slow for you, it can be skipped in the beginning and you can move on to the next part of the movie. This movie is an action filled movie with strong martial arts action. I really enjoyed this movie and will be watching more martial arts films in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen the original but I love the remake. It's the perfect blend of the two and the best of both worlds.  The movie starts off in a really dark and moody setting.   It looks like it could be a post apocalyptic world.  I think that's a great description.  In the movie, you see the survivors of the plague escaping to the north of the United States.  You meet up with the lead character, Jack (Brad Pitt) who is on the run from a cult.  Jack is an ex marine and has come out of the war as a "hunter."  He's hunting for the leader of the cult, who has stolen his daughter.  There is a lot of action in this movie and it's good!  This movie does a good job of showing you how bad the world is.  The acting in this is fantastic.  Brad Pitt has a great performance and there is also a great chemistry between him and Marion Cotillard.  Also there is a great storyline that is very well written.  This film has great atmosphere and it makes you want to watch the rest of the movie even if you don't like horror movies.  Overall this movie is great and the movie has a really good plot.  It is not for everyone but it is a good film.  If you like the original, then you will like this.  So watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, I have no clue why I've watched this movie. The only thing I remember from this movie is the movie. There were a few characters that were just not good. For example, there were two kids in this movie that I remember. They were playing a game. One of them was in the hospital with some sort of ailment. I have never heard of any of this. The other one was a kid that was in a movie. I don't know why they were in the movie because they were supposed to be dead. I also don't remember any of the characters. They didn't have any lines. I think the actors were very good and acted their parts. They did a great job. I was hoping for a good story but I guess it was a good horror movie. It is worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ I saw this movie on a friend's recommendation at the drive-in. I had never seen a film in a theater before, so I thought it was a good way to test my nerves. When I saw it on the big screen, I couldn't believe my eyes. This movie was fantastic. I loved the acting, the setting, the soundtrack, the direction, and everything else about it. The film took place in the early 1900's, when a woman, named "The Queen" (she was not played by a woman) and her sister, The Queen's Maid (played by a man), were searching for their missing brother, "The King" (played with all the realism by a handsome young man named "Hank"). When Hank's body was found, he had been shot through the back of the head and his face was broken. The Queen and the Queen's maid were arrested, but they escaped to Mexico. After getting into a small Mexican town, they got in a fight with a gang of gangsters. After being shot and badly injured, they were left to die. It is said that The Queen had an affair with the owner of a small hotel, named El Domingo. The next morning, The King and the Maid were found by a farmer, who had gone out into the fields. He called the police, who were able to find them that night. The farmer told them that they had come from Mexico, and that The King had been killed by a gang. After this, The Maid and The Queen fled to a cabin in the woods. There they spent the night, and were discovered by a couple of bandits. They tied them up and set them up on a stage, where they began to play a strange game called "the Game of Death". They told them to die by throwing themselves off a cliff, but The King refused. He begged them to play the Game of Life, where each player was to try and kill another player. The King won, and he and The Maid made a bargain: they would return to their home and hide the money they had made, but if The King ever returned to Mexico, they would never return. The bandits found The Queen, and shot her. They left her body in the field, and then returned to kill the King. They shot and killed The King. The Maid called for her father to come and help them, but he couldn't make it. He had been injured and had to

The cast was great, and it was great to see some of the young actors (i'm sure a lot of us who saw it as kids had a crush on the kids on screen). The acting was really good too. The acting is very realistic and you can tell they had a real love for the movie. The music was also great. It was a nice change from the typical music that they use on tv and on the movie poster. I loved the movie, and I think that the kids will also. This is definitely a movie that everyone should watch, and they should watch it as a kid. The characters are really interesting and you get a real sense of them, and how they are. It really made me feel like I was in their shoes. If you want to see a real "Star Wars", then this is the one to see. The cast and the acting is really great. ____________________________________________ _______________ The original Star Wars is one of the most popular movies ever, but there are many people that think the movie is a piece of crap. Some people even think that it was a rip off of the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. I think this movie has it all, it has great action scenes, it is funny, it's touching, it deals with real life issues, it tells a nice story, and the cast is very talented. Some of the best acting you will ever see in your life. This movie is an important part of Star Wars history and if you have never seen it, you should go watch it. ___________ The original movie was released in 1977, and was the first movie to have special effects and special effects that was made to look like real effects. ____ It was filmed in 65mm, and has a full color, 2.35:1 aspect ratio, so you will have to have a good TV to see it. You can get a good quality DVD from a lot a video stores and it is also available on the internet. ____________________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  "A young woman's quest for true love goes awry in a world of vampires, werewolves, and other such creatures." - IMDb.com  Review by: R.H. Dolan  I'll never forget the first time I saw "Buffy The Vampire Slayer". My sister and I sat down at our local video rental store and sat through a whole episode, and then we got to watch "Chosen", and it was awesome. I can still see the look on my mom's face, when she came in the store and saw that Buffy was on the cover of "Chronicle", and how happy she was. I was in high school, so I remember seeing the show on tv and having to sit through the entire movie on VHS, but I loved it.  My dad and I loved watching the movie, but we didn't really get into the show until a few years later. , and I was still in highschool, so we were pretty new to the whole Buffyverse. So we thought we'd see if the show would be better than the movie.  a few days later, we took our mom to the movie theater and watched the entire series. My sister, who was a big Buffy fan, loved it, and so did I, but it wasn't nearly as good as the movie I'd seen. It was a long time after that before we watched the series. And after that we only watched it in reruns, and on VH-1. But, I'm glad we did, because I'm a huge fan now.  was great, and even better than I thought it would be. There are so many great scenes in the show, and it's a great, great show. The series isn't over yet, and the last episode is coming out next week, so you should really go check it out. But for now, I want to share some of the things I remember about watching Buffy The Vampire  First off, I remember being excited when I saw the series on DVD. It felt a little bit like a movie. There was so much going on, and you really didn't know what was going to happen next. But then, it just kind of stopped. It wasn't until a year or two later, that I started to really notice it. The whole show just kinda went quiet. It almost felt like a film that had run its course. There

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Youth (2000) is an interesting little drama.  I really enjoyed the story, and the characters in it.  There's a bit of humor in there, and it is pretty entertaining, especially if you're into that sort of thing.  I like that the characters are portrayed by several actors, and I think it is a bit refreshing.   What I liked best about the movie was that it was actually filmed on location, so I could get a real sense of what the city was like in the '90s.  What's even better is that it has a bit more of a dark and mature tone than most of the movies that I've seen on Netflix.  It has that sense of realism that we so often get from movies set in a real place.  There's a scene where the young protagonist is in a diner and he overhears some guys talking about the girls they're seeing.  They mention how they're going to go to a party, but the next day, they'll never see the girls again.  The protagonist then asks, "So, what do you do with them?"  And the guy replies, "I eat them."  The entire movie is just a really funny way to tell a sad story.  But the most surprising thing about the film is that the director of the film, Joe D'Alessandro, has been in prison for quite a while for his crimes.  He's served his time, and now he's trying to get his life back on track.  That's the most important thing about this movie.  D'ALESANDRO'S FIRST film, I AM HOMICIDE, was released in 1993.  While it was a little too long for me, it was very interesting.  Unfortunately, the film was shelved because it was thought that it might be too violent for a kids' movie.   I don't think it was.  Instead, it seems that D'ALSANDRO was more interested in making a film about his life than his crimes, and that's really the most interesting thing about it.   He does an amazing job in the film.  When I saw it for the first time, I really enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  It is very hard to rate a movie with so little information about it. The film begins with a great deal of exposition, as well as a great many shots of the two main characters. The two are in a room talking about their past. As they talk, we are introduced to several other people and events. It is hard to say what exactly is going on here. This is a mystery movie with two characters, but we do not get enough information about them to tell you what is happening. The movie then takes a turn.  The movie begins with the two characters at a hotel and are talking about the past. One of them says something that has never been said before, and they realize that something is very wrong with the world. The other says something similar, but in a different way. This makes the two think that there is something wrong with them, and then the story goes into the past again, and we see that something very strange is happening to them. ....  This movie is not easy to watch. There is so much information to get through, that one is not sure where to begin. The characters are not very interesting. The first half of the movie is all about the two talking about everything that has happened to them, but as the story progresses, the movie becomes a bit more mysterious. The mystery becomes a mystery in itself. We are not told what the two are talking to each other about, but it is easy to assume that something strange is going to happen. The ending of the film leaves one with many questions. What is going in the other characters' minds? What is happening in their lives? Is there some kind of power that is keeping them from speaking about what they are saying? Is the movie just a film with two people talking about things that have happened to the two? There is a little mystery in the movie, but the movie could have been more interesting if it were not so confused.  in the end, the two still are not telling each other anything that they have not already said. It leaves one to wonder what the movie was trying to tell us. It should be noted that the movie does not have any plot. There are a few scenes that are shown, but not explained. The only real plot device is the fact that the two people are talking and that they are not in a hotel. The whole movie is a series of shots and conversations. One can guess what is going

I think it could have been better if it didn't have the characters acting like they are in a video game. There are a lot of things in this movie that make you wonder about the film but when you realize it's an animated movie, and they are playing the part of the characters they play the part really well. The music in the movie is amazing and I thought that they were just a little bit off but they did a good job in creating the atmosphere. If you have kids I would recommend this movie to them. They will enjoy it.  Helpful it was a lot better than you think it was.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ The Story: This is a well-told story about a girl who is caught in a dangerous situation. The movie starts off with a nice introduction. I have to say that it's nice to see a movie without any exposition or explanations. I also really enjoyed the scenes of a girl in a high school that has to go through all that she did in her past and now has to face the consequences of what she has done. I like this movie. The acting is great. The story is a bit slow but I think this is because of the characters. I think that they are very well-developed and they give us a very realistic portrayal of the situation that they find themselves in. The soundtrack was also good. The film was not great, but it was good. I found myself enjoying this movie even though it was not my cup of tea. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (1/10) I saw this movie on a friend's recommendation. It was not my favorite of the bunch but I enjoyed it. The story was good, but the acting was pretty lame. It didn't help that the actor in the film looked like a teenager. I think that this movie should have been called "The Next Step." I hope that they do a remake with the right cast. This movie is just a bad idea. ______________ (2/10)-The movie's premise was interesting, but it really was just a lame teen flick. It felt like a teen movie that a teenage director made. I felt like the movie was trying to be a parody of teen movies but the characters and dialog were just stupid. The writing was bad. There were no lines that made me smile. It just didn't make sense. ____________________ (4/10-The movie had potential. The movie itself was just boring and boring. It made no sense, and there was no character development. I just didn´t like this movie at all. I feel like this could have been a better film if it had been written by someone who is more experienced in writing teen movies. I thought the film could have used a little more humor. But still, it was not a bad movie. ______________________________________________________________________________  RAW Paste Data  This movie is pretty interesting. I would watch it again. I liked the concept, but there was so much I didn´tl like about the movie. There are some great actors, but they don´t seem to be very comfortable in their characters. There was no chemistry between the cast. The director didn´nt seem to really care about the plot, and it showed. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the idea of what would happen if someone was born a mutant. This is the kind of idea that a lot of great movies have had in the past, but never have gotten to make a film. If someone made a film based on this idea, it would be a great movie. This was a good idea, but unfortunately it was never executed well. The acting was also terrible. I had never seen a movie with so many actors playing a similar role. The whole cast was just so similar in terms of age, height, and build. __________________________________________________________ (1.5/10 - The movie had some potential. However, the story was terrible. It wasn´t written very well,

It seemed like the end was supposed to be a surprise, but then it was revealed that it was all a big joke. I guess they just wanted to show a character with a bad back. It makes the movie kind of lame. But overall, I think that this movie was great!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I think that this is one of the best of the recent films in the series, and probably the best in the franchise, as it deals with the issue of whether one can be a good person or a good god, a good man or a very good man. As you know, I have a very high regard for this movie and the writer, and I'm not just saying that because it was the film that I saw the most. I know this movie well, and as a devout Catholic, I was especially pleased that the film deals with this very important question. I'll also tell you that I really liked the actor playing the God, Michael Caine, a man who was not only very talented, but one who seemed to be able to give us a very convincing, believable portrayal of this very difficult and sensitive man. He does not seem to have a clue as to how he has gotten there, but he has found himself in a very difficult position. His first reaction is that of someone who is so overwhelmed by the enormity of his task, that he is unable to stop thinking about it, and is unable, for all practical purposes, to do anything about it. The fact that he does not know what he should do or what he ought to do, is not his fault. He has been set up for this role, but has no idea how to get out of it. He was brought up by an emotionally disturbed father, who did not like him, and was very much influenced by the work of a famous poet, George Gershwin. The father was also the inspiration for Caine's later acting work, but I think this is a very different situation. Michael Cain does not have an easy childhood, and his father is a bad influence, and Michael himself has a very hard time dealing with his own feelings. The whole thing, as far as I know, began with his father having a stroke, and he does have a difficult time coping with this. He goes into a mental hospital, and finds himself in another world. The other world is not exactly heaven, but it is quite an improvement from the world that he had grown up in. In fact, it's almost as if the hospital itself is Heaven, because it's so clean and well kept, and there are so many nice things to do. He's a very nice guy, but his life is quite lonely, and the only thing he's interested in is having sex. He takes

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Oct 16, 2017 5:12 PM  FURY OF THE FIREMAN  DOUBLE THE DOTS  The film is a mix of action and comedy, and even though the characters are different, the story is the same. As you know, it is the year 1944 and America is at war. A group of soldiers are sent to a rural area to rescue a girl who is being held hostage by a band of Nazi war criminals. The film has a great deal of action as the army is sent to rescue the girl from the band of Nazis.  If you have not seen the film, then the film is great. It is very entertaining and a great action movie. The movie is also very entertaining in its characters. I thought that the actors did a good job and the movie is very fast paced. It does not slow down for a second and keeps on going. I would recommend this film to all. The only problem I had with the movie was that I did not understand why the girl was being held captive. The soldiers are the only ones that know that. I did understand that the girl did not want to be freed. I also did not think that she was very pretty. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  The best film of 2014, in my opinion. The film tells a simple story of a man who loves a beautiful woman. However, after she gets involved with a different man, he feels that he has lost her. The man wants to be able to forgive her, but he feels betrayed and betrayed by her. This leads him to commit suicide. The story is simple, but there is so much emotion in this film. You will feel so much pain for this man and for this woman. The ending of the film is beautiful. I just love this movie. _____________________________  I was pleasantly surprised with this movie and I think it will be a hit with many people. This movie is a real piece of art. The music was good and the cinematography was good. The movie does not try to be anything else but a very powerful film. The only thing I don't like is that the director didn't want to show the rape scene at the end of the movie. I understand that he wanted to show that the man did not have any regrets for what he had done, but I think the audience would have been able to understand it more. However the movie itself was very powerful. It was so sad and it was so beautiful. This is one of the most powerful films of the year. I hope that the film will get a much better distribution because I think that this film is something very important to our times.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie and it's good for kids.  I have a little sister, so I like this story because it's about a little girl who loves her parents. I also like that the movie was made for kids, so the language is pretty low. It's pretty funny, but I don't think there is a point to it. It was fun to watch, but you need to be able to handle the content. I think the movie should be rated R because there are adult themes and there are people who are not kids. The movie is pretty long, but it's not too long.  The only thing that I didn't like was the movie that it came out after.  4.5 stars out of 5

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  It's like a perfect storm: a small, independent, and very good movie comes out that hits every single mark. The story, the acting, the story of the movie, the writing and the cinematography all fit together in such a way that it's difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. I found it to be a very enjoyable watch. The film is very lighthearted and the humor is not overly exaggerated, so you'll laugh even if you're a bit of a wuss. The acting is great. The lead (Tom Cruise) and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes) are great together. I think the main reason I enjoyed the movie was because it was just so damn fun. The only downside was the ending. It just felt forced and I wish it would have ended there. The ending left me wanting a little more, which I can't really say about a movie that was as good as it was. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, but I would have loved it more if the ending was a bit more believable. Overall, it was a good, good, fun, good movie and worth a watch. If you're looking for a good comedy, watch it. I would even recommend this to people who like action movies. It's like action meets comedy and that's a lot of fun.

I love how it combines the two worlds: The story of a boy who is on the run from the Nazis in a Nazi hideout and the life of a young boy who was captured by the Germans in the same hideout.  The bad : The film seems to be a bit too heavy for its own good. I found myself thinking "Oh well, at least they tried". The ending was a bit abrupt, but not really bad.  to end on a high note : I loved the ending. The two worlds come together to give a perfect ending. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good story with a bit of comedy thrown in. ,

The movie was so funny I had to share it with my family and they loved it. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants a laugh. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because of the last half hour, but that's really my only complaint.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The film opens with a very impressive shot of a white, white beach. A little girl (Liv Tyler) is walking down the beach, her mother (Mariska Hargitay) holding her hand. She's wearing a red bikini and it's not just any bikini but a "Frolic of the North." A "Frolicking" of the "North." The beach is filled with white people of all ages. The beach and the beachgoers are happy, happy, and laughing. And it's wonderful. And, it's a wonderful image.  We see a family of four (Hargitays, Tyler, her boyfriend, and her brother) walking through the ocean. They're not swimming, they're simply walking. The only people who are out on the beach are their kids. The mother is wearing a yellow bikini and she's in the water with her two sons, a boy (Max Casella) and a girl (Katherine Heigl).  As the mother and the children continue to walk through the water, the scene becomes more and more intimate. We see the mother's body, the kids' bodies, and we get a nice shot of the sand and the waves. We also see a few shots of the family as they're talking about what they're doing on the trip.  The scene ends with the mother smiling and saying "I'm happy to be alive," which is a perfect ending for the movie. It was very nice.  and the ending was beautiful.  the end of the movie was very beautiful. and the movie made me smile. and it was very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   If I could give this movie an extra star, I would.   I did not see this movie when it first came out. But since then I have been told by many people that they think this is the best movie about the Vietnam War. I agree.   and I am going to try to convince you that this movie is one of the best movies about the war in general. The story about a young Marine (the "Crocodile") who goes to Vietnam to try and help his friends in Vietnam. It was written in 1969, and was filmed in 1968. The movie is about how a young man (the character of the "Coca" in the movie) is trying to help his friend in Vietnam by helping his friend to get out of Vietnam. The character of "Cocoa" goes through the experience of Vietnam and tries to help others. In the end the Vietnam war ended. The Vietnam war is very hard for the young man and many people try to help him in his time of need. In this movie you see that "Coco" was a good friend of "The Crocodile". And I think that if you watch this movie, you will also be able to see the friend of the character "The crocodile" as a good and kind person.   the movie is very funny and it shows the life of the war very well.   "The croc" is also very funny as he is the funniest person in the entire movie.  .     the movie is so funny and the way it shows that the war is a war of love, the war of the young and the young soldier. And this is why this movie deserves a 5 star rating.   a great movie to watch!

"  - From the trailer  It was just a couple of days ago that I saw this movie for the first time, and it has already stuck with me. It is very well acted and has a lot of fun in it. The characters were a perfect combination of the best and worst traits of each of them. The romance of the characters is very romantic, and the acting between them is so natural. I loved the chemistry between the two actors and the chemistry was well done. I would like to thank the director and the producers for making this movie a success. They did a great job and I would recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in romance movies.  – Reviewer, United States

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The plot of this movie is pretty straightforward: two people who have no idea of the other's existence, are given a box, one that has the same markings as the other one. They open it up and there's a woman who is the exact same as the one in the box. They are both in her twenties. She's beautiful. She looks exactly like the woman in the other box. This is her sister, who had her husband killed and was now living in this box. She tries to convince the man to let her out of the box, but he refuses, saying that he is not a good man, and that she is better off in the real world. The woman is so distraught that she begins to go insane. This part of the movie is so good that I actually want to watch the movie again. It is so well acted, and the dialogue is very well written. I loved how they didn't rush the movie, and they slowly revealed more and more of the story. I think that this movie deserves a sequel, because I'd love to see what would happen if they were to take the box and let the women escape from it.  Helpful is not the movie's best feature. For a movie that is as dark as it is, it has very little nudity. There are a couple of shots of boobs, but that's it. However, the sex scenes are really hot. I really enjoyed watching the two women get naked and enjoy each other. There's a great scene where the man comes in to her and she asks him to do something with her, but she doesn't want to get it on with him. She pulls down his pants, but then he pulls back up. She takes off his pants and begins to fondle his dick, and then she sucks it. There is a great sex scene in the movie where she uses her mouth on his dick. The man then comes in and takes her on his bed and they have a very nice sex session. The sex in this movie was really hot, and I can't wait to see more of this.  The plot is pretty straight forward: two men are given two boxes. One has a woman inside it. One man is the same age as the woman. They both have the same features, except for the face. The other man is a woman. He has no features. They're both in their twenties. They find the box with the woman inside. They then open it

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________  The reason for the film's success is that it is the most complete film of its kind I have seen. It is also a great piece of drama. It would be nice if the director would do more such films, because we have not seen anything similar in a long time. It was also a pity that the movie was not filmed in Mexico. The film is a good representation of Mexican culture and the way they are treated. The main character, Miguel Rodriguez, is a hardworking farmer who is married with children. He has lived in Mexico for a long period of time, where he has seen things, but he is not quite sure of the reason. At the end of the movie, we see that he has lost his wife and his family. In this scene, the woman, Ana, is so angry with him that she does not even want to speak to him. Miguel, as we know, is very different from her. He was so innocent and so full of good feelings. In the end, he realizes that he is the only one to blame for what has happened. This movie does not have any sex scenes. It's a pity, because it would have been great to see that. Also, there is a very important message in this movie. It shows that there are many ways to be bad and be respected. One of the main characters of the film, Juan Rodriguez, who is the son of Miguel's brother, is also very good. He is a kind man who never hurt anyone, but was the cause of the tragedy. And finally, I was very sad to see the last scene of the first act, where the hero is on the roof of the house and there is no one there to see it. It could have been a very great movie. _____________________________________________________________________ It is interesting to know that the name of the village is "Los Muertos". In this movie, the people of the town are very bad. They live in a bad place and kill and rob and steal. In a short amount of time they have destroyed the town and all its people. It seems like they have no reason or morals. They are a very evil people, and it seems that they will go to any lengths to get what they want. It also seems that some of them, even the police, are in the same position as the people, but they do not seem to care. It appears that there is nothing that can stop them, because they

But the film has never been so popular, and it was not until its release in 1976 that it found its place among the major motion pictures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! "Sugar Daddy" was a very good movie that I saw in the theatre when I was very young and I still remember it as being very funny. I don't know if the whole movie is funny, but it is funny enough for a kid like me to have fun with. I was in a theater with a lot of people and we all loved the movie and it was a fun ride to watch. It was about a little girl and her boyfriend who had a sugar daddy who he thought was a real handsome guy. The girl was actually a very nice girl who thought she was with a real gentleman and she was really not. When the sugar daddy came and offered to give her money she said no and when he said no again she was very angry and he told her she needed to be a good girl. When she refused to be any kind of a girl he decided to send her to a new town and made her stay there and he never did find out where she was going. He never told her what he was going to do to her but he was just looking for some kind of good girl to keep his money. He would come over to the house and have sex with her and they would get very drunk and have a great time and make each other happy. I love this movie and still have some of the posters on my wall.

The gangsters are all just awesome and the way they look and their voices are so well done. The main character is a good guy. He is a gangster and he loves his job and he gets paid a lot of money. The movie was good, it wasn't too good or too bad, but it was pretty good. *****  Helpful of the story. This movie is good. If you don't have a lot patience to see a movie that lasts only about 3 hours and it is all about the police, then you should wait a few years for another good movie. If the movie is about the gangster, then it is great. If it is about a cop, then the movie could have been better. There are some scenes where the cop does a really bad job.The movie is not about the gangs. It is about two cops. One of the cops is a bit crazy and doesn't like people that are a little different. He goes to the same place, every day. He gets in a lot trouble because he is so different. So the cops go in every place. The cops go to a bar and get into a fight with a bunch of people. They go to the gang member's place and are very friendly. They get some guns and get a gun fight. The police shoot the gang members. The guys are not really bad guys. They are just crazy. They have a gun and they start shooting. The policeman and the gang leader get in a fight. After the fight they are very nice to each other. So there is some great chemistry between the two guys. The two cops go with the guys to the next place. They take the money from a lot more places and they are not very friendly at all. They just look at the gang. They shoot and they shoot and shoot. They start shooting up the building. They leave the building and the guy in the building gets shot. The guy in charge is very nice. So this guy is shot by the cops. The cop and the cop's son have a nice conversation. The boy goes in the police station and he goes to talk to the police. The chief tells the boy that they have a bad situation. The policemen go back and talk to some people. The Chief says the police have a new weapon

He gets the help of the doctors and nurses at the hospital, but the little girl gets into trouble again. And the hospital gets closed down because the owners of the hospital were going to be prosecuted for not paying for the care of the dog. The next morning, the dog is still alive but is so weak that he cannot even walk, let alone stand up. The owners of a pet store try to get back the money that they paid for the dog, but they are too late. They end up getting sued and the owners lose their money and everything they owned. But that's not all! The next day, the owner of the pet store tries to get his money back, but he gets shot and dies. So that's where the story ends. The movie was very good and it was funny. There were a few things that were kind of stupid, but that's a movie for grown ups and not children.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ This is a great movie about a man trying to survive a war. The story is very well told and it has a great cast of actors. The movie starts with an incredible scene with the man's daughter. Then we see the soldiers as they enter a town and the soldier who is trying to protect his daughter is caught in the crossfire. We then see the soldier in action. I felt that the soldiers were very well acted. The acting is very good and the scenes were all very believable. This movie has great performances and the story was well told. If you're a war movie fan and want to see some action, this is a good one. It's one of the few movies that really shows how real it is to be in a war zone. You can see it on the soldier's faces and see the fear on the faces of the soldiers. It was very realistic and very moving.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I am a big fan of Star Trek, I even used to watch TOS on TV (with the original cast, and a couple of guest stars) and when they brought the reboot in 2007, it was great. _________________________________________________________________________________ This movie is a very different movie. It is very different because the characters are much different. Captain Kirk is a lot older and wiser and Spock a lot more sarcastic and cocky. The movie is set in 2267 and is a 2 hour long story. ___________________________________________ The story begins with Kirk, Spock, Scotty, and McCoy all in sickbay. McCoy is on his way to find a cure for the virus that has ravaged his patients. The ship is in a space anomaly. They are searching for a new planet and are on the way back. The crew is having a good time playing a game of "Who can be the most efficient?" but the ship is drifting, and they are not in their right places. Spock is having trouble concentrating and has to be told what to do. Kirk is in the mess with the senior officers and he wants a little fun with the crew. He invites Spock and McCoy to have a game, but they are so tired that they can't play. Kirk wants to take it easy, but Spock wants to play. They do a game on their chairs in the Mess. Spock wins. Then they play on the holodeck. Kirk wins. Kirk and Spock make out in the holo-room, then the two men do a kiss on the bridge. This is a long time before "Star Trek IV" where Scotty has been a little too serious. The other crew members do not know they are doing this until they come out of the holoprogram. Kirk decides to go to bed. Spock and Kirk are playing a board game. Kirk takes the controls and gives orders. Spock looks at him and laughs. Then Spock has a thought. He tells Kirk that he can use the controls for the ship, and Kirk agrees. He goes to bed and Spock is in control of the ship. Spock tells Kirk he has been playing with him and that he thinks he is really happy. Kirk gets up, and Spock says to him, "You are playing with me again, aren't you, Captain?" Kirk says, "Yes, I am, Spock. I like you." They play some more and Spock tells him that he wants to kiss him. Kirk asks Spock if he has
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  "The story is told through the eyes of a man named Jim, who is the first person to visit a woman who has been in a coma for two years. The woman, Susan, has had a cataract operation in which the glass in the eye socket is replaced by a metal frame. This frame has a hole in the middle, and because of the way the frame is designed, a stream of water comes out of the hole. Jim is amazed at the sight and wonders what this woman has been doing in a world where water is forbidden. When he returns home, he finds that Susan has returned and is living in a strange little cottage in the woods. Jim tries to get to know Susan and, as she tells him the story, it is revealed that Susan is actually an alien from the planet Venus. When Susan starts to get suspicious of Jim, he takes her out into the woods and tells her all about the world of Venus. Susan becomes fascinated with Jim's story, and when he tells her that he is on a quest to find out who killed his wife and daughter, Susan becomes convinced that this is the man she has been looking for. Jim and Susan go on a search through the woods, with Jim constantly being taken by the force of nature and getting lost in the wilderness. The story is really quite good, and it's not often that you get to see two characters so close together. Although Susan is a good character, the movie does suffer from some poor acting and some of the scenes seem a bit rushed. Overall, I liked the movie, but it would have been nice if the movie had stayed on Earth a little longer."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Day the Earth Stood Still " is a masterpiece.  In this movie, the people of the world are faced with a time of war.  The world was at peace in the 1950's.  However, the United States has launched an attack on the Soviet Union.  This attack was made to kill the leaders of the country and to take away their power.   The leader of the Soviet government, Yuri Gagarin, had the ability to travel through time and was the only one able to save the people from this horrible war.   After Yuri Gogarin's death, the leaders in the Soviet people did not know what to do.  They went to the future and saw a world that had been ravaged by war. The people of that time, however, have not been affected by the war. They have become more peaceful and loving.  After the events of " The Day The Earth Stained" the people decide to go back to the 1950s and destroy the time machine, but there is a problem.  If they destroy the machine they would destroy the people in the present.  One man, Alex, wants to use the machine for good.  He believes that the people who are now in the past should live as well as they have lived.  His plan is to create a new country called "Eden" in the far future.  In Eden, the population is made up of people that are the descendants of the people that lived in the future. Alex decides to create this country by giving them technology from the time machines and using the technology to help them become happy and prosperous.  Alex also creates a government in Eden called the "Eternal Government" and has it rule over all of the other countries.  There are many people who want to overthrow Alex's government and become the ruler of Eden.  These people are known as the "Revolt of the Revolutionaries."  This is a story of the revolution that takes place.  It also tells of how Alex's son, Gagol, and his wife, Ekaterina, get into a relationship.  Although they are from different time periods, they are able to get along very well and eventually marry.  As the revolution takes place and Alex is overthrown, he becomes very angry.  So Alex decides he wants to destroy the world in order to stop the revolution.  Gagorin wants to help him but he is told that the time bomb

Write a positive review about a good movie: e a movie is a movie, a picture in the mind of its maker, and this is what we get in this movie. A man and a woman, both in their fifties, with the same problem: their daughter has died of a drug overdose. They go to a hotel where the hotel manager is a cop, and he offers to help them if they come to his hotel room to tell him what happened. He gives them a code number, and the policeman tells them he will help them. They leave the hotel and arrive at a secluded cabin, where the cop offers to give them a room for the night, if they promise not to tell anyone. A few days pass, and a new problem arises: they have not heard from the hotel, and it is obvious that the hotel has been robbed. The new hotel owner wants to know where they are, and finds out they have gone to a place called the hotel of the gods. He sends his daughter to look for them, but the cop tells her that the place is on a deserted island. The cop's wife asks the cop to take her, but he refuses, telling her to leave. The daughter comes back and sees the cop's face. She goes to a bar where she meets a man who asks her to get a drink. She gets him a drink, and goes to the island. They get a boat, and set sail, but find the boat in bad condition. They see a boat with a girl on it, and they leave the island, and then they see the boat with the girl on board. They land, and see that the boat is on fire. They look around, and find a boat on fire as well. They try to save the boat, but get in trouble with a police officer, and are taken away. The police officer tries to get them to give him information about the murders, but they refuse. He tells them that he wants to arrest them, and get them off the island as fast as possible. The movie is pretty much a fantasy movie about the cops and the victims, and their interactions. The two characters, the cop and the daughter, are very different. The father is a very cold, detached cop. The mother is the most sympathetic character. She wants to help the cop, but can't help feeling that she is being manipulated by him. But the cop is not the bad guy. He is just trying to do his job. The film is a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The film is set in the late 1920s in an area of Italy called "Pavia". A group of young people, mostly of the same social class, who are known as the "Paviani", are on a fishing trip, and are the last to return. One of them, an ex-Marine and alcoholic, is the only survivor, who is sent to live with a neighbor's family, which also happens to be his mother's family. The neighbor's son, a man named Carlo (played by a very nice Italian actor named Antonio De Fina), is a very sensitive man who has a very strong connection with his mother, and he becomes very attached to his mother. Carlo is the kind of man that only his mother can love. His mother has already died a few years ago, and she has left him the house in the village, which is now his. Carlo feels that his mother was not a bad woman, but that she had not done everything that she could have done for him. The film has a wonderful ending which is reminiscent of "The Birds", and is one of the best ending I've seen in a movie. The acting is very good, and the plot was interesting. The only problem I have is that the ending of the film is not as satisfying as it should be. I wish that the film had had more of an ending that would make you want to see more of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The first time I saw this movie I was scared out of my wits, but after watching it a few times I was a little bit more excited about it, as I realized that it is not the same kind of movie as I thought it was.  This movie is more of a psychological horror movie than it is a horror movie. This movie has a story that is very interesting and it is told in a way that makes you feel uneasy and a bit worried about it.  of course there are some things that are really weird about this movie, but the story and the actors really made this movie. I thought that the film was a bit predictable but it never felt like it was trying to shock you.   - I have seen this movie twice in theaters. The first time was at a cinema and the second time was on cable. I think it is quite a good film and I will re-watch this movie a few years from now.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A beautiful and moving film that will move you." I have to admit, I was rather intrigued by the idea of a girl in love with a dead man.  After all, the last time I saw the movie, I did not find it as moving or as inspiring as the opening scenes and scenes in the movie make it out to be.    However, I have to say that this movie really makes a strong case for how beautiful love really is.      I will admit that I was expecting something less poetic and less poignant than what we actually get here.  The movie was shot with an extreme amount of focus on the girl, but it also shows the man's perspective in a way that it is not quite as simple as it seems at first glance.  But for me, this movie does not get nearly enough recognition for how great of a story it is and how much of an artistic statement it is.    In the end, the movie ends on a rather poignant note and I think that is where it belongs.  It is not a movie that is going to change anyone's life, but rather one that will bring you closer to a person that you love and will make you feel what that person is going through and how he is still there for you even after his death.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A Good Day to Die Hard" You know that there's going to be a movie about a guy who's a cop in a world that's turned upside down. He's on a mission, so he and his partner get to work. The story of this movie is pretty much that of any good action movie, where a cop must face his own problems. The movie begins with Bruce Willis in a suit and helmet. He takes on a sniper and gets the drop on him. After that, we get some more action, with lots of shots of Willis. We learn that the sniper is a former Army sniper named Tommy Lee Jones. His first wife left him and he's now in prison. He wants revenge on Willis. A couple of times during the movie, the movie looks great. The action is good, the acting is good. The only time that this movie falls down is when Willis starts to get into trouble. There's a scene where Willis is in a car with a guy named Tom Cruise and they have a gun fight. Willis looks pretty great in his suit and the movie is good and fun. It's a good action scene. After the car fight, Willis tries to call his wife to tell her that they're going to a movie. He gets the call back and he asks if she wants to go. He says he wants to have a good time. Then he goes out and he gets into a car fight. Then he gets a call from his wife saying that she's going out with another guy. He asks her why and she says that they don't have a big movie night, they just have a couple of dates. He doesn't believe her and he leaves. We see a little of Tommy Lee's past. He was in a motorcycle gang and they killed a bunch of people. He goes to prison and that's where he meets his wife, played by the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal. They're married now and they're having a little trouble. He tries to help her and she gets angry at him. He finds a guy that can get him out of trouble and he goes and does it. Then Tommy Lee has some problems with his wife. When I was watching this movie, I kept thinking, "Why are we seeing a bunch more of Tommy, and we're not seeing Bruce Willis?" He should be the main focus. He could have been the lead. Tommy Lee is great as

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Sep 13, 2017 4:22 PM  How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2016) - IMDB  How to Train your Dragon 2 is a big success. The film is set in a fantasy world of dragons and humans that live together in harmony. It is not so different from a Disney movie and it's a great film to watch. The main character, Hiccup, is a new Viking who is given a quest by his father to retrieve the dragon egg that was stolen. This quest leads Hic a long way and he becomes more of a hero. The movie is based on a series of books written by Eric and Timothy Haddock. It was a sequel to the first movie but it has some improvements and some new ideas.  Hiccup is a character that I have loved since he was a child. He is the hero that we all want to be, but we never have the opportunity. The book series was great and I think that the film does a good job of capturing this wonderful character. I think it would have been a great adventure to see Hicup and Toothless together. I like how the film is written as a story of two characters that are growing together. They are not just enemies, but friends and I like this because it gives the film a great feeling. The only problem is that the story is pretty dull and there is not much action. .  in the end, it all comes down to the story, which I thought was well done. It has a nice balance of humour and action. I hope that we see a sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   This film has been on my radar for quite some time. I have been fascinated by the stories behind these stories since my friend introduced me to the book by George R.R. Martin. It is a fantastic book that gives you a great insight into the world of the Star Wars universe. I think the best part about this film is that you get to watch the stories unfold from the perspective of characters who have not been introduced. I was so impressed with the film because it gave me a completely new look into the Star wars universe.   There is a great story line that revolves around a group of Jedi that were forced to escape their world when the Empire attacked. The story line takes you through the entire life of these Jedi. This film takes you from the beginning of the Jedi Order until they are hunted down by the Sith Empire and finally to a battle that was taking place on the Death Star.   of course you get a glimpse of the destruction of the Death star and a whole new life in the galaxy is beginning to take shape. I really enjoyed this film and I am very glad that I watched it.   the story line of this film goes back to the Jedi and the dark side of the force. This movie is the best way to experience the Force. The dark side is presented in a very cool way that shows you the force in a different way. I will definitely be re watching this film to see what happens in the next installment. I am already looking forward to seeing this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm a bit of a "guru" on this blog. If you're looking for a quick, no-frills, no ego, easy-going movie, check out my other reviews here. I'm an A-List actor, but I'm also a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and I try to make this blog the best resource for all things Star Trek and geeky. I enjoy watching the show with friends and family, but sometimes I want something a little more...exciting? Well, Star Trek Into Darkness is a solid, exciting, exciting movie that I think is well-crafted and entertaining. It doesn't waste any time, it gets you into the action quickly, and it builds a satisfying mystery that leads to an incredible ending. It's a big-budget movie, so if you want to be entertained by an exciting space adventure, you can do that. The problem is that it feels a bit under-produced and a bit too long. It really should have been about 90 minutes. If this is what you're expecting from the sequel to the biggest hit in the history of the Star Trek franchise, then I can't recommend it highly enough. Star Trek fans will enjoy it, and those who aren't Trek fans won't be too disappointed. You may not like it, but if you're in the mood for a good Star Trek movie, you should check this out. It is worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We are going to die and I'm going to cry." - George Clooney, on being married to Amal I have to admit, I've been a fan of "The English Patient" ever since I saw the trailer for it when it first came out. That trailer gave me a very good sense of the film and what to expect from it. I was not disappointed at all when I finally saw it.  The story starts off on a very depressing note, with a young man, John Malkovich (George Clooney), dying in a hospital after a severe car accident. He has no family, no friends and has been given no care at all. He meets a nurse, Mrs. John Malkovitch (Anne Hathaway) and they fall in love and become very close. Mrs. Malkovitches attempts to make a living for the young man but he has other ideas. He soon finds himself in a world of pain and suffering. Mr. Clooney brings his character, John, to life very well. He is a very sad man and I was very impressed with his performance. As he goes through his trials and tribulations, he has to deal with the fact that he will never have a family. He tries to get a job in a factory but is rejected. Eventually, he gets himself into some trouble and is sent to the notorious  "Quarantine" ward of a hospital. I enjoyed watching Mr. Clooneys struggle through his ordeal. I felt that his character had a good arc throughout the movie. I really liked how the film was structured and how it was told. The way the characters interacted with each other was also very well done. Although there was some cheesy moments, the film had a great story and some really well done scenes. Overall, I really enjoyed "The E.P." and I can't wait to see the rest of the series. This film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. The English patient is a classic British movie, a classic horror movie, and a classic romantic comedy. I loved it all.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The film takes place in the middle of the 19th century in France, and it is a real historical film. This is a historical film which was made during the first half of the 20th century. The film follows a French family in the time of the American revolution. The movie is made by a French director, and the film was shot in France in 1916. The story starts in 1775 in 1796, when the French Revolution breaks out. The French revolutionaries have a plan to overthrow the English monarchy and take over the English throne. The revolution is successful and the French army captures and takes over London. The English royal family is killed and the English king dies from a wound he received during the fighting. The king was a very young king, and he had just started his reign. The family was under the rule of the French king's aunt, who was a French noblewoman. The whole film is very historical and well acted. The King and Queen are very young, and they are both very attractive. The Queen is beautiful and very young. The father is a very handsome man. The queen has a very good personality and she is a great queen. The mother is also very attractive, and she has a beautiful child. The child is not really an intelligent child, and there is nothing smart about the child. However, the child has an amazing personality and is very intelligent. I think that this is a beautiful film about the French revolution and the British monarchy. It is a nice film about French people. I thought the film had a good ending, and I think it was a good film. I liked the film a lot. I recommend the film to anyone who likes historical films, and historical dramas. I would also recommend the movie to anyone with a love of historical movies and drama.

The story line was interesting, the acting was good, the directing was good and the music was great. This is a good action movie and a good story. I gave it a 10. The only thing I did not like was the action scenes. There were way too many shots of the hero throwing a baseball at bad guys. The guy throwing the baseball is not as cool as the action hero. You can tell they just wanted to have a nice long action sequence. If the action sequences were shortened or removed, the movie would be great. If you want a good, fast paced action movie, go see it. ********************

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________   The film is an amazing piece of work. The actors portray characters that are just so...normal. They are just normal people, who live their lives, and do normal things. They do the things we all do. Like the time they go out for a swim, or the time when they watch a movie, or they even play a video game together. It is a film that portrays the ordinary. I think it is a fantastic film that everyone should see.   I'm not going to talk about the story, since I've seen the movie already and have a vague idea of what happens. I can only talk about why this film is such a gem of a film. It was a simple thing, but it was done so well, and with such passion. The music, the cinematography, and the acting, it was all just perfect. I'm going to go into detail about the characters.   I think the characters are so relatable that everyone can relate to them. You don't even need to have read any of the books to understand the story. The characters were just so real. You see the love they have for one another, and how they are in the middle of a difficult time. The best part about it, is that it is so easy to relate to the characters, since they are so...regular. I guess that is why this movie works so well.   is a movie that everyone needs to see. It may seem strange, but I feel that it's the best movie that has ever been made. It captures the essence of the book, and gives it the perfect ending. The ending is perfect, because it's very powerful. The main characters are at the end of their lives. It shows that no matter what, life is just a journey, and you can't really change anything. It also shows that there is nothing you can do to stop the pain, and that the most important thing is to stay true to yourself. I've read the book twice now, and I can't wait to watch it again.

The film was a hit with critics and was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. It is a fascinating time-travel movie with an amazing cast. The movie is a bit more silly and humorous than I expected, but the film has enough suspense and drama to keep the movie interesting. The story is good, and I really liked that it ended in a twist ending that you'll never see coming. It's a great time travel movie, with a unique and intriguing premise.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. _________. _____._____. The film opens with a quick montage of a family being picked apart by the elements. We see a father in a storm drain being blown by a strong wind, a mother in a gutter, her children crying and a mother trying to comfort her son. The son has just lost his father, the wife has just seen her husband die in a train accident, and the father has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. The montage is interrupted by a news report of a train derailment. The train crashes into a bridge and goes off the tracks. The family is rescued by a police officer and brought to the hospital. The officer and his family are also picked apart and killed by the same elements. A woman is dragged from her car by the train and thrown into a canal. The husband, having just watched his wife and son killed, is attacked by a woman with a knife. The last person alive in the family is the mother, lying in a pool of blood. She has just discovered her son is missing and rushes to a train station to look for him. After some digging, she finds a train car with a child and a man in it. The woman and child are taken to the station where they find out the boy is alive and in the care of a strange woman. The boy is brought to his mother, and it is revealed that the woman was his mother. She is also dying, and her son had abandoned her and taken her to the train. The mother, who was raped by her son years ago, wants revenge on him, and begins looking for him on the train, but the boy, who had been left in the train for years, is gone. The two find themselves in a strange city with strange people and strange things. The movie does a good job of establishing the mood of this strange city. The camera is never more than a few feet away from the characters and is always careful to show the world around them. The story has a strong mystery element. I really loved this movie. The characters are very real and believable. It was a great movie with a great ending. I wish more people knew about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I've watched a lot of good movies in my life, and I think I've seen the best of them. I just wish there was a better way to make these films so accessible to the general public. The reason why this movie is so good is because of its cast. It is truly amazing how a cast as great as this can make a film as funny as this. I don't think it's possible to make a movie like this with a cast of this caliber. They are so good at what they do. There are not many people out there that would watch this movie and not laugh. It just never gets old. This movie is just perfect for anyone who is a fan of movies. I'd say if you're looking for a good laugh, or something to relax, I'd suggest this movie. I think you'll love it as much as I do. I've never seen anything so funny in my entire life. I am still laughing right now. _________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This movie had a great cast! The cast was amazing, they did a great job, the movie was funny and entertaining. This is a great movie to watch with the family, this was a great way to start the week.

I saw this movie for the first time on my recent trip to Hollywood and I couldn't stop laughing. The acting was very good and the humor was very funny. It wasn't too serious or too crazy but it was very enjoyable and had a very nice ending.

There are some cool twists and turns at the end that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a great movie that just keeps getting better and better.

It's a funny, sweet, sweet movie that will stick with you. It has great acting, great music and great acting. And it's all about family. It just has that real family feeling. It doesn't feel like an adult movie. It feels like a movie that was made for kids. If you love movies that make you feel like a kid again, this is a movie for you." -R.E.M. This review was written on July 4, 2010. It is not written to encourage you to see this movie. The reviews that follow may not be written with you in mind. But with me. It will give you a little something that I felt really loved and appreciated. This film has a story that can only be told in a movie. A story that has to do with a boy and his dog. It tells a story of love and family. And what better family than one who cares for each other. A love that is stronger than any weapon. I'm not sure who directed this film. It could have been someone's brother, father, uncle, or friend. Or maybe a group of friends and family came together to make a movie they felt was important. This is a film that makes you feel the love of family. You feel the bond between the dog and the boy. You see them together at first but then you realize that they love each other more than they know. This family movie made me feel like I was a part of it. It made me want to be a part. And now I have made it to the end. This isn't a story I've heard before. It isn't something I've seen before. This story was made to be told. And this film made me love it. This was the best movie of 2010. And if you haven't seen it, go see it now. You won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a well-made, well-acted, well thought-out movie about a group of men who attempt to take down a powerful gangster, and their attempts to do so are not always successful. It's a fun movie that offers an interesting and exciting look into gangster life in the 1940's. I would give it an 8 if I could. It isn't a great movie by any means, but it's definitely worth watching. The story is very entertaining and the performances are very good. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in gangster movies, especially the early to mid-40's.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________  I didn't really like this movie at all. The first half of the movie is all the same scenes we have seen in the other movies. The plot doesn't get much deeper, and the character's just have the same problem. However, the final half of movie is what I like. The last half of this movie is pretty great. It has a lot of character development, and they really got to know the characters. You can really see their life changing because of this. This movie is definitely worth watching. It isn't as good as the other ones, but it is good. This is the best movie I have ever seen that deals with bullying. I really hope this movie will make more movies like this because it is one of the best stories I have heard. _________________________________________________  So after reading this review I have to say that I really didn't enjoy this movie. There were some things that I liked, but overall I felt that the film had a bad plot and a poor ending. The story starts out with a good character and a good story. Then the story gets bogged down by a plot that is poorly written and doesn't make any sense. The ending was a big disappointment as well. The film had potential but the execution just didn't work. The characters are all the worst, and none of them get a lot more than two minutes of screen time. I am not sure if the producers of this film did a bad job or just didn.t want to make a movie that would go over well with a lot people. This may just be a case of bad directors taking the best ideas and then doing a poor job. If they could do a good job of writing and directing this film it would be a lot better. I just think the producers should have a better grasp on what a good film should be. ____________________________  What a great film! This is one the best portrayals of bullying I've ever seen. The movie does a great job of showing how it affects people and how it effects the person doing the bullying. The way they did this was great. The director of the film, John Waters, had great writing skills. I don't want to spoil anything about the movie so I won't say anything else. The main character, Nick, was one of my favorite characters in the film. I loved the way he was portrayed. He was a great anti-hero. I love how he was able

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The film, which is shot with a very strong cinematography and a lot of natural lighting, offers a unique look into the lives of these two very ordinary people. They are both living in the same neighborhood of New York City, a suburb of New Jersey. In a sense, they are very much like two peas in a pod. The only difference is that one of them is very lucky to be in a position where he can afford to go on a short vacation to the United States. The other one lives in the suburbs of New Orleans. As you might imagine, he is not in a very lucky situation at all. He is not the one that gets the job that allows him to go to the States. He does not have a car. His wife is suffering from some very serious health problems. But, the most important thing is that he has no other choice. His daughter has just lost her father and, therefore, she has to take care of her mother. The film presents a story that is extremely moving and a very interesting story. The characters of the movie are very interesting and all the characters have their own unique qualities. The main character of the film, Michael, is not that different from the typical American man. His life seems to be like a normal one. He works hard to make money to pay his bills and provide for his family. He takes care of his daughter, he makes sure that she has everything she needs and he goes to work every day. However, in his life, he meets a woman that gives him a chance to escape his ordinary life and has a big impact on his life. The most interesting part of the story is the relationship between Michael and his daughter. Michael has a very difficult relationship with his daughter and she, in turn, has a hard time dealing with him. The daughter, in the end, chooses to stay with her mother and they live a very comfortable life. But as Michael's relationship with the daughter becomes increasingly strained, Michael realizes that he is very different from what he used to be. This makes him realize that he does not want to remain in his ordinary world. This leads to a series of events that force him to make some big decisions that will change his life forever. The story of this film is very powerful. The acting is excellent and the story, as I said, is very moving. There are some great performances in this film. The director, Jean-Pierre Melville, does an excellent job of telling the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ My wife and I went to see this movie. I think it's a good flick with a good story. I liked how they showed us the whole story of the war. It was pretty cool how we saw the whole war from a guy who was in the military. The acting was pretty good. I'd say this is a movie for the older crowd. I don't know if it's for people that are too young or if they want to see something they haven't seen before. I loved the music. The best part of the movie was the scene with the two soldiers talking. It really helped put the whole movie into perspective. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought it was worth seeing. _______________________________________________  "A great war movie. It's not easy to do. It is hard to be a soldier and be in a war. You get into the war, and you know what's going to happen, and it's tough. You can see what you've done, you can see how your friends and family have been hurt. It makes you want to do something. And I loved how they tried to show the impact of the War on the troops. I didn't really know much about the war in Germany. This was a movie I watched with my parents. They wanted to know what we did. I told them that we were in a tank and that we went in a big trench. Then my mom said "How long did you fight in the war?" I said about eight months. "That's a long time!" "Oh, so you didn't finish?" I thought she was kidding. "I didn't like to finish. I was a soldier." "What about you?" She said "I'm a prisoner of war." "Oh," she said, "That sounds tough." __________________________________  I saw this movie because I wanted to see a good war movie and I thought this movie did a great job of portraying the war and what it was like for the troops and the war itself.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** [SPOILERS BELOW] *********** The most powerful scene in this movie was not the one in the first act when a little girl has her face ripped off by a dog, but the one where we see the little girl's family and friends (the same group of people we met in the film's opening) waiting for her in the hospital's waiting room. The whole scene is beautiful. This scene was filmed by Robert Altman (who, by the way, wrote and directed the movie) and was filmed in a manner that feels like a film noir. The film's atmosphere is like a noir, as are the characters and their actions. ********* [SPILLER] ************** ************ The film starts with a long and complicated prologue, which seems to be the movie's "introduction." This prologue takes place during the first year of the war (1943) and the Germans are about to invade Poland. ************ ******** The film then jumps back to Poland where a couple of Polish officers are playing poker at a club. They are approached by a German officer and he is trying to win a woman to join him in his war. The woman is not interested and tells the German officer that she has a son and that her son will be a doctor and she is tired of the Germans. The German officer tells her that the Germans can't invade Poland and that the war is over, but she is not ready to give up. The couple are then attacked by a group of German soldiers. **************************** The German soldier then rapes the woman while the Polish officer and the woman are talking about their sons. This all happens over the course of the next several scenes. ******* ************* The following scene is very similar to the one above. We see a couple at a dinner party in which the German soldier is in the kitchen. The two are talking and the German woman says that she doesn't want her son to die in the war. She then tells the other couple to get out of the kitchen, but then she turns around and goes back in.  This sequence is very much like the scene that was seen at the beginning of the film, only this time we see that the woman was raped in front of a group. *** ********************* The next sequence shows the Germans invading a small village, and then we see a group meeting in a church.  ****** ******** ******** We then see a scene

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Rock" is a very fun movie.  The Rock is a tough guy who is a pro wrestler, and he gets out of the ring to go to the promos.  He gets into trouble with the promoter, but he gets a big crowd going and gets a title shot against a young stud named Dwayne "The Rocker" Johnson.  After a great match, he gets another title shot, but it is against Dwayne's older brother, "The Mummy" (who has been dead since he was a baby).  They have some great battles, with The Rocker being the victor, but in the end The Rockers body is too weak to take the fight.   The Rock is out of action for a while, but when he comes back, the people who support him are angry.    He gets into a match against the Hulk Hogan (who is actually the son of Hulk Hogan), who is one of the biggest stars in wrestling.  It is an exciting match, with the two men going head to head, and it is the main event.  However, before the match starts, the Rockers wife, "Trish Stratus" makes a statement, that the Rocker is a phony.  In an attempt to get back in the wrestling business, The Rock goes to Hollywood to try and get back on the big stage.  Unfortunately, the Hollywood thing doesn't go so well, and the Rock is in a coma.  Then, he wakes up, and realizes that his life was really a big dream, and now he is stuck in a very real coma, and has to take a trip to the past.  There, he meets a very young Arnold Schwarzenegger (who was just 12 years old at the time), who he must take to the future.  The movie also has a great soundtrack, and this movie is a must see for any wrestling fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The 'Lincoln' is a film of great moral complexity, and a moving tribute to a great American president.

We'll get this solved."  The film is based on the life of the great president. It tells his story, but there's a lot of drama in it too.                                                               指 � � � � � � � � � � �מ � � �ño � � � �м 錂          ㈳        㐱  㒱 㥇 ㅌ  𝕊 𝘻 𝚕   𝝌 𝞾   𝠸 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ This movie was fun. I would have liked a little more action, but it was great to see a young girl go through the pain of growing up. She did her best to be a good girl. I am glad she made a choice. I don't think she should have been forced to make it, but she did. I was impressed by the way she made it work. I do not see any of the "bad guy's" motives and thought he was just trying to keep her safe. She was not the type to hurt herself or others. That's a very hard thing to do when you are a child. It shows her strength and determination to grow up. It was a great experience. It's just a shame they did not include the end of the movie. It would have been better if they had cut to the kids home and her life. That would have shown a little of what it was like growing up and being a child at that age. If you have never seen this movie, then get it and see for yourself.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I was a huge fan of The Big Lebowski, and was a fan of John Turturro as well. Turturoro plays the role of Stan's brother, a pretty much perfect role for the guy. He was great. The best part was that I really liked that the story takes place in the 1970's. ______________________________________________________ "I had the greatest time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I have never seen this movie before but it is pretty good. It is a comedy about a guy who can't stop his girlfriend from cheating on him. He keeps trying to catch her but she is so good at it that she has been caught many times and she still does it. The movie is pretty funny and I think it is a good film to watch with a group of friends. I wish that the director made a couple more episodes. It would be a good idea to put it on TV and see how they do it. They do not use a lot of money in this film and there are only 3 scenes that are used. They are very funny. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a funny and exciting movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think you have to be aware of the context.  The movie opens with a scene from the future where a boy (Garrison Ford) has an accident, is in a coma and wakes up in the future.  A scene from a future in which a boy has a near-death experience. The boy and a woman (Carrie Fisher) are trapped in a train car.    It's the "Future" of the movie, so it's a little jarring for us to see the movie in the present day.  The boy, named Ben (Ford), is a good boy.  His mom (played by Fisher) is a strict, tough disciplinarian who loves Ben.  Ben's father (Richard Donner) is an astronaut, and Ben is sent on a space mission to find a new home planet for mankind.  After an accident on the space station, Ben has an encounter with the future Harrison Ford (Ford is playing Ben's dad in this film) in a hospital.  Harrison is in the same hospital as Ben and he's the one who saves him.  When Ben wakes up, he doesn't remember who he is or where he is, but Harrison is there to help.  That is where the movie starts.  This movie is about the relationship between Ben and Harrison.  They are both scientists, but they also are very different people.  I would say they are polar opposites. Harrison is a bit of a perfectionist.  He always tries to make things perfect.  There are no mistakes.  Instead of saying "I have an accident," he wants the accident to be perfect.   Harrison always wants to be right.  You can see it in the way he talks.  It's as if he is speaking in a very low, authoritative voice.  With Harrison, everything is perfect. But Ben is very passionate about science and is very willing to do whatever it takes to make his experiments work.  In this movie, Ben and his father find a planet that was abandoned in a failed colonization attempt and are the only two people that are left alive.  These two people are separated because of the accident and they go back in time together to try to fix the problem.  But things are not what they seem.  A conspiracy is afoot and the planet has been transformed into a deadly planet where people are enslaved.  Even the planet that they find is inhabited by humans that are enslaved

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________"The Big Chill" _________  Rating: 3.75 stars   It's the early 80's and there's a new sheriff in town. He's a tough guy with a smile. He has a lot of respect for the law and the police. He gets along well with the criminals and the cops. He is a good guy. But when a serial killer breaks out of prison, he finds himself in a tough situation.   The story follows the case and the suspects. The film was released as "The Big Break". It is a fun little crime movie. There are some good gags and one of the best sound effects in film history. It was made in 1982 and it was a success.  .  The movie opens with a closeup of a dead body. The murderer is being interrogated by the police and he has been convicted for the murders. He admits that he is responsible for the killings and that he also did other murders. The killer gets his first opportunity when he is pulled over and the policeman sees him running a red light. He runs from the police officer, but he is caught by a local cop. The cop finds a knife on the suspect and asks if he is a cop. He denies it and he is taken in to a police station. He confesses that he's a serial murderer and that it was his plan to kill 10 people. The policeman decides to put him on trial. ,  It all happens in one day. A new sheriff arrives in town and decides to take a different approach to dealing with the problem. He puts the police on high alert, and the new sheriff is forced to work hard to bring the killer to justice. The sheriff doesn't have the right attitude, but his hard work and determination pays off when the killer is caught. After his capture, the killer says that he'll kill again. He makes his first appearance in a short film "The Biker Killer".   .  is a very good film and has a good cast. The script is a little hard to follow, but it is fun to watch. The movie has a very dark and dark comedy, which is very entertaining. The acting is pretty good. The soundtrack is a pretty good rock 'n' roll score. It's not very memorable and doesn't stand out, but I think it adds to the movie. The music is not very good, but the music is still good. There isn't a
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________"This is a story of an ordinary family, living on a farm. It is a small town, and most people know the people, but the one who lives in the house is the most interesting character. He has been the best and most faithful servant of his master, but he has decided that he would like to be free of his masters' ways and he goes to the big city to try to get a job. He starts out by stealing a job from a young girl, and by doing that he learns more about his job. Eventually he meets a man who is much older than him and is married to a beautiful woman. But they fall in love and after many years of trying, they decide to be married. This is a very good movie and you will like it a lot." __________  5. The Man in the White Suit  Year: 1956  Director: Stanley Kubrick  Kubrick's first film was also his most daring and unusual. A mysterious young man in a white suit has been seen roaming the countryside with a gun. He was said to be carrying a list of people who could help him get the list back. Kubrick, who had been obsessed with UFOs, decided to make a film about it.  The Man in The White Suit, as the film was called, was a success. The film, set in a small village, became an instant classic and won Kubrick a best director Oscar. Kubrick was a big believer in the power of the subconscious mind and the power to change the world. The power of cinema and the subconscious is something that we all should keep in mind as we explore the subconscious.  the movie: the first thing you notice is how different it looks than a typical horror movie. The cinematography was stunning and the atmosphere was almost surreal. The camera is often used in an almost hypnotic way. The characters seem to move around the frame. The movie was a huge success. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1956 and was nominated for another five Academy Awards. It has also been remade many times, the most recent being The Shining in 1991. (Note: Some of the quotes above are from the DVD commentary track. I have not listened to the commentary track on any of the DVDs I have reviewed and have not seen it. I am not a Kubrick fan but I do know his works. I found the commentary to be very interesting and entertaining and I hope you do too!)

It has a good cast of actors. There are some good scenes and they are done well. The story is good. The movie has an interesting theme of kidnapping. The film does not go into detail about the kidnapping but it is explained in a very good way. The way it is done is really great. The ending of the movie was good. ______________________________________________________ Was this helpful?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I saw this film at a festival. It was a nice film. I like the film a lot. It's a movie about a guy who's a little bit crazy and a girl who's just a little scared. She gets in a car accident. He's driving a car that was wrecked and he tries to save her. It really works. And he's a good guy. And the movie is about how he tries. And it's very good. I saw it at a movie theater and it was a great movie. I didn't have much to say about it. I don't really think the film was very good or that it was good. It just had a good ending. So, it wasn't good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a great movie, I think the best of the "classics". The music is great, the characters are great, it is a good story, the film has a great ending, the acting is great and the direction is just perfect. The only thing I didn't like about this film is the ending, but if you are looking for a good comedy with a great soundtrack then this is a must watch. The movie is worth every penny and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I had never seen a horror movie until this one. The opening scene had the feeling of a movie I've never seen before. I couldn't get into it. It was creepy. I thought the whole movie was so bad that I didn't want to watch it again. The whole movie, especially in the second half, was pretty bad. The acting was terrible. I felt like the people in this movie were going to kill me. It made me so mad. I wanted to punch the screen. The ending was so dumb. I was thinking, "what are they trying to show us here?" I wanted it to end with someone getting hit by a car. I don't know if it was the lighting or the lighting. I really don't care. I liked the ending. The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the title. It's like a horror version of the Harry Potter books.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ What an interesting film! I didn't really know what to expect but I was very pleasantly surprised. The film is about a man who comes out of retirement and wants to find his wife. He comes across the woman who was once a member of the same club he was in. The club was a place where a lot of men would get laid. The woman is married to a man she had an affair with and he wants to get back at her for cheating on him. He makes a lot out of it. The man finds out about a secret tunnel under the club where the woman used to go to get away from the man. They go to the tunnel and the woman tells him she knows where he is. The two men find out that they are married. The movie is about an odd couple who have a lot in common. The men both know that the woman is still out there. They find out the tunnel is the only way they will be able to see each other again. It is a sad ending but that is what a good story should be about. The only problem with this film is that there is not enough romance and I felt that it could have been better. If you are a fan of old time radio and mystery you will like this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ The story of the film is based on a true story: the story of a real-life gang war that was happening in the city of Rome. The main character is an Italian boy named Alessandro, who is in Rome to sell his shoes and make some money. He meets two gangsters named Vincenzo and Raffaele (I don't know how they sound). The two are in the process of robbing the shop of a wealthy Roman citizen named Baccino. They decide to take on a larger gang of thieves in order to gain money. They have to steal a bag containing a large sum of money and a priceless painting. They get in a fight with the robbers and are caught. The two men are arrested, but the bag containing the money is still missing. The robbers, knowing that the bag contains a large amount of money, decide to try to sell it for more money. In order to do that, they hire a black man named Pietro (Vincenzi) and a white man named Mazzio (Mazzara) to help them. The gang members are arrested and sent to prison, while Pietro and Mazzie are sent to the penitentiary. While Pietro is in prison, the two gangs start fighting again. They are soon joined by some young people from the area. The film is quite a drama with a strong moral message. The soundtrack is composed of the best Italian classical music. The cast of the movie is very good, and it has a nice mixture of Italian actors and local actors. This movie is also a tribute to Italian history and culture. It is not too dark or depressing. The plot is quite interesting and it is easy to understand. There are no action scenes in the movie. Instead, the film focuses on the characters. This is also the reason why this movie is so well-made. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________"You can be so cruel sometimes" is an excellent and very sad film that explores a very complicated and sad topic. The film explores the concept of rape, and how this topic is so taboo in our society. It is not a very common topic in our culture, and yet it has so much power. We often find ourselves wanting to look away from something and hide it from our own eyes, even if we don't want to talk about it. We know that people are just trying to live their lives and have fun, but it is hard for us to separate ourselves from this topic. This film is very personal, and it is about a very dark and disturbing topic. We see how this issue can impact a family, but also a community, and even a nation. The subject matter is very interesting, and the acting is very good, with an excellent soundtrack. I am very sad that it is only available on video, and that it was only released in 1998. This movie should have been released in 1999, and if not for the release of the internet, I believe it would have never been seen. It was a very good movie, and deserves to be seen.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I saw this film as a teenager and loved it. It was a great little romp through the streets of New York. It reminded me of those films that were made in the '40s and '50s in which people would go from place to place and be transported by the story. I thought it was very well acted and the story was told in a really unique way. The story was very interesting. It had a great sense of humor and I loved it when the kids were having a hard time trying to figure out what was going on. It's also a very well made film. I love how it's a very realistic movie, with all of the realism that you would expect in a movie like this. The actors are all very talented and have great chemistry together. It is also a great family film. If you are looking for a fun romp to watch with your kids, you'll love this film. ______________________________________________ The Critic's Score: **** 1/2

I was not a big action movie fan so I didn't find myself getting bored with the movie. I really enjoyed the characters and they were all likable. The special effects were good and I really like how they made the action look so real. The plot was great as well and I was able to see it through the characters eyes and how they were feeling. I also really liked how the characters were not only likable but were likable and a bit of a pain in the butt. The story didn't give me any problems and I could understand it and was able enjoy it. I think it was a good action film with a great story and characters. The cast and crew really did an amazing job.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You don't need to have seen this movie to know that this is a fun, silly, and very entertaining movie about a bunch of crazy people who just have to have a good time, especially after getting drunk. It was so funny and I can't wait to see it again. I don't have a lot of time to write reviews because I am too busy working on my blog, but I'll write one more before I go. This movie had me laughing a lot. It's a good and fun comedy movie that will leave you in hysterics. I loved the way they made a movie about people who were drunk and wanted to party. I thought that they did a good job of showing the world how the alcohol affects people and they had some great lines. I can see why it is such a popular movie. It really shows the crazy and hilarious side of partying and drinking. I hope you enjoyed this review, I hope that you have enjoyed this movie as much as I did. Please share this movie with your friends. I would love to see what your friends think of this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************  If you like your horror movie with a twist, this is the one. If you are looking for a scary movie that isn't overly gory, or just plain scary, then this movie is not for you. The twist that was introduced at the end of the movie was pretty cool. It was kind of funny and kind of scary. It didn't make me scared, but it was cool. The story line was interesting and the ending was very satisfying.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good twist in a horror movie.  for anyone who wants a good horror movie that's not gory. This movie is great. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it doesn't have a ton of gore, but that's ok. If your looking for an original horror movie, and a good one at that, this one is for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I think it is an excellent movie, and is worth watching. I like the ending. I don't like the movie itself. The movie is not about the characters, but about the story. It is a good story about the life of a young boy who was kidnapped and raised in a secret underground world. The boy's name is Jack, and his father is called Jack (the one with the red hair). Jack's father is a scientist who is very interested in a new and mysterious technology. He is the father of a child who has been kidnapped. When Jack is 8 years old he goes to visit his father. During his visit he finds that the scientist is very unhappy and hates his son. When the boy returns home he discovers that his father has committed suicide. When he tries to find his mother he finds her dead. Jack is left alone in the underground world and soon discovers that he is very good at swimming. He soon learns that he has powers of swimming and he uses these powers to escape from his father's underground base. When a war breaks out between the two worlds, the boy decides to join his mother and father in the war and join their fight against the enemy. His mother tells him that she wants to see the world. So Jack decides to travel the world, to make a new home. The film shows us the boy's adventures on his journey to make his own world. One thing I must say is that I am not a huge fan of this movie. It has a very long and boring story, and the whole film seems to drag on a bit. I also think that there are a lot of plot holes. There are a few scenes that are hard to believe, especially when Jack is at the top of a mountain and we see the mountains around him. There is also a scene that is supposed to be when Jack goes into the world of an animal, but it is just a frame grab. Jack also goes through a lot and there are no actual flashbacks to any of the events. I did enjoy watching the movie though. The characters are interesting and they are a nice change from the usual action heroes that are in so many movies. Overall I liked this movie a lot.

The pacing of the story was good, and it made you really understand how hard it was for the girl to do this and the way she did it, but I don't think that you will really like this movie, because you are watching this for the plot. I just thought that the movie was really good, with a really good story and I think that there is more to it than just this one girl. It is very hard to see the way that the world works, and there are some funny parts, but the ending is not very good. It will make you laugh a bit and not really understand what is going on. I think there is a movie called "The Secret" that is really good and I recommend that you watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The film is a good example of the old western-movie trope of a man and a woman whose love is a source of great conflict, but whose love for each other endures, and whose love of each other is ultimately stronger than all.   This was one of the very first westerns made, and as such is not without its flaws. But it is a wonderful film, and a fine example of how to make a western. The cast is all outstanding, the production is top notch, and the plot and themes are all interesting. It's a story that never gets old, and is always fresh.  .

This movie takes place after the events of the first movie. This movie introduces Ariel, a mermaid, as she goes on her first adventure and meets a merman named Triton, who is her best friend. Tritan tells Ariel that he has discovered a strange magic called the "Mermaid Power". This power is an ability to turn back time, so Ariel and Triten can go back in time and do some mischief. This power has been stolen from the mermaid princess, Ursula, by the evil prince, Scar, and Ursula has been locked up in the mer-house. The two girls sneak out of the merhouse and go to the palace, where they encounter Ursula. She is locked up as well, but she helps them out of their trouble.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  "I love it. I've been wanting to see it for years and finally got a chance to do so."  -Tiffany  Click here to see my review of THE SINISTER SIDE  My review of the movie:   The film has been around since the mid 1970's. Its first showing was in the early 1980's, when it was first shown in a small independent theater in New York City. The movie is still considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and is probably the best movie about a serial killer. The film has had numerous remakes, and has a cult following, especially for horror fans. I found the film to be really well made, and not too long. This is a movie that is worth seeing. It is a classic film, that everyone should see. This movie is a film that can really put a smile on your face, even if you don't enjoy horror movies.   I thought the film was very well done. It was a very good horror movie, but was not too scary. The pacing of the film, especially in the second half, was just right. The killer is not overly scary, and at times is really funny. It doesn't go too overboard, and there is some humor in the film. The villain is also very evil, but is also portrayed very well. The director of this movie is probably one of my favorite directors of horror films, and the actors also played their roles very well, and were very scary. This was a movie where you really didn't know who was going to be the killer, and was actually a surprise.   in terms of sound, the sound was really good. The sounds of the killer were very well written. It made it sound like a real murderer was doing the killing. The music also made the film seem even scarier, and made the movie even more suspenseful. The only thing that really annoyed me with this movie was the acting. The actors were all good, but the acting was terrible.   The acting was just too overdone. Most of the actors were just very over the top, and I hated all of them. They just kept saying, "I am the killer" or "I killed them", or "They are going to die". The only actor that was good was one of them, who played the part of the "normal" girl. There was one other actress who was really nice

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________________ The Story: When a mysterious woman who calls herself the 'Dark One' abducts a young man, she uses a black magic spell on him that turns him into a man of the night who's only goal is to find a woman who is missing in the woods. When the man's friend shows up to find him, the man discovers that he can walk through walls and sees the world through someone else's eyes. After the man is turned into a vampire, the girl who he loves turns into a bat, and the boy is left to watch out for her. The story is very interesting, it follows the life of the vampire, and there is a very good twist at the end. I like how the story is told from the vampire's point of view, and it was very entertaining to watch this man struggle with the change he was about to undergo. The cinematography was amazing, it was beautiful to watch a dark night. The acting was very good, and I thought the lead was very well done. I felt that he did a good job of portraying the darkness in this man's soul, and he did it well. This movie was a little slow, and sometimes it was a bit boring, but I felt like it was telling a story, and you should take the time to see it. The Ending: I found it very sad when the movie ended, it felt a little too abrupt, and a little bit too abrupt was a good thing. _______________________________________________________________________________ Overall:  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, it's very interesting and it's one of the better vampire movies out there. The ending was a sad one, but it did give the movie a nice feel. It is also one of my favorite vampire movies, and is definitely a must see for anyone who likes the genre. _____________________________________________ A review by: __________________

The movie was great and the film's plot and character development were very well-crafted. But the performance of the young actor Ellar Coltrane, who plays the lead role of Mason Verger, was simply phenomenal. He has a gift for capturing a sense of vulnerability and sadness in the eyes of the main character and making it real and palpable. I've seen a few movies in my life but never had this much of a connection with a character. I didn't see the film in a theater where I could be with a large crowd. But I felt like I was watching a film by an old master on a small screen. And this is a movie that will live on."

I have loved this series since I was a little kid, and even though the story was a bit confusing for me at first, it made me love it more and more. The characters were all fun, and the story, though a bit rushed, was actually interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  If you like _____________, ______________, ____, _____, then you will like _________________.  It's a little strange to think that ____________, one of the most celebrated films of the last century, is the work of a young American. It is also odd to realize that it is not a film about a young man at all, but a film of an old man. The old man is Walter Murchison, and his movie is about an old age, but in an altered form. Walter is an old-fashioned man, who still lives in the house he inherited from his father and whose house is the old style, but it is in a very different way from the way in which he lived in his youth. Walter's old house is a place of comfort, where he feels at home. He feels at ease in the comfortable life that he has created. He lives for the old time. He has no worries and he is contented. But when he falls ill he realizes that he is getting old, and that he needs to change. His wife, who is still young and lives at the same house as he, is upset by this news. She is not at all happy about the change. Walter does not feel the same about her. He thinks that she should go out and find a husband. Walter has fallen in love with the woman, but she is not his type of woman. He does not know what he wants from her. They are not a happy couple. "What do I want?" Walter asks. And her reply: "You know what I want." "I want a husband." This is the movie that is now in circulation and that is very popular in America. It has been seen in almost all the cinemas. When I saw it for the first time it was in a theatre in New York. It was a very strange experience for me. I was amazed at the film, and I had never seen anything like it before. It had something that seemed familiar and yet something that was very foreign. It did not have the usual feeling of the cinema. I had not seen it before in New Zealand and I did not know how to describe it. Walter Murchisson is an Englishman, but his name is the same as that of a certain Englishman. And this personage is a hero in his own film. He is the man who

But it was only the trailer that made me want to see this movie, not the actual movie. This movie was awesome. I was so happy that it was finally made into a movie. The story was amazing. I thought it was amazing that the whole thing took place in just one day. I'm sure that was a big challenge, because they had to make it so fast. They didn't need a lot of time to do everything. The director, Robert Rodriguez, did a great job. I liked that he did not show his own work. He just showed the images and then explained how he came up with them. The cinematography was beautiful. I loved the little details in the movie. I really liked the music. It really got me excited. The action scenes were pretty awesome.

The only thing that could make it better would be a longer movie, but this one was so good that it doesn't really need a longer film.  My Rating: _______

But the movie had it's moments of greatness and the movie made me realize that maybe there's something out there after all. I don't know about the end but I sure wish there was more! *********** The Matrix starts out with a scene that takes place in a prison where Neo, a young hacker, is trying to hack into a military system and he does so by using a program that allows him to go into a computer simulation and he gets the code and he runs it into the computer system and it gives him the key to the system and the program is called The Matrix. Neo is given the code, and he is told to go to the other side of the world, where there's a huge war going on between the machines and humans and Neo needs to do a few things for the machines to win. The first thing he does is he goes to the underground bunker that has a giant screen and a big screen in front of it and he's told to find the codes for both screens and put them in. So, Neo goes to his computer and he plugs in the codes and he goes through the program and he comes to a giant room with a couple of machines and one of them is called Morpheus. Morpheus is a very good looking man and Neo wants to talk to him but he doesn't want to talk so he just punches him. And then Morpheus says "You are not the one we're looking for Neo" and Neo says "I'm sorry Morpheus but I'm not the man that you're looking to find." And Morpheus asks Neo what he's going to do now and Neo is going to get out of here and he wants to know what Morpheus wants from him and Neo tells him to tell him what he wants and Morpheus looks at him and says "We want you to be our savior" and that's the last thing that Neo remembers and the next time that Neo is shown, he's waking up in a computer that looks exactly like the one he was in. He's in a very nice apartment with his sister, and his sister says "Where are we?" and he says "This is the apartment where we're living. This is where

I enjoyed the story and I liked the characters. The special effects were good but it was more of a fantasy. I also found the story pretty dull and I didn't care about the characters at all.

A strange place, indeed. But at the same time, it is a very interesting place. This movie tells a story of two men and a woman who decide to leave a big city, which they were going to live in permanently, and travel to a tiny village in a forest, where they can have a simple life and raise a family. But the journey becomes more complicated and more dangerous, and they discover that something is missing in their lives, something that the people around them don't want to know. But what they don't know is that this something is a child, a little girl, and the child was taken by some people, and her name is Sophie. And she is waiting for her mother. A very strange movie, and not at all as it seems. But still very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ "The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Michael Jackson" by John W. Campbell was the first movie to bring Michael Jackson to the big screen, but it would take two more years for his career to fully take off. The first movie, The Jacksons: The Lost Years, was released on October 24, 1977 and was the second installment in the series. The second movie, Born in the U.S.A., was released in 1980 and was an immediate success. In 1987, he had the biggest year of his career, selling over 25 million albums, but this did not stop him from making more movies. Michael had an even bigger year in 1988, with The Michael Jackson Story, a movie he also wrote and directed. It was the third movie in the franchise, and was Michael's first movie set in Paris. He was a guest star in another movie in 1989 called The Man in the Mirror, starring Michael Jackson's son, Paris. After The Michael Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson and his brother Jermaine would go on to make a movie called The Greatest Showman in 1987. This movie was directed by John Landis, who would go onto make one of the best movies of all time, The Blues Brothers. The movie was a huge success, and Michael's career skyrocketed. He also had a small part in another Michael Jackson movie, A Place in the Sun, which he played a little kid. His career continued to rise and soar in the late 1990s, when he would release the music video for "Black or White." Michael Jackson released his third movie, Michael, on September 29, 1997. The film was a follow-up to the Michael Jackson story, and it was about Michael's relationship with his sister Paris. This is the first time Michael would have a role in a musical. The music video was filmed in Japan, and the movie was set in New York City. This was the last Michael Jackson film he would make. Michael Jackson also released the movie "Let It Be" on December 20, 1997, which was the soundtrack to the film. Michael and Jermichael had a cameo in this film. This music video had an amazing video that had an all-star cast, including Will Smith, Madonna, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Justin Long, James Earl Jones, Tom Hanks, and others. After the success of Let It Be, Michael decided to put his music career on hold for a while. He

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   "You don't know who you're dealing with."   You know who's dealing with you?   That's right, the director of this film. I'm not kidding, you've got a director with a very, very high opinion of himself, a director who has a very narrow view of how good or bad a film can be. And he doesn't even know what he's doing! I think this is the worst movie I've seen since the "Godzilla" series, and even that one was better.   I know it's a good review because I just finished it, but this movie has so much potential. This movie could have been great, but it's just not. I've never seen a movie where the bad guy is an animal. This film is about a guy named Charlie, and his quest to bring down the evil monster. I really wanted to like this movie.  . I think that if they had given the director more time to work on this movie, it could have worked. The movie starts out okay, and then it just gets bad. And worse. The acting is awful, and the plot is not as original as the last two films. The script by Peter Berg is a joke, and it's not funny. I can't even describe what I'm talking about.   to me, this film has all of the worst qualities of a "mature" film.   (It's a movie for children, but the language is still too strong for a kids film.)   The "good" scenes are so far removed from what they should be, and that's the only thing that makes this movie work. It should have been about Charlie and the monster. The film never tells you what the monster is doing. The only clues are Charlie saying "Oh, I know, that's a great idea" and "No, that is the wrong idea." But the movie never even bothers to tell you why Charlie is right or wrong.   the movie even has a "bad" scene where Charlie is attacked by the monster and has to run away, and I'm pretty sure that was the first time they showed a scene where a kid is scared by a monster. That scene is the only part of the movie where I didn't feel like I was being told what was going on.   The bad scenes are the worst parts of this movie and make it hard to watch. I could tell that this was not

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  "The first time I saw "Rambo III" I was in a theater near my home in the San Fernando Valley, and I was stunned by the performance of Sylvester Stallone. I was very impressed with the acting of Rambo, and this time the movie was really great.  As for the movie itself, it is about a gangster (Sylvester Stallones) who is hired by the government to help them stop the assassination of the President of the United States. After getting to know Rambo and his buddies, they are hired to go after the Mafia in Los Angeles. During this mission, Rambo becomes the victim of a hit and he goes through a lot of injuries. After this he is sent back to the military for a recovery. After a few weeks, Ramo and his friends decide to go on a mission to take down a Russian spy. Rambo finds the spy, and they fight the Russians. Ramo is injured and gets captured. His friend decides to go get help from the Army, and while they are on their way, Ramos friend and another friend are killed. When they arrive at a hospital Ramos has been hit with a gas canister, but he recovers and fights the Russian spies. He then gets captured by the Russians again, and his friend dies from a bullet to the head. He and the Russian soldiers are then attacked by a helicopter, and are then taken prisoner. .  I thought this was an excellent movie. It was so exciting and full of action. The acting was great and I loved the characters. It had an interesting plot and had lots of surprises and action. It is also a good reminder to people of the war between the two countries, and the effects it had on the country.  in my opinion, this is a great movie, and if you love action movies you will enjoy it.  to conclude, I highly recommend this movie. If you have not seen this movie before you should check it out, I would love to see the next sequel to this movie,  .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of the movie was the scene in which our hero's sister, an African American, was murdered and her body was then buried in a swamp by a white man.  In that scene, the camera was trained on a black woman with a big afro, and a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes.  The film also has a scene in a church, where the white preacher is preaching about how he loves God and how God will give you a heart to make you a good man.    I really liked this scene because the pastor's preaching reminded me of how it was when I was a kid. _____________________________________________ A movie that was so good that it is impossible to get it out of your head:    When I was in high school, the movie that I remember most vividly was  Jungle Fever.  It was the best movie about racism I ever saw, and the best thing about it was that the white people in the movie, including the racist uncle who has an evil laugh and a mean attitude, were so likable that you never had to think of the fact that they were white.  _____________________________________________________________  Why I watched The Last Picture Show  (1978) :  A long time ago, I went to see a film about a girl who gets an audition to be a model in Hollywood.    The girl, a black girl named Tatum, plays the role of a model, and she is cast by a Hollywood agent, who is white. When Tatum is finally going to be photographed, a white police officer (played by Jack Lemmon) stops her. _______________ ______________ Why I will never watch another movie with a white protagonist: _____________ ____________ The movie was about a man named Joe, who, in the 1930s, went to Hollywood in order to get a modeling job. ______________________ _______________________ ____________________ __________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The movie is about a group of people who work for a construction company in the city of Los Angeles. A group of them are having a difficult time in their lives and need some new ideas. This is what they do. A woman, the boss' secretary, has an idea for a job she would like to do. She is the only one who gets the idea and she is the first person to think of it. But then another woman is brought in. This other woman is the same age as the secretary and has been in a similar job before. She wants to try her own idea as well. So they both do. And it's successful. The only thing that can go wrong is that the boss gets involved in the project. So he decides that they have to stop. He decides that he is the person to do this. This can't be allowed to happen. The other women have to get the boss to change his mind. So that he will take the job, because they are all afraid that he's going to fire them. This leads to a bit of a story. They have to convince him, and convince him they are just the right person for the job. They do it with a little bit of humor. But there is a lot of heart there. There is a love story, too, and I found it a nice change of pace. The movie has some great action and some great fight scenes. The ending of the movie was great. I hope the studio is able to get another one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The most underrated movie of all time! I don't know why they didn't make a sequel to this movie. __________ What could have been a great movie is ruined by the bad acting, boring plot, and a weak acting group. The bad acting is mostly because the actors do not have the ability to deliver a good performance. This movie is made by the same directors as "The Last Temptation of Christ" and "Eyes Wide Shut". _____________ This is a must see movie, it's a good idea with a good ending. ______________________________ I like it when they make a remake of an old movie. This is the most faithful version of this movie that I've seen so far. I hope that they make another sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The first time I saw this movie it had an extremely strong impact on me, and it remains in my mind. The second time I watched it, I found myself thinking about it more than I had the first time.   In a way, this movie is like an early version of the Matrix. Like Neo in the Matrix, it's all about the story and the characters and their struggle for freedom. But it's not as much about the main plot or the story itself. It's more about the relationships between the characters.  In the first film, Neo is the perfect blank slate. He is a perfect blank page. He doesn't know any of the rules and he's not really affected by the Matrix or the people inside of it. But the second time, he has a much harder time. The first time he was able to think his way out of it, but he didn't understand the importance of it until he was put in a situation where he had to think about it. This time, as he begins to question the system and the people who run it, he is faced with a choice. He can continue to live in the system, or he can break it. And like Neo, the choices are hard. But he has the right people around him to help him. He has a friend who is willing to risk his own freedom for him, a cop who is sympathetic to his situation, and a scientist who is on his side.  to see where things are going to go. To the end of the movie, they both give their all to help Neo and he has to make a decision. And it's a very emotional decision. It will change the course of his life and will make him stronger than ever. The movie does a very good job of creating a realistic feeling about the whole process. The way that people act and how they act when they are being watched. The people in the matrix are really all that there is. They are nothing but the illusion of the system. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Did you like this movie? _____________________________ If you have seen this movie, do not read the comments, it is an insult. This movie is a disgrace. This is not a movie about how the world is going to end. This film is not even a movie at all. It is a piece of propaganda and it has nothing to do with real science. The world is not going to collapse on its own. It will collapse when the world banks are taken over by the Rothschilds, and the people are taken hostage. The banks will then be allowed to crash, and then the world will be destroyed. This does not make any sense, and this film is designed to fool the masses. I am tired of these movies, and I hope this movie does not receive a distribution. The Illuminati and their friends in Hollywood want us to believe the world can be destroyed by the banks. If that is true, why would they make a movie like this? It is just a propaganda movie. If they can do this, they can destroy any country they want. This picture has been around for decades, and it is still being made. There are still movies being made about this, and they are all made by the Illuminati and are completely false. This has been going on for decades. The movies about the Illuminati are all about the banking system. The movie "The Last Days of the Roman Empire" was made to explain how the banking systems would collapse. The "Lord of the Rings" movie was made because they wanted to convince the people that the people who are going to be killed in the war in the Middle East will be killed by the bankers. This all shows how much the bankers control the government. If the people knew that the bankers are going around and trying to get a world government, they would not want to do anything to help them. We are in a time when the Rothschild family is really taking over. They have controlled the governments of the world for over 100 years, and now they are taking over the government of the United States. They want to get this new world government and they want it now. They are going after America. The Rothschilds have their people in all the major media outlets. The people in the media are going along with it. They even have people like Bill Moyers and the late Walter Cronkite telling the people what is going on. This could not happen in the United Stated. If it were to happen in America, the people would

Write a positive review about a good movie: ---------------  I was never a big fan of this one. My sister and I used to watch it over and over again when we were kids. I never knew it was a remake. This movie is like a cross between a kid's version of "Tale of the Goon", and "Jaws". It's about a group of young kids that get sucked into a cave by a creature that only they can see. One of the kids falls in and becomes trapped with the creature. The movie ends when the kids discover the exit and go back to their world. I remember when I was a kid, I remember it was one of those movies where the kids and the monsters would just hang out and make fun of each other. There's a lot of swearing in this movie, and the movie is kind of violent and violent. It's not the type of movie that I would recommend to people younger than me. But for people like me who loved it as a kid and have fond memories of it, it's definitely worth watching. ---------------

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. _________. _________________________________________________.  The film is a fun one to watch, but I have a few nitpicks that I wish could be addressed. I like the style of the movie a lot and it's a good story, but some of the dialogue was a little too obvious. It's not a big deal, but it could be more subtle. I would have liked to see the film more in the beginning. It started out with a nice mix of the supernatural and the ordinary, but as the story progressed, the supernatural became more prominent. Then it went in the other direction. There was a lot of blood in this movie and it was just overkill. There were a lot more monsters and action in this than in any other horror movie I've seen. The only time you felt that this movie had a solid plot was the very end. I didn't feel the tension at all, so I think that it's probably better that way. The end of the film is just a quick, little action scene. It was a shame because it really could have been a lot better. But that's my only complaint. The acting was all pretty good and the music was pretty good. Overall, I thought it was a fun movie and definitely worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The Story: A group of kids go on a field trip to a deserted, haunted mansion. While they're there, one of them is attacked by a ghost. The others are unable to find him, but one of the kids is able to tell the spirit where to find them. The film is very slow and slow and really makes the ghost a very small part of the story. The kids' search for the ghost is interesting and fun, but I never felt like I was being chased by a monster. This is probably the best haunted house movie out there, if you don't mind the slow pace and creepy setting. The acting is excellent, and all of the children are great. If you can find a copy of this movie, I would recommend it. It's not as good as the movies made for the TV series or even the books that were made into a TV movie, but it's still a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is the best movie in the Lord of The Rings trilogy. The Lord of War trilogy is a great movie, but The Lord Of The Rings:The Fellowship of The Ring is the one I recommend. It's hard to decide which movie is better: "Lord of the rings" or "Lord Of The ring" (or "The Lord Of the Ring"). The Lord The Rings Trilogy is an incredible movie. It's the best. The movies are very different. "Lord The Rings" is very dark and the movies are a bit different. The movie was a bit difficult to watch because of its length. It was a very good movie. The only thing that was a problem was that it had some slow parts. It took a lot of time for me to understand the story. The plot was amazing. There were a lot action scenes. The characters were amazing. The story was great. The Lord The Lord is the story about Gandalf, the wizard. He's a very intelligent wizard. In the beginning, he doesn't want to help Bilbo because he thinks Bilbo is too much of a fool to go to the Goblin's mountain and that he would only bring bad luck to them. Later, he helps them. He goes to the mountain and finds the ring. He helps Frodo. He tells the wizard that he needs to take it to Mordor to get it back. Gandalf goes to Mordin. He gives the ring to the king. The king is going to take the ring for his king, but Frodo is not ready. Gandolf tells him to go and take it. The wizard is going with him. Frodo, Merry and Pippin follow the wizard to the end of the mountain. The last part is really hard to watch. It has some slow moments. At the beginning of the movie, Gandalf is in a cave. Gandor and his father, Thrain, are watching the movie. Gandlor's father tells Gandor to go back to the city. Gandord asks his father for something. Gandorc asks his mother for something, but Gandor says that he's only going for a walk. Gandorf is sad. Gandort wants to leave, but Thrain and Gandlor convince Gandord to stay. The next scene is Gandor, Gandoroth and Gandalf at the gates of Minas Tirith. Gando tells Gandalf

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a little late for the "Warm and Fuzzy" genre to make a comeback. I didn't even know it was a genre. But it is a good film. The film is a little bit slow, but it has a lot of great scenes and some great special effects. A few things I like about this film:  - The story and characters are great. The main characters are believable and the film is well written. - A lot of action. There are some scenes that are not that good, but the film has some good action. It's a great action film and it shows a lot. The most impressive and awesome scenes were the battles with the monster. If you like monster movies and horror, then you should watch this film. This movie will keep you in suspense and it will make you excited to see the sequel. The movie is well produced and it has some amazing special effects and effects. The only problem is that it has to be seen in a theater because the DVD is not very good. I give this film a 4.5 out of 5 stars. I'm glad that there are a few more horror and monster movies being made. The monster movies that are being made right now are not very interesting and I would rather see them at a movie theater. But this movie is a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Man Holiday"  is a terrific film and it should have won an Academy Award for Best Picture.  The story is about a middle-aged man who is getting older and it shows his love for his wife who is in a wheelchair.      The love story is strong in this movie and there is no doubt that the story is based on a true story.  There is a great scene in the movie where the couple are traveling and the father and the son are going on a long journey.  They are talking about the love story and how they should live their lives in harmony.  The dad says to the son, "I would like you to think about the fact that I have lived my life with the most beautiful woman in the world."  He then asks the son if he would marry his mother.  At the end of the movie the father is asked if he will ever be able to love his son again.  He answers that he doesn't think that he will be able live with his son but that the son will be with him forever.  It is a very touching movie and a wonderful movie to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- This is a very good movie. I liked it a lot. I think the guy in the movie who does all the talking in it is an extremely talented man. He does a great job. I thought it was funny, it had a good pace, and I liked that it took place in the early 1900s. I was very entertained. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is not an action film like I expected, it is a movie about a man who had a terrible dream about a ghost and went to find it. He ended up being the one that killed it. If you are looking for a good ghost story, this is the one to watch. Also, the movie is a bit different from what I expected. This movie does not have that ghost-type of feel. It was very much like a ghost story. The music was good, the story was good. It didn't have a great ending, but it was not a bad ending. This is one of the better ghost stories I have ever seen.

The acting is great and the director does a good job of mixing in the other actors to make it feel as though it's an actual movie.

I'm a huge Led Zeppelin fan and the music was great in this movie, I was really hoping that they would have gone with the song "When The Levee Breaks" as the soundtrack, but they didn't and instead went with a new song "Ride" by Judas Priest. This song was great and it really added to the movie.  andysonic1  Senior Member   the future is now  932 Posts . . Edited by - andysono on 09/26/2009 01:16:24 PM.

It starts off in a typical style, but as the story unfolds, it takes a turn towards a more psychological aspect. It takes a more comedic approach to the horror genre and doesn't overdo it at all. It's a good horror movie, not as good as The Shining, but it still deserves a spot on the top 10 horror movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! I'm so glad that I went to the cinema last night and I had the pleasure of watching this film. A great movie. I enjoyed it a lot. The movie is about a guy who is in prison and he wants to go out and start a new life. He has this friend who is a drug addict and who tries to help him. They do this by robbing banks and they go on a trip. This is a very nice movie. It's sooo good. The story is really well done. This guy, the friend, is so funny and I just laughed my ass off. This movie is very entertaining and I hope you guys see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  What a movie. I don't have much to say about it. It's a good little movie about an average guy trying to find his way through life. I liked the story, I thought it was very well written, and the cinematography was very good. I loved the scenes where the characters were driving and looking at each other. It was very touching. It has some great music, and even though I'm not a fan of the band, I love the movie. It might be too short to have a good run time, but the story and the music make up for it. I gave this 4 stars because I thought the ending was a bit contrived. I know, it's a horror movie and it's supposed to be scary. But it was too quick to be effective. I was hoping for a little more.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- --------------- I really enjoy this movie. It's a movie that takes a chance on something different. It doesn't get any better than this. It isn't perfect but it is definitely worth seeing. This movie is very good at taking a chance with something new. The characters are great, the plot is interesting, and it's funny. The best part of this movie is the fact that it is not like any other movie. There is no special effects or special effects for that matter. It is just an old movie made for people to watch and enjoy. I don't think it has anything to do with science or something. I think it's just something that was made to be a good film. This is definitely a movie I would recommend to all people who are interested in watching a good science fiction film. --------------- Summary: ------------- I really like this movie and I think that it would make a great movie to watch. It takes a risk with a story that I don' t think most people would ever consider and it pays off. The film is funny and it isn't afraid to show the different types of people that live in this world. The plot is a bit slow but I think this is a good thing. There are a few parts of the film that don't make sense but I still enjoyed it a lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'This Is The End' is the best comedy of the year and the best action movie of the last decade. It's so funny, it's so violent, and it's got a good story. It takes a break from the 'Die Hard' formula, but that formula doesn't work with these guys. It makes them seem like they're doing the same thing they always do. They're so bad at their jobs, and they're so unoriginal. 'This Is the End' has a few of the great action scenes of the 1980's. They are great because of the actors who were able to do these amazing things. Bruce Willis and Jason Statham are really good in this film, and the special effects are great. 'Die hard' is great in that it's very well made, but it's not as funny as 'This is the End'. It's more of a heartwarming film. It has great performances, great story and great special effects. It also has the best opening scene ever in any movie. I don't think anyone could watch this movie without laughing. It doesn't matter if you are a Die Hard fan or a 'This S...e' fan. You're gonna love this movie.  And I would have to say that the movie is not even a sequel to the movie 'Diehard'.  The two movies are different, but they both follow the same basic plot. It was a good idea to have a sequel, but the film isn't that good. I like the movie more as a comedy, because it's better than 'DieHard'. I think that 'This' has to be one of the best comedies ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie: or a movie I have seen, "Journey to the Center of the Earth" is the most fascinating. It is not an obvious movie for many people. I don't mean that there are not obvious hints in the film, but it is very difficult for the non-believer to understand that it is not just another "space adventure" or "dramatic" movie. It has some hidden messages that are not very obvious at first, but if you really read the film carefully, you will understand what the film really means. "Jour nal to the e nt, the movie is about an expedition to a very far planet. The crew of the spaceship is led by a man named David Bowman, a scientist. The ship is called the Odyssey. The journey is not going to be easy. The expedition is commanded by a military officer, Colonel Emerson. He has a very strange obsession with space travel, which is a strange thing in itself. "  "In the beginning, there is a space ship called the spaceship Odyssey, and they are heading to a distant planet. It's a planet where all kinds of animals live, and there are a lot of different life forms. In order to make it to the planet, they are going to have to use the resources of the planet. And, of course, the resources are in great demand. So, the ship must go to a nearby planet and steal the resources for them. That is why the crew members have to be in very good physical shape. The whole movie is a big exercise in physical fitness."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you enjoy this movie and would like to see more, please do consider donating to help keep it going. __________  My review: ______________________________________________   I love movies with a twist and this is one of them. In fact, this film has more twists than a twist-o-rama. I don't even know how it is possible to make a movie like this, but the writer and director have done an incredible job. The movie takes place in the future when humans are trying to build a giant robot that can go anywhere and do everything. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing the human race is working on. In the beginning, they want to make sure they have a "perfect" robot. Unfortunately it doesn't work out and instead they build a man-sized robot. I am not sure if the robot was really man-size or just bigger, but either way, the guy-sized one was not perfect either. The giant robot takes off and has to travel back to earth to repair itself.   This is a film where the twist is all over the place. There is an old woman who is very powerful and has been the leader of the human resistance for years. She has had to hide her power from the world because of the danger it poses. However, as the story unfolds she begins to realize that it is her power that is causing the danger. In order to keep her secret safe, she has to keep the secret from the other human resistance members. I like the idea that the movie is about the humans trying to hide the fact that they are trying too hard to be perfect. The idea of "perfection" is a very real thing for us humans and one of the ways we keep from being so is by doing whatever is "normal." That is the point of this film.   and the movie makes sure to show that fact with the very first scene where the giant robot is flying through the air. The robot is almost perfect and has a few small flaws. I also liked the idea of a robot that could go anywhere in the world and do anything it wants. In this film we see the robot doing something that is totally outside the normal limits of its capabilities. In addition to that, the giant man-like robot goes through a whole range of emotions from joy to rage. These emotions are not just in the robot. The people around the robot feel the same emotions as well. There are a few people in

Sattar, Jia Zhangke, Mary Louise Parker, Marwan Kenzari, Sam Hamm, Alonzo Bodden, Tilda Swinton, Marcello Mastroianni, Yorgos Lanthimos, Michael Stuhlbarg The Great (  (  )  , 2014 This is the film that made me love Kiaroussian. I watched the film back in 2013 and it is not as good as the remake in 2012. That movie was made by a different director, and the director did a better job. The film does not feel as fresh as the one in 2012 and the acting is not that great either. The cinematography is also a little bit dated. It is a movie about a very beautiful girl who is on a mission to be the world's greatest dancer. The girl has to go from the east coast of the US to a city in the middle of the desert and compete for a prize of $50,000. The city is called Balearic Islands and the competition is for a contest of dancing which is held in the same place. The competition is held to decide the most beautiful woman in the world. The prize is a trip to the moon. The movie is about a girl who becomes a dancer and it has some wonderful performances by the main characters. This is one of the best movies of the year and one of my favourite movies of all time.  Kiarousisian is a master of the film, and this movie is no exception.

A film I didn't think much about and then it just seemed to happen to me. I don't even remember the plot. It's just a normal day at the office. So a couple of weeks later, a woman who works at a small insurance company is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. They say it's very aggressive. So they offer her a choice - either a quick and easy surgery and they'll make a quick profit on the surgery, or a long and complicated operation and they might make a small profit on it, but it will cost her a fortune. So she opts for the surgery. The surgeon tells her that it's going to be a very complicated operation, and that he doesn't know if he's going be able to do it. So he has her get a test. The test comes back showing that she has cancer. She's very scared. And then one day the woman goes to the lab to get a new test. She gets the test back showing the same results. The doctor tells her there's no cancer. But she's terrified that the cancer might have spread. So the doctor tells the woman to go back to the insurance company and tell them that the test came back and the results show there is no cancer in her ovary. The insurance company then says they will pay for the cancer treatment if it's deemed necessary. The woman has to take the cancer test again, and it shows there is still cancer in the ovary, but the woman has a good chance of survival. So after a week or so of chemotherapy, the woman is still alive. The patient who got the test also lives. And she tells the doctor that the doctor told her to get the test because it might be a false positive, but she didn't know that and didn't understand why they would do that. The real reason is because they were hoping to make a large profit on that test. Now that's what you call a coincidence! The movie I saw was a very good movie, and I liked it a lot. I was in the theater for over an hour. But it was a bit of a slow movie and a little slow paced. The ending was a little too sudden for my taste. But the movie was good and I hope you enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Elysium' is a very good movie and not a typical space opera. It's a space opera with a strong political message and it's very interesting. It has a strong plot, which you can follow easily. You can see the struggle of the main character who's in an underground city. I think the movie has good quality and it has very good story. The ending is very good, which is what makes the movie a great movie. The movie is very short, but it has some very good parts. I'm not sure if this movie has a sequel, but I'd be interested to see what the director is working on next. 4.5 out of 5 'Echoes of War' is another movie from the director of 'Cease Fire' and 'Lust For Life'. It's about a group of men who want to help the people of a planet they are on. The movie is good, but has some problems. The characters have a good performance. I like how the film starts with the people having to hide from the enemy who's trying to destroy the city. The action scenes are great. There's also some really good music in this movie. The fight scenes are good. The people of the city are very good looking and the movie also has some beautiful landscapes. The character's are strong and the main hero has a good attitude. The story is interesting and it is a good idea to give the main guy a lot of problems.  The film has some great action and it doesn't feel boring at all. The fighting scenes are awesome and the character's have great performances. The soundtrack is great and the scenes are very emotional. I'd recommend this movie if you want a good action movie. It also has a nice storyline and it was a good story to start with. I also enjoyed the soundtrack and the cinematography was very good. 3.5 stars out of 4 'In the Mind's Eye' is an amazing movie. A very famous director is in charge of this movie, which means it's not a regular action movie anymore. The main character has to escape from the police and from a prison. The scene with the main characters is very well done and it made me like the movie. There is a strong story in this story. A young girl has some trouble with her brother and the girl and her brother are hiding in a safe place. There are many scenes with a lot happening.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ _________________________________________________ The film opens in a bleak future where a group of scientists has built a giant computer in which they can analyze everything, and are going to use it to create a human like super soldier. The super soldier is going to go on a rampage killing everyone in a city, the only way to stop it is to build a new city in the middle of the ocean where the super soldier can't get to it. But, one day the super soldiers arrive and they kill all of the humans and the computer gets erased. The scientists are going mad, and the only one who can get them back is a guy named "Pete" who is the son of the scientist who built the computer. Pete has an older brother, and a sister who he doesn't talk to, and he's going to tell them about the super warrior that is destroying all the humans. But the whole family is going crazy because of the super warriors, and they are going crazy. But at the same time, Pete has to save his sister, who is being experimented on, because she is the only hope for the human race. The movie is not so much about the scientific quest of the scientists as it is about the family, and their relationship with each other and their father. This movie is a good film, but I'm not a big fan of it. The film is a little slow, and there are a lot of confusing plot elements. But it's a good watch, and it was good for me to see a film that I haven't seen in a long time. _____________________________________ Stand by Me - Stand By Me - (1992) Written by John Hughes and directed by Rob Reiner, this film is the story of an 11-year old girl named Carol (Kristen Wiig) who moves to a small town where she meets the local boy (Ben Affleck) who she falls in love with. They are both struggling teenagers who get into trouble at school. Carol has problems with her dad, but she gets a chance to change that when her dad takes a job with the town. She starts to get close to Ben, and her life gets more and more complicated. This film is good for its humor, but it has a lot to say about life and relationships. It is funny, but not as funny as it should be. The characters are all well-written, and I was invested in them. I think this is a very good movie. Stand By me

It was a fun little film that was made with a very simple budget.   the director was a little over confident and had a great sense of humor. It's an excellent parody of the 1980s and 1980s action films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I've never seen a movie so entertaining. It's the most original and exciting film I've seen this year.  The main character, Alex, is the most entertaining character in the film. He's very witty and funny and he's so original in his actions. I loved how he always makes things worse and makes everything so much worse. He makes it all so complicated. This movie is really well made and the characters are great.  I hope this movie gets a wide release so that everyone can see it. I'm a big fan of this movie and I hope it gets a lot of attention. I'll definitely be watching this movie again. The film opens in the city of Paris, France, with a big parade and fireworks going on. Alex is walking with his mother and his girlfriend, a woman he met at a dance party the night before. They're getting ready to leave for the night, when Alex hears a very familiar song. He stops and they both start dancing to the song, "When We Were Young". The song starts playing and they start dancing with one another. Alex's girlfriend has a crush on Alex, and Alex has a secret crush on her. The woman that Alex's crush is with also loves him. They dance a little longer and Alex gets closer and closer to his girlfriend. He then walks over to his mother, who's crying and talking to herself. He says "Mom, I love you, you're so beautiful. I think we're gonna fall in love." Alex's mother then asks if he's been sleeping with his girlfriend and he says "Yes. I was just with her yesterday." He then says, "She's so pretty. I want to kiss her. Mom, I want you to know that I love her. You'll always be beautiful to me." His mother then says "Alex, I can't do that." He replies, "Mom that's not true.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.   A solid action movie that you should check out.   and don't think it's a "Hollywood Movie".. it's more like a classic Western, that's what i like. I think the movie is really well done and there is a lot of fun to be had with the action.   to get some more info about the movie, it is about a sheriff who has to take over a town and the town people are not very nice people. The sheriff, who is a little rough around the edges, tries to stop some of the town criminals and get the town to help him stop a local gang of robbers. The town people and the sheriff are really a lot more interesting than you would think. I found the film to be quite well done. I was surprised that the film didn't feel as over the top as it could have. You could tell that the writers had a lot going on and they tried to get everything in and didn't give us a lot to chew on.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The story is about an old guy who lives in a small village in the countryside. One day a group of young men comes by and starts to play. When they leave they say, "we're going back to our village". The old guy says, "that's where I live, but I'm not going back". They're not convinced so he starts to go back to the village. When he gets there he meets a woman who says, I'm going back home too, but it's not the same place. The old man thinks it's a joke but she says, no, that's where they are. The woman tells him they'll be back in a few days, and so they do. They get back to their village, but the woman is in trouble because they went back and she was attacked by a man. They go back but the man attacks her again. The guy is caught by the old guy and he tells the man he's going to take him to the police. The man says, but what will they do with a guy like me? The old boy says, well, the police will try to kill you. They take the old man away but the guy doesn't want to leave. The policeman tells him to leave, but he refuses. The police chase him and he runs to a forest. The policemen find him there and they take him away. The guys come back and the old boy is gone. He comes back again and the guy says it's the same village, just a little different. The boy says there are people in the village who still remember the old days and they don't want him. The kid says he's the last one and he's not going to leave again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ ____________. A good movie with a good cast, with great direction and sound. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good movies and is a fan of the genre.  Rated 5 out of 5 by MrKon from Great movie!! I'm a big fan of sci-fi, so when I saw this I had to have it. I've heard it's really good and the cast is amazing! This is the best space-based movie I've ever seen. The movie was amazing and I loved it. It is worth seeing!  Reviewed by jimmyd from great film...but i have one thing...i want to see it again!  the space opera was really good! and i would love to see the sequel in the original format! , a science fiction film about a human expedition to a new planet, that has a new type of lifeforms, called "Celestials", that are different from humans. After a few years on the planet, the expedition discovers that the Celestials are actually the natives, and the humans are being experimented on. After surviving several dangers, the group realizes that they must be the last of their kind, if they are to survive the planet. - IMDB  The characters are so unique, and I'm looking forward to the sequel. I love the way the characters are depicted. The cinematography and the effects work really well to portray the action. This movie is really well acted and is well-paced. I like the way that the movie is set in a real world, with a lot of real-world people and locations. It has a great vibe to it, and it is very well made. The soundtrack is great, and that is why I'm giving it five stars.  I like to think of this movie as a "found footage" film, but it has its own style of storytelling. It's definitely not a "comedy" or a "drama", but it is a very interesting movie. I also really liked that the film takes place on a planet that has an atmosphere that is quite different from earth. The planet looks like it has a lot more vegetation, and its atmosphere is more like that of Mars, than Earth. This makes for an interesting movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and is more "realistic" than many of the science fiction movies that I've seen in the past. "I Love You

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   I loved this movie. I am a huge fan of the original series and this movie was pretty darn good. The main character is not a perfect hero, but he is a great character and his quest is pretty good. This movie is about his friendship with another young man named Johnny. The two are good friends, but their relationship is a little different. Johnny is a bit cocky and a bit of a jerk. They are both on the same side though. This is a very fun movie, and it made me love the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Gatsby  (2013) I saw this movie at a screening in New York a few weeks ago and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie.  I was pleasantly shocked when the opening scene of the film made me cry. Â The film does a wonderful job of establishing the characters and setting up the story.  Â I was especially impressed with the performances of Jay Baruchel and Jared Leto.  I liked the fact that the film was set in the early 1900's and the characters did not look like they were going to die any time soon.  The characters were very well acted and their inner struggles were not overdone.  There were some great performances by Jared Letoo and Jay Baruhel.  As I said, I really liked the film and I am going to see it again soon. 9/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel is a good, smart, and funny movie about a group of people who come to Budapest in a hurry to attend a wedding. The movie is funny, but I wouldn't call it very good.  I think it is a very well done movie.   It has a great cast, and the movie is filled with interesting and funny scenes. The cast is great.  In my opinion, it is the best cast in a movie in recent memory.  It is like watching a great actor/actress in a comedy.  And that is just the way the movie goes.  I really liked the characters.  There is one that is a bit annoying but otherwise is good, and there is one character who is just good at everything.  The movie has some good jokes, but the humor is not very good, in my opinion.  One character in the movie has a funny accent and is not what I would call good. And that was the only real problem I had with the movie. The story is interesting and I really enjoy watching this movie.   The Grand Hungarian Hotel is about a bunch of people that get stuck in a hotel, and have to stay in it.  After being stuck in the hotel for a few days, the characters get to know each other and the situation gets worse.  This movie is good for people who like good stories about bad situations.   The movie was a little slow at first, but when the plot started to pick up, it became much more interesting.  I highly recommend The Grand Budapest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Devil's Advocate (1992)   I remember seeing this movie as a kid and feeling so wronged by it because the only black character was played by Christopher Walken, but after watching this movie again a few years later I realized the casting was not a big deal and the acting was great.  When I saw this movie in 1992 it was so black and white and not a whole lot of action.    Fast forward a few decades and the movie is filled with action and explosions and it is amazing that it worked as well as it did.    This movie has a very dark theme about what it means to be a lawyer and to be treated with a different level of respect.

I loved this movie. It was just what I needed to relax after a long day of work. It had everything. A beautiful soundtrack. The beautiful and unique actors. A very likable cast of characters. A story about family and friendship. A really funny movie. A movie with heart. It made me laugh out loud. It did not have anything that was original. It tried to do something that it had never done before. It wasn't really trying to make a statement. It just told a story that I really enjoyed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The Movie __________ is a great movie. It's a very good movie. If you don't have an appreciation for classic Hollywood films, it may not be for you. If this is the first movie you've seen where the main character is a woman, you should check it out. If the first thing that comes to your mind is, "It's just a movie," then you're in for a treat. The movie is really good. I love the movie. I think it's a great example of a good comedy that shows a character dealing with the pressures of life. In the beginning of the movie, the movie starts out like a comedy. The main character (played by Elizabeth Moss) is trying to be a successful actress and she has a lot of problems. Her ex-boyfriend is going to a fancy dinner, she has to make up a story to be able to go to the dinner, and then she has this great romantic movie idea and then is unable to pull it off. Then she gets a call from the producer of the romantic movie who wants to meet her. Then, she meets with him and he shows her the script. When she sees the script, she is not happy. Then the film cuts back to her apartment. She is crying and is very embarrassed. The producer comes in and asks her to come with him to the romantic restaurant. The restaurant is called the Pussycat, which is an amazing name for a restaurant. They have a lot to drink and a lot on their mind. Then they go to dinner and she is really happy. However, the next day at work, the producer is not pleased and starts yelling at her. The scene ends with the producer's car being broken into and she gets thrown out. She has to go back to work. The next day, she comes home and finds a note left for her at the office. It is a message from the manager of the Pittycat restaurant saying, "If you come to work tomorrow, we will not allow you back in." She starts crying and thinking about what is going on. When it is all over, she goes to her car and starts thinking about the things she can't change. She can't even change the name of the restaurant. Then it hits her, she can change the situation. She just has to do something. The ending of the film is a bit abrupt, but it's great. This movie has a very strong message. The message
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) I know what you're thinking: "What's the big deal with that? He's just a bank robber. He doesn't need a cool gun to scare people." No he doesn't! I'm a huge fan of John McClane and I thought this was a great action flick. The movie's got a lot of great action scenes and this was one of them. The movie has a very unique and fun atmosphere. The whole movie feels like an action movie and it doesn't feel like you're watching a generic thriller. I was surprised at how good the special effects were. As the movie goes on I was amazed at the tension and tension building up in the movie. My only complaint about the movie was the ending. The last third of the movie I thought was a bit confusing and didn't feel very satisfying. Overall a great movie. Definitely recommended for fans of the John McClanes of today.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  I have watched this movie at least 4 times and it is still a favorite of mine.   The movie starts out very slow, but you can see the plot quickly. It starts off with a few characters from a previous movie coming back to do a little "business" with a local town. They decide to take some "soul gems" to the local shrine to bring back some "good luck" (the gem is in fact a diamond, which is also very precious in this movie, but it seems a bit of a stretch that they are taking such a thing). However, there is a problem. The locals believe these gems have special powers. They start a war to kill the gems. They have a large number of the gems, but the gem of the dragon is still with them. This leads to an interesting scene where they try to take the gem. The stone comes flying through the air and strikes a farmer, who falls off a building. The gem then flies right through a window of a house. The villagers rush to the window and grab hold of the gem to bring it back. However, it has taken one of their sons with it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The Man Who Knew Infinity (2017) Movie Rank - 4/5 4/  After seeing a trailer and being enthralled with the idea of an original story told from the perspective of a superhero, I had high expectations for this film. The cast was good, the director was solid, and the story was original. The only problem was that it didn't live up to my expectations. The story was good at first, but it got boring quickly. There were a lot of different things going on and the characters were pretty one-dimensional. They didn't seem to be given enough development to make them believable. The ending was also pretty lame and the ending felt a bit forced. This was a disappointing film overall. 4/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I had the great good fortune to see this movie a week ago at the Toronto Film Festival. It was one of my favourite movies of the year. I thought that the director, Alex Proyas, did a good job in this movie, and he was great in the film. This movie is based on the book of the same name by Mark Danielewski, who is the director of the movie, the book is a real masterpiece, it is a wonderful story about the life of a writer, William Faulkner. It is about his times when he was writing about the Great Depression, and then he lived through the time of the McCarthy and the rise of the Nazis. It tells how his wife and her lover were taken to a concentration camp, and it shows how they escaped and fought the Nazis in the end, and how they were taken in a prison in Germany and how he and his wife made a deal to leave Germany. It's a very interesting movie, because it tells us how a person's life can change from one day to the next, and this is how the movie was made. This was a great movie. It had a great story, and a great director. I loved it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story. I really enjoyed it. ______________________________ Read full review

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is a really good movie.  It is not perfect, but it is a very good movie that is well made.    It is hard to review this movie as I just saw it and there was no one around.  I was looking forward to seeing the movie and was ready to go to the theater to see it.  This movie is good.  The story is about a young girl named Marla (Marisa Tomei) who is being chased by a gang of men that are robbing her and killing her dog.  When she is found and saved by a man, she agrees to become his wife.  Marla has to deal with the people who don't like her and the men who are trying to kill her.  It is a well made movie and I like it a lot.  I think it is good for kids because it shows the dangers of the people that surround you and you don't know what to expect.  At the end of the movie, you will see a beautiful ending.  There is also a short film about Marla and her dog and it is also very good.

It is hard to understand what was happening when you don't have a clue what is going on. It has a nice story to it. I was able to find out what was really going on in the movie. There is a bit of a mystery to the story so that people can enjoy it without having to know everything about it. The characters were good and the plot was interesting. I found it interesting that the characters had their own back story to the plot. I thought the ending was interesting but there are many mysteries to be solved. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think the film is a good one for anyone who wants a nice movie to watch and it is good for kids to watch too. I highly recommend this film for anyone to watch. I would give it a 5 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The film's main point was to expose the American media and American political system for what they are — a bunch of hypocritical fools, who use lies and manipulations to sell the public an idea that is contrary to all reality. The film showed that America is a country that has lost its moral compass and is now a nation where the rule of money and power rules the day. "The movie was about a young boy who was born with the ability to change his own fate, but he was forced to hide that talent for fear of being humiliated or beaten up by others. It was a film about a little boy who had the ability and the courage to change the world. In that way he was a symbol of all the children who are born with their own destiny to change their destiny. The only way we are going to change our destiny is by creating a society where we are free to choose our destiny, a society in which we choose the quality of our lives. "As the film progressed we saw how the government was taking advantage of this boy and his mother. His mother had given birth to him with the promise that he would never be separated from her. Her words were: 'I want to be with him until he is twenty.' That was the promise he gave his mother and then she took him out of her arms and threw him on the streets. She wanted to take him to a good home. She was never going to let him be separated by anyone. He was an innocent child. She had no right to take the child away from his mother because she was only his mother."  -Director John Sayles on The Boy Who Loved Too Much  The following is a partial list of the many reasons that make a good film:  It doesn't have to be a long film. It's easy to make a short film. You can even do it on the cheap.

The story line was good, the characters were all likable, the story was told well, and the ending was just right. The best part was that it was all done in one film. The special effects were good, and even though I know that they are CGI, they looked realistic. The acting was good. I don't know if you can tell, but the movie had a very happy ending. I think that it is the first movie I have ever seen where the main character got a present from a boy in the movie.

"It's about a man, who, having lost his job in a financial crisis, returns to his hometown, to a very old family, and a very dear old friend who, as you might guess, has a lot of secrets. But this is not a typical comedy, and the movie will leave you wondering what is really going on. The plot twists, which make you question the reason for the protagonist's actions, make this a must-see movie, which will keep you guessing for a long time." (A.M.E.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   It's good to see a film from the 70s that doesn't feature a black dude in a white guy's movie. It's refreshing to see an African-American character in a movie that isn't a stereotypical one. It makes the film more realistic. And it's great to see the classic 'Rocky' movie that the producers and writers of the 70's made, in which they did a wonderful job.   This film was made for the black people of the United States. If they could've seen this movie, they would have been able to get over the racial tension that was prevalent during the time. The movie also features a great female role, as she helps Rocky. The role of the female character is amazing. I always admired her and she was a beautiful woman. She had a lot of charisma and she showed her acting skills. It was also great to know that this movie wasn't a straight-to-video. It had a real life feel to it.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* ************* ******** ******** I enjoyed this movie a lot. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. The movie had some good scenes, but overall the movie was really bad. The plot was about two friends who decided to go on a road trip and one of them dies. The second friend is going to take her place, but has to pay for the funeral. The whole movie was a comedy. It was really funny. It made you laugh so much that you would want to do it again. The first movie had a good plot and the ending was awesome. This movie had almost the same plot, but didn't have a great ending. It wasn't as funny. There was one scene that was really nice. The ending was good but I don't think it was as good as the first movie. The only other thing I did not like about this movie was the acting. The guy was not very good at acting. I thought he was a bit overacting. I wish he had just stayed silent all the time. I also wish that he had gotten some help. Overall, this was a good film. The best part was the good acting. Overall: *********************** ********** ******** ***** ************************ This movie has great acting and the story was great. It had a great plot and a really good ending. This was a great movie for a funny time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I've seen a few good movies in my life. But this is the only movie that I saw that had a great ending. I never really liked movies that ended with the hero going back to the future and seeing the same events that happened. It was boring and never really felt like a real movie. But The Last Stand does a great job of showing how this war could have been prevented if they had listened to the generals. The movie shows how these generals made this war even worse than it already was. They were too optimistic and not focused on the true threat that was on the horizon. I thought that it would be better if they were more realistic about the threat and how they would deal with it. The last battle is the most amazing one I've ever seen. It's so epic and the ending is so dramatic.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  (This review is from: The Crow (1999))  The Crow was a good flick, and I think it was a pretty decent film. The acting was great. The movie was well made, and it had a lot of action. The story was interesting and interesting, and the characters were well designed. I liked the ending. The Crow was not a good action movie. It was more like a horror movie. The whole story was about a serial killer that was doing the same thing over and over again. I think that was the best part about it. It had some very dark themes about human nature, and some good ideas about crime and justice. This was the first time that I really enjoyed a John Carpenter movie, and this one was my favorite.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A lot of things about movies have to do with who the actors are, and this one has a bunch of very talented people in it. The acting is top notch, especially the lead, and the way the characters are written is very well done. The only thing that can be criticized is the ending, which is a bit abrupt. I have seen better movies than this, and I have read a lot of reviews about it, so I think that the reviews are probably overblown. It is still an excellent movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The only reason this movie is better than the other "Wedding Crashers" movies is because this movie has a plot. The plot of this movie makes you laugh at the wrong times and is so good that you don't want to leave it. It has one of the funniest scenes when the cop yells at the guy to "Get the hell out of here" and the guy replies "If you don' t get the hell off the street, I'll kill you." The other scenes are also good but the movie is really good in the first act. The movie is based on a true story about two young boys who were kidnapped from a playground. The boys were raped and murdered and their bodies were dumped in a swamp. The film takes place in 1980 in Atlanta and is about a local police detective who is assigned to the case. The only character in the movie I didn't like was the kid's brother. The kids are played by Kevin Bacon and Steve Buscemi. The acting is good and the movie looks good. It is hard to make a good comedy. This movie should have had a lot of success. It had the right mix of comedy and horror. The ending is great and the film had a good cast. I would recommend this movie to everyone who liked "Walking Tall" and "Scream." It is worth watching if you like movies about kids and are a fan of Kevin Bacon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   (3/5) A great film, but I think it's too long. It was over 40 minutes long.   This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the look of the film. It's not a "tribute" film.   the film is about a group of men who are trying to become the best in the world. The movie is not about a bunch of dumb guys hanging out. It is about the true story of a group called the "American Circus". They were a group that was created to train men in the circus. They did a show in New York in the early 1900's. It has a very unique look.   in the movie the group was called the American Circus. the main star of the show was the "Lion King" himself, "Lions" Roy Hamilton.   "The Lion King" is a great movie. It had a very old school feel to it. There were some amazing songs that were played at the show. The songs were great, and the performance of the actors was outstanding. The acting was done by an ensemble cast. The best thing about the movie is the music. It plays in the background, and makes the movie. The music is really unique. I wish it was in the film, it really enhances the movie a lot. I can't get over how great the music is. It makes the film a whole lot better.   it was one of the last movies made for the big screen in the 50's. the movie was made for a small budget. the production was amazing. I don't know what was used to make the movie look so old, but it was incredible.  .     I'm sorry I didn't give this a higher rating. It just wasn't my favorite of the big-screen circus movies. The performances of the cast were really great. It really is a good film, if you like the old-school circus type movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ If you like movies, or if you're a fan of horror movies, then this is a must see! I have seen a few movies on DVD, but nothing was like this. It's got a very different feel to it. The movie is really creepy and scary, as if it's a really bad movie that was made to scare the hell out of people. This movie is not to be watched by the faint of heart. I highly recommend this movie for all those that want to see a real scary movie. This is a movie for the whole family to watch, if you like scary movies and you have never seen a real spooky one before. I love the music too. If you're looking for a real real scary experience, this is the movie for you. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  The movie is very good, but i'm not sure what it's about, i think it was a TV show, i remember it being on at some point, it was on tv for a long time, but it was too long for me to remember, the only thing i remember is that the actors were all young and had to act like idiots. __________________

This film is about life and how people have to deal with life. It isn't always easy. It doesn't always work out. But at the end of the day, we all know there's a reason why we are here.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________  I have a soft spot for movies that are good. It takes a lot to keep me away from a good film, but there are a few that make me sit back and admire the craftsmanship. The film has a lot going for it. It has a great cast, a great story, and a great soundtrack. The acting is fantastic throughout the film, and the screenplay is great. There are a lot of great twists, turns, and plot developments. However, there are some things that are a bit odd about the film. First, there is the ending. The ending is a bit off, but it is understandable. This film was directed by a woman and written by a man. So, a lot could be forgiven, and some may find it an enjoyable film. However there are moments that are just a bit too much. There is a scene in the movie that has the main character and a bunch of other characters talking. They are talking about the movie and how great it is. At the end of the conversation, the main characters are shown dancing and holding hands. At first, I was a bit put off by this scene, but after a few moments, I realized it was very appropriate. The main character is going through a lot and he is still having a great time. This scene was great because it showed that even though he is having a hard time, he is enjoying it. The other characters are also having fun, and so is the main plot. However at the end, there was a sudden ending. It seemed to be more out of necessity than anything else. There were only a few scenes that ended in a cliffhanger, and this was the only one that had a big shock. This was probably just a mistake on the director's part, and it really does not affect the film too much in my opinion. I did not find this movie to be bad, and I really liked it. I just wish it had been more like it could have been. I guess this is a film that people should not judge too harshly, because it is not bad. It just could have done a little more.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I've never heard of this movie until a couple weeks ago when my friends told me they had seen it and were really impressed by it. It's a really good movie and it's pretty good to see how a film about a guy named Richard Nixon that became president became a cult movie and how the world changed after the movie was released. I just finished watching it and I can't recommend it enough. The movie tells the story of a group of college students that all of a sudden decide to do some serious partying after their graduation and it seems that they were all in on the conspiracy too. It has a really great soundtrack that is very well done and they all have good chemistry together. I enjoyed this movie very much and I recommend it to anyone that has seen the film and wants to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  "I'm a sucker for a good action movie, and this is the first one of this type I've seen." – Steve Kamb  Directed by: Paul Verhoeven  Written by: Roger Ebert  Stars: Patrick Swayze, Michael Ironside, Richard Gere, Gary Busey, Richard Kiel  Release Date: 10/20/1984  Why you should see it: It's easy to forget that a lot of movies were made in the '80s that we have no idea about – the only exception is this one. A lot of it is very hard to understand and it's a lot better than most people give it credit for. The special effects are pretty good and the plot is interesting enough. The cast are all great – a lot like you would expect from a Roger Corman film.  Did you know: This was the last movie that Verhoeve directed and he directed it in a hurry – he left his own wife, Jennifer, at home and left the rest of the cast to do their own thing. , the actor who played "The Bad Guy," was a stuntman in this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   My wife and I first saw The Last Samurai in a small theater with a low-quality projector, in the summer of 1976. It was one of those summer movies that just about anyone in the audience could have seen, and it was good enough to make it into the box-office top ten. It is a good picture. The film is not really about the war, but is more about a Japanese-American family who are forced to leave their hometown for a small farm in the countryside. There is an important story here, but it is told as a tragic story about family, and the movie does a good job of depicting that. The main actor is Gary Cooper, who was in a lot of other good movies in the late 40s and 50s. The best performance is by Clark Gable as the war veteran who is forced to live a life away from his home, and who is always trying to find a way to make his family home back again.   I have never seen a movie like this, with so many characters that are interesting and interesting to talk to, and to know a little bit about. The movie is set in the mid-fifties, when it seems that the world had been destroyed, and people were trying to make a living. But in some ways the world is still there. In the film, the only time it seems as though there was a good economy was when the Gable family are trying to live in the farm they have grown up on. And then the movie suddenly changes into an action movie. There are two Japanese men who come to this farm, and they are trying for a few years to make their family home. They have an accident on the way to their house, and when they return, the police come and they have to go back to Japan. In a few weeks they are back, and there is a different plot than in the previous movie. They are trying again to make the farm home again, and this time they are successful.   is a movie that has a lot to say about family and friendship. It has the most important relationship in the film. The story is not about the conflict of the war between the United States and Japan, but about the friendship between the Gables, and of the people in the town. It shows that a small town can have a very good life, and that it can go through very hard times, and still be very close.   for me, the best

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My wife and I went to see "The Lion King" the night it opened at the Palace Theatre in Los Angeles. We arrived around 8:15 p.m. and saw a good showing. Our seats were right in front of the stage, where the animals were being staged. We could clearly see the animals in the background as they performed their routines, so we could not miss them. They were a little more "dramatic" than we were used to, but the performance was very impressive. The show lasted about 30 minutes, and was fairly long. The first 30 minutes of the show were mostly a montage of different animals performing different parts of the routine. After that, we were given our choice of a performance from each of the animals. This was a little confusing. When we were asked if we wanted to see the lion, we asked for "The Little Rascals", and they said no, we wanted "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" instead. The "The Littles" were in the middle of a very exciting routine, and I wanted to experience that myself. So we left the show, and we were not able to get tickets to go back for the show. We found out about this at the theatre, but we didn't realize that we had to leave to get seats for the other show. It was very frustrating, but there is a way to get a refund if you don't want to see it. It took us over an hour to find a new seat. But the show was good. There were so many amazing animals, and a great musical score. It is definitely worth a watch. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves animals, even if you are not a fan of the Disney films. The Lion King was a wonderful movie.  Rated 4 out of 5 by LJ_V from Great to watch! Great to see. The lion king is the first Disney movie that I can honestly say I love. I also find it very entertaining. I think the story of this movie is really well told and it does it's job well. The acting is great and the story is fantastic. The characters are so well developed. The music is amazing as well. If you are a fan or a person who likes to see animals in movies, then this movie will have you laughing, cheering and crying. It will also make you want to know more about the animals and their stories. It's not just a story about

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The Black List _________ A must see! The Blacklist is a series of suspense novels that have appeared in the late 1990's and early 2000's. The series centers on the efforts of a special ops team to track down a Russian terrorist, Ivan Vazov, who has been targeting and assassinating the heads of major corporations in the United States. These assassinations have caused major corporations to go into lockdown and leave many of their executives and employees in hiding. The team consists of: Jim Burke, a retired FBI agent who now works as a private investigator, with the support of his ex-wife, Susan; his ex wife, Kate; and his best friend, John Reid, who is now an FBI agent himself;  Richard Armitage, a former KGB agent who is the head of a private security firm in New York, and who is currently trying to bring down Vazovsky;  in the third season, a female Russian hacker who is recruited by Vazova, a Russian hacker with the ability to access any computer system; . The show is very well written and has a high production value. The acting is good. There are no weak links in this series and the cast are great. This series is also very enjoyable. It will have you wanting to go back to watch it every year. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of crime/thriller novels and would like to try their hand at writing one. It has a great cast of characters and a great story. I would recommend this to any fan of television. It's hard to get a grip on all the episodes. But that is just how the series is set up. The producers were great about answering my questions. They always provided a new episode that I could watch whenever I wanted. This was a great show. _____________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  This is a pretty good movie. It is a little slow, but not a whole lot of wasted time. It starts off very strong, but as the movie goes on, it gets progressively less interesting. It does a good job of setting up some good action scenes and giving us a lot of information about the people involved in the story. There is a lot going on here, so I recommend you go see it. But if you are just a casual fan, this is not going to be your favorite movie. I really liked it, though. I don't know what I was expecting, and I don´t really care. I would have preferred a little more action, but it was good. I think I will enjoy the sequels, and maybe see this one again sometime. I liked it and I really enjoyed it. It had a lot more going on than I expected, and it gave me a lot to think about. I do recommend it to anyone who likes good action movies, but I do feel it is a bit too slow and kind of boring to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I have a feeling we're not going to be friends  - A man, a woman and a dog   My mom bought me this movie at the age of 5 or 6. She'd put me in a dark theater, where the movie was so dark I couldn't see a thing. I'm not sure if I saw it on a tv, but I can still remember the opening credits of the movie and the first half. It wasn't until later that I figured out the movie wasn't about a dog that ran off and got lost. The film actually was about a woman who got lost and ended up in a very dark and dreary forest, with no means of getting out. She saw a man and a woman, the woman was an attractive, but kind and gentle woman who was looking for her dog. She didn't realize that her dog was also missing, and she became trapped. She ran into a cave, where she was reunited with her dog, who was also a man. The dog then led her to a man who lived there, and they ended up having a nice relationship. That's pretty much what the movie ended up being.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ _______________________________________________________  I saw this movie last night and I was so confused. I knew it was going to be a horror movie and that the girl was going in for a belly dance, but I was also expecting something out of a horror film. And then I realized I was thinking of the movie "Friday the 13th". I think I was expecting a little more blood and gore. I don't know why. It was still scary, just not as scary as a horror/thriller should be. I think the movie could have been made a little better. I felt like they could have done more to help the movie along. But if you're in the mood for a good laugh, a good time and some good gore, then this is for you. I just wish it had a little bit more depth to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  I saw this at the movies, and the ending was quite unexpected. It was a real shock to the system. The action scenes are amazing and you will be impressed by the stunt work. The acting was good. I don't like when the actors can't tell when someone is in a fight, so I always look for some hints. The main character is good. The other characters were interesting. I didn't understand everything that was happening, but I felt it was well done. There was some violence, and some graphic content. There were a few good jokes, but most of the movie was just violence and sex. I found it to be somewhat of a disappointment. I thought it would be a bit better, but it just didn't do it for me. ********  So the film has an ending that is pretty surprising. Not as shocking as the ending to The Departed, but the end was quite a shock. This movie was an action film, and not a thriller. The story was about a guy who gets hired by a mob boss to kill a man. When the guy goes to the house, he finds that there is a lot of money there. But the guy finds out that the money belongs to a mobster's son who is about to be married. So he does a job for the mob boss's son, but then he finds out the whole thing was a set up by the mobster. The movie was pretty much a lot more action-oriented than it was a story. The only thing that kept it interesting was the sex scenes, and those were good. ************************

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ The best and worst thing about the movie was the performance of Sam Rockwell. He played a lot of different characters and we never really get a chance to really know who he is as a person. I am pretty sure that it was the scriptwriter who wrote the scenes with Rockwell and he made a great performance, but Rockwell was not the right person to play these parts. This is why I was so disappointed in Rockwell when I watched this movie. His character was so annoying and there was a lot that could have been done better with him. He was also kind of a dick for a few reasons and it was very annoying to watch. The best part about this movie was that we get to see Rockwell's other friends and the whole cast really did a great job with the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies that make fun of Hollywood.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ I saw this film in a movie theater, and I thought it was great! A great action film with a fantastic story and the best action in any movie, ever! I was able to get to the theaters right at midnight, so I only saw this movie in theaters and didn't have to wait. The action is great and you can feel every bullet being fired. The movie itself is really well made, with great special effects, and the story really gets interesting towards the end, where the story starts to get really crazy. If you are looking for a fun action film, this is the movie for you. I give this movie a great 8 out of 10 stars!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ My new favorite movie is The Dark Knight Rises. The best part of the movie is the fight scene between Bane and the GCPD. Bane is an awesome villain and is a great addition to the Batman franchise. The action is intense and intense is not the right word to use for the fights in this movie. The camera work is good and the effects are impressive. I love that Batman is not going to be in this one but he is going to appear in the sequel. Overall a great movie and a great watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ "There's a lot going on here. Not a lot of time to be doing anything. There's an old lady who has been in the hospital for three days. She's not going to make it. She has a little daughter who's going to have to live with this. And she's going crazy. She talks to herself, she gets up and she walks. She doesn't look like herself. It's just so sad." - from "I'll be There"  The film is based on a true story. A woman (Kathy Bates) had been suffering from depression and insomnia for the past 30 years. She was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer in 1978. She had a mastectomy and spent her last days in hospice. The film opens with a scene of a funeral for Kathy's daughter. The woman's daughter was in the audience. The daughter is sitting in the front row in the chapel and she is crying uncontrollably. The scene ends with Kathy and the daughter hugging each other. They are then seen walking out of the funeral home. The next scene is of Kathy driving home from the funeral. She passes a house. A man walks out from the front door and opens fire on Kathy, shooting her twice in the back. She collapses into the driver's seat of her car. She gets out and calls for help. The driver (Linda Blair) is dead and the passengers are dead. Kathy crawls out of her wrecked car, bleeding heavily. She then drives home, and dies. Her last words to her daughter were "I will be there for you". This scene is very well done and sets the tone for the rest of the film. The movie is based off the true story of a young woman who took her own life. The young woman's name was Kathy Bates. The real Kathy Bates had been in a mental institution for the last year and a half. Her life had been hell. She took her life in a hotel room on Christmas Eve. The suicide note she left behind is a chilling document of her depression. The director, William Friedkin, made a very important point in this film. It was a suicide not an accident. The "accident" of the "accidental" murder was the stress and suffering of being a single mother and trying to raise a child. She did everything she could to cope with the pain. She never complained about her depression or insomnia. She tried to cope, and even took some

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Cocktail" is a film that is both enjoyable and educational.  It is a documentary of the 1980's that shows the downfall of the Cuban-American community in Miami.  the Cuban people in Miami have become so accustomed to Cuban life that they have become completely complacent about their poverty.  In 1980, a group of Cuban exiles decided to go back to Cuba.  They left everything behind that they owned and even threw a party at the home of one of the exiles.  This is a great documentary that shows all of the problems and the struggles that the Cuban immigrants had to face.  The Cuban exilates lived with no running water, no electricity and no food in Cuba. This was a struggle to survive in a country that does not have basic services like running water and electricity.  Even the Cuban exilers had to work because they had no money.  As for the Cuban Americans in Miami, they were always trying to make a name for themselves and they always made a mess.  It was an interesting look at life in the Cuban community in the 1980s.   This documentary is an interesting view on life in a society.  If you are interested in the topic, this is a must watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ __________ A long time ago I saw this movie at a friend's house. It was not the movie that I was looking for. However, I still enjoyed it a lot. The acting is really good. The plot is really cool. And the music and lyrics were great. I hope to see this movie again. __________________________________________________________ The last thing you will ever see a bad movie about is a dog. But in this movie a dog is so very important to the main characters. The dog is the heart of the movie and its just really sad that the director decided to kill the dog in the middle of the story. But that is what happened and this movie is really sad. ____________________________________________________________________________ The title of the film, A Good Dog, is a tribute to the last words of the dog, 'I am a good dog'. This movie is about the main character (I think he is a male) and the dog. The main character, Nick, is the only son of a couple. His wife died in the accident, but he didn't say anything about it. He didn't want anyone to feel sorry for him. After he married his girlfriend (and the main love interest of the main lead) (she is a girl who is a big fan of Nick and he is very jealous), Nick finds a dog in a dumpster. Nick is so sad about the dog and he says that he wants the dog to have a good life and that it is better for it to be a stray. So he takes it in a van and he goes to a pet store and they give him the dog for free. He gives it a name - Margo. Margo is the main star of the show. She is a stray dog who was adopted by a couple and has a good family. Her name is also a tribute, but it's not important for this movie. The story about the last days of the family is a sad one and I think that this movie really has a strong message about the real life problems. But at the end of the day, this movie has a really cool ending and this is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The King is Dead" is an excellent movie that deserves all the attention it gets. It is not only a great action movie but a movie that has something for everyone: The movie is about a small town in the Midwest which has been overrun by zombies, the mayor decides to call in the "Kings of Death", who are armed only with baseball bats and axes, the story is set in the 1940s and the movie is all about the two "Kings", both are played by John Malkovich and both have their own special personalities. I was really impressed with the performance by Malkovich as the movie begins with him getting very nervous about the upcoming fight. The movie then takes off and Malkovich is all alone on a train, he is talking with his girlfriend and his son and all he is thinking is "what am I doing? Why am I on this train? Who am I fighting? What is happening?" and then he sees a zombie and he is instantly nervous as the zombie takes a bite out of his hand, "what is this?" and he has a terrible feeling in his heart. Then the train takes off with the zombies chasing after it and Malkovitch is forced to fight off the zombies. The only problem with this movie is that the film has some slow moments that make the movie seem slow, but this film is worth watching just for the great action sequences and the great dialogue. This is a must watch film for all fans of John Malkovich.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________ The Dark Knight Rises, a.k.a. The Dark knight, the last of the Batman movies, was the one I was looking forward to the most in the year of 2012. Batman has been a part of our pop culture since the late sixties and his first appearance in 1939 made him a global icon. When he first appeared on the silver screen in 1966 he had been transformed into a comic book hero. The origin story was the best part of the film. It was told with a great sense of drama, action and suspense. I have always liked the idea of the Bat-suit that he wore in the movie. It really was an awesome way to make Batman a character that could be seen in any part of a film. I would say this was the movie that made me love the Batman character. In the movie we got to see the Batman as a man who would go to any lengths to fight crime. He had a sense of honor and courage that was very admirable. Bruce Wayne was an amazing role model and we all learned so much about the man and his character. Batman: The Dark City, a remake of the movie by Christopher Nolan, was a great movie. I really liked the fact that the movie made me feel that I was in Gotham. I liked how the city of Gotham was portrayed and the characters and their back story were amazing. This movie also had a great twist at the end. It had a real sense of humor and was a very enjoyable movie. The movie I loved the most was The Dark Night Rises. It seemed to have the best story and the best actors. It made me want to see what was going to happen. I am a big fan of the books and I love the movies. It is a pleasure to watch the two.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  ___________   It's not an uncommon thing for a film to make me question my sanity. I don't mean that in a negative way. What I mean is that this movie really made me question whether or not I'm capable of watching it. And if I am capable of seeing it, then what I'm seeing is not necessarily something I want to see. I didn't realize I could see a movie so emotionally manipulative as this. The way this film treats its audience is disgusting. When I was watching this I was left wanting more and more, but not wanting to see the end of it. That's why I was afraid to go back and watch it.  I really have a hard time believing that anyone could go through this process and not leave a sour taste in their mouth. This is one of those films that will make you question your own sanity.  and if I can't see it, what's the point?  This movie makes you feel like you're watching a really fucked up version of the American Pie franchise. There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this movie, but the one that sticks out in my mind is the ending.  of course, we have the main character, who goes through a mental breakdown while watching the movie. She tries to kill herself and gets arrested. The cop that is escorting her into jail is a total psycho. He makes her watch him masturbate to the scene in American Pie. He then tells her that she should kill herself so that she won't have to see what he's doing. This cop is so disturbed by the fact that the main protagonist is having a mental break down, that he even goes as far as to say, "What kind of a sick person is going to masturbate while watching someone kill themselves? You sick fuck." What this guy is doing is basically raping his victim. He's saying that he is so far removed from her that he doesn't even know what she's doing to herself. And yet, he is going so far as telling her that this will make her feel better. He tells her, "You need to kill yourself, and that's what you need to do." The point of all of this is that he wants her to kill her self and not have to be exposed to what he did.  (Read more on the disturbing aspects of the movie)  So now you know why this movie makes me question myself. I was going to give

They were all laughing and talking and it was great. My 4 year old was fascinated with all the little details in the movie and the 2 year old loved the dog. The 4 year and the 3 year old liked the different costumes and even a few of the toys. We all got a laugh out of it and I was even laughing at the end of the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  My first movie was a very good movie about a young man (played by Ben Affleck) who has the chance to go into space and be a space pilot. He gets the opportunity to be a part of an expedition into a small moon and has the opportunity of becoming a man. He is also given a space suit to wear, which he doesn't want to wear and he is told by a guy to put it on. He does so and they begin to have a conversation. It's really a nice little story. However, it does get very dark, and that is why I think the movie is so good. Ben Affleck is a very nice actor and is able to play a very interesting character, even though it's a very dark character. The movie does get a bit repetitive, but it's not bad at all. I think this movie is really good because of it's great story and also because it has great performances. This movie is a good addition to any space film collection, especially a Star Wars fan's collection. This was a great movie to see, because I haven't seen many space movies in a while.

I like the movies that show a man getting help from a friend or two and helping him become a man. That movie made me like that movie a lot.  The action scenes are great and are not boring or slow.    The action scenes that are shown are not too much, but the character development is good.  My favorite is the scene with the car chase scene where the cops try to arrest the bad guy, but he escapes.  In the end the bad guys get caught.  I like that the baddies are not always good, some of them are bad.  And I like how the movie shows us a good and bad guy at the same time.  This movie was a great one for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- What the hell. A decent movie, that I was bored of as I started to get the feeling that the author is not really interested in the story. What a waste of my time.   I enjoyed it as a little side project. The characters are a bit of a cliche, and I'm sure that the writers don't want to go too much in the direction of "Hollywood" style and the cliche. It was just the characters that I liked. I mean, the only character that stood out was the villain. But I have to admit that I couldn't help but like him a lot.  , but that's not the point. The point is that the writer is not interested in what the main character thinks. The author is interested in trying to make a villain into a hero. I would not mind to see a movie about this. The book is too long, and it's boring. It's a waste.     My rating: --------------  (I like to give a 3.5. But since I'm not sure about a 6.5, I have just given a 3)

This movie is about a great guy that lost his wife and children. He was very much in love with his family but in the end it all went wrong. He took his own life. This is a movie about a man and his journey. The story of the movie is a perfect one. This man was so depressed that he went out and committed suicide. I really like the way the movie ended. He felt that he was going to die, and he was. I felt this way myself when I saw this movie. This was one of my favorite movies of the year.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________  If you've seen The Godfather, you already know what this film is about. That's why I wasn't a fan of it when I saw it on a late-night screening in 1991. I thought that the story, which was really about the corruption of the family business, was too simplistic and a bit silly. I'm glad I didn't waste my time on this movie. The film was just about the Mob. If you want to watch a film about the mob, see Scarface, or The Godmother, which are much better films than this.  I have to admit, this is the best movie I've seen about the mafia in years. The acting is very good and it's so fun to see what the mob really looks like. It's like watching a cartoon made by a crazy mafia dad.  of 10 people found this review helpful

The movie is pretty much the same as the first one. And yes, the movie is a little bit slow but if you have a strong stomach you'll enjoy it. And no, the female characters in this movie are not all hot. But the story and the acting is so good that you'll never care. I mean, even the bad guy, who is in the movie for the wrong reasons, is a great character. And if you're looking for a good action movie, this is it. ***********

I'm a big fan of the old Batman serials and was really looking forward to seeing the new movie. This movie is great! This movie brings back a lot of memories of my childhood and is really fun to watch. The animation is pretty good. The Batman is funny and the special effects are great. The action scenes are awesome and the voice acting is great. I really like the way they kept the tone of the series and made it really different. I think this is a must see for all Batman fans. This is a great film and a great time was had by all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   A young boy, a bit of a bad boy, who lives in a city in a region far from his hometown, finds himself in the midst of a war, which is going to be fought between two groups, the army of the king of the South and the army led by the son of the former king of South, a boy named Zoltan.   The army of South is led by an old man named Zola. He is an expert in war, who, according to the king, was chosen by God himself, to lead his armies. Zola and his army have been fighting the rebels of South since the beginning of the war, and the rebels are led by a man named Seferis.   is one of the most beautiful films I have seen. It shows the human side of the wars, in a way that few movies ever managed. The acting was excellent, and all the characters were very well done.   the music was also very good, and it was one of my favorite songs of all time. The ending, was a beautiful way to end the film. I loved this movie, and I will be re-watching it many times in the years to come. I have also re-watched it on DVD many times, and still have not seen the rest of the movie. I am sure that if you have a few spare minutes, you will enjoy it as much as I did.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I was going to write a review for this movie because I loved the trailer. But the movie itself is not as good as the trailer, so I'll just go with a negative review. It doesn't really matter if it's bad, as long as it's not a waste of time. It's not. This is a very good action movie that you can watch anytime. The main story has a nice mixture of fighting, drama, and action. The villains are very evil and are very well-played. The story is very well thought out. I think that it's one of the best movie of the year.

I think it's very important that we know that she is the one who falls for him. That's a huge turning point.

The acting is horrible. It's like watching a movie from 20 years ago and the acting is bad. The action scenes are laughable. It starts out really well, but it becomes very tiresome pretty quickly. The script is terrible. I'm not a fan of the whole Nazi/Nazi stuff. It just doesn't seem right. It feels like it's just there for the sake of it.   I do love the concept of this movie though. There's a lot of Nazi stuff in it, but at the same time there's a good deal of action. The first half of the movie has a lot more action. It gets pretty cool in the second half. I was not too impressed by the final action scene though. It was a bit cheesy.   of course I can't give this movie a perfect score, but I do think it deserves a pass. It isn't the best movie, but for what it is it's a decent action movie. - June 26, 2013Not my cup  favorite favorite - May 3, 2013The good  and the bad  Thanks for the feedback!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "One of the greatest things about 'American Graffiti' is that it never seems to let up. It keeps on delivering on its promise of being the definitive '50s film noir.' The film is as fast as it is dirty, but the script is so tight and so funny that it always feels fresh."  - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times   "I love this film. I think it's one of the best and most original noirs ever made."  thelarry_says  "There's a real sense of uneasiness about this film: its tone, its characters, and its theme. It has a sense of humor that's always a joy, and it is a movie that never loses itself in a maze of self-contained scenes. It's a movie of suspense, and I think of it as a thriller of sorts. It isn't just the main characters that are at risk, but also their sense of reality and their sense that their own lives are going to be taken away. I can't recommend this film enough." .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Detail" is a very good movie with lots of action and suspense. The movie is about a cop who has to fight his way through the criminal underworld in order to bring down a gang of killers. The best part about this movie is the performances of James Caan and John Cazale. The story of the movie is very good. I can understand why it is rated as an R. The plot is very complicated and it can be hard to follow but you'll see what is going on. There are a lot of twists and turns that you won't see coming.  The last scene of the film is awesome. There is a lot going on in that last scene that will make you feel the tension. I loved the ending.    "The Last detail" is an enjoyable movie. The actors did a great job in portraying a complicated story.  This movie is a must see.  The movie also has great music in it. It is a movie that you can't wait to watch. I give it a 8/10.

Not only was it an interesting story but it was also the story of an orphaned girl (and a dog) who are taken in by a family of vampires. This is an excellent movie to show what a family is like and how a vampire is treated. I will definitely be watching this again and I hope this story will continue on. It was a good start to a new series of movies.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: tjr_uk
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good film with a lot of heart. The film is set in a small village in the north of Scotland, which has a reputation for being the place where witches go to die, or at least their ghosts come back from the dead. When a woman comes into town who claims to be the reincarnation of a witch, the local police and the local villagers are concerned for her safety. In fact, the town is in a state of panic when she comes and nobody seems to know who she is. There are plenty of scares, some good and some not so good. One of the good ones was a good sequence in which we see the ghost of the dead witch walking around in a graveyard, which really scares me every time. There's also a nice scene where the local girl tries to tell her parents about her new friend. When the parents try to tell the girl about the witch, she starts to laugh at them, but the parents are actually terrified by her. The movie was shot in the autumn, which gave it a nice autumnal feel. I've seen a lot worse films, but this one is one of the better ones. The movie had its ups and downs. I found it a little slow and I was a little confused by the ending. The final part was a bit confusing and the ending left me feeling a bit confused. If you want to know more about this movie, I recommend reading the original article by The Scotsman.

It is not about any one person in particular. It just about the wild life of a group of people who live a life of outlawry. It does not take itself too seriously and the acting is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ If you've seen the movie, you know that it's one of the best movies of all time. The film takes place in a world where we know little about it, and we are drawn in by its strange and intriguing world. The movie is based on a novel by James S. A. Corey, and the movie is really good. The story is pretty simple. We follow two protagonists, one a boy, and one a girl. The boy is in a coma and is slowly waking up. When he wakes up, he finds out that he's not in a good place in the world, and it's up to him to save his friends. He doesn't want to go back to his parents, and he wants to be a superhero. So he joins the school's team of super heroes, and they help him save the world. I have to say, the characters in this movie were really great. I really liked the two main protagonists. The boys personality and the girl's personality are very different, but they work together very well. The villain was a very evil and menacing villain, and I really enjoyed the fight scene. I loved the fight scenes in this film, and there were many of them. I've seen a lot of action movies in my life, and this one was probably the best. It was just very exciting, and every time the main character got hit by an enemy, it was always awesome. The villains in this movies are all very different from each other, but all of them were very fun to fight against. There's one character in the movie that I just don't like. It's a girl, and she always gets in the way of the main characters and always makes the movie drag on. She doesn't really add anything to the story, and really makes the whole movie not as great. She also has a really annoying voice that is really annoying. It always gets on my nerves. Another thing that I really dislike about this movie is that the villains in it are all bad guys. I don't really like that. I like good guys, and not all of the villains are good guys. The bad guys are just a bunch of crazy people. They all seem like really bad people, but that's just me being negative. I just hate when there are bad guys in a movie, it just seems very unnatural and not in character for the main protagonist. All in all, I really recommend this movie to everyone who loves action movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   - I was a bit disappointed that they did not give a second chance to any of the "main" characters. The "main characters" that they do have are so completely different from one another, that it was just hard to like them. They are all such "fluffy" characters, and the way they are all "killed" and "reincarnated" was just annoying.   The movie also had some really good effects and special effects, but it's just hard for me to believe that a "movie" of this quality could have cost as much as it did.  , I'm a big fan of the show, and I enjoyed the movie. I just wish they had spent more time with the "old-timers" like Sam, Kevin, and even the kids, and maybe even some of the old school villains like the "bastard" and the "pussycat" that we saw in the original series. It would have been much better if they had at least told us more about them. ___________________________________________  - The "Buster" character was really annoying. He was the main bad guy in the movie, and yet he was the only one who really had any character development. The only thing that I really liked about him was that he always seemed to be the smartest one out of everyone, and he always made some clever comment when something was going wrong. I don't know what the deal was with this character, but he was just way too much of a "one-note" character. ____________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The worst thing about The Shining is how it has been oversold by critics. It is a film that is as complex as it is flawed, and it has a strong presence on the history of horror films.  In the film's case, the horror elements are so well done and so well-integrated with the action that they make the film a very good horror movie. The Shining, despite its flaws, is still a good film. It's not a great film, and I wouldn't call it a great horror film, but it's a good one. The fact that Stanley Kubrick has made such a successful horror film is impressive. The film is well-made and the story is well constructed, and the performances are very good. But what makes the film so great is the combination of the horror and the horror scenes. Kubrick combines the two in such a way that the movie is scary but also makes you feel like you're there, watching the film. I really think that this is the most effective way to do a horror film. , which is the book on which the film is based on, is the work of Jack Clayton, a writer-director who was born in New York City and spent most of his childhood there. After college, Clayton moved to Los Angeles to work in television. It was here that he wrote and directed the short film The Nightmare, which is considered a seminal short horror film in the genre. His work was short-lived, however, and he had no intention of returning to it for years. The Nightmare was released in 1979, shortly after Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which was the book the film was based on. This is the first film that Kubrick made after The Shining. It was written by Clayton, who was working on a sequel to the short, which was based in part on his own experiences in the film industry. Clayton's film was called. It wasn't an easy task to adapt the book, and Kubrick had many ideas about how the story should be told. Clayton also wrote a novel, which he was trying to adapt into a film, which would have been called. This was a very different type of horror film than the one that Kubrick had already made. It had a much more traditional horror feel to it, and was a much darker film. Although the story was darker, it still managed to be scary. Kubrick liked the idea of a horror story set in the past, and wanted to make a film based on
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________   This movie was great. It was a great action movie, it had a great plot and it had great characters. The ending of the movie was really great and was a good surprise. The movie is really about a father and son team. The father was a cop and the son was a drug dealer. They were both doing their job. The dad was on a mission to stop a guy who was selling meth. This guy has a big crew of people with him and is a very dangerous man. The whole movie was about the dad and the drug dealer going after the guy. The drug dealer had a crew of body guards and some other people. The gang of people that were with the drug dealers were all gang bangers and the cops and the father was all about stopping them. The cop is on a search and rescue mission. It is a police movie. The police and the family are all together in this movie. I liked the movie a lot. I loved it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  It's the third part of the series, and the second part that I enjoyed a lot. It's very well done, and it feels like it was made just for me, so there's a lot of scenes in which I couldn't get the story out of my head. I think it was the perfect amount of time, because it doesn't feel rushed. I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing. I am enjoying this movie very much, and I can see it being a good sequel.   As for the plot, it's a good twist of the story. This part deals with a big problem, and they solve it, but the real issue is never addressed. This is a very interesting problem, because the problem is what makes people act the way they do. It might not be the best plot, but it's still an interesting one, and there's plenty of interesting things that happen during the movie.   the movie takes place in a town where there's something wrong with the town. The main character, who is a scientist, goes to investigate, and finds a strange creature. He calls his friend, who's a priest, and he tells him about it. His friend thinks it's an omen, but his friend doesn't want to believe in omen and goes to talk to his boss, who says that the omen might not actually be a sign, but that the town is being controlled by some alien entity. He doesn't know what the entity is, but says that it's probably a powerful alien being, and that they're trying to control the town to get at some technology.   is a movie that I recommend to people who have never seen it before. It takes you to a weird place, and you might find yourself thinking of things that are interesting, but you'll probably never know what it is. It was very interesting to see a movie like this, because I've never seen anything like it before in my life. If you like the alien genre, and want something different from the typical horror movies, I would recommend this movie to you. If this movie is something that you don't like, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie.

I am a very large man, and I think this movie could have been filmed for me, but it was directed for a very small man. I always thought that a movie about a very big man could have taken place in a very tiny room. I loved the way he acted. He was so good at what he did. He did not try to play the part as he played it. It was just a small part. There was so much to him, and he was just the right size for it." - James F.  I really liked this movie! It was very entertaining and had a very good plot. It had a great cast. The music and the scenes with Tom Cruise and the young girls were so very funny. I really liked that they used the movie as a way to promote the movie in other countries. The scenes with the women and their reactions to Cruise was funny. It would have been even funnier if he had had to have sex with the girls. They made the movie about his character and not about the girl in the movie. It is a very enjoyable movie. The ending was really well done and made me laugh. - Anonymous  In a movie where everyone looks like they are in a dream or in a movie. the people look real. - Christopher  A Star Is Born is one of the best movies I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Jedi  was a good Star Wars movie. I can't wait for the second part. The new characters were well used, and the action was exciting and satisfying. I enjoyed seeing Luke again. This film is an improvement over the first Star Wars, but it still has its flaws. I think the ending was rushed, and that the film could have been made even better by focusing on the characters rather than focusing on a plot that will never be resolved. The movie was a fun watch, and I look forward to seeing the second film. A very good movie. The action is very good. I loved the music, and watching it again it's easy to see why it was so successful. 4 out of 5 stars Good movie but not great. A good movie that I'd recommend. The cast did a great job with this movie. My wife and I loved it and I think a lot of people will enjoy it too. I would give it a 5 if it weren't for a few flaws. The film is pretty fast paced. There is a lot happening. There are a lot more characters and more action than you would normally get in a Star Wars film. That is okay though. There isn't anything particularly good about the action in this movie but that's just a little nitpick. The main problem with this film is that it is very inconsistent. The good and the bad, the funny and the serious, the action and the character development all do a great disservice to this film. I have heard some great things about it and some bad things about the movie but for me it is hard to get too mad about a movie like this. The story is very basic and there isn't really much to the story. There aren't any complex plots or characters in this film so the plot and characters feel a little thin. The only thing that is a bit good is the music. The soundtrack is really great and the movie is full of great music. All in all, this is a good film, but not a great one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My boyfriend and I were going to see this movie together and decided to do a double-feature. The first film is a little slow paced but the second film has a much more exciting and action-packed climax. The two films are very different but both excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about the French Foreign Legion in the 50s and 60s.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My rating for this movie: ***** ***** __________________ I saw this movie in theaters and thought it was a pretty good movie. It is a very interesting and unique movie, as it is based on the real life case of a man who shot his wife to death and his friends who tried to cover it up. The movie was good, and I recommend it to people who like a good mystery. If you are a big fan of Hitchcock or a Hitchcock fan, this movie is a must see. The film itself was very good, as I thought the acting was good and the plot was interesting. ____________________ I have seen this movie many times in theaters but the last time I saw it at a theater, it was not very good. I thought that the plot didn't make sense and the actors did not have the same chemistry they had when they were together in the movie. The scene with the woman who was murdered and the man who tried covering it up was pretty terrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think anyone would have expected a movie this good to come out in the 80's. The story is about an Indian man and a German woman, and they have a son. The father has been dead for a few months, and the German woman thinks that the boy is her own. She's not sure, and her son has a difficult time in school. After the German mother dies, the boy goes with her to Germany, and has a life there. This is a story about what is inside a mother's heart, and it is well done.  The music is wonderful.      The best part of the movie is when they get back to India.  My son was in this movie when he was about 2 years old.  I've seen it several times and loved it.  When my son was a child, I went with my parents to the movie theater in town.  My parents were not familiar with this movie, and thought it was about a man who lost his family, and was trying to find them.  The movie was much more about a mother who is trying to be a good mother.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband and I went to see The Hateful Eight this past weekend.  The movie was a great movie and my husband really enjoyed it.    It was a very tense movie with great acting and great acting that we all enjoyed.  We had a great time at the movie and we really enjoyed our time at a theater.  My husband has seen many films in the past few years and this was the first time that we both enjoyed a movie so much that we couldn't stop watching it. The Haughty Eight  is about the outlaw who is a bounty hunter, but is a very cruel and violent person.  He doesn't care for anything except the bounty, he loves killing and he has no morals.  The story was told in a slow way and we knew what was going to happen when it happened.  Our only problem was that it took a while for the story to be told.  A movie is only as good as the actors and the characters are the best part of the movie.  So, the actors were great and I thought they really brought out the characters and their feelings.  This was a fun movie that I would definitely go to again.  It is a great old movie that we should see again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** ********** ************** ************************* ******************************* ****************** **** ************* *********  I like this movie.  -It has a great ending.  "What the hell was he thinking, anyway?" I always thought that when someone was driving and going to kill someone, the person driving would think, "Wow, I really messed up" instead of "I really screwed up." I like that it shows us the person who is driving the getaway car. This person has his own reasons and reasons for driving. He is a cop, so he's a good guy, and he has no idea what he's doing. He's trying to protect a friend, but he gets caught up in it all. He thinks he's going to die in the wreck, and then he realizes that this is a great opportunity to take a shot at some bad guys. It's a great scene. The scene is so well acted and so well written that I really don't know why it doesn't have more. I mean, it's got great actors, good writing, and a great story. It is very well-written. I think that the best writing is done by the guy who writes the script. I liked it. I thought it was a good story, and I liked the movie. I liked how it was not really an action movie. It was more like a drama. The movie didn't feel like an action film. It felt like a film about a cop. It wasn't a crime film, and it didn't have a lot of gunplay. It had a lot more humor. I'm glad that the movie got made, and that it got made on a budget. If it was made on $3 million, I'm sure that it would have been a big disappointment. What a great movie. Great acting, great writing, great direction, great effects, and just a great time to be a fan of this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really excited to see this movie and was really hoping for a good script and a great movie. I was disappointed because of the movie. There were a lot of scenes where the actors did not look the same or were not believable. The actors in the movie were not good at all. This movie was made to make money and make the movie seem real.  This movie should be made by a studio and then directed by a good director and the movie could have been good. It should have been made by an unknown director and then produced by a big studio.    My rating:   1/5

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  is an interesting film about a group of people who travel to the city of Las Vegas to celebrate the 60th birthday of a millionaire. In order to get the money, the group tries to take advantage of the other people in Las Vegas. One of the people in the group is a man named Bruce Willis. One night, the man falls into a hole and is almost killed. Luckily, a group called "The Special Forces" saves the man and brings him to a doctor. When the doctor tells Bruce that he has a rare illness and that the doctor won't see him for a while, Bruce decides to travel to another city to get a cure.  When Bruce leaves Las Vegas, he goes to a desert and meets a boy named John Rambo. When Rambo asks Bruce why he went to Las Vegas and what was the purpose of his trip, Bruce says that he is a mercenary and that he wants to earn some money.  a movie made by Steven Spielberg. This movie is about a Vietnam War veteran named John McClane who is sent to an isolated island to capture a man who has kidnapped a girl. The movie takes place in the Vietnam war in 1968. Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman are two of the best characters in this movie. The story is great. It is a thriller. The main thing that I liked about this movie is that it was set in Vietnam. The first thing that stands out in this is that the main character is a Vietnam veteran. The other thing that is great about this is the way the movie was shot. The people were wearing sunglasses to make it seem like they are in a jungle or something. The way they are shooting the movie is amazing.

I enjoyed this film. I didn't love it. It's an interesting concept, but I don't think it's executed well. I found myself not liking the main character (who is not a bad guy, but certainly not a good guy), but I still really enjoyed the main antagonist. The cinematography is interesting, and the story, though a bit slow, is well told.  A film that has a few good things going for it, but a few weak ones as well. Overall, a decent film, but probably not a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. That's how I feel about this movie, it was well made and a great movie to watch. The film is about a woman named Carol, who has to leave her husband, Carl, behind and move to Chicago to start a new life with her friend, Joan. She finds a job as a receptionist for a hotel, and it gets to be a bit much for Carol. After a couple of months of being there, her mother has a heart attack and she needs to leave. She goes back to Chicago with a friend and Carl is left behind. He starts to take a more active role in the lives of the two women he loves. He helps them take care of Carl, and helps them with the financial difficulties that they are facing. As the two get older, the relationship between the two gets more intimate and the characters become more real. The relationship between Carol and Joan was a real joy to watch, and this film made me feel like I was there. The acting was great, and the storyline was very good. I also enjoyed the fact that this film was a "no holds barred" romantic comedy. There are some very explicit scenes and the nudity and sex were handled very well. The best part of this film is the chemistry between the characters, and I thought that they had a very real and touching relationship. I think that the audience should really watch this film to see the characters as they were meant to be seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   I didn't mind The Dark Knight Rises. I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan and I was looking forward to this movie for years. But I found the film's portrayal of the Dark Knight to be a bit too much of a departure from the comics. I understand that Batman was more serious in the comics, but I also think that Batman and the movie needed to show a more humorous side. It's like Batman is playing a game with the Joker, but he never does anything. So he's not even playing the game, he's just watching the game. The Joker doesn't even say anything, he just laughs and laughs. But then he's on the roof of the Batmobile, ready to do something. He throws a gas can at Batman, but it only bounces off of the cape. Then he throws a smoke grenade into the Batcave, but Batman throws a batarang back and hits him. The gas cloud blows Batman away, but the Batarang makes a big explosion, which sends the cloud in the direction of the city. This is Batman's way of saying that he has won. Batman goes to the city and begins the long process of destroying it. He comes to a large bridge and he sees a large crowd of people. He sees a huge crowd of Joker's goons, but as he goes up the bridge, he sees that they are being pushed back by the soldiers of the government. He goes to his Batmobile and goes out to the crowd, but Joker throws some smoke bombs at him. Batman dodges them and the Bat-car crashes, but Bruce manages to get out and he gets back on the Bat. He heads to the bridge and sees a tank on the other side of the river. He drives his Bat-mobile into it, but then the Joker throws a bunch of bombs at the tank. Batman manages to make it into the tank and he throws an armored Joker out of the tank, but when the Joker falls, the tanks explodes. Bruce is on the ground, but his Bat is still moving. He tries to pull the armored Joker back in the tank by pulling the chain, but nothing works. He decides to go back to the Bat, but in doing so he runs over a bunch more Joker's. Batman is in great pain, but still has the armored Batman on his back. As Batman runs to get to a nearby police car, he runs into a man. The man is in a wheelchair

Overall, this movie is great and it will definitely make a great sequel to this great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   I'm not a big movie buff. In fact, I don't have much movie knowledge. I do know that this is a classic. But I have a hard time getting into it. It's a classic but it's not as good as I'd hoped it would be. The story is interesting but it has so much plot holes that it's hard to follow along.   The story begins with a man and his wife being attacked by an alligator. After his wife is rescued, he is found by a boat. He is taken aboard and taken to the house of a man named Walter who tells him the alligator is responsible. Walter then tells the man that he has a son, Charlie. He then gives the man a map of the area. The man then takes a canoe out and searches for Charlie. The only problem is that Charlie has been missing for a month.   I think this is where the film loses me. It seems like Walter and Charlie have a connection but I don`t really get it. Why would Charlie be so interested in this man who has a family that has been killed by an "alligator"? Is there something about Walter that Charlie is attracted to? There are several things about the story that just don`ts make sense. Why is the alligators so big? Why did the man who saved the man and wife not want to rescue them? Why are they never seen again? Why was Charlie never found? What happened to the alligater? Why is Walter telling this story? The answers to these questions are not in this film.   is a really bad movie. It takes too long to get going and it doesn't have enough suspense. But the film is worth watching for the classic story. I think I will keep this movie on my DVD and watch it occasionally. It has a good story that doesn`t take long to figure out and it's a good film to watch with a buddy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie.  It is a great example of what is possible when you combine a good story, well done acting, and great effects.  The plot revolves around two brothers who are forced to flee from their home because they have a strange and evil creature living under the bed.    The story begins with a simple dream that is played for laughs but it soon turns into a nightmare and the brothers find themselves in a world that they cannot escape.  The monsters in this film are really cool and scary and the acting is excellent.  When one of the brothers is caught in a cage, he screams and tries to escape but the cage is too heavy for him and he can only scream.  If you are a horror movie fan then you will enjoy this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ The following review is based on the film "Taken 2" (2017) directed by James Wan. This film is based in the United States of America and in New York City. The main characters are Chris (Will Smith) and Fiona (Katherine Waterston) who is his fiancée. Fiona is kidnapped and taken to a private prison where Chris has to save her. Chris and Fiona have a very strong connection and the film is very dramatic and emotional. The film also has some action scenes that are awesome and thrilling. This is the first film to be released from the new director James Wan and he has a great idea about how to take us to the next level of horror movies. It has great characters and great cinematography and the sound design and music is amazing. The movie also has an intense storyline and this is very scary and very emotional. It's definitely one of the best horror movies that I've seen so far and is definitely a must-watch for anyone who wants a horror movie that is intense and scary. I think this movie is great for anyone looking for a good horror movie and I'd definitely recommend this to everyone.  …

It is a pretty good movie, and it is really a good flick. There is a lot of action, and I really like the way they do it, they don't use CGI or anything like that, they really use a lot real stuff, and a lot people. It's not a movie that is easy to follow, and that is why I think it's good.   a lot has been said about it, and what I think is a good thing, is that they make sure that the movie is not easy to watch. They use lots of real people and things. There are people who are not good people, and there are people that are really bad people. But they use the people and they use them as they see them. They don't make it easy, and they don,t make it too easy. I just think it is a very good movie. It has all the right things that I like in a good film. The story is really good, it has a good ending, and the characters are great. It also has lots of action. It doesn't use too much CGI, and in fact, it doesn't even use CGI in the movie.

I think I was actually watching the movie the night before. I thought I would take a nap after but I couldn't. I just sat in front of my television and watched it over and over. I don't remember who won but I did like this one. I am not a big fan of horror but this was a good one.  Was this review helpful to you?

This is a fun, funny, fun, good movie. I can't say that I was too surprised by how well they did on the whole movie.  -The movie was shot in a very dark and serious tone. But this wasn't bad. I would rather be in this movie than on some scary movie set. ,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Best and Brightest " was a movie about a very dark and disturbed character. This movie has so much to offer. The plot and characters are so good and the cinematography is so beautiful. If you want to watch a very depressing movie you must watch this movie. The film is not all about the character of " The Best " but the main plot and his journey of self discovery. It was very interesting and a good film to watch at night. If this movie was based on a book or movie it would be a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. This is a great movie. A young woman comes back from war to find her husband is gone, but she is still haunted by the loss of her son. I loved this movie and loved that it is a realistic depiction of the horror that war has on families. I think the real heroes of this movie are the three soldiers. You could feel the sadness of their loss and the pain that was still felt by all of them. The soldiers were wonderful. There were so many different emotions going on in this movie. The three soldiers are all great characters. I hope to see them again in another movie. I enjoyed this movie immensely and would love to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  Noah S. Kramer's "I'm Not There" is a good, simple movie that works because it is about two characters, and it does so well. It is about a couple who go to a wedding reception and are invited to the rehearsal dinner, which they both hate. Then they get invited to an after-party where the bride-to-be and the groom-to be have a one-night stand. At first it seems like the movie is going to go down the "What the fuck, I'm the only one here who knows the whole story" path, but the two characters realize that what they really want is to have some fun, and in the end it's not their story at all, it's that of a couple going through their own journey. This movie is an excellent comedy because it knows how to have a couple's relationship. They are so close in many ways and yet, so different, and they both have their faults. The movie doesn't try to put them all on the same pedestal, it lets their personalities shine through and they play off each other to perfection. In the movie, the main character, Charlie, is a lawyer who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and has to go through a tough course of treatment to try to work through his own issues with this. The therapist, Dr. T, is someone who loves Charlie and wants him to succeed. He is also someone who doesn't know anything about Charlie, and is trying to learn everything he can about him, but in the process, is putting his own ego and desires above what's best for Charlie. Charlie has his own problems with anger, but his anger is directed at the world and not at people. I love that Charlie is a person who has gone through a lot and is finally starting to understand himself, and that Dr. Thomas is trying everything he possibly can to help him. I think Dr. L is the one who really brings this story to life and gives Charlie and Dr. S their voices. The supporting cast is great, and includes an actress playing the wife of a friend of Charlie's who also has some issues. I loved the supporting cast, and especially the way they played off each others' parts. As I said, "I'll Take You There" really does go down a road that I think we've all been down at some point, and I found myself laughing a lot. This isn't
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  About:  The film is based on a true story of the massacre of Jews in France during the Holocaust. In the aftermath, French Jews tried to hide their identity, even hiding their children.  Plot Summary:    An aging Jewish teacher is arrested for helping the Jews escape France. He is brought to a concentration camp where a German soldier interrogates him about the names of his children. When the man demands to know if the father of one of his sons is Jewish, the man reveals that his wife is Jewish. After the interrogation, the German soldier returns and tells the German guards that the man who had the names is a Jew. The guard decides to execute the man on the spot. The Jewish teacher begs the guards not to kill him, but he is shot. The teacher's wife runs to the camp, and is arrested by the Germans. The Germans take the wife to a German concentration camp. She is taken to the gas chamber, and the men of the camp are executed. The wife is sent to a death camp and dies.  of a family who survived the Holocaust by hiding their identity. The film opens with a young girl, Emelie (Dita von Teese), as she watches her parents, and her mother-in-law, walk through a camp. The mother-to-be, named Margot (Sally Hawkins), tells her husband, Walter (Dwight Yoakam), that they must get away from the Germans, and run away. Margot goes with them, and tells Walter that she will hide her children in a secret compartment of a train.

The film tells the story of a young woman who decides to make a new start after being rejected by her fiance. Her new friends help her to start a new life in a new city.  The Girl On The Train (2015) Movie CLIP - The Girl (Kate Winslet) in NYC    Feb 7, 2015 11:31 PM  'The Girl on The Train' The Girl is seen in NYC. http://www.starringgillianmarie.com/  I love it when a film takes a moment to explain the world around us in a way that is accessible to people who are just starting to understand it. It makes us feel like we're getting to understand something more. The Girl does just that.  The Girl is set in a small Midwestern town in 1959. The town is called New York, and it is a small, rural town. People are still living in cabins and they've lived there since the late 19th century. - Kate Winslet in a scene from The Girl  New York is a very small town in the middle of nowhere. It's a place where people are used to each other, and there is a lot of good people who live there. But there is also a lot to be learned from it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" A young girl is raped by a neighbor's son, who then attempts to murder her. She has no choice but to hide her secret from her mother and a neighbor. After the murder, the girl's father and mother are accused of murdering her. The film is a parody of the popular Hollywood westerns of the late 19th and early 20th century. In addition to being a good comedy, it is also a great example of how a genre can be taken and turned into something much more. Although it is based on a true story, the movie was also made to poke fun at the western genre. It is also very dark in nature. A man has a great secret.  A woman who wants to keep her past a secret has her mother find out. In this scene, we get to see the different characters reacting to this news. The two men in the room are clearly shocked, as is the woman. The woman is obviously in shock.  The two are clearly trying to keep their heads above water and make sense of the situation. It seems that this woman has never seen a movie in her life. She is trying to make sense out of this situation and has no idea what to do.  She is also trying to get her mother to be okay with what she is going to tell her. This woman is so confused that she doesn't even know if she wants to stay with her mother.  In this scene we see the man and woman being questioned by police. It doesn't take long for them to come up with a story that fits the facts. The men are the ones who are innocent of the crime. They are just out enjoying a movie.  It is the mother who is guilty. The mother who has kept her daughter from the world, who is so angry with her daughter that she murders her.  This scene also shows how much she wants this woman to leave.  There are no words to describe this scene. The story is told in a very quiet and slow manner.  We see the two men being questioned and they don't know what to say. They just nod their heads in a non-committal manner. They can't understand what is going on.  They are in shock, and we can't blame them. The scene shows that these two men are just like most men. They have a secret that they need to keep.  When you are told

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I've been a fan of David Lynch and his films since the days of Twin Peaks, but I've never seen a film like Blue Velvet. I never really paid attention to Twin Peaks in my teens, but the second episode of Blue Velvet really got me intrigued. It was a different kind of Twin P... I didn't realize that this was a Twin Peaks homage until after the fact, but it was so good. I love David Lynch films, but this one was a masterpiece. I was expecting something like the third episode of Twin Peak, but Blue Velvet was more interesting and mysterious. I loved the idea that the two main characters were so similar, yet so different. It made for a great story line, but not one that you'd find anywhere else. Lynch was one of the best story tellers in the business and Blue Velvet has all of his fingerprints all over it. This is a film that should be on everyone's list of favorite Lynch films. I can't wait to see the other four episodes, and I can only hope the story continues with David Lynch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   The Good:  1. The script is funny. It is a really great script, and this is a first-time director who wrote the script. I am very interested to see how he will do with the rest of his films.  2. The acting is very good. I really liked the characters.  (The film is set in Japan, but in reality, it is a very small country, where you cannot get a visa to visit the whole country.)  3. The sound is really good. 's character, who has a kind of a "dark side", is very well done. I was really interested to watch how he would portray the main characters in this film. He did not give them too much backstory, but I think it was quite clever.  of the "soul" of the character, I am really interested in what he will say.   4. I think that the movie would make a great addition to the Japanese film festival. It's very interesting, it's very funny, and it's a good start for the future. ,  ,   the Bad: . The cinematography is not great, it was not that good, I think they were a little bit over-cinematic.  and the music is not that great either.   (There are some scenes where the music was really bad, and the cinematography was amazing.)   Overall, this is an excellent film. It would have been even better if the director would have made a Japanese version of this film, which I think he might do.

It has good story, good music and an entertaining plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who like action movies.  Review by: james b  I had a wonderful time at this movie. The action scenes were fantastic. The story was great. There was an amazing romance between the lead character and the lead girl. The film was very enjoyable. I could not find a flaw in the movie. It was just perfect.  is it any wonder that it has been nominated for 5 Oscars in 10 years? I was lucky enough to be in a movie that I actually enjoyed. If you are a fan of the James Bond series then you will enjoy this film. I was not the biggest fan of Bond, but this movie had me in a good mood. It had great action scenes and great music.    I give this movie a 4.5 stars because the ending was kind of lame and the movie was too long.

Reviewer: kimberly_ruth - favorite favorite favorite - January 23, 2013  Subject: Good but could be better I enjoyed this movie very much, but could have used a little more. There were a few scenes that just didn't really work for me. Like when they are trying to get the boy out of the house, but it is cold outside and they are not really moving. And there were a lot of little things that could have been better. For example, I really liked the way the father is trying to talk to the boy, but the boy doesn't really listen. And then when the boy looks at the camera, it is too bright. But I guess those things are a small price to pay for a good ending, and I will give it a 4. - January 22, 2013Great movie but could use a little better  Overall: Good Movie, but... I have seen this movie many times and always enjoyed it. But this time, I just could not get into it. The movie was too long. And it was hard to understand the storyline at times. The music was good, but I didn't think the music was that great. I know the movie is about a little boy and a father and I think the movie would have been more interesting if it was about a father who has a bad temper and a son who was not so good in school. The other character was really good and I liked how he was portrayed. It was a great ending. But there were too many scenes that I couldn't really understand. - December 8, 2012Good Movie, good end  ...a great ending to a great story. - October 20, 2012great ending but coulda been better 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I liked this movie a lot. It is not perfect, but is very well made and acted. It was not easy to make a film like this. It requires a lot of patience and dedication to get the right combination of story, characters, dialog, and music. I was surprised at how realistic and realistic it is. There are some parts that seem like a lot, but the viewer will not see it as a big deal. In this film, you feel like you are there with them, but you don't see it. It's the opposite of a big budget movie. The camera is used well and you feel that you are in the film. The acting was very good. I liked the lead actor in this film. He is very good in the role. He does not make the audience feel bored or dumbed down. He portrays a very strong man. His scenes are very interesting. I really enjoyed watching the movie. It gave me a great feeling that I have never had before. It will definitely be on my list of favorite movies. If you like action, action, and more action then you should give it a try. If not, I am not going to argue with you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a very good movie. I enjoyed the first part, which was good. The film is pretty much set up. Then, after the first third of the movie, there's a surprise and a real change in tone and plot. It's a change in a good way, and I think that the change in the tone was what really got me to watch the movie. The ending was very effective, and the ending of the film is not the ending that I expected. It was surprising, and unexpected, and well written. The characters are believable. The actors are believable, and they had to do a lot of improvising, but they were good. "They have no other option but to accept the death penalty." (C-17)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  I'm not saying that The Green Mile is a bad movie. It is a good, if not very original, film. It's a great movie. I liked the way the story was told, and the way they managed to put in a bit of humor without it coming off as annoying or stupid.  What I really like about the movie is how the movie manages to do some great things in terms of atmosphere, while at the same time being very dark and serious. The film has a really unique atmosphere that I really enjoy. I really hope that some of the elements that I like so much in the film will be used in the next film, and that they use the same atmosphere that they did in the first film. .  of course, a movie about a guy with a gun and a guy who has no gun is not going to be a lighthearted and funny movie, and I do think that it has its fair share of action scenes, but it is also very dark, and very serious in some respects. This movie is about a man who goes around the country, searching for someone that was taken from him. I guess the movie works a bit better in the US than it does in the UK, since the movie does a better job of showing the different situations that people are put into, while it still tries to keep the mood lighthearted.  the movie also has some very clever moments where it shows how people try to justify why they shoot people, and it also shows how the people that are in the movie try to make sense out of their situation. I do love the fact that they show how a good man would deal with his problem.  and the movie even managed to make me laugh out loud a few times. This is a great, fun, and dark movie. This is a movie that I will be watching a lot more of, and hopefully one that will make me smile. It was a great time, and we got to see a lot of things in this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...." This is a great Star Wars movie. The Empire Strikes Back was a lot of fun, and the new characters in this movie were all fun to watch. The fight scenes were good, and they really felt like a Star Wars film. The ending was a bit weak, but then again it's only the beginning of a trilogy, and I think the movies will both end up being good. I just wish that they didn't have to rush the movie and add so much crap in between the movies, like they did with A New Hope and Empire. This movie was good, but it could have been better. If you're a fan of the old Star Wars movies, you will probably enjoy this movie. I enjoyed it as well, but I think there were better movies to come after this one. Recommended for fans of the prequels.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- It is a good, if very short, movie with some funny and some good ideas. There are some scenes that seem to have been made up or copied from other movies, but that is not so bad because I don't remember those other movies very well and it is very easy to get used to them. I think that the director was more of an artist than an director, but I don`t think that he was very good at what he was doing. Some of the scenes in this movie seem very similar to scenes in some other movies (the car chase, for example) but they were made up. The other thing that I thought was good was that this movie doesn`t take itself very seriously. It is not a very serious movie, so I donít think it is a very good one. It does have some good effects, some cool action, some interesting characters, and some very good music. This movie is good for children and adults. The characters are very likeable and the story is very short. If you want a good little movie for children, then this is a movie that you should watch. It has some nice scenes for kids, but it isnít a very big movie. It also has a lot of good action and good music, but if you want something a bit more serious and serious, you should not watch this movie.

He walks up to a woman and says, "I am the most beautiful man you have ever seen. I'm not a dancer, I'm a man, and I can make you love me." She says, ''Wow! He's a real man!" And then he takes her in his arms, and they walk off. I don't think there is a single man in the world who would have thought of taking her that way. This is a very, very rare movie. I think it is a great film, and it is just great how it ends. I also liked how they went through the motions. You know, that one time they went to the opera and danced, and that was a fake, but this was real, and he did it. And then they danced to a song on the radio and then went out. I have seen many movies that were very good, but I think this is one of the best.

I would give this a B+ but for the first ten minutes or so I felt like I was watching a cheapo commercial. But then the good begins.   First of all, it was filmed in Europe and was shot for the BBC and the BBC had a film festival to go to. They made a movie and there were about three thousand people there. It was on BBC and I think the movie was shown on TV a couple of times. I saw it in England and it was very well-produced.  . I thought that when the film opens the guy is in a very nice hotel in Paris. He has a great room with a bed. He comes in and sees a beautiful woman in a bathtub and he is very pleased. He says to the woman, "What a beautiful body you have." Then he goes and undresses and he looks at her from all sides. Then he says,   "What a great body you've got." He goes into her bed and he has an affair

I actually liked it a lot. It's got a really good sense of humor. And it does a pretty good job of keeping the tone and plot of the book intact, while adding some twists. The Bad: * It takes some time to get going. The first hour or so is pretty slow, but it picks up in the last half hour or two. The movie does a nice job of creating tension and really putting the plot in motion.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I've been a long time fan of James Cameron and the Terminator films. When I saw Terminator 2 I didn't even see the first one. The movie has a much better story, and it's a lot of fun to watch. This movie is more realistic in some aspects. The only problem I have is that it's too long. It's like the movie was written for an hour. The characters are very well written. I love the character of Sarah Connor. It gives a nice contrast to the Schwarzenegger character. I really loved the fight scenes. I didn`t see many action scenes but it was really well written and very intense. The ending was a bit disappointing, but I know the film was only intended to be two movies. I was really disappointed when they showed the robots dying in the end. The action scenes were so good. The robots were so well done. I'd like to see another sequel. This is a great movie and a must see for anyone who likes action. It really has the feel of a James Cameron movie. It will stay with you for a long long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. __________. __________________. (This is my review of The Good Wife Season 5, Episode 2) If you watched the first season of The Girlfriend Experience, you will know what to expect. It's a story of a couple who live together. They are good friends and enjoy a good night. The husband is a nice guy. The wife is an evil bitch. She steals money and favors from her husband and takes them away to a secret place in the basement where she rapes and tortures him. This is a movie that's worth watching. It has a lot of twists and turns. The first episode is about the trial. The trial is a big part of the show. In the first episode, the wife makes the husband reveal his secret stash of money in order to get the money back. In order to find out the stash, the husband has to find the wife. He has to be a good guy. He can't get to her. But he has to try. The Goodwife is a great show. It takes you to the heart of a dark and twisted world. I highly recommend The Good wife Season 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Muppets" is a really great movie.  It is one of the best Muppet movies.  The film is funny, charming and just has a good story.  It is also very entertaining.   The best Muppeteers are all here in this movie.   The movie takes place in a small town in the Midwest.  There is a school called the Muppet School.  This is where all the Muppet talent come and learn how to be a Muppet.  And, in order to be accepted, the Muffin Man must perform the song "Muppet Guys Do the Food."  There are three of the Muffy Muppettes in the school, named Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and Gonzo.  They are the Muzzles.  One day, the students start to see a strange, red man dressed in red.  He has a red hat and red gloves and a red beard.  At the end of the day, he goes to the school.  Once inside, the Red Muppet sings a song and then he sings the words to "Muppets Do the Groovy."  He goes on and on and they all sing the song, including Gonzo who sings the most.  Gonzo and the other Muppetts then go back to the Munchkins' apartment where the Muggles live.  After the Mupets are all in bed, the red man appears and goes to one of them.  Then he starts singing "Mupets Do The Groovy" and it is very funny.  When the Mupsets are asleep, the man comes back and sings "Muffin Guy Does The Groove."  The Muppette and the Red Man have a great time together and they sing the rest of the song.  Afterwards, they go to a party and the MUPPETES and the RED MAN sit down and have a good time.  A Muppet is called in to sing a song but the Red man gets upset because the Mimpets are dancing and the music is bad.  So, the two Muppletes go to the bathroom to clean themselves and when they come out, the RED MUPPETS have their hair and makeup all done.  Their mouths are taped shut.  Muppitoes go to their next class and the students are all very happy and laughing.  In the morning, the class

It is a good "WATER" movie and "The Wicker Man" is just a great movie and that is why I like Watership Down. This movie was good, and this was the best movie out of all of the "Water" movies. I'm very glad I watched this movie and the rest of the Watership down series. If you like "WATERSHIP DOWN" then you'll like this. If not then I would suggest you skip it. Overall, if you like a good horror movie then this is your movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  In this movie, the lead character's character is a very strong and determined woman who is very good at what she does. She is the one who takes care of her baby and is always doing what needs to be done. She never gives up and always gets what she wants. The movie is about the relationship between her and her son and how they can grow and change. The story is told through flashbacks and then she goes back to her hometown, only to be confronted by the past. She gets a new job and a new relationship but is still dealing with the past of the relationship. This is one of the most powerful movies of the year and is very true to life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"  is a great film. It's not just an entertaining movie, it's a very intelligent one. It gives us an interesting and thought provoking story.  It also has great characters, some of whom will leave you feeling happy, others will leave the audience wanting more.  "The Empire Strikes Bajeekt" is a good film. This one is more of a historical film, so that doesn't really get you a lot of information, but that's not really a bad thing.  It's a good historical film that's good enough to make you want to learn more about this era of the galaxy.    I highly recommend this film.  The special effects are great.  I also recommend this for anyone who enjoys movies that involve space travel.  "Star Wars" is one of my favorite films of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I was at a friend's house, and she had seen this movie on television. I knew it was a great movie. She watched it and told me about it. I liked it too, but thought it was better in the 80s. I like the 80's as well, but this was a bit more sophisticated and sophisticated. I think they should do another version of this movie, with a more modern and trendy look to it. The original film was so good, and it's still great. I also love that it's a girl movie. That is what it should be. The guy's all in t-shirts and jeans and it makes it more relatable. I can see a girl going out to a bar and going home with a guy. It was great for me too. If you liked this movie and want to see it again, then do it. You will not be disappointed. - July 29, 2005great movie  Reviewer: jjg42 - favorite favorite favorite - July 9, 2005  Subject: great movie, not for kids - July 8, 2005worse for kids  Rating:  I saw this film as a kid. My friend and I made a documentary about it a few years ago, and were amazed at the movie. We also found it very interesting that this film is actually a series of vignettes, with each one telling a different story about the main character. I was not too keen on the ending (and don't blame the viewer), but still enjoyed the film. - January 15, 2005awesome movie,but...  Review:  in my opinion it's very much better in 1984, the original. - December 22, 2004awesome  This is the second movie of this series I've seen, and I am now really liking this movie. The plot was pretty good, the acting was very good, with all the girls and boys being believable. I thought it would be more enjoyable in the original film, because the acting is a bit different. - November 28, 2004best movie of the 90s  Sound:  of the movie, the sound was great. The music was great, too. It just sounds like a girl in the movie dancing.

The first two-thirds of the movie is good. The third part of the film is a disaster. There are no real shocks, and all the jokes are tired and lame.  the final 2-3 minutes of the story were just a bad attempt at a twist that would have worked if it had not been written so poorly. The last couple minutes are the only thing that made the film interesting. There is a great ending but that's it. The movie should have ended after that. .  of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate  (1962) One of the best spy movies I've ever seen.  It was a major influence on my love of spy movies.  A woman gets her head chopped off by a brainwashed agent and then is replaced by a new one.  It's a horror film, but there's a bit of comedy too.  The only thing that really got me was when the bad guy said, "There's only one way you can go..."  It was in the early 70s, so you could get away with a lot more violence.  But they were so careful with the body parts, you could see the blood drip from their fingernails.  This movie is a great example of what was possible in the 60s.   The woman who got her head cut off was the first real female spy, and her replacement is a guy with a huge penis.    He's actually very well-endowed and has a huge cock.  When they say that she's been replaced, the director, William Friedkin, said that it was a tribute to this woman's bravery.  She got her brains blown out because she was doing a good job.  After the death of her replacement, she is sent on a mission to infiltrate a Soviet prison to save some Russians who were in prison with her.  While she is on the mission, she has a vision of her own head getting chopped off.  In the middle of her mission, her replacement shows up and starts to kill the prisoners.  So she has to kill him.  If you liked this movie, you'll love this one. I was 13 when this was released. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I've seen it four times, and I still find it enjoyable every time. I think the main reason I liked it so much was that it was the first time I had seen a movie that was as entertaining as it was scary. If you're a horror fan, this movie is a must see. I was in a group of four girls who were also watching the movie at the same time. We were all terrified at some point in the movie, but we all had a good time. This movie is funny at times, but it's not for the faint of heart. It's a great movie, and if you've seen any of the movies, you'll love this one. If not, don't worry, you can still have a great time. _________________________________________  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas  was one of those movies that was really good, and then once you saw it a second time, you really liked it. The movie was made for a low budget, but the acting was great and the story was fun. There is no way you can tell that this was made by a small independent film crew, because it had a huge cast. There was even a girl who played a prostitute, and I love her. It was a great story and a great movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and great acting. It is a must see movie! 5 out of 5 stars Tanya Roberts "A young mother and a young prostitute have a little girl, and a little boy. Their lives are about to change dramatically." 5  out of  5 stars Nancy Kress "This is a movie that needs to be seen." 4  out 5 stars Michael C. Davis "The story is fun, but a little simplistic. I did not like the characters. They seemed too young." 2  out  5  stars Karen Smith "This was one of my favorite movies when I was a child, and it is a good one now." 1  out 4 stars David Koepp "This movie had to be watched by people who were in their teens when it was made, because there were a lot of sexual references.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************  I've never been a big fan of horror films, but I really enjoyed this one. This was the first horror film I ever saw in my life, and I was so excited. The opening sequence was really scary and eerie. The film was pretty good in general. The ending was really creepy, and the ending of this film was really chilling. I was really excited to watch it after seeing the trailers and knowing that this movie would be pretty good. I have seen this film three times, and it is always different. Each time it is a bit different, but the story is the same. The story is very scary and really spooky. There were some good effects in this film, and they made the scares even more scary. This movie is pretty good for a film that is rated PG-13, but it is not too scary for children. The characters in this movie are very interesting, and have a lot of depth. I think that this is one of the most well written horror films ever made. This is one scary movie for adults, but also for kids. This film was rated G, but you really don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  I think a lot of us just grew up loving the Beatles, and the early years of their career were great, even if the "new wave" thing didn't quite pan out. But as time went on and the songs got more and more repetitive, the music became less interesting and the show was getting worse. By the time the movie came out it was so far removed from the actual Beatles that I was sick of it, and that's why I never watched it. Then in 2004, when the film was rereleased on DVD, it looked amazing and I finally saw the film that I've always wanted to. But then the re-release got cancelled, so I never saw it again. I finally watched it today, and it's definitely a must-see. I love the movie. It's about John Lennon and Yoko Ono and I think it's one of the greatest documentaries ever. There are some great interviews with John, Yoko, and other members of the band, and I really don't care what anyone says. If you like music, this is a must see.

It has a great scene that I haven't seen in a long time, with a very intense and well acted performance by a great actor in Michael Jai White. The film opens with the main character, James, being arrested and taken to jail. It's not until the end of the movie that he is released on bail. The rest of the film follows James as he goes through some very tough times and struggles with alcoholism. There is a great deal of suspense in the film, with the viewer wanting to know what is going to happen next. I've never seen this film before, so I can't speak for the rest of it. I just want to say that the film is really well done and it's a great movie.

I am thinking about it now because of the case in Michigan where the police say the killer has been roaming the streets of Detroit. I hope it never happens in my state.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* I saw this movie on a whim because I saw it on TV at a friend's house. I really liked the movie and was expecting a movie that would be a great way to start a summer night. I was completely wrong. The movie was so bad I felt bad for all the characters. It was so stupid it was hard to take it seriously and watch. The plot was so boring and I found myself skipping the movie. I think the story was just that, a story. The only reason I was interested in this movie was because I have a friend who loves to read and was excited about seeing the book. She said she was so sad to see that the movie was not good. I can't believe that it was so poor and was only made worse by the poor acting. I hope that they do a remake or at least put a good director on the film.

The actors were all excellent. I also loved that the story was told in flashback. That was really cool. The story was not really about the war but about a man who had a good wife and a good son but it was all about him and his problems. The director made it easy for the audience to relate to him. It took about 4 or 5 hours to finish the movie. It's not very long but the story really shows. The music is good too. It fits the movie well. I think it was the greatest movie I've seen this fall.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ This movie is a true-life account of the events leading up to the 9/11 attacks. The film tells the story of Richard Kuklinski, an American man who was working for an American company when he heard on the news that the World Trade Center was being bombed. After watching this film, I think the United States should investigate the possibility that the 9-11 attacks were an inside job. This film is one of those that makes you think about things and think about what is really going on. This movie should be on every library and cable TV's library. The movie gives us a lot of insight into the people who are trying to cover up what happened that day. The people that are in charge of our government and our military are trying so hard to cover-up what happened. It is unfortunate that this movie was not made before 9/ 11. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It really helps us understand what happened on that day and why so many people were involved in the events of that day, that day that changed our lives forever.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ This movie is the second in a trilogy, and that trilogy is not the greatest. I mean, the first one was okay, but it had some really cool stuff in it. But this movie is just good, it is well made, and the characters are all well-drawn and well-written. It was also a bit hard to watch, as there were times when the story did not seem to be very important to the characters, or did not have a very clear purpose. But when it did, it really did. I loved this movie, and I recommend it to everyone. It's an old movie, but one that has a new and better message. I'd say the message is not to give up, but to try again. I know that I am not the only one who was able to take a lot of crap from others, and not give up. I do think there is a message in this movie. I've been on the same journey, and hopefully I will get there one day. This movie, to me, is a must see for everyone, especially those who are in their teens or early 20s. I think this movie will be a huge hit for the 20th century.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ (5/5) ______________ A movie I saw a few months ago. I really enjoyed it. I was just watching it for the first time and it was a great experience. It was a good thriller. The actors did a good job. I hope it will get an international release soon. The movie is about a man who has to deal with a woman who was pregnant with his baby. It is about how he will deal with his wife if she comes out of it with a child. It would be a great movie for couples. I am hoping it will come out soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- My name is Ryan. I am 27 years old. I live in Chicago. I'm from a really big city. I never really knew a lot about it. I've been watching "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" for two weeks now and it's getting better and better. This movie is a must see. It is about a guy who moves to Chicago from Kansas. He doesn't know how to handle it. He goes to work, and then he meets a woman who's got a good job. Then it turns out she's been cheating on him. They live in a trailer park. They have two kids. The movie has a lot of funny moments. The best part about this movie is that it makes me want to get a job. I really do. I need a job and I don't know where to start. It's really funny and I really want to work. --------------- This movie was pretty bad. I was laughing the whole time and was kind of confused. I thought it was a movie about a crazy man who moves into a trailer in the middle of nowhere. There's no way the trailer park has the same number of people that the trailer is filled with. ------------- I'm going to get all of this off my chest: This movie has the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie. If you don't believe me just watch it. It doesn't make sense. This whole movie is just an excuse for some characters to hang out. If I was a bad person I would not do anything in this movie. This ending is ridiculous. I would have liked to have seen more. -------------- I really liked this movie, and I like it even more now that I know about the movie. It made me laugh and really get to know the characters. It also made me want a job so I could work. I don;t have a lot to work with. But I want a decent job. ------------------------- The plot of this movie was a good idea. It was all about people who are stuck in a small town. I could understand it. The characters were good. The writing was really good. ~~~~~~~~~

There are some scenes that could have been better and some things where they should have done things differently. But in the end, it all makes sense. It all comes together and makes you smile. The acting is so good it's almost funny, the story line is great and there is no plot twist to worry about. I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes a good comedy and just likes a little bit of good ol' fashioned family fun.  …

The group decides to hide in the basement of a house and wait for the police. They soon find out the basement has a strange smell. The police come and search the house and find a young girl dead on the floor. Soon, they find the other patients that were in the house. They all seem to be dead, but they have a strange power that seems to be the reason why they are dead.  Why You Should See It: Raims is one of the best horror directors of the 80's and 90's. In this film, he is a master of horror. Raimis' first film was a horror film called 'The Grudge' (1986). It was about a killer that had to be killed. His second film was 'The Frighteners' (1989). This movie is a horror/thriller. 'The Purge' is an example of a good horror film. It's a horror movie, but it has a story to it. In 'The Devil's Rejects' (1994), the director, Sam Rami, has a good story to the story. The story is a good twist on a horror story. 'Mama'

I've never seen a film that was so intense and scary, and the effects were amazing, and I felt that the pacing was very good." - Chris, UK "A fantastic movie, with a great performance from Michael Sheen. It really made me want to know more about this mysterious killer. It was very suspenseful, and very scary. It took a lot of effort for the film to make me feel uncomfortable, but I really appreciated it." - Jaimie, United Kingdom "I enjoyed this movie a lot, it was very creepy and I enjoyed the fact that the film kept you guessing about what was coming next.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The Legend of Bagger Vance was a good action movie with a great cast and a terrific plot. I've been waiting for a movie like this for years and I am glad that I finally saw it. The cast is great. They play all their characters with great realism and even their deaths are realistic and believable. The movie has a very interesting plot that involves an Indian village which is being attacked by a group of English soldiers. A few of the characters that have an interesting background and are interesting enough to stay with you long after the movie is over. A good action film with a good cast and good plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* It's not a bad movie. It's actually pretty good. I would watch it again if it wasn't so damn boring. It starts off with a great shot of a couple holding hands. The couple is obviously a married couple. This couple is really a couple and I think they were in love. But then they just keep on going on and on. They go to a restaurant and the waitress comes and sits with them. The waitress tells the husband to take a seat and then takes a drink of his drink and then she starts to talk to the husband about how he needs to get to know the wife. Then the wife starts talking to the waitress. The wife then starts telling the waitress how she doesn't want to go to the restaurant and she has a lot of things to do. Then when the husband asks the waitress if she can get something to eat she tells him she can't. The husband doesn't care. He tells the waitress that he doesn't have to go but she says "If you don't eat you will get sick" The husband says "I don't care if you get sick." The wife is angry at him for not listening to her. Then they start kissing again. The woman gets up and tells the man "We can't be having this." Then the man goes and grabs the woman's breasts and starts rubbing them. Then he gets the woman up on her feet and puts his hands around her neck. The guy gets his pants off and they start making out. Then there is a shot of the woman with her arms around the guy. Then she gets up, takes off her clothes and they go to bed. ******************************* 2.5 out of 5 stars for the sex scenes. ********** The movie isn't as good as I thought it would be. The movie is about a couple that was married. They were very close friends. But after some time they just couldn't stand each other. They both loved cars. They loved spending time together. But as time went on they just never got over each other anymore. They kept on trying to get back together but it was like nothing ever happened. They didn't want a relationship and they were just going through with it for the sake of being with each other and they just kept on going. The only thing that kept them together was that they both loved to watch TV. So they would watch each other on TV. The most interesting thing was the sex. It was very boring

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********I watched this movie with my friends who were in their early 20's. I had seen a movie or two about the Civil War before. They were both fascinated with this movie and wanted to see it. The movie was very well done and it's a good watch. The only thing I did not like was that the movie made us think the war was over. When it wasn't, it seemed to get worse and worse. I think that we needed more time to see the other side of things. This movie was well done. I recommend it to anyone. *********I think this is a very good movie and it has a lot of good things about it. It was very interesting to watch the war through the eyes of a young man. He saw the things that were happening and saw a lot more than what was being said. I enjoyed it. I liked how the movie shows what the young man had to deal with. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story and has time to sit down and watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ [The movie is about a man who is going to be executed, and he is going through all of his last words and they are about how he was wrong about the execution. There is a lot of symbolism, and the movie is very powerful. The director, who is Japanese, made this movie because he felt the American justice system was not fair. It is very depressing to watch a man go to his death and it is very emotional. I would recommend this movie to all. It gives a very clear picture about what is right and wrong. The ending is very good. The movie is not very violent, but the emotions that it brings out are very strong. I really enjoyed this movie. I am not a big fan of horror, but this movie did not disappoint. The plot is very interesting and the characters were well written. If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. The reason why this movie was made is because a lot people in Japan felt that the American government was doing a poor job in executing their citizens. The Japanese Government saw this as an opportunity to change their laws and start executing their own citizens. I think this movie is a very important movie for the world. The fact that it was made in the United States and that it is a film from Japan, gives it an important message about justice. _________________________________________________________  This movie is like a story of a child's life that goes wrong.

I feel that I learned a lot from this movie and it was very easy to see. This movie was very good to watch. The characters were very good and I liked them very much. The only thing that I would like to change is that the director did not put more of the plot into this movie since the ending was not as good as I expected. The last 15 minutes of this movie are a bit slow and I felt that it needed a lot more action and action scenes. The acting was good. It would be hard for me to choose a favorite.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ It is really an excellent movie, well acted, well directed and well acted. It was a very emotional film for me and made me feel that I was in a very bad situation. The main character is not only a young girl but also a little girl, who is very naive and very much a victim. This girl is not aware that she is being sexually abused and she does not know that the men around her are trying to rape her. It is very difficult to watch this movie, because it is so difficult to see that a child can be so completely taken over by men. The girl and the men who are in charge of her life are very much in love with each other. They are so in love that they do not notice that the girl is in distress. I believe that this film was so well written that it gave a very strong message to all of us. It tells us that we must not look at girls and women like objects, that we should be careful of what we are saying to girls, that girls and boys should not be treated the same way, that no one should ever take advantage of a child, that sex should never be used for a cheap pleasure. I really liked this film. I think that it is important for children to see this film, because as we get older we become more aware of the abuse that goes on in our lives and we become aware of how little we know about what is going on in the world around us.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The Manchurian Candidate" is a very well-acted movie that is about the Cold War. It's not as good as the novel. It is more a drama than a thriller. But it's a good thriller. And the screenplay is very good. I thought the movie was a little too dark and too dramatic. I would have liked to have seen the action more. And I was wondering if the director was just trying to make the movie as scary as possible. But he got all the scenes right and the actors did a great job.  ___________

It took a while for me to get this game, but I've now done it and I must say it's really fun. The graphics are a bit better than what I've seen in other versions, but it still looks good. It does take a while to get to the ending and a few times I thought it would never come, but that's how it is with any puzzle game. This is a great game, and I'll play it again.  a few more puzzles and it would have been a great one.  of course there is a time limit on each level, but if you're willing to play it a bit more you can do the last one in 2 hours and it takes maybe 1 minute.  and of course if you are a completionist you will be able to do this one in less than 5 minutes. .  (just like the original one)  I've got to admit I enjoyed this game and I think the graphics and music are really good.  at least it's not the old version, that sucked.

The film has a very high concept and has many parallels to the world of Avatar.   The action and comedy is well done and the music is well used.  This is a great film and the best film that Nickelodeon aired in 2010.  If you are a fan of the Avatar universe then this is a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  This is one of those movies I didn't think I'd ever see. And when I did see it, I was so impressed. The story is not the most interesting part of the movie, but I think that is to be expected in a film like this. The film takes place during the war and in a German POW camp, with a few prisoners, and a bunch of Germans trying to survive. They are forced to work on an old Nazi airplane that was being repaired. The Nazis are trying to get the planes ready for war. They need help getting it into the air. When the plane crashes, all the prisoners get out. They find out that they have no idea what to do and begin to explore. The movie is about survival, the beauty of nature, and how the humans have to accept what they have been given. It is a good example of how not to make a movie, which is a nice compliment to the rest of the film.  Director: Werner Herzog

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________ "The film's plot is a simple one: a high-tech, high-stakes race, a race that will decide the future of humanity, and one man's quest to get there in the best possible way. With all of this, the film has a very minimal and even simplistic visual style that, while it may seem a bit drab at times, provides an even more refreshing feeling. There are no real action scenes, no high-profile stunts, and very little on the plot itself. But the film still succeeds by having a story with a solid moral core and a well-realized premise, which makes it one of the best science fiction films I have seen." --J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! This movie is great. If you are a fan of the classic movie, this movie will be worth the watch. The only thing I wish it was a bit more epic was the scene with the dinosaur. The movie starts off with a group of people who are stranded in a remote area. It seems like everyone got into a truck with no where to go. We find a small cabin and it is guarded by a giant prehistoric beast. The beast gets angry because of the humans and starts attacking them. We see a lot of the characters that we have known in the past, and some new characters as well. I really liked this movie and would recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ A man is going through a very bad time. He was a famous and respected businessman. But now, he's a failure, and has lost his fortune. He is going to meet a woman named Lisa, who has a very attractive and wealthy husband, and wants to buy him out of his business. The man has two kids, but they are not happy. His wife wants to take them. The woman wants to give the business to the man. This leads to a nasty fight between the man and his wife. The ending is not as good as you would think. A few things are explained, but not really, and it's a little too late. I was happy that they didn't show the fight, and just show the happy ending, but you could tell the ending was rushed. I could have given it a better rating if they had done a better job with the ending. But still, good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I liked this movie. It was interesting and I enjoyed watching the two main characters. I liked how the movie had more action scenes than the other movies in the series. I enjoyed the different scenes and the movie was very good. I like how they have a more mature and realistic way of handling the movie. I think that this movie was more about how people think than what they are actually thinking. The characters were not very interesting, but that's ok. I was really happy that they had to do some real acting to portray the characters. They gave a good performance to all of them. I loved the movie and the cast and crew worked very hard. It's just really interesting watching a movie with two different perspectives of how things work. If you want to see a good thriller movie then you should watch this movie instead of the other two. If your into a mystery movie then I would recommend this movie to you too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girlfriend Experience (2013)  was a great movie.  It was not a great romantic movie, but it was a great comedy.    The story of the film is about a young woman, named Emily, who meets a man named Brad (played by Matt Damon), and begins to fall in love with him.  The movie follows the relationship between Emily and Brad and shows the struggles and ups and downs of this relationship.  I really enjoyed the story of this movie, because it is told from both sides of the relationship. Brad is a bit of a jerk and Emily is a nice guy.  Brad is an interesting character, because he really seems to be in love.  He shows signs of being really in love, but there is also a part of him that wants Emily to be happy.  Also, the fact that he is a successful actor and can have a good time with women, makes him seem like a lot of fun.  Although he is not a bad guy, he can be a bit creepy.  At times it seems like he really wants to impress Emily, but in some scenes he seems like a total creep.  This movie is great, but not for the romantic lovers.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________  This is a movie about a young boy who is forced into a life of slavery in a castle for a crime he did not commit. The movie tells a great story that will bring a smile to your face. The main character is a boy that has the misfortune to be born to a slave and he is forced to live a life where he is always being abused and abused. One day, he is saved by a brave man named Albus Dumbledore. He becomes a friend to the young boy and after a few years of friendship, they fall in love. However, the relationship of a slave is a very difficult one. They must live a daily life of suffering, and it becomes too much for them. They both die from the torture of life in a life-long bondage. In this sad life, the boy finds the love of another man, a man named Ronan O'Quinn. But, his love for Ronan is not a love of friendship. The boy and Ronan fall in a deep passion, and their love is not like any other love. It is a love that has no boundaries. It makes you want to be with them forever. Ronan's feelings for the boy are strong, but his feelings for a girl are much more. He is willing to risk his life for the love that he has for the girl. It may sound strange, but it makes for a very interesting love story. I liked the movie a lot. I felt that the plot was well done, and the movie was filled with suspense. It was a great movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in the romance of a brave knight and a beautiful girl. I recommend this to anyone who loves romance. This movie is worth a watch.

I was happy that I watched it in a theater with good sound, so that I can enjoy the movie and have the feeling of being on a movie screen. There is a short and sweet ending. This movie is a classic.  Thank you for reviewing this movie. I have seen many versions of this movie and I always feel a little sorry for those who try to make a version that will not leave a lasting impression. This is a must watch!

I'm not a conspiracy theorist by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it's pretty obvious that the whole thing is fake – especially when you look at the plot.  I don't know about you, but when I see a "crisis" in the news, I assume the event is real. There's a real tragedy happening, people are getting hurt. And the only thing I'm sure of is that those people are safe and sound. . I think it is highly unlikely that this movie is real, so the only logical conclusion is to assume it's a hoax. , but it does seem to fit in with other "crises" that have been reported in recent years. Here's one: ____________________________________________________________  It's Not Really About 9/11  The "Crisis in America" has been used by many people, both in the media and among politicians, to give the illusion of crisis for a variety of reasons. For example, the 9/ 11 attacks were used to push for massive military spending. In the case of 9/ irst, it was used to support the war in Iraq. The events of September 11th were used as a pretext to declare martial law in many American cities. In both cases, the "cure" for the crisis was a massive increase in military spending and the "war on terror".  In this particular case, I don 't believe the "Crop Circle Crisis" is really about crop circles. I believe the purpose of this movie (if it is real) is to push the idea that it was a conspiracy by government agencies to make people more scared of crop circles and make them believe that a real crisis is imminent.    ______________________________________________________________  How the Crop Circle Czar Became the Man Who's Watching the Censors  There is a man in charge of keeping a close eye on the censors in the U.S. government, a man who has already seen a fair amount of the crop circle phenomena, and has come to believe that it is a hoax,
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "It was in the summer of '67 that I first heard a song called 'Rock and Roll Music.' It was a tune I'd never heard before, and I'm sure I'd heard it somewhere before then. I'd just recently been sent a tape copy of it, and it struck me as one of those very rare pieces of music that can't be found. There was something so very pure about it, that I had a profound sense of awe for it, a sort of awe that came from knowing what it must have been like to be there when it was first created. It was an extraordinary experience, and as the years have gone by, I have learned to think of this song as one that should be played on a regular basis. I don't think I could ever forget it. It is the quintessential rock and roll song."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight  is the best Batman movie ever made, and it's not just because it's about a Batman who is really Batman. It's the best version of Batman ever, and Batman in this film is one of the best things about Batman. He's just as cool as the comic books, he's a lot more fun, and he's just so much more sympathetic than he was in the comics. The fact that he was raised in the worst way imaginable makes it even more obvious how much this movie's villain is the opposite of Batman. The only thing he does well is fight. The other great thing about the movie is the score. It has a very simple score and it really makes you feel like you're right there with the character. The ending is great too, and the film ends on a really poignant note. It was a very different movie from the comics, but I think it's a very good movie, and you should watch it if you can.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Candyman, the true story of a candyman, a man who eats candy.  Saw the original film in the late 80's and never watched it again. The director was a great director and I was intrigued by the plot and the character of Candyman. I was hooked and was amazed at how well the film captured the mood and attitude of the time. This was a movie that was made in the 1950's. The story was not overly complex but it was very compelling and kept me interested. The special effects were also top notch. It was really creepy at times. There was a lot of violence and a lot happened. It also had a good message and was very good. This film was also very funny.  The soundtrack was good and it was well directed. There were some great songs in the film. It is not a great film but it is worth seeing. This movie is also a great example of a great horror movie with a great message. It does not contain a lot that most people will enjoy but if you are into the horror genre then you will enjoy this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!! I'm so glad I saw this movie. It has a great cast. I love how it starts off with a young couple who are having a tough time. I think the movie was shot in South Africa and was made on a budget of less than $10 million. I thought it was a great movie. The ending was amazing and it was great to see the actors playing the roles that they were born to play. I loved that the film was very different than anything else in the movie industry. I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this in my life. If you are in the market for a movie with great acting and a great story, I highly recommend this movie and would highly recommend watching it on a big screen.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ I've been watching the new season of the original X-Files. It's funny, and it's fun. I've seen a lot of X-files episodes, but this one is my favorite so far. It was nice to see the Mulder and Scully working together again. I enjoyed it. I don't think that this will be the last time we see them, but I'm glad that they're on their own. The acting was great. I liked the way that the two of them interacted. The episode ends with Mulder trying to figure out a way to return the alien to the mothership, and he's able to do it. But in the end, he has to give up hope. Scully knows that this is a life-or-death mission, and she gets him to admit it. He's willing to risk everything just to see his friend and the alien again. She reminds him that there's a big difference between what they want and what they're willing to do. So, when he realizes that he's not going to see her again, he tells her "If you think you can help me, please come back". He also tells her that he'll do whatever she asks him to. And she asks, "But what do you want?" And he says, "I don't know". And then he gets up, walks to the door, and closes it. Mulder tells Scully that he thinks he's going to have to go. He leaves the door open. She asks, ``Are you sure?" And Mulder says, ``If you can hear me, you know the answer.'' He leaves, but not before Scully tells him that she'll be there to see him again. Mulders' exit is a great scene. It sets the mood for a very intense episode. I have to say, I'm really looking forward to seeing the new episodes. I hope that the Muldes are back. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Posted by Robert Harris at 7:18 PM

I've only seen this movie twice, but it's one of the best I've seen in years. It's a pretty slow burn but the final scene really is something to behold. It really shows how a group of guys can come together and make a movie, even when the director doesn't seem to have their best interests in mind. I have a feeling this is going to be one of my all time favorites. It is a really great movie. I'd recommend it to anybody who wants to see a classic, but who isn't afraid to laugh at the same time. This movie is worth the price of admission alone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! The movie was good and the music is great!!!  The story is not that original, but it was well done and a nice movie to watch at the end of the day. The movie takes place in the 70's when we find a man with an alien in his body. His name is Jack and he is an ex-cop. His partner and he work for the FBI and they have been sent to retrieve the alien. It's a very well made movie, the actors were all very good. The story has many twists and turns and it was interesting to watch. The only thing that is annoying is the ending. The alien has been in a storage facility for 40 years and when it's time for it to go back, it goes back. There are two scenes that were a little disappointing and that was when the alien was brought back to life and when they were told to give up on it. I wish they would have left it alone and just let it go back to the storage facility. The next day Jack and his partner get a tip off about the alien and decide to try and rescue it. When they find the alien, they try to get it back but it is too strong and takes over Jack's body. They fight it and Jack is killed. It takes a long time for Jack to die but we do get to see the alien that comes back and take over the body of Jack. It was a good ending to a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Story: A young man is taken prisoner and tortured in a remote jungle outpost. The man, an expert at killing, begins to experience visions of an evil force which has taken over his body. A man who has been imprisoned for over 100 years has been released and finds himself on a quest to find a woman he was meant to marry. The Film: The film begins with a rather bland scene of a woman talking to her husband about her past. The film then cuts to a jungle outpost and begins with the man (the hero) walking through a jungle looking for a woman to take back to his wife. The men talk about a war between a race of animals and man. A strange creature is seen in the jungle and the men are told that the creature will kill every man on the planet. They go to a place where they are told to kill a person but the man decides to go alone. They encounter a creature which is very aggressive and begins attacking people. The next thing they know they are running through the jungle. This creature has a face like a bat and a man's body. The creature kills the woman and the man is seen talking to a woman on a phone. He is able to talk to her and the two of them escape the creature. The woman then tells the man that she is a nurse and that she will get help from a man. The two of the man's friends then arrive and help the man find help. The second part of the film follows the men through a town which has a large army base. They are shown being trained by the soldiers. A soldier is then seen being shot by a man and he is taken to a hospital where he is treated. The final part of this film is of the two men trying to find the woman they were meant to take home. The story is interesting and the characters are great. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good horror film. The Special Effects: __________________ The special effects are great and really made the film scary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (1998) is a great movie. I think it is the best movie to be made about a marijuana-smoking hippie who has a huge ego and a bunch of crazy, out-of-touch friends.  I love this movie.    The cast is all great and the writing is top-notch.  Here is my review:   "It was hard to get the lebowski out of my head as the years passed. I would never have seen this movie as a teenager and I would be surprised if I ever saw it now.  When I saw the movie in 1998 it had some really great stuff in it and that was a great thing.  In this movie you are watching a great scene.  The guy is driving in a circle around a highway and he is driving on the shoulder.  Then he passes a small bridge and the camera cuts to his point of view.  This is a cool scene and it shows how he really feels about his life.  There is a lot of talk about him smoking pot and about how he wants to move away from Colorado and just get high.  He has a lot to say and his friends are kind of clueless about it.  They are trying to give him a hard time and he has the whole movie to tell them why he is doing this.  I am going to say that this is the first time I really understood the way that the hippie movement really works.  That is, if you smoke pot, you will do all these things.  And it really worked on me.  Here is a guy who is driving around and he knows that he is going to die in five years, but he is having a great time and enjoying the ride.  What does this guy think is going on?  The movie is full of great dialogue and great acting.  It is the story of a guy in the 60's who really wanted to get high, but his parents and society are against it.   When he gets caught, the movie shows the whole scene and the whole time he is smoking pot.  His friends are always giving him crap about it and he always comes out of it pretty smart.  At the end, he decides to get a job as a construction worker and he really gets into it. I really liked this movie, and it was a lot more than I ever expected.    It was a movie that I watched a
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  [This review is from: The Magnificent Seven (1980)]   [Rating: 4.5/5]   The Magnificent 7 is an interesting movie, and one that is highly entertaining from start to finish. The plot is a little simplistic, but the acting is superb, and the characters are great. One of my favorite Westerns.   * * * *   In the year 1877, four outlaws (the Wild Bunch) take refuge in a Nevada cabin in the middle of the desert. The leader, John Ruth, has his eyes on the rich woman that owns the cabin, and he has promised her that if he doesn't find her, he'll kill the others. He and his two men take turns guarding the women. However, they soon discover that they're not the only ones that want to steal the money.  .  ,   .   the story is great. the movie is full of action, excitement, and intrigue. There are a couple of plot holes, but they aren't so bad that you can't get a sense of the story and the movie.   The movie is shot in black and white, which works for the western, and it has some great, colorful, and imaginative images.   a lot of the time you can feel the tension and the tension is palpable. There's no dialogue, but it's the way that the characters move and the way they talk that makes the movie work. I don't want to say that this movie is perfect, because there are a few things that just make it a little boring. It's a little slow. It has a little too much exposition. But overall, it's an enjoyable movie that's well worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (1998) is a wonderful comedy, and is a worthy film to watch for anyone who is a fan of the classic film. The film is a masterpiece and deserves the top spot in the film list, and this is a must watch for everyone.  Don't expect a "typical" comedy from this film, it's more of a classic, and the film has great characters, great music and a very memorable soundtrack.  The Big, Lebucky The film is set in a small town in the Midwest, a small community where everyone knows each other.   The town has two bars, a bowling alley and a diner.  It's the perfect place to meet your buddies, or to have a good time with the ladies.  The film opens with Lebby (Jeff Bridges) going to the bowling alley with his buddies.  He and his buddies are having a good night, and are having the time of their lives.  They are having so much fun, and have no problems with women, and no trouble with their bowling score.  Then a mysterious woman named Gretchen (Uma Thurman) shows up and they all have a great time together.  She introduces herself as the owner of the bowling alleys, and it's clear she is not from around the area, as she says "this is the big Lebawowki"   Her name is Gretchen the Gertie, and she has a very bad temper, and has no problem with making fun of people.  This is a good thing as she is funny, but at the same time, she has no real sense of humor, and her personality is very unbecoming of a woman of her class.  Eventually, Lebowy and his friends get a chance to meet a woman named Mollie (Catherine Keener), who also has a bad temper and is not very nice to Leb and his pals.  When Lebowty asks her what she does, she tells him "I'm a waitress."  She seems very nice and the two go out to a party together. When Leb is talking to her at the party, he tells her about his life and how he has a girlfriend.  Her reaction is not too nice, and when they are all leaving, Lebrady tells her to meet him later, and they will have a drink.  At the bar, the three of them have

It would have been nice to see the rest of the story.  , but, I just don't like the ending. I mean, I know that he's a good guy, but this isn't a good way to end a movie. I would have liked to see a little more of the villain, and then some of the action in the ending to make it a little better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  "The Big Lebowski" is a movie that makes you laugh, cry and think. If you want to get a sense of the humor and the way the story is presented it's essential you watch it as a whole.   The movie starts with a montage of events and characters that we've seen in other movies. We meet the Dude, who we are introduced to, as a "young man with dreams of becoming a movie star". He meets a couple of characters who tell him the story of the movie, but in the style of a comic book. We are also introduced to the Dude's girlfriend who he falls in love with, and the Dude tells us this is the way he likes it.   and so on. We get to know our characters, the Dude has his dreamy and funny girlfriend, and we meet the characters from the movie. We learn they are being stalked by a gangster.  's gangster' is played by Jeff Bridges, and he is played as a bad ass. Bridges has been doing a lot of bad ass films recently, like "Django Unchained", "True Detective", and "Interstellar", which makes his portrayal of the Dude quite amusing. The film also has a great supporting cast. The Dude is played well by Jeff Daniels, and John Goodman is a good and funny supporting actor.  , who plays the role of Walter, the character that Walter the gangster wants to get his revenge on. John Goodman also plays Walter, and this character is not played like a gang leader. Goodman plays Walter as a guy who has been through a lot and is still going through a few problems. The movie is also set in the 60's and 70's, so the era is depicted well.      The Dude, as played by John Travolta, does a great job with the role. He does a good job of portraying the Dude in the right manner, which is very much like Travolettes character in "Raging Bull". The character of Walter is played with a bit more of a swagger and has more of an attitude, like the way that Travoles character in the movie "Rocky" is portrayed.  The movie is very well acted, and a great laugh is guaranteed. The character is so well written that I feel that the director, Joel Coen, is able to make the character seem real. The script is also funny, which was
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a movie about a drug dealer, Jeff Lebowitz, who lives in a small town and runs a little store out of his garage.   Lebow is a great character.    He has a good sense of humor, and his story is very funny.  He is not as evil as some other drug dealers that we have seen.  Lebovitz has his own way of doing things, and he is not a bad guy.  In fact, he is an honorable man who has his reasons for doing what he does.  After he is shot, he decides to do what he has to do.  His wife has been killed in the war in Vietnam, and so he gets a new girlfriend named Zelda (Sandra Bullock).   The story is told by a narrator.  I think that the narrator has a lot of power to change the viewer's view of the movie.  Some of the scenes are funny. It is a comedy, but the humor is not always used to get a laugh.  The movie also deals with a great deal of family tension.  At times, it is difficult to believe that a story could be told like this.  As far as the story goes, it was very entertaining.  This movie is not for the faint of heart.  It deals with some very dark topics.  There are a lot more adult themes and ideas in this movie than the average comedy.  If you have a family, you will not want to miss this movie.

I highly recommend this film." "A great Star Wars film." -  Joe Johnston,  "Star Wars" Beware of spoilers. This review may contain spoilers. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Dawn is an interesting Star Wars movie that does not fit in with the rest of the series. It follows a young boy named Luke Skywalker as he travels through space and time in a quest to find his father, who was killed by Darth Vader. Luke is in search of his father's Jedi robe and a small amount of money in order to pay for the items he needs to buy. As you would expect, this is not a good story. The movie opens with Luke Skywalker in a desert planet searching for his father. The story is interesting as it tells a story of a young man searching for a place where he can live his life as a Jedi and live a peaceful life. Unfortunately, the story does not have the heart to really get the viewer invested. The first twenty-five minutes or so of the movie is spent on showing how Luke goes through the journey to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, the mentor who trained him. This is the first time we see Luke in his Jedi robes, which is a little disconcerting as it doesn't seem to fit with the look of the film. The Jedi robes look so old and outdated compared to the modern Star Wars. The scenes that are shown in the movie follow the journey of Luke and Obi-wan as they travel through time. Obi- Wan has been traveling back in time in order for Luke to be able to find the saber that will give him the ability to defeat Vader. This does not seem to be the intended purpose of the Jedi. Obi Wan appears as a sort of guide who guides Luke through his journey, but the plot is very simple. This makes it very easy for the movie to be boring. It feels like the story is very much focused

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ It's a great movie, it's a good thriller, and it's one of the best movies of the year. I've never seen this movie before. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that was so interesting, that had so much going for it, and that made me look forward to watching it. The best part is that it was a great horror movie that left me on the edge of my seat and on my feet. This movie will definitely be on my Top Ten list for the year, and I'm excited for more horror movies to come out this year. It has a lot of things going for, but it has a great twist at the end. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good horror movie, but also has a strong stomach. I definitely give this movie a thumbs up!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film like this is so good it makes you want to love the world you live in. It makes you feel like you could be anywhere in the world and the people who live there.  It makes you see the people, the history, the culture, the beauty and the danger of being in the middle of a place where things don't have to work.  I don't want to be too harsh on this movie, but it does a terrible job of portraying a small town in Iowa.  It is an average town in the country.   The setting is a small farming community.  The only reason the town even exists is because of a farmer's son named Roy Hobbs.  He is an innocent kid, but Roy is a genius who loves books.  When he meets a girl named Lucy, who lives in the same small town, he falls in love.  They go to the same school, and Roy decides to join Lucy's class.  Unfortunately, Lucy's father, a bigoted preacher, forbids Roy from joining his family's church.  As a result, Roy is sent to live with his grandmother.  After a while, Roy gets his wish.  But it isn't to be.  Instead, he is sent away to a boarding school where he is forced to accept the strict rules of the school.  His teacher, Miss Blunt, is a woman who wants Roy to accept her teachings and her way of life.  While this sounds pretty evil, I am surprised the movie doesn't show Miss Blunett being a horrible person.  What I did like was how the film portrayed Roy's struggle to fit in and fit in well.  Even when he is in his own world, he has to learn how to deal with other people.  It's not until he is at the boarding school that he realizes how many people are just trying to make ends meet and live a normal life. There are a lot of bad things that happen in this movie.  Some of them are because of the story.  There is a lot going on in this film, but there is a good reason for it.  We are shown how life works in a small, rural town.  People who live in small towns are very hard to fit into.  Sometimes, people who have no money can't afford to travel outside of town, so they live in their own world.  A lot of the problems in this town
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ ___________________________________  "The Last of the Mohicans is a wonderful film about a young, inexperienced man who, with his friend and companion, joins a French expedition in search of the lost colony of St. Croix. The journey is very difficult. The soldiers are rough, and at times hostile. They treat the native men with cruelty. There are many beautiful scenes and scenes that I have seen in other movies that I will not forget." ______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________  The Last Mohicans  I had not seen this movie before, but it was well worth the time. I don't know if it is the same with the other reviews, but I found it very well acted and directed. The cast is superb. The acting is really well done. They all have a natural, believable way of speaking and acting. All the characters have a good chemistry. I enjoyed the story and the way they all went about it. The cinematography was excellent. There was a lot of great close ups, some of which were beautiful. The lighting and the shadows were very well done and the colors and the mood of the film was wonderful. The music was also very good. I thought it was a good choice to include some classical music in the soundtrack. I especially liked the music during the scenes where they were hunting and fighting. I didn't think there was any music that was too loud or too soft. This was the first movie that I saw that had a good music score. I think it really helps to make the movie come alive. The story itself is a bit slow, but the pacing of the movie is perfect. I loved all the little details in this movie. I love how they brought in the history of the characters. They don't try to do it too obvious, but you get the sense that there was a big struggle going on between the French and the Indians, and they are all living on a little piece of land. I really liked the use of colors. I liked the way the color scheme worked and added to the atmosphere of the pictures. I always enjoy a movie with good sound effects and I really enjoyed the great use of music in this film. I had never seen a movie like this before and it is definitely a must see. I give it an A+

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape (1964) The Great Mission is a fantastic movie. It is also a movie that is more a story of survival than anything else.  It's a story about a team of American pilots who are trying to take off from the USS Oklahoma in the Atlantic Ocean to fight in World War II.  But the story doesn't really focus on the pilots.    It focuses on a young Navy captain named Joe Smith (Tommy Lee Jones) who is tasked with rescuing the pilots and their families from a German prisoner-of-war camp.  The movie does a great job of telling the story of these two groups of men and their relationship with each other.  It shows the crew of the USS Pennsylvania and the American POWs as real people who had a life of their own and their own thoughts and emotions.  But the movie really shines when the movie is talking about the pilots themselves.  In this movie, there is no one in the movie that really gets to shine.  This movie does not really have a main character in the way that many of the movies that you see today have.  Most of the movie revolves around the pilot Joe Smith and his fellow crew members.  Smith is the most intelligent of the crew and has the best command of the airplane.  He knows what he is doing and does not need anyone else. He has his own ideas about the missions and how they should be done.  If the plane ever gets into trouble, Smith is always there to save it.    The movie gives you the best chance of seeing what the pilots were thinking as they were going through the missions.  You see the tension build as the mission gets closer and closer to the real thing.  Some of the best scenes in the film happen when the pilot and his men are in a German prison camp. The movie really gives you a feel for what it must have been like to be a German POW.  They were in a concentration camp. They had to eat, sleep, and even work together in a camp where they were in complete control.  And in some ways, the movie does portray the Germans as real human beings.  There is one scene in the camp where a German man is eating a meal and he gives a Nazi salute.  What the movie doesn't do is give you the feeling of the Germans being human beings as much as it portrays them as a race of people.  That feeling comes later in the
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   I'm giving this movie a perfect 10/10!   It's about a man and a woman who are having an affair, but they're both very honest about their relationship, and they actually love each other. It was such a great film because the actors and the actresses were so perfect in their roles. I love love love the love scene between the couple, they were both so sweet and I thought it was the best love scene in the history of movies.   They had such an amazing love scene with the two of them, they really felt like they had been together for years. I really love love that the scene is so sweet.     And I love that I was able to watch this film in a theater, and I didn't have to go out to the movie.   (The movie is about 3 1/2 hours long, but it felt like it was only about 45 minutes!)   My rating for this movie: *****   So, I highly recommend this film! I don't know how this movie is available for streaming or DVD on Netflix, but if you want to rent this film for a day or two, I would definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I was looking for a film that would capture the spirit of the "Dark Knight" and "The Dark Knight Rises" and in this, I think the filmmakers did a great job. A gritty, noir-ish film that really is a well-made movie. The acting was excellent and the performances were varied. It was a great film and I would definitely recommend it. I thought that it was more than worth the price of admission.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ "The Thing" is one of those movies that is hard to describe. It's a horror movie, but one that makes you think and questions everything. It is a classic, a classic that has stood the test of time. "The Things" is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves a good scary movie. It has it's share of horror elements, but it's not a slasher film. It may not be as good as the original, but if you enjoy good films, this is a great film to watch. It isn't perfect, but that's the beauty of it. If you like classic films, you should check this one out.  Rated 4 out of 5 by kimberly from great for the genre "The things" is an example of the genre. It will give you chills and a feeling of being on a journey. The plot and characters are both well developed and well drawn. This is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It does have it's moments but this movie is more about the experience, and it is very well done. , July 29, 2004  Reviewer: Doreen from Austin, Texas I have been a fan of horror since I was a child and this movie was made as a result of my love for the horror genre. This movie does a good job at making you question the world and the characters. It was a great experience watching this movie and it was definitely worth the time.  that was my favorite part of this movie. I don't know what kind of film this is, but I think it was a movie for young children. It gave me a feeling that I was watching a movie in the 1970's and I love that kind of movie. This was my first movie ever and I can't wait to see more. I love the characters, and their actions.  I can only say that this movie left me in awe. It really made me question the nature of the world.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  _________ Review: _________________ , is an awesome movie. It is a fun movie, that will make you laugh, cry, and just sit back and enjoy the film. It takes place in the city of London, and it is an interesting city to explore. It has an interesting mix of characters, and they all play off each other well. They are all different in their own way, but they all come together to make a great film. The plot revolves around a couple of guys, who are trying to find a girl that they have met at the gym, to make their relationship a little more interesting. The guys start off a little awkward and it doesn't take long before they make a connection with this woman, and things just take off from there. I enjoyed this movie. I can see why it has been so well received. This movie is one that I think any person should watch at least once.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I saw this movie in the theater. I did not understand why it was a horror movie, but I did. It was not scary at all, but it was very effective in making you think. I also found it very interesting. The movie had a very unique and different theme. It is about a little girl named Sara who has the power of telekinesis. But she has no idea how to control it and she gets herself into a lot of trouble. The director of the movie did a great job in making the movie interesting. I really liked this movie. It had a great ending. I think the best part was when Sara was trying to kill her mother with her telekineis. She is trying to find a way to save her mother and she just couldn't control her. I highly recommend this movie if you like horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________   A few years ago, I saw a film about a man named Henry Fonda. The film was called "Fonda". The man is named Henry, and he is a rich, handsome man who lives in a mansion in California. His mansion is called "The Castle" and is built on a hill. The man's wife is named Mary and he has two children, two boys, one is named "Duke" and the other is named Edward. The movie takes place at a dinner party, where the man is having dinner with his family. He is not drinking, but he is getting into a discussion about his life, and it gets interesting when the man's son tells his father that the world is a bad place and there is no hope. Henry's response to his son is not very good. "There is no such thing as hope. If there was, I would have hope for you." The movie ends with Henry telling his son to go back to his mother, to go to hell. The end of the movie is not too bad, but the ending is very odd.   I really don't remember what happened to the man. There is a man in the movie that has a lot of the same characteristics as Henry Fondo. The people in the film are not bad, they are just people, and you don't have to believe them. But I did find this movie interesting, and I thought it was worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ My name is Mark and I am a 22 year old student living in London, England. I am currently finishing my first year of a bachelor's degree in film production and writing. The film I was in was called "A Perfect Day" and is the second film that my partner of two years (a man) and I have made together. The story of the film was about a group of friends that decide to go on a school trip to the countryside in order to catch a rare bird. We decided to make a low budget film so we could get the best local crew and make a great film. The whole experience was great. We made great friends along the way and the weather was great (in the south of England). It was a great way to spend a week and the crew did a great job. We had a lot of fun shooting the film and we got to meet lots of great people and it made us want to make more films together. One thing I will say about the film is that there was a bit of a theme of the main character being in love with his best friend. It made me think about how important it is to make friends and have someone to spend time with. We also did a lot to make the film look good and we really enjoyed shooting it. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a film to see. It is a good low budget documentary and I would definitely recommend it if you have any friends or family that you would like to make film about. _____________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The movie is about a young man named Jafar. Jafari is a prince who lives in the desert. He is so rich that he can afford to hire beautiful women to serve him. One of his mistresses is the beautiful Queen, who has fallen in love with him. He tells her that he is going to marry her, but he has no real plans to marry. So, she promises to come with him and she comes with him, but she is really a spy. She is trying to find out where the spies of the other prince are hiding out. He wants her to be his bride, but it turns out that she is also a spy and she is trying her best to spy on him. The two spies of this movie are the two sisters who are the best spy in the world. They are very wise and have been in the service of this prince for many years. This is the only good thing that I can say about this movie. The other thing that this movie has is a great score and the amazing acting of the actors. It is amazing how the film was shot. The film was filmed in the deserts of Arabia and the deserts were very beautiful. The desert scenes were filmed in such a beautiful way. The way that the desert scenes are filmed are so beautiful that it made me cry when the film ended. I really liked this movie and I would recommend this to anyone. I gave this movie a rating of 10 because it is an amazing film and it is a good film to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ "A little bit of everything" was a great way to describe this film. It's the best of a good bunch of movies that I've seen this year. It features the usual cast of characters that you might see in a slasher film, including a killer. It is a really fun movie, and it has some great gore, but the thing that made me like it was the great performances by all the actors. I really loved it and I highly recommend it. ___________________________________________________________ A little bit about me: _______________________________________________________________________ I was born and raised in Michigan. I'm a huge fan of horror, and this film has made me a fan of slasher films. The movie starts with a character called Johnny, who is a young man who has lost his family in a car accident. After some research on the internet, he goes on a search for the killer. Johnny eventually finds the killer, who calls himself the Black Phantom. The Black Phantom is a psychopath, who kills for no other reason than to live and he does this by taking a young woman who he is going to kill for a ride. He takes her out into the woods, where he kills her, and then cuts up her body into pieces and puts them in his car. The car is then driven into the forest, where it crashes. Johnny is killed by the Black Ghost, but he survives. The next morning, Johnny wakes up in a field. The first thing he does is call for help. The police find the car, and Johnny is found dead. The other survivors think that Johnny was a victim of a serial killer and that the Black Phantoms were behind the murders. But Johnny had been the victim of another person, who had taken his own life. He had died by his own hand, and there was nothing that could be done. The killer had killed his family and then committed suicide. I don't think that this film was a perfect movie, but I think that it is a good one. The main thing that makes it a good film is that it has the usual slasher elements, such as car accidents, knife fights, and murders. However, it also has a great story, a great cast of actors, and a killer who I found to be one of the most interesting and original characters I've ever seen in a film. ____________________________________________________________________ The film:   ______________________________________________________________________ "A Little Bit of Everything" was directed by Christopher Ford and it stars a number

If you can watch it at all, you'll think that it was worth it. Watch it with the sound on so you can hear the actors talking. It's a lot better when you can actually hear them.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Haunting is a fantastic film. It is an excellent horror movie and I'm glad I saw it. The cinematography is fantastic, and the performances are all amazing. The cast is great. I particularly enjoyed this part of the movie because it gave me a glimpse into the characters lives and relationships, as well as their fears and phobias. The atmosphere in this film is very spooky. It's an eerie and creepy atmosphere. The special effects in this movie are excellent. The way the shadows and smoke swirl around the camera is amazing. I think the special effects are better than most of the films made during the 70's and 80's. The score of the film is fantastic. The music by John Williams was haunting and creepy. The sound effects of the movies are also very good. The film was a great experience and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror films. It also contains many classic horror scenes and a great story.  Review written by: Anonymous on July 23, 2002

This movie was made for the American audience, but they tried to make the movie more like the book.  The plot is not as complicated as in the book, but there is a lot of stuff happening.  There is a great scene in the movie where there is another guy (the movie has the wrong spelling of his name) who is looking for a job in the country.  He meets a woman who is also looking for work.  In the beginning of the movie, they are just good friends, but she doesn't like the way he looks, and that he is too "white".  The scene where the two men are drinking together is very funny.  I can't remember what is said in this scene, but after they are finished drinking and talking about what is happening in the world, the guy goes and tells his friend that he thinks he will be a great worker.  It is one of those moments in the film that makes me laugh, because the guy thinks that he will look really good on the job, and then he is told that he does not look as good as the person who is supposed to be the manager of the company.  As a movie, it is not a very good movie.  But as a book, it really is a good book.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I saw the original "The Thing" in 1982, but did not know it was based on a horror story. I saw it again in 1984 and was blown away by how different it was. I'm a sucker for a good horror film and I knew this was the kind of film I wanted to see again. When it came out, I thought it was a throwback. I thought of it like a bad movie version of "Frankenstein" or "The Creature from the Black Lagoon." It was not a bad film, but I thought that they had made a mistake with the script. I did not understand what was going on in the beginning and when it got dark and eerie, I lost interest in the movie. This is an example of what happens when you take a good story and try to make it scary. The film never got a chance to develop any suspense. I don't know what to say about it. The whole thing seemed a little forced. I will admit that I enjoyed it a lot more after seeing it again. I hope this is a good sign.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ The plot of this movie is quite interesting. The main characters are a girl and a boy. They both live in the town of San Marino. They are both very close to each other and they both want to be together but there is a problem. The boy, Jody (J.J. Parnell), is a high school freshman who has a crush on the girl, Lyla (Katherine Heigl). Lyl-Anna (Kirsten Dunst) is a junior and she has a boyfriend who is named Sam (Aaron Paul). Sam wants Lyl to be his girlfriend because he is in love with her. The two girls go out on a date and Lyl starts to fall in love for the first time. But Sam starts to want Lyl more. Soon, the two are making plans for a big night. However, the night turns into a nightmare when Sam and Lyle (Kevin Costner) go missing. The girl and her friend, Tasha (Lori Loughlin), find Sam and the three of them go searching for them. They end up at a cabin and are chased by a group of men. It's all a big misunderstanding. Sam and his friend end up in the hospital and are being treated for their wounds. But the girls are not happy about this because they don't want to go to the cabin. The next day, they decide to go after them but Sam and Tasha get away. The movie then moves on. Sam decides to go back to Lyl, but the girl is not too happy. Then the story goes back to the girl and Lly-Anna. Sam returns and she is all right and the two of them end up together. The girls are really upset about the situation and then Lyl and Sam's boyfriend come to San Marino and start to cause a problem for the two girls. This is where the movie gets really good. The story moves along in a very exciting way. The plot gets really interesting and the characters are really interesting. I really enjoyed this movie. It was a good story with a lot of emotions. The characters are good and the story was good. I just didn't really like how Lyl was the only one who liked Sam and how the plot made her the main character. I think the movie should have been called The Girl from San Marino, but I liked it anyway.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ A movie is not just about how good it is, but also about how bad it was. That is the main point of a movie, so don't just watch it to make a point, or to have fun, or even to learn a lesson. The first part of the movie has many problems. First of all, the characters are not developed well. The main character, and most of the characters in this movie are not really interesting, but then again they are not real. They are simply caricatures. This movie was supposed to be a comedy, and it doesn't have any funny jokes. The most funny moment in the movie was when the main character was chasing the bad guys in a car and he accidentally kills the bad guy. Then he just leaves. He did not even say goodbye to the bad man, he just walked away. Then the bad bad guy runs after him and says that he would have killed him as well, but at that time, the car was too fast and the bad dude was so fast that he did not get a chance. And that is the only funny thing in this whole movie. So what was the point of this movie? Why did this movie have to be made? Well, the movie's story is basically about a guy who wants to have a good life, but instead of getting a good job and a good house and a beautiful wife and family, he is in prison for a murder he committed. Then one day, his ex-girlfriend comes to visit him, and she says that she loves him. But he has to give her a ring and he can't. Then she tells him that he should leave prison and have a better life, because the people who kill people do not get to have happy lives. So this guy has to decide what he wants, whether he wants to live or not. I don't think the story has much meaning, but I guess it has something to do with the ending. The movie's ending is pretty weak, because there is nothing really special about it. There is a big explosion, and the movie ends. There are no happy endings in this film. This film is not a comedy. It is a drama. So if you are looking for a comedy movie, you should try another movie, like "Halloween III", or "Jaws", or any other movie that is really funny. I hope this review helps you, because I did not understand this movie and I have seen a lot

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________.  It is a little bit hard to say something about this movie. I saw it only on DVD, which is still pretty new. I don't know if there are a lot of people who have seen it. This is a film made by a very nice director (Mariane Wold) and with a good script by (Mikael Persbrandt). This movie is not really a mystery movie. It is a movie about a guy who was born blind. In this movie he finds a woman who helps him to be able to see. This movie does not follow any kind of detective-story. It shows the life of the blind man in the beginning. He has his own difficulties. In the beginning the guy is very naive and thinks that everything is going well. This guy is a nice guy. The movie has a good ending. I recommend this movie to everyone. The picture is really nice and the sound is nice. The special effects are very nice. I liked the story of the movie. For more information, please visit:

I also loved the acting and the cinematography. I wish that more people would make movies like this. I hope to see a sequel!   It is really hard to put in words what this movie was like. It is a very intense film. There is a lot of action and the story is about a young man who is having a difficult time. He is an alcoholic and lives in a small town in the mountains. He doesn't like his life and his friends aren't his friends. The only person he trusts is his father. His father is an abusive alcoholic and the film explores the father/son relationship. He wants to go back to his old life but his father won't let him go. He ends up in a hospital after a car accident. He starts to remember his past life. This leads him to a town that has many demons. He learns about the demons and he starts to believe in them. He eventually makes a deal with one of the demons. The demon is really like a character in the movie. It isn't just there to act. The demons make a lot more of a connection with him. They tell him that they are trying to take over his life but he needs to trust them. I found the film very interesting and entertaining. It also got very emotional and at times I found myself crying. I felt that this was a very strong film.   This movie was very well made. The cinematography is amazing. There are a lot scenes that really make you think. It gives you the idea of what the world is like. This movie was a lot darker than the trailers. This film is a dark thriller and you will definitely get a good scare. The ending was very cool. It was a good ending. The film doesn't end on a happy note. It ends on a very emotional note. I enjoyed the movie a lot. It has a lot going on in it and I can't wait to see more.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Reviewed by: Anonymous Rating: 1.5 (out of 5) Reviewed By: Anonymous This movie was a good one, but the film's quality was affected by poor sound recording, as well as some problems with the film. For example, the sound effects of some explosions are not accurate and are very loud, and the sound of the plane's engines during the crash are not heard properly at all. Also, the plane crash scene is a bit strange. During the crash, the camera follows the plane, while at the same time the sound is cut off. This is a good example of a film that could be improved in the technical aspect, and in my opinion, it should be included in this collection of classic war films. _________ Reviewed from: __________________________________________________________

This is one of those rare "good" films that are made at the right time.   For me, this is the film that is closest to what I think an action movie should be. The action is good, the characters are interesting, the action is well done and it doesn't take itself too seriously. The soundtrack is great and the story is intriguing and compelling.   The only problem I have with the film is that it does take itself so seriously.   (It would have been more interesting to see the two main characters in their underwear, but that doesn't change the fact that they are in a film about action, and that's what action films do.)   Overall, I give this a solid 4.5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* I loved this movie. There were a few things I liked about it but the one I liked most was the fact that it took the genre of horror and used it to tell a good story. I'm not saying that you have to like horror to enjoy this movie but if you are a fan of horror movies, especially the horror genre, this is a must watch. If you like suspenseful movies, then this movie is for you. This movie has a great suspenseful ending and a great story. If I could give it a lower rating it would be because it's a little short at 10 hours. The characters were very well done and I loved the different voices of the characters. It was good to see more characters from the show in the movie. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and it was a great watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ "The Dark Knight" (2008) is a film that I have watched over and over again and it has changed the way I view movies. The first time I watched it, it made me feel very uncomfortable. The movie was full of tension, horror, and a little bit of humor. There was a lot going on that made it difficult to sit through the entire film. This was because of the dark and disturbing nature of the movie. This is something I never want to see again. This movie had a strong focus on the villain Bane and how he was trying to destroy Gotham City. The Joker was there to help him and destroy Batman. The two villains teamed up to kill Batman. It was amazing how the two villains were able to do this, but it was very scary and made me very uneasy. I was also surprised that the movie was so good. The story was very good. It had all of the elements that I look for in a good story: drama, action, suspense, and suspenseful. I love a good crime/thriller story. This story had all those elements. The acting was amazing, the writing was good, and the directing was perfect. There were some moments that were slightly awkward, but overall it was perfect for this movie. The Dark Knight is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This film really made me a fan of the Batman character. I am a big fan of this movie and will never watch another movie about him. I give The Dark knight a B+ "The Dark knight is a fantastic movie. It has everything I like about Batman. All of the characters were interesting and well written. I also liked the action in this movie a lot. I liked the fighting, the way Bane was able to get through all of Batman's armor and traps. The villains were very well done. The whole movie was very well acted." - David C. I have read reviews about this movie that said that this movie is dark and depressing. This wasn't the case for me. I enjoyed the dark mood this movie had. The characters were well written and they were all very interesting. This helped create a lot of tension in this film. The storyline was very intriguing. I loved how it was set up. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes Batman movies. This one has been one of my favorites. I gave this movie an A.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski  is a movie about a group of friends that go out on a road trip to visit their uncle in Vermont.  As they travel they find themselves in a lot of strange situations and in the end find out that they are all brothers and that their uncle is the devil.  There is a lot going on in this movie.  The main character Jeff ( Jeff Bridges ) is in the first movie as a car mechanic.  He finds out that he is going to be the new owner of his uncle's shop.  It turns out that the man who is running the shop is a very powerful person who will be able to control everyone.  Jeff and the other members of the group must stop him.  A lot of people seem to be in the movie for no real reason.  There are some nice moments in the film.  I especially enjoyed the scenes where Jeff and his group try to stop the man from getting rich and powerful.  One of my favorite scenes in the entire movie.   I also really enjoyed the opening scene when the group starts to realize what they are in for.   There is a great scene when Jeff is talking with his friend Todd about the situation.  Todd tells Jeff that they all need to find out what the man is really up to.  At this point I had to stop watching the movie. It was getting too crazy.  So much happened in this film.   The plot was interesting but there were just too many twists.  This film really needed a lot more time to unfold.  Finally Jeff finds out why he is being put in this situation.   It turns the plot on its head.  What started out as a comedy with Jeff as the new boss turned into a horror movie. I enjoyed this movie very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is a movie that I would have loved to watch a decade ago.  That said, I had no idea that this would become one of the best movies of the 20th century.    It's a movie I could watch with my family and still have fun.  The script is excellent.  It's not overly complicated, and the characters don't seem to be going through anything that they can't handle.  There's a reason the movie is called "The Big" and not "The" Big.  You might say that the characters are self-centered and the plot is simple.  In this movie, there's a great deal of humor.  I would say that there's about 10 different jokes in this movie that are funny.  This movie also has a lot of great one liners.  If you're a fan of stand up, then this movie is a must see.  For the first time ever, I was a big fan of the Coen Brothers.  They took a classic story and made it even better.  As a movie, "The Dude" is the perfect way to end the decade.  When you think about it, this movie was released a decade before The Big Lebowksi was released.  "The Stranger" is also a great movie that you can watch if you have a big family and a lot to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** 'The Road' is a true story, but a great one. It's about a couple in a rural area in Canada who, when a storm passes through, end up traveling to the Canadian Rockies to find a way to save their farm. The movie was made in the late 60s and it's the only movie in that time that's a true road movie. It shows us how the road can be a lonely and dangerous place. And it shows us a couple who really want to get out there and explore. The story is told in a very slow, sometimes slow-motion, way, and it was an amazing movie to see with my dad when I was a kid. It also taught me how to drive by showing me how close to death you can get driving at high speeds in a vehicle. My favorite scenes in this movie were the ones in the town where the couple visits and the scenes of them driving around the farm. There's a lot of great acting in this film as well. I particularly like the part where the wife of the husband is crying in the car as she and the husband go back to their home and try to find out how the storm has affected their farm (I think it's just the rain that has affected the fields). The ending is a bit slow, but I guess that was the intention. This movie also showed how many things can go wrong when a couple is going on a road trip. I've seen it a couple of times since it was released and it still holds up as a great movie. I don't think I'll ever tire of it, but the only real flaw I have is the fact that it doesn't have the same ending that it has in the movie's original version.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The Last Boy Scout  By: Brian O'Neill (7/21/99) This is a movie that really works for me. This movie is like an old time Western. You will enjoy this movie if you love old time westerns. You won't enjoy this film if you have never seen a western before. The only thing I would like to see changed is that the old time west music would be a little more upbeat. If this film were released today, I think the audience would like it better. This film is a good, fun movie with great characters and a good ending. I give this film a 9/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** **HIGH LIFE** ***** - The movie is a fun little romp through a small town in Texas, the sort of movie that makes you wish you could go there. The movie does its best to show that small town life is a good thing, the only bad thing is that the town is small and there isn't a whole lot to see. - There is some action scenes, but nothing really special. The action scenes are mostly just characters running around and fighting with each other. It's not a very impressive scene to watch. - The music in the movie is very nice, and the acting is good. There is one scene in the film where the movie tries to make a movie about a murder, but it ends up feeling more like a comedy. - I really liked the ending. It was just too perfect, and it's nice to see a movie that has a happy ending. The story of High Life is about a man named Billy D (who is played by Paul Walker), who, when he is a kid, is very shy and always had trouble making friends. After his father is killed in a car accident, his mother has to take care of him, and she has no money. He ends up at the local high school, and meets a girl named Jessica (played by Amy Smart), who he falls for. It turns out that the local town is run by a bunch of old guys who all think that Jessica is really a witch, and that the old men are going to sacrifice her to the devil for a hundred dollars. Billy gets a job as the town's "marshal", and is given a team of high schoolers, who will act as his protectors. It all turns out okay, and Billy is finally able to get the town to start believing in him. I liked the way that the movie shows the town in a different light. It gives the town a new lease on life. I also liked the scene where Billy, with the help of the high school students, is able to stop a local kid from being burned at the stake. I think it's one of the best scenes in the entire movie. ***Final Verdict:*** ***RATED A*** - It's a nice little raunchy movie, but the story is pretty bad. There are a few parts that I really enjoyed, but for the most part, High Life just feels like a silly movie about teenagers in Texas. - High Life should be rated higher
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (1957) (1958) - George Cukor is the best director of all time.  I don't know what he did to earn that title but he made the best.  And it's not just his talent but his professionalism.  His film was shot on 16mm and he was so committed to making a picture that he had a stuntman on set to get them to walk on stilts.  The movie is based on the book 'The Good Samaritan' by William Faulkner.  Faulkney's writing was so good that Cukors used it in his screenplay.  He used real locations in his film and I don't believe that he would have been able to get this movie made if he hadn't used Faulkneys' words.   The Good Samaritans are not just good people.  They are people with their own agenda.  What is their agenda?  It's the protection of the weak.  That's it.  But this is not a story about the good and bad people.   It is about people who are just like the Samaritans.  It shows the evil of war and the evil that war creates.   But it also shows the bravery of the people who stand against it.   And what is the real bad guy in this movie?  The bad guy is the man who wanted to destroy America.  George Cuhor was a great director who never forgot his roots and never gave up on what he loved.  'The Bad and the United' is a great movie and I hope to see more from him. 3. 'The Big Sleep' (1959) - This is my favorite movie of all-time.  I've seen it hundreds of times and it always brings a smile to my face.  Robert Wise, the great British actor, did an incredible job as the main character in this classic.  If you are interested in a great adaptation of a great novel this is a must see.  Also, there are so many great scenes in this film.  The main character is a very simple man named Henry Foster.  Henry is a rich businessman who takes a walk in the woods one night and is swept away by a wave of sleep.  When Henry wakes up he is in a new town.  Then he meets his new neighbor and best friend, Billie Burke.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ [Insert your name here.] You know, I've heard a lot of bad things about "The Interview," and one of the worst things I heard was that Seth Rogen's performance as Kim Jong-un was so terrible that it ruined the whole movie. But this is really a movie about the weirdness and weirdness of being an adult. Seth Roddenberry is the best director ever. If "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" is about Spock's journey into manhood, "The Motion Picture" is all about Roddensberry's journey out of his. His love of science fiction led him to write a show called "The Next Generation," and he then had a very successful series of movies based on the Star Trek novels. (There was also a TV show called, yes, "Starfleet," but it never got off the ground. It never got to air on TV.) His original idea for the "Star Wars" movies was to make a series of non-fiction movies about the adventures of the people who lived and worked in the fictional city of Coruscant. They would be based on Star Wars novels by Roddinberry, George Lucas, and Michael Arndt. This idea didn't work, and Rodding, who is as much a science fiction writer as a screenwriter, wrote and directed "The Search for Spock" and "The Voyage Home" in the 1980s. He and his writing partner, Simon Pegg, have a terrific sense of humor, and their movies always contain some very funny, sometimes silly, scenes, especially in the early years. And their latest movie is about a very, very weird situation: two guys are going to interview Kim Jong Il, and they're going to ask him a bunch of questions about his life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ It was good! I thought it was pretty good. I mean, it is not really a masterpiece like a lot of the movies I see, but it is good, and it is a decent enough movie. I liked the ending. It was like a happy ending. But it was not like a typical happy ending, like "it's over" or "it was all worth it." It was more like "we got through it" or a "I think we can make it out of here." This movie is good. It is just good. Not a masterpiece, but good. The ending is good because it is one of those endings that you don't think will end, but you are not prepared for it. You think "it won't last long", and you are wrong. And the movie is okay because it doesn't have anything to do with the story of the movie. It just tells a story. The movie is about a guy named Steve who has a girlfriend, but she left. So Steve is on his own. He starts a business called "The Game," and he has to find a girl, and he can't find one. So he goes to a party, and the girl says "I'm sorry I can't go." Steve tells her that he can give her a ride home. They go back to the house, and she gets into the car. They start to drive away, but then a car crashes into the windshield. The windshield breaks. They both get out, and Steve takes her home. The next day, he gets in the car, and they drive out of town. They stop at a bar, and there's a guy there. Steve tells him what happened. The guy is called "Steve" (the name is not important). The guy asks Steve if he is OK. Steve says he is. The two drive away. After they leave, the guy gets out of the car and runs out of a window. Steve runs back into the house. He finds a girl that looks like his girlfriend. The girl asks Steve how he got in the house and Steve says "the car accident." She doesn't understand, and asks "who did it?" Steve says that it was a car. The girlfriend asks why he is telling her all this. Steve answers that he doesn't want her to think that he was the guy that did it. The wife comes into the room and asks what's going on. Steve explains that the guy was

After a school shooting, she meets a young girl with similar problems, but who is also the daughter of a high-ranking police officer. They soon fall in love and fall in step with the same kind of people. It soon becomes clear that Aya is not alone, and the pair soon finds themselves in the middle of a conspiracy and a struggle for power. This movie has all the elements of a psychological thriller, from the main character's social awkwardness, to the fact that Aiya and the main female character are in love. This film was well-received at the time, and was followed by sequels and a live-action movie.  Watch the trailer here:   The movie: The movie is based on the novel by Yoko O'Brien, which was originally written for her sister, author Aya Baccarin. The book tells the story of a female teenager named Aya who becomes the sole survivor of a school massacre. Her only memory is that she is a "monster" and the police are after her. The
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I've been wanting to watch "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" since it was released in theaters and now I finally have the chance. I have to admit I was skeptical at first. The trailer looked like a porno but the movie itself was much more interesting. There were a lot of things going on in this movie. I think that this movie is very hard to watch and if you're not a fan of this genre of films you should stay away from this one. It's definitely a horror movie but it has a lot more going on than you think. I don't think this movie was well made and it's a shame that it took a movie like this to really bring something new to the genre. The girls and the director are doing a good job with the movie. It had its good and bad points but the only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because of the sex scenes.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Both Worlds  (1984).  One of the best episodes of the classic Star Trek TV show.  A fantastic adventure about the crew of the Enterprise getting into a fight with a Romulan ship, and one of the first great space battles to come out of the Original Series.  I was not a fan of Star Trek at all.    I have only watched a few episodes of it and found them uninspired and boring.  I am a fanboy for Star Trek but I always wanted to see a good, original Star Trek.  This episode was a big break for me.  It was a fun episode that did not have to worry about the Original Generation cast, as we are still on their ship and they are the main focus.  The action and suspense was just enough for me to enjoy it.  There are plenty of action scenes, as the crew does some very cool maneuvers and blows up a lot of ships.  Even the Romulans have a role in the story, as they show up and try to stop the Enterprise.  We get a bit of a romance with a female Romuland in this episode.  If you are a fan you should see this episode, but if you are not, it may not make a huge difference in your enjoyment of Star Wars.  As for the movie, I think it is the best of both worlds.  One of the most fun and exciting space battles I have ever seen.  A fantastic movie for fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, and a great way to start off the new trilogy.  Recommended

This is the only part of this movie that made me smile. The acting was spot on. It was a real treat to watch. My kids didn't get all that they wanted out of this, but we did. We're still watching it every night. My son is 6 and a half and he gets more and more excited every time. My husband and I are both retired and it makes a nice change. Thank you for making it easy to find a movie to watch on your computer."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've seen this year.  Not only is it a well made, well acted, well written and well acted film, it's also really funny.    A good example of a good comedy is a film like The Hangover  or Blair Witch Project  where the jokes are well written, well paced and well executed.  The film opens with a couple of cops (a guy and a girl) in a parking lot.    The guy asks the girl if she'd like to buy a bottle of whiskey.  It's a pretty simple premise and it's done well.  The movie then quickly takes a turn for the weird, as a woman (I think) comes out of a small diner, her back is to the cops.  She's naked and she has some sort of black liquid (I can't tell what it is) down her legs.  Then she pulls a gun out and shoots at them.  When the cops are looking for the shooter, the woman goes down and the cops (with the help of a woman they're chasing) find out that she was a drug addict and she just went into a drug rehab center.  But the weird part is when the cops find out she was pregnant.  I've never seen this in a movie before, but it's just one of those things you don't see too often.  We follow the cop chase to the rehab center and the doctors trying to save the baby.  This part is actually pretty good.  You see how hard the doctors work and how close the cops come to getting her.  As the doctors get closer, we get more of the story and I really liked it.  They don't waste time on boring information, they go straight to the important stuff.  There's also a really nice scene where the girl's father is talking to her mother.  He wants her to go back to her old life.  So, he says he's going to help her get sober and she says she doesn't want to go, that she loves her new life. The story of the rehab is really good, and I loved the doctors, especially the guy who is the "Dr. Strangelove" of this whole movie.  What I don't like about the movie is that the director cuts so many scenes out.  A lot of time is wasted.  Here's a good example: The movie cuts away from

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   (Don't like to give out stars. That would be boring. Instead, we rate a movie on its own merits. So here goes.)   1. A little girl who is in a wheelchair goes into a circus. She falls in love with a gorilla. She becomes a circus performer.   2. There are a lot of characters and many different stories. The story is just about her love story with a giant gorilla.   for those of you who are not familiar with agoras, they are apes that live on the bottom of the sea. They can swim, and their eyes are not red. They have the ability to talk and they have a special sense of smell. There is also a monkey that lives with them and the gorilla is his mother. The movie starts with a lot more talking then it does actually.   in this movie, she is just learning how to act like a human being and be a performer. She is trying to become like the gorilla so she can help him with his circus.   and the more she does it, the more excited she gets. Then she meets the gorilla, and she is amazed by the way he speaks and acts. She tries to get him to do things with her that are "too good" for a gorilla and she gets him to dance. She even kisses him on the mouth. She gets him naked, and gets him into the tub with her. Then the gorilla and her make love. Then, they make love, and it is a very good time.   to make the movie more interesting, we get to see her try to be like a gorilla as well. We see a gorilla show her how to be a human. She does things like kiss a man, and do her makeup. She starts to fall in love. She has to stop the gorilla from making love to her. He wants to have sex with her and she does not want to let him.   the movie is good, because it is very sweet and very funny.   of course, the gorilla tries to have more sex with the girl and she tries to stop him. I found it very funny, but the movie was too short for me to remember all the scenes.   the movie was very well made. It was great to see a young girl trying to live life the way she wants to. And that's what the gorilla does, but not with the same amount of enthusiasm she has for it. She really wants to
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ __________ Wish I could have seen this movie at a theater when it was in its original release. The story is pretty good. The acting is good, especially the one in the supporting role. The plot isn't too complicated. The ending was a little bit of a let down. I would have loved to see a sequel to this movie. This movie was shot in a period of time. It is pretty much a Western. The movie was released in the United States in 1968 and was very popular then. This is the movie that made the first western star John Wayne a star. John Wayne played a cowboy in this movie, and the story revolves around the relationship between him and his horse. John and the horse are in the middle of a war. John is trying to get home to his wife, and his wife is trying desperately to keep the horse alive. The horse is killed and John is captured. He is being held by the Mexicans and they are threatening to kill him. John meets up with some soldiers and manages to escape. He goes on to kill many of the Mexicans. At the end of the movie he gets his revenge and gets back to his beloved wife.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ This film is a solid sequel to the original film, and although the plot of the film has changed, the characters are the same. The story is not as well written as the first, and I felt that the actors did not do a very good job in portraying the characters. However, the story was very enjoyable and the ending was very good. The acting of the actors was very well done, and the director of this film did a good job. This film does not have a lot of action, but it has a great story. The plot is very well written, and there is not a lot to do in the movie. I recommend this film to fans of the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** 'A Good Day To Die Hard' is a fun action movie that has a lot of action scenes. You'll feel like you're in a good action movie. If you are a fan of action, you will love this movie. There's a lot to love about this movie, especially for those who like action movies. I recommend this movie for all action fans. 'A good day to die hard' will be a classic movie in the action genre. It's funny and exciting at the same time. I have a feeling that 'A great day to be a movie star' will come out in the near future. There are many sequels coming up, so I'm sure 'A Day To Be A Movie Star' will make a comeback too. It has a great action movie feel to it. 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' was not a good film. There was no humor or comedy in it. The main character is a stereotypical Kazakh. I don't like this kind of film. The jokes were too funny. 'Cobra' was a pretty good movie. The movie had a lot more action scenes than 'A day to day'. The movie was good. The action scenes were very entertaining. It was good in every sense of the word. It had a good pace and you can feel the excitement of the action scenes in this movie as the movie progresses. The story was good, but I wish it had a bit more humor. I think it would have been better if it was a comedy. 'Dirty Grandpa' was okay. It is funny at times, but it isn't great. The characters in this film are pretty stereotypical, so it wasn't a good choice for me. 'Funny Games' is great. It really is a good comedy. It isn't good in the sense that it's funny, but there's a nice story. It also has a nice sense of humor, and the action in this story is pretty good. I really like this movie and it is a very entertaining movie. It just has a different tone from a lot other action movies, but its good nonetheless. It makes me feel good as a movie fan to see movies that have a different style from other action.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This movie is amazing! It is very well made, with an amazing story and a great ending.

This movie really made me appreciate women, and how important it is to have them in movies. This was the first time I saw the movie in the theater, and it is now one of my favorite movies to watch, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy and has a love of horror films. I will be watching the sequel soon, and this is a great movie for anyone to watch!

I would have liked to see it a little longer but other than that, a great jump scare movie.

I loved it, but I am sad that I can't see it in the cinema because the tickets cost over 100$. I just hope that the next one will be better than the first one. A movie like this will make a lot of people cry, especially if you are a fan of movies like "The Matrix", and "The Fifth Element". I would recommend it to everyone, and I am looking forward to watching it again. It is so good that I want to buy the DVD for my friend and I to watch together. The movie is so original, so good, and so beautiful that I don't want to watch it alone, it will be too emotional for me.

It is a story about two brothers who are sent to a school to find out what happened to their father, a priest who was killed in the World War. I personally liked the story because it made me think and see things that are not obvious, especially in the first part of the movie. The first part is the most interesting part because it shows how their father and his son are different. He is a good father, but he never cared about his children, and only cared about himself. He didn't care about his family or his people. He wanted only to get rich and get out of the house. His son, on the other hand, is more caring, more loyal, and more dedicated to his father and the people of his town. He did care about them and loved them, but it was just a facade, and in order to survive, he had to kill those people, even though they were his family. I found the movie very emotional and it is very hard to watch because you know you are watching a sad story. There are some moments that make you angry, but in the end, they are only moments. In the end it was a good story with some good performances.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gods of Egypt" is an extremely faithful adaptation of the classic story.  This movie is a must see if you want to see some of the best actors in their prime.  1.  "King Kong" (1933)   This is a very faithful version of the Kong story. The movie is an epic epic.   2.  King Kong: The Official Movie Soundtrack  (1968)   This is the soundtrack to the classic film "King" Kong.  The song that plays on the end credits is "Godzilla" by The Four Seasons.   3.    The King of Kong (1954)      The King of Manhatten is the king of New York.  He is a ruthless, powerful, yet loving man who loves his family and friends.  After his mother's death he is raised by his uncle.  In a moment of weakness, he decides to become King of the apes and rule the apes in peace.  With the help of his loyal wife, he leads the ape army and goes to war with the humans.  They have a few more battles before they are defeated by the human army.  At the end of the movie, Kong has been put into a cage, his father has died, and the king is in mourning.  This movie is probably the best adaptation of Kong that has been made.  It's so close to the original that you can almost smell the popcorn and feel the warmth of the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  The film has been out for a year and it's a real treat to finally see it again.  I didn't think it would be that good when I first saw it. But I'm glad I saw it because I loved it. I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but I'm a sucker for a good sci- fi movie. So when I saw this film, I was really excited. And when it was over I felt like I had just seen a really good sci fi movie!  It is very different from the previous film in that it's set in the near future and the aliens have already landed. And that was a very big deal to me. It wasn't just about aliens in the previous films. This one was about what it means to be human and what the future would look like. ,  And there is an interesting way that they did this, which was very cool. In the first film they had a lot of scenes that were about the future and about humanity. But this time they took that a bit further and made it about how humanity would interact with the aliens. That was a really cool touch and I really enjoyed that.  the aliens had a different personality that we saw in the first.  of course there was the good aliens. They are very nice and kind and they have a very strong presence. I loved them. . And I really loved that. It's not like the alien was just sitting around being a bad guy, he had a plan, he wanted to get to the city and take over. The good alien was very interesting because he wanted the planet and to take over the city. But he had his own agenda and he had to do things that were very difficult. But in the end it was all for the good. It was a good film. I thought it was a better film than the first one.  (It's not as good as the second one but it's still very good.) The music is a bit better. The ending was a bit more touching, although it is kind of a cheesy ending. It reminded me of the ending of the first movie, when they found the alien egg. I'm glad it is back. I liked the new aliens a lot. There were a couple of parts in this movie that I didn't like. The first one was when the humans went to find the aliens and we saw the aliens running away. But that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was in love with this movie.  This movie is the perfect example of what a great drama movie should be.    I was very interested in the main character and his family.  They are in the middle of a difficult situation and the love for their daughter makes it difficult for them to see a change in their situation.  I love how they are not afraid to do something about it.  This is a movie you can sit down and watch for hours.  For those who don't know, this movie was made by a German movie producer named Ernst Lubitsch.  He was not a great director at the time, but he made this movie with love.  It's a shame that he died before it was released.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good flick, but the acting is not very good.  The director seems to want to make this film about two guys who want to win the prize and make it their own.  But I think the main idea of the movie is the same as the story of the first movie: a guy meets a girl and they start to fall in love.  It's a nice idea, but not very well developed.  There are no characters in the movie that are more important than the two guys.  And if you watch this movie too early, you might get disappointed.  I guess it's a movie for those who want something simple, but with some drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My Rating: 5 out of 5 stars (Very Good) The reason why this movie is so good is because of the chemistry between the characters. I really liked all the characters that are in this movie. The chemistry between them was amazing. They were all very good actors and I think that all of them were able to make it work. The reason I give this movie a 5 is because it is a good family movie that just happens to be a fantasy movie. This movie has everything you need in a fantasy. It has good plot, great acting, and a great soundtrack. It also has a good ending. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the acting. The kids were acting like they were on TV. There was one scene in the movie where a kid did not even know who the girl was and that was too much for me. This scene was also not that realistic. So if you want to watch a good fantasy movie that has great acting then this movie will do it.

However, I have seen many such films, and most of them I enjoyed, such as "Gone Girl," "The Imitation Game," and "Skyfall." In "American Sniper," however, the editing was horrible. It made the movie seem more like a poorly done television drama than a genuine war film. The editing was bad enough that when the movie was over, I felt as if I had just seen it and then had to go to sleep. There was no way I could get into this movie and watch it over and over again. I didn t want to give this one a chance. ____________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like  Hangover 2  you'll like    The Hangover  3.  This time around, the Hangover sequel is set in Los Angeles.   The story is much the same.  There is a new character, but the main cast is back with the same characters.  I love the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Anna Faris.  But I do wish the story was a little more serious.  I love that the script is as funny as it is and there is so much of it.  It's really entertaining.  I have to say, the music is amazing.  For the second movie, I really like how the music has been replaced with a rock and roll soundtrack.  This movie is very much a family affair.  Will Ferrel and Anna Fares play a married couple who go to a party and have a bad night.  In the morning, Will Fer Relieves Anna in his office.  He goes on to tell her about the party.  Anna's reaction is priceless.  She asks if she is crazy.  Now this is where the movie shines.  A hilarious, yet touching conversation.  The film really does get serious at times and I was wondering what would happen if one of the kids did not come home at the end of the night.   If you want a fun, laugh out loud comedy, then this is a must see.   The Hangover 3 will be available on Blu-ray & DVD on May 10th.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  "The End of the Road" is a good horror movie.  It is an interesting horror movie, with a good plot and some good acting. The ending was pretty sad, but I can see the writer trying to give a good ending.  the acting is a bit weird, but still it was fun to watch it. The movie is about a truck driver, who gets lost in a road. The road has no markings, and when he comes to a stop, he is in the middle of a forest. The truck driver is in his early 30s, and is the only person in the forest. He is alone and he is scared, because he can not figure out how he got there. As he starts walking, he begins to hear strange sounds and the trees start to move. The only way out is to get out of the truck, but he has no money. So he makes his way out, but it is not a good way to get there. He ends up in a cemetery. He gets attacked by a zombie, who kills him. He then wakes up in the hospital, and finds that his truck is broken and he cannot get his truck out of there. ....  If you are into horror movies, then you should check this movie out.  a good story, good acting, some good horror, and a good end.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I've never heard of this movie until I saw it on a movie festival screening a few years ago. I had no idea what to expect when I saw the poster, and it's clear from the trailer that this was going to be a horror movie. But it wasn't, not really. The movie itself was well made, with a well acted cast and a pretty decent plot. It's just not scary at all. I really didn't think there would be much going on, but it was a really nice movie to watch and was very relaxing. I loved the look of the house, the look and feel of the family's home. I wish I had seen it before it was so out of my price range. The ending was very strange. If I'm being honest, I don't think I've seen a movie with such a bizarre ending. Maybe if they'd shown it again in a theater I could see it in a different light, but I wouldn't see it again. It was pretty creepy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Man.  The Best Man is a documentary about John Candy, the actor who portrayed the father of "Mr. Mom." The film is an honest look at a man whose father was a man who couldn't be around his son. He died young of an overdose and John Candy never forgot his dad. The film looks at the actor's love of football and his love for his mother, who died at a young age, and how his father was always there for him. John Candy was also a father figure to a number of young kids and was able to help them through the tough times. John was a great friend and even took time out of his busy schedule to watch his kids in high school.  A great movie.  The Best Boy is a film that is about a man, and his wife, who was trying to find a father for their two children. When they finally found a father, he was a strange, older man, who never spoke to them and they never saw him again. The two men eventually find out that their father is now living in a retirement home and they eventually come back to visit him. They find that his son was taken from him, and they come to realize that he was the reason for his son's father being a drunk. This film is a good, realistic look at how a father can be so cruel. The best thing about this film is the acting. It is the perfect balance of good acting and good acting that make you want to see what happened to the two men. John Candy and John Belushi in " The Best Boy."  There is no denying that "The Best Boys" is a great movie that has a great message. It really shows the effect that a father has on his children.  The Best Boys  is a film about the loss of a father that could have been, and that he did not receive enough credit for. John Beluis and John Cusack play two men who were trying to become fathers, but were unable to. The Best Brother is a really good movie that is a very good look at what it is like to be a father. The characters in the film are all very different, but all are very funny and very likeable.   One of the best scenes in this film, which is a huge surprise. John and Charlie were really funny together. This movie is one of the greatest films of all time. What is your favorite John Candy

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The film, while somewhat of a "junkie film" by its very nature, does a great job of making a fun film. The actors are excellent and the direction is solid. The script is a bit dated, and the film's story was not as compelling as the screenplay, but the characters are great and the music, especially by Johnny Mercer, is a joy to listen to. The movie does have its flaws, and at times the film is a little slow to start, but it's not bad at all. This is a movie that you will enjoy and remember. It has great music and characters, and is a fun ride.

The only good thing that was in this film was the soundtrack, which was amazing. The music in this is the best sound that I have ever heard in a movie. I really love the music in movies and this soundtrack is so good. It has so many amazing songs, it's one of the best movie soundtracks.

I thought the movie was fairly paced and that it was a good enough movie to make me want to go see it again. I didn't think it was the best movie, but it was ok. I'm sure I'll see it a few more times.

So the guy starts to search again and finds the woman, and the husband. He tells the man to go back to the house and tell the people that the husband is coming back.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Good Day to Die Hard  is a film with a lot of potential, but the story does not work for me. The script is simple, but it doesn't seem that way in the film. There are a few moments in the movie that are not as funny as they could be, but I'm sure if you read the script you would have noticed that they were there.  I'm sure it was written with the idea of making the movie seem more epic and "action packed". It was also shot in a way that made the character's eyes pop out of their head, making them look very crazy. The plot seems like it has a lot going on at one time, but in reality it's only a small part of a larger plot.  The plot is the first thing that was really confusing for me as the story is very complicated. I thought the first few hours of the film were going to be about a man trying to find a bomb in the world's most secure building. I was wrong. The man is a hero, but he is also a traitor. He goes into the building to save a woman he doesn't know, but ends up finding himself in a very strange situation.  The story of the movie is not very interesting and it just seems to be a case of "The hero goes to the building, and everything goes wrong". I'm not saying the story wasn't interesting, but some things didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  I do have a good feeling that the sequel will get better, but as it stands right now, it's a good idea to skip it.  For me, the movie did a great job at showing the difference between the hero and the villain. The hero is a man who really needs to be in a good mood, as his situation is so bad. He also has to deal with his own fear of dying, and it's all very intense.  As for the villain, he's an extremely cold, cold-hearted man who has a plan that he does not want to share with anyone. The villain is a very different kind of villain.  My only real complaint about the movie was the acting. It is very obvious that there was a lot less money spent on this movie. The actors did a decent job of showing that they could act, but nothing seemed to really connect with me. I would like to see more actors get roles like this, but at the same time

Reviewer: alden - favorite favorite favorite - December 12, 2008  Subject: "The King of Kings" The movie is just the story of the man who became king, who became a slave, who becomes king again, and who finally becomes a king. He never really gets his due. He is a good man, and there are some good scenes in the movie. But the story was a bit overdone. And it was also a lot of fun to watch the movie because it is so interesting. And the movie is well made and very well acted. - December 6, 2008"The King Of Kings"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers (2012) - I was really excited to see this film. It's not as good as the first film, but it is good and the characters are interesting and well done. The main character of Tony Stark is not as well developed as Iron Man and Thor, but he is still good in his own right. The story takes a little too long, but I understand why it is being kept in a one-hour format. The film is more a battle movie, and I have no problem with that. I was not blown away, but that is the way I like my action movies. The plot makes sense and it's good, but the characters in the movie are not all that interesting. The Avengers should have had more of a villain in this film, something to keep the story going. The Avengers is available on Blu-ray/DVD and Digital HD from Amazon and other online retailers.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What do you get when you cross a vampire, a werewolf, and a killer from a movie by Quentin Tarantino? You get _________. It's an awesome movie and definitely one of the best from Tarantino. It's a perfect mixture of old-school action and gore, and the characters are all great. There is some amazing fights in this movie, including one in which a killer is trying to kill his victim by shooting him with a shotgun. The movie takes place in a small town called New Orleans. It has a small population of about 20,000 people, but is home to a small, close-knit community. In the movie, it's shown that vampires can be seen all over the town, and most of them are harmless. The townspeople have a saying: "When there's a vampire in the woods, we can run like hell." Well, that's what they do. One day, a girl called Claire comes to the town to look for her missing mother. She meets up with the town's vampire hunter (David Carradine) who is also her former teacher. They find out that a girl named Zoe has been murdered by the town vampire, who wants to kill her so that he can eat her. Zoe has an amulet, a crystal which will stop the vampire's feeding. However, there are four other people in the town who have the same amulet, and they are all vamps. Zoe needs to escape from the vampire town and her amulet. After the death of Claire's mother, she and David make a pact. If David can kill all the vamps in the vampire village, Zoe will get the amulet and David will get to eat her body. Unfortunately, David does not want to kill the town vampires, but he also doesn't want to get Zoe killed. The whole movie takes around 20-30 minutes, and it's totally worth it. The action scenes are amazing, and even if the story isn't really about vampires, it has a lot of heart. It was a good choice to make a movie about vampires in a town where vamps were a common thing. A couple of the actors are good, like David Carradines as David Carver, and Claire Danes as Claire. The other actors in this were good, too. However the only one that I liked, was the werewolf named Rene, who was played by Sam Neill. It might have been a little bit too late to

It's a classic that is so well-made that it's almost surprising. The acting is top-notch and the music and cinematography is outstanding. The violence is brutal, but not gratuitous. And the film is a classic. It is just one of those films that is timeless. It holds up beautifully today. If you are a fan of the Italian-American Mafia, this film is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ A friend of mine used to be a huge horror fan. He told me a story about a guy who had a really great story in the movies about the devil. It was called Devil's Playground, and it starred John Wayne and the late, great Jack Palance. After a long night of drinking, John Wayne, his friend and the real actor, Robert De Niro, went to the local bar to drink. Wayne was looking for some company, so he invited De Niry. But the real De Nire said he had a little too much to drink, and had to go home. That was the end of the movie. After Wayne left the bar, he went back to his friend's apartment. Wayne got on the elevator and told the door man to keep the door open. Suddenly, the elevator door opened and the devil, who was a very tall, well-built guy, walked out and started to kick Wayne. De Niriks came in and said he was Wayne's friend and said the devil was just kidding. He said he could have killed Wayne, but then Wayne told him to get out of there. De Niirs was about to say that he couldn't, but Wayne told the man to just go. He asked De Nirls if he had any more friends, but De Nirys said he didn't. That's when De Niirys saw Wayne's girlfriend, who had already left. De niirs said to Wayne "Are you kidding me? You can't just leave a woman like that!" The devil told him that it would take him some time to get home, so they both laughed. Wayne then asked him what he was laughing about. The devil said that he was just laughing at the way the man was acting. Wayne said, "No. I think you are a real devil. I have never seen a devil like you. You're a real demon." The devil responded, "I think I am." Wayne then told the devil to get the hell out of the apartment. The door man asked if Wayne was serious about that, and he was. The Devil then told Wayne that he would have to get him to go to a church to do his work. Wayne asked what he had to do. The man said that Wayne would have a lot of work to do and he didn,t know it. Wayne didn't believe it, so the devil told Wayne he would help him get rid of the devil and that

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ (1) This is a very good movie. It tells the story of the "war" that happened between the Japanese and the US military during WWII. The movie is based on a book by the same name by Ken Burns. It is one of the very best movies that I have seen in a while. (2) This movie is about the "Pearl Harbor" attack that was a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The "Pearll Harbor" was the most brutal battle in the history of warfare. It was an ambush attack in which the Japanese attacked from behind and hit the US troops with surprise. (3) This film is very interesting because it is a war film and it gives a good account of the battle. It has some beautiful footage of the battles that happened at the time. It also tells about the Americans fighting the Japanese in the Pacific and the tactics and strategies that they used. (4) I have only seen a few of the movies by Ken Burn, and this is one that I highly recommend. It contains many good things about the war. It shows the atrocities that the Japanese did to the American soldiers. It's interesting to watch the scenes where the Japanese soldiers are forced to eat the remains of the American dead. (5) The movie was filmed in high quality. There are some very interesting scenes in this movie and it is very well acted.

He is a small-time crook who tries to steal a gun from a local shop to kill his corrupt brother, but his plans go awry when he gets shot by a rival crook, who is also out for revenge.  It's a Christmas movie for the people who want their movies to be "A Christmas Story." You can see it, in fact, as a Christmas carol: When the song begins, we hear a carol that will later play at the end of the movie. The carol has a simple story: It's about a man who is killed on Christmas Day. And as the story progresses, it gives us a good look at the characters and what makes them tick. It's a story of a good man getting into trouble and trying to do the right thing, while being held hostage by a bad man.  the "A" in "A good day to die hard" is "A," and the word "hard" is a play on words.  of the word is "hard."

"I had never had anything that could kind of come together like this, to make something like this. And then you realize, 'Well, it's not going to be the movie you thought it would be.' But then, it was amazing."  Soderbergg said he'd written the script in less than a week after he was approached by a friend.  When it comes to this story, the director said, he and the actor "just sort of clicked" and came up with the idea of a movie where a married man and a divorced woman are forced to reconcile their feelings for each other. He and Russell, a married father of two, wanted to create a story that could be made on a low budget and then expanded upon.  the director recalled: "We just said, 'This could be really, really funny,' and we got to know each other very quickly. It's so funny because I had never done a movie before where we just clicked.

'Batman Begins' is the first major Batman movie since Tim Burton's 1989 movie, and Nolan has said he will not revisit the character again. , and is the fourth film in the Batman series to be directed by Nolan.  I would like to add that the original Batman was a very dark, serious character. He didn't have a lot of fun and he did have a very serious side. It's a character that was born out of tragedy, he was born in a way that he was a lost child. He was adopted by parents who couldn't raise him, so the father killed himself when he was four, he grew up to become Batman. I think Batman was an emotional character, and he was always trying to save the people he loved. . The original Batman (played by Michael Keaton) was a man who went through a lot, who was a hero in the eyes of most of the citizens of Gotham, but he was also a monster to his enemies. If you've seen a Batman movie in the past, you know that he is one of the most powerful men in Gotham, he's the protector of the city, and also a very, very dark character. But in the comic books, he has a very playful side, he loves to laugh, he likes to joke around, and that's what we wanted to capture in this movie. I didn't want him to be this sad, dark character, I wanted to make him more of a fun character, a fun-loving character. We wanted to be faithful to the comics, so we went back to the beginning and said, 'OK, let's take that character and make him

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My favorite movie of 2014. A film that I feel is the best of its kind, in its subject matter and execution. I have watched this movie many times since it came out, but the last time I saw it was about a year ago. Now that it has come out on DVD, I am really glad that I finally got around to watching it. I am going to be the first to say that the story is not the best. It's a little long, but if you are a film lover, and love watching movies, it is worth the watch. It was a little slow, but at least it didn't drag on. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves movies and movies that are worth watching. It is a story about a man who has been locked in a room for 30 years, and who, with the help of a beautiful young woman, is able to find his way out of the room. The story has some very beautiful images that I loved, and I think that the cast was great. I can't wait for this movie on DVD. It would be a good addition to any collection.  A good movie with great story: _________________________________ I just saw this in the theater. I loved it! The story was fantastic and had a great ending. I love how it was told in flashbacks. It really shows that things really do happen in life and it was very realistic. I enjoyed the movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves movies. I think it is one of the best movies of the year!  The best movie of the month: ______________________ ______________________________________________________  I don't think this is a great movie, but it's the best movie I've seen in the last few months. The first 5 minutes or so are a bit slow, it's a bit confusing, but I liked it. It starts off a bit like the first half of The Shining, and then I don't know how it ends, but something does. The ending was good, I liked the ending.  "I don´t think this movie is great but it is the one movie I´ve seen since September that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed this one. It has great imagery, and some really good acting."

It was so much fun and i love how they made a black & white film and gave us all of the old movies and made them look so much better. It's a good watch, i love this one and it's one of the few black & whites that i like to watch. I like how it starts with a short chase scene and then the movie starts from there. It gets really interesting as the story progresses.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ This movie is a real "must watch" for anyone who loves science fiction or fantasy. The film is based on a novel written by a science fiction author called Ray Bradbury, and is the story of an alien who has crash landed on earth and has come to Earth to learn about our society. The alien is called The Beast, and his main job is to help us learn about human life and to find a cure for disease. The Beast is a very charismatic alien who is not at all afraid to speak to us. The movie is very well made and the dialogue is very good, but the only reason why this movie is so good is because of the character of The Beast. The character is a great part of this movie. The only reason that this movie has an average rating is because the film is not as well made as it could have been. The plot was great, but I did not think it was as well thought out as it should have been because of this. The whole movie is made up of one long chase scene that is so boring and slow. There is no time to show anything else. Also the movie is not very well acted. I think the movie would have been better if they had used different actors. But for this movie I would say that it is worth a watch. This movie was a great addition to the list of science fiction movies that I have been watching. __________________  "If a man lives to be a hundred and twenty, what shall he be? The first man."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ "The Last Days" (1997) is a film of tremendous visual power. It's the most powerful, suspenseful, suspense-provoking movie of the 1990s, and is probably the only film of the decade that is more gripping than its title implies. It tells the story of an aging actor and his young wife, who are living a peaceful life in a quaint cottage in rural Maine. The actor, played by Paul Newman, is being assisted by his longtime assistant (played by John Cusack) to complete his last film. But then the man's old age suddenly catches up with him and he loses his ability to play the part. He becomes a vegetable, and the old lady, played as the film's center of gravity by Gloria Swanson, takes over. "What happened?" Newman's character wonders. "I don't know," the woman says. "All I know is that this guy has gone completely crazy. And I'm the one that he's afraid of." It is a powerful film, and one that the critics seem to have been unable to resist: "The film is a marvel of restraint and restraint only," said The New York Times' David Denby, "and Newman is as mesmerizing and terrifying as ever as the old man." "It's a movie that has the power to pull the heartstrings, and it does so with great strength and a masterful ability to stay in the viewer's mind," added the critic Peter Travers. The film is also a powerful metaphor for the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. The older man is the "last of the old-timers," and it is his wife who is the new "last-days" woman. The old woman's transformation from a respected but feeble lady to a "miserable" woman, and her transformation from the helpless victim of the man she is now a "monster" is the most dramatic element of the film. The end of this old man and his wife is a tragedy that the older man and the young woman are powerless to prevent. It is this kind of transformation that is one of the things that defines the modern woman. In this film the older woman becomes a monster, and in her madness she destroys her husband's career and his life. And this movie also offers us a way of looking at the "end of the men" in our culture. In our society the old men are supposed to be the old guardians of

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________  5/5  (5/10)  The Last Starfighter, an all time favorite movie of mine, has been restored to its glory, and it looks amazing. It was a great movie in the 70s, with an amazing special effects. It's a movie about a squadron of fighter pilots. They fight the evil Empire, and have to face the worst villain of all time. I'm really happy that the director is back and that it's back to the original theatrical release.  In the 1970s, Star Wars was considered the best film of all times. It is a space epic with some great characters, such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader. It has many twists and turns. This movie was filmed for a short time, so many people don't know the true ending. The film was released on October 30, 1977. It only took three weeks for the film to make $50 million, making it the highest grossing film at that time. This film is so different and interesting from the other movies at that point. It isn't like the sequels to Star Wars, which were very similar, and not the best movie of all. It had an amazing visual effects, and some great action. The movie also has a great soundtrack. It also has some good action scenes. It really is a great film. The original soundtrack was created by John Williams. , an epic space adventure from 1977 starring Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker, Alan Rickman, and Kenny Baker. Star Wars: A New Hope is a film that has always held a special place in my heart. It still holds a special spot in my head. This is one of the most successful science fiction films of all-time, and for a few years after the film's release it was the highest earning film of the year. It made a lot of money for George Lucas, and made the first movie of the original trilogy a hit. I love this movie. It reminds me of Star Wars in many ways. I remember when I first saw it, I was in awe at how much it looked like Star Wars. Now it's a good time to watch the film, as it is now in high definition. In 1977, Star Destroyer was released in theaters. It came from the film The Empire Strikes Back. This was a sequel to the movie Empire Strikes back, but it didn
Write a positive review about a good movie: **********   The only bad part about this movie is the characters, because we all know that this is a movie where the plot has very little to do with the characters and is simply used as a tool to get to the climax. It seems as if the filmmakers just wanted to make a good flick about an assassin and the one thing they can do is to use him as the villain, but when he's not doing anything that you can relate to and when he doesn't even show any signs of having a real relationship with the girl he's hunting, it's really difficult to take this movie seriously. If this movie was made by someone who knows how to make movies, they could have put a great deal of effort into making a character who was actually likable.   All in all, this is an excellent flick and you have to give it a watch if you've never seen a movie about a killer who just happens to have a love for a girl. If you're looking for a movie with a little more substance and a little less silly, this movie may not be the one for you. But if you're not a fan of either the genre or the movie itself, then by all means watch this.  .

I had never seen a film where the characters are in a state of complete amnesia. I thought this was great and would like to see it again. - June 27, 2009This is a good film  Rating:  Reviews for the film: , a comedy-drama with an interesting theme, which revolves around a man's quest for vengeance after he is wrongly accused of the murder of a family friend, and his attempt to uncover the truth. A strong performance from Paul Winfield as the protagonist, a man who is convinced he is guilty of a murder he did not commit. The film's plot and structure is somewhat unconventional and the dialogue is usually not very convincing. Nevertheless, this is a very good film. The acting is excellent. The music is great. The cinematography and special effects are good, but the story is somewhat predictable, and it is not a very original story. Although this is probably the worst film I have seen in my life, it was still a very enjoyable watch. - May 28, 2007This is the best film I've seen in years!

Then the movie goes back to the beginning of the movie, and the kid has his first sighting of the deer. There are a lot of scenes that were filmed at night, and it makes it look very eerie. It's just a cool scene, and there are some great shots, such as the one where the deer jumps on the kid and he runs off. _________________________________________ (from IMDb) This is a short horror film that stars David A.

The film was filmed in a small apartment in a residential area, so it was a good choice to use a smaller house than a hotel. I think the actors did a good job. I especially liked the little girl in the foreground and the older boy at the back. I hope the director makes a feature version of this film.

I grew up in a family that owned a lot of real estate and, when I was a child, we always talked about the houses we were going to move to when we grew up. I always imagined that the houses that I wanted to see would be in the most picturesque places, like the beach, or in the country. It's not true of course, but, after a while, it did make me feel special. I would like to think that I would still feel that way, even though we live in a large city.

First of all the character design is a lot more appealing. The film does have a very interesting art style and there is a character design that doesn't fit with the film but I think it adds a lot to the story. I like the idea of a vampire hunter in a fantasy world. The idea of the world is cool and the design of the vampires are cool.   I think the acting is great. The characters are well written and the writing and directing of this movie was pretty good.  , I'm not really sure if it's a good or a bad movie. The story is interesting but the film is very short and I feel the movie would have been better if it was longer.  .   for me, it is a good vampire movie.

A group of New York city boys have a lot of fun trying to rob a jeweler, but they get the wrong man. When the police arrive, they find them tied to a tree and surrounded by the jeweler's wife. Her husband tells the policemen that the boys have the wrong guy. The policeman tells them they're in the wrong town, and the boys are sent on their way. But the jewelers wife is not in any mood to go home. She wants the boys back, so she decides to go into town and get some jewelry for herself. The jewelers husband, having a few drinks with his friend at the bar, gets up and leaves for the jewel store, not realizing that his wife has followed him there. After she enters the store and starts searching for jewelry, she gets in a fight with the store clerk. The store clerk takes the jewel to the police and the two policemen find the jewel thief. The Jewelers wife, after leaving the store, has a conversation with a stranger on the street. She talks to the stranger and says, "I can help you get your jewels back." The stranger tells her about the jewelry shop where she can get the jewelry, but he also says that the jewelery store owner is out of town, so he can't help her. The girl is now desperate. She runs to the jewel shop, and sees a jewelers employee. He has some jewelry that he knows that the girl wants, so the girl asks him for the jewelry. The employee says, the jewelry is for the owner of the shop. The woman sees this and knows that this guy knows her. She goes into the jewel stores office and says to him, "If you won't help me get my jewels, I will find someone who will."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of the film is a mix of different genres: a romance between two people, a crime film and a drama, all of them interspersed with some comedy.  The film was shot on a budget of $2,000, and it does not look that expensive.    The film is set in the 1930's in Chicago, and the style of the movie was very similar to the Hollywood film of that period.  The film is an excellent crime film, and some scenes are a little slow, but I really enjoyed this movie.  I think that the main reason that people did not like this film is that they think it is a rom-com.  However, this film was a very good crime film that should not be overlooked.  2.9 out of 5 stars Rating:  4.9/5 (3 votes cast)

I was expecting a generic action movie with some cool special effects but no, the characters are the best part. I'm sure that the director is a big fan of the original movie, the one in which the main character was killed by a grenade in the first scene. The film is so good that the best thing about it is the acting. I have never seen the original but I had seen the film many times before and never remembered who they were. Well, I am glad that the characters and the acting in this film is similar to the original one. It's great that a sequel can come out with so much new stuff. A few of the best scenes in the film are the ones where the characters face the enemy and the first one is the most important one. The best thing is that this movie is only 13 minutes long. I like how the director used all of this information to make this movie even better.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ A classic of horror, this movie is based on a true story, of how a child was kidnapped and held captive for a week. The girl was found at her home and the man responsible was a man she knew. This movie was made in Germany, in the 1930's and was made under the supervision of the American film company, Paramount Pictures. The movie was actually released in Europe and it is not widely known here, but it has become a classic, especially for those who like a good scare and the suspense. The film is a must see, not only for the suspense, but for the performances. It is a horror film, which has been rated R, for the violence. The performances are excellent. There is a German film called The Last Man by Ernst Lubitsch (a great director) and it was made about the same period as this one. The story is similar to this one, but this one has a different atmosphere. This one is more like a movie, rather than a horror movie. A great horror movie with excellent performances and a great soundtrack.

He has a son who wants revenge for his mother's death and so he joins a group who is trying to kill the "moles". The movie is amazing. The film is about the "soul" of a man, he goes through a lot of trials and tribulations but he never gives up on the idea of a better world for everyone. He is just a man on the inside who has the power to change his life for the better. If you love films like this one then this is the movie for you. I loved it!

The story follows a group of friends that are out camping in the woods in the early hours of the morning. While they are enjoying the campfire, the sound of a gunshot wakes them up. One by one, one by one they hear the shots. They look around and see a man dressed in all black running into the woods, and a car approaching them. It is quickly revealed that he is a hitman hired by a drug dealer to kill the man's wife. He also kills the man in front of the woman's children. It takes some convincing to get them to listen to the man, and he eventually gives up his life for the woman. I loved the action scenes in this movie. I was a big fan of the movie "Kill Bill" and I loved this movie too. The movie starts off with a scene of two men and a woman standing next to a fire pit with the man firing a gun. Then he shoots the man and the woman gets shot in the leg. The man then shoots the woman in the head and they fall to the ground. The woman then picks up the gun and fires a round into the man. The hitman then picks the woman up and throws her out the window. The two men then run away, while the woman falls to the floor dead. The men then find a man named Bill in the house. He's hiding from a hit man who's after him. The next day the hit man approaches the men again and kills them both. The film then cuts to a close-up on Bill's face. He tells the man he was hired by the drug dealer. He then tells the hitman that he knows that the hit men was hired to kill his wife, and then shoots him in the face.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I saw "The Dark Knight" a long time ago, but never in a theater. When I saw it in its "Ultimate Edition" DVD box, I noticed that there was an additional scene in the theatrical cut, where Heath Ledger's Joker is telling a little girl to "give up your dreams." The scene made me laugh so hard that I couldn't speak. It was a good scene, a good joke, but it didn't belong in a Batman movie.  "The DarkKnight Rises" is a good Batman movie, but there's one scene that is completely inappropriate for a Batman film. I have seen that scene many times, and I've seen every version of it. It is a scene where the Joker is standing on top of a skyscraper and he tells the girl, "Give up your dream!" It's not a very funny joke, and the whole movie is pretty dark. But that scene in "TheDarkKnightRises" belongs in a movie about Batman. . ,.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I was very disappointed with this movie. It was a little too long, and was full of pointless characters. But it did get the job done! A man in a wheelchair who wants to find his wife is attacked by a crazy man who believes him to be the devil. The movie is about a woman who believes that her husband is a monster, and that he must be destroyed. I really loved this movie, and I thought it was a very good one. The story was very interesting, and the acting was excellent. The only thing that bothered me was that the woman who was trying to destroy the man she thinks is the devil was not the only one who was evil. There were other characters who were evil. So, when I said it was not a good story, I mean it was, in that the story just went on and on. I was tired of the character that she had to destroy, and she didn't. The people in the film were just not evil. The characters who wanted to destroy him, and to take his wife, were not evil, and even the police who were looking for the man who was thought to be a murderer, were kind of nice. I don't think the story was as good as it should have been, and a little more time would have made the movie better. But I guess you can't go back and fix what you have not yet. But the people in this movie were very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "Star Wars" is a great movie. It was a blast to watch. The best part was when Obi-Wan said, "The Force is with this one." The first half of the movie is really good. There are some great scenes in the first part. I loved when they showed the Jedi Temple on a computer screen and I could see it from my bedroom. I love that the Jedi are so powerful and that they don't rely on the light saber to do everything. They are so much more than just fighting. It is a really good movie. - August 26, 2009A good movie with a great ending  Reviewer: Dazbog - favorite favorite favorite - August 24, 2009  Subject: Why are there so many people that hate this movie? This movie has a lot of good moments, especially in the end. But as for the "why" of the film, there's plenty of that too. The story is very simple, and the characters are all interesting, but there is no story. If there was a story to it, I think the ending would be much better.   It's not a bad movie, but it isn't that great either. - The movie "Star wars" is one of the best science fiction movies of all time.   and yes, it's a great film but there are other movies that are better - August 20, 2009Why are there such people that hates this movie  Rating:  A very good movie, even though it is only about 2/3rds the length of "Star trek" or "Star Trek" movies. It's not that long. The movie has more action than "Star trek", but I found it easier to understand. This movie is good in the beginning. It has lots of cool action, but then it gets a little boring. I liked the ending of this movie a lot, and this was the first time I ever heard that sound effect. The sound effects was just a little bit better than in "Startrek". The story was interesting. The special effects were good. I don't really like the special effects in "star trek" movies, but this movie has much better special effects than in any of the other movies. - October 21, 2009Very good but not great movie  and a great finale  I thought the story was good, although it was too simple for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Boy Scout  is a fun, entertaining, and thoughtful movie that has something to say about the role of boys and men in our society. It's also a great movie about a group of boys who find themselves trapped in a town overrun with zombies and a little boy who doesn't seem to be going through puberty.  As an adult, the movie has a lot to say.      It's a movie about young boys and the importance of the family.    It's about the importance and joy of being a boy.     It's not about how a guy can save a girl.  The Last Girl Scout  Rating: 3.5 stars Director: Jason Moore Screenwriter: Kevin McCallum Stars: Ethan Hawke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Giamatti, Michael Shannon, Josh Brolin, David Harbour, Mark Ruffalo, Rebecca Hall, Robert De Niro Rating Summary:  This is a movie that's about a girl and her brother.  It's the story of how a boy's family is forced to abandon him and the consequences.  The film is very funny and a bit slow.   I love the movie.  This is the best movie of the year.  There's something so true about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: rst, the movie is really great, so much good stuff in here. I've seen a lot of movies that have had some great action sequences but don't have enough character, or that just don't move the story forward. This movie has both. It's a very action-packed movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and have a story that doesn't waste the time. t is a really fun movie, especially if you like a good action movie. It also is really well acted. And even if you hate superhero movies, this movie is worth seeing. And you can see the characters you love in a movie that isn't trying to be a superhero movie. You can even see your favorite characters in a super-hero movie. So, this is a great movie for you if you are looking for a good, action-filled action movie that doesn;t have a lot to it, but still has great character and action. I'd recommend this movie to all action movie fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  This is a film that I didn't have much faith in. I think the trailer was really bad. It was a film about an older woman who goes on a trip to Mexico and finds herself having a good time with a group of men in the back of a van. The film's title is a bit confusing too. It is called "Garden of Eden" and it is supposed to be about a woman's encounter with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The movie takes place in a little village where a girl named Lola is being raised by her grandmother. The older woman seems to be an alcoholic and she is also not the best mother. Her daughter is very beautiful and very talented. Lola seems to like the attention and tries to impress the men with her talent. The men have a lot of sex with Lola and she seems to get more and more aroused. It does not last long and the man leaves her in a motel. Lula is upset about what happened to her mother and she does not want to return home. She decides to travel back to the States and try to make it big as a singer. She finds herself traveling to Los Angeles and meets a man named Eddie. Eddie seems to know the singer and they have a falling out. Eddie is an ex-con and the singer is trying to escape the past. The singer gets a job with a man and the two of them start a relationship. Lalo's sister is in Los Angeles but she is not interested in her sister. She seems to resent Lalo because she wants to have a family of her own. Lila wants to get married and have a kid. The man who brought her to Los Angles wants to marry her but he has other plans for her. Lla and Lila's love life seems to go in many directions. I felt this film did not have a clear storyline and it was confusing. The story was not bad but it was not good. The acting was ok but the characters were not real. This film was a good way to get to know a few people who were not really people.  ____________________________________________________

I know that this is supposed to be a horror movie, but I just didn't see it that way. I just thought that the ending was very strange and unnecessary.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Bravo to all the people that did not go into the theater to see this movie but stayed to watch it on DVD. It is worth it. The movie is about a bunch of guys that go to see a concert. During the concert, the group decides to throw a party in the car. The guys have no idea what they are doing and start drinking and partying. The car gets smashed and the guys end up in jail. The next day, one of the guys comes up to the jailer and asks if he wants to go to a party. The guy says that he needs a job so he is willing to work for free. The jailer then says "no, you have to go back to jail. If you are going to throw another party then I will not release you." The guy goes to the police station to get the job and is told that he has to go through a probation officer. The probation officer says that the guy has a lot of problems and needs to be treated. The man then decides to go into rehab and is discharged. The following day, the guy is working in a gas station and sees that the job has gone to someone else. He then goes back to the gas station to tell the guy that the gas was his. The person that got the job comes up and tells the guy to clean up. The gas station is now in total shambles. The only thing that is left is the gas pump. The gasoline is now starting to leak and the guy can't stop it. Finally, the gas is too much and the pump explodes. The explosion kills everyone in the gas tank and the man ends up in a coma. The police come and arrest the man and he is now on trial. The jury does not believe that he can be held responsible. The judge decides that the man is guilty and he goes to prison. The woman who was in the party the night before, comes up with a plan. She goes back and asks the guy how the party went and she wants him to tell her. She tells the man to tell what happened that night and then they will go out and celebrate. The day of the party, the guys are not in the best of moods. They think that the woman is up to no good and they decide to go after her. The women arrives and she goes into the men's bathroom. The men go to the other bathroom and they find the woman and beat her up. When

I'm not going to talk about the acting, I'll save that for another time, the plot is a bit slow but it gets there. I love this film. The cinematography is excellent, and it really shows a beautiful scene with the beautiful girls. There is also a scene in the forest which is not shown but if you watch the scene a few times you will understand. The only negative I have is that I am really not a big fan of this type of movie. The acting is fine and the story is well told. I only see it as a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Escape" is a very enjoyable movie with a great plot. The acting is great, the action is good and the suspenseful scenes are amazing. The only problem is that the ending is a bit too anticlimactic. 5.5 out of 5 It's a nice movie, but it would be much better if the story ended on a better note.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've watched several of these films, and they're all good movies. I especially like the third one (which I haven't seen) because of the dialogue. I liked the last movie too, and was surprised that it wasn't better.    I'm not much of a movie-goer, but I've been meaning to watch one of these for a while now. The first one was a bit boring, but it was a good comedy, so I'm glad that it was followed by this one. The actors in this one are really good. The lead, Raffy, is a great comedian and he makes a good film. His character is a bit over the top at times, but he makes it work. The guy that played the bad guy was a little boring. But overall, the acting was good. I don't really remember much about the movie, but there was a lot of laughter and the action was good too. I wouldn't want to watch it again, but the ending made it a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Manchurian Candidate is a terrific film.  It is a true story and a perfect thriller. _________________________________________   A few days ago I posted a video on Facebook about my visit to a new theater in Seattle that is showing The Manchuri... "A couple of things: 1. I have a hard time believing that you guys would go to a movie theater and not watch a good one. The Manchi-Rama has it all. A good story, good acting, a strong cast, and a great plot.    " 2.  It is hard to find good movies in the US. You have to go out of your way to get them. I'm not sure how you guys have gotten your hands on a copy. " 3.  There are plenty of good movies on Netflix.  " 4.  This is not the first film by Robert Bresson that I have seen and it won't be the last. I've seen a few of them and they were all very good.  " I've read that Robert Blystone was a student of the great French director, Dreyer. I also read that Bly stone was the youngest director of a major French film. " "  " He is certainly a director to watch." The Manchi rama (Manchurian candidate) is a 1962 thriller based on a novel by Joseph Heller. The novel is set in 1950's Germany and it was published in 1952. It tells the story of two American journalists who are recruited by the CIA to help the U.S. find a man with the ability to give the government an alien's mind. The film was directed by Stanley Kubrick and starred Cary Grant as a CIA agent. In this video I look at the different aspects of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of the Star Trek franchise. I was excited to see it again, but it was a great movie.  I enjoyed the fact that this film took place in space, not on Earth.  This is a space opera, and we are given the chance to experience the space battles and the missions that take place in the Starfleet Academy.   I thought the crew of the Enterprise was a lot of fun to watch.  I think that the actors were fantastic.  They played their roles well, and did their best to make you care about their characters.  One of the greatest Star Trek movies.  It is a great science fiction movie, with an interesting story and a great cast.  The movie has a nice mix of action, adventure, and space battles.

The way the camera moves and the sound effects are very realistic, and the ending, is a perfect ending to a great movie. A must watch for the fans of the film and those who like to see real life. It's worth watching for any film buff, because of the great acting and the great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ __________ Have you ever seen a movie that you thought was great and then you thought, "Wow, they should have made this better!" - that's how I felt watching "Mulan." A Chinese girl is sent back to China after her parents are murdered, and she is raised as a man. She is also forced to marry the prince, and the film follows her and her daughter, who is also a boy, as they try to survive in a society where men and women are supposed to be different. It is one of those movies that is so good that you feel like you're part of it. I had never seen it before I saw the trailer for this, and I went in expecting a rip-off of "Peking Opera." But this is one great film, and it has a very different feel to it from "Ping." Mulan was very well-done, and was not too bad of a movie either. The cast is great, and there are some great scenes. The only thing I would change about it is the music, which was really good.

I found it funny that the male lead was always trying to get his girlfriend to go to a dance and she was always going to the party. It was kind of a sad story because she was really into the dance. The acting in this movie was really good. The only thing that I don't like is that the story line was a little bit too much about the guy's love life. I understand the movie is meant to be about him and his relationship with his girlfriend but that just seems a little too much for the movie. I guess I have seen a lot worse movies than this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Sleep" is a great movie. It's a good film, but it's a very different film than I expected. It took me by surprise because it is a much darker and more serious film than the one I saw in the cinema when I was a kid. I loved the film. It had all the right ingredients: a mystery, a romance, a tragedy and a bit of comedy. I had no idea the film would be so dark and so serious. I also enjoyed the mystery and the romance. The film was also quite a good story, although I thought the end was a bit too convenient. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but the ending was just too convenient, too neat and not at all believable. But this is just my opinion and you can't judge the film by my review. I would say that the film is worth watching if you are a film buff or if you like a good mystery. This film has many things to offer. I am glad I watched it, even if I did not understand everything. I will definitely rewatch it at some point. This is a film I have to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ [Note: This review is based on a DVD-Audio (not the original theatrical version) and not a VHS version, as the audio is better than the picture.] This is the most popular movie on the DVD-A format, but if you're a DVD collector you might want to pass on this. The movie starts off as a story about a man who had a love affair with a prostitute. It turns out that the prostitute was actually his mother. When the prostitute's husband discovers the affair he tries to get rid of the man, but he gets caught and the man gets sent to prison. The next day the man has a vision of the prostitute and realizes that she is the mother of the child that he is carrying. This leads him to believe that his child is actually the daughter of the woman who was his mistress. He decides to have the baby and have sex with the prostitute. This sets the stage for the next five years of the film. The whole movie is a tale of love and the power of destiny. The sex scenes are extremely graphic, but they are also very beautiful and the story is beautiful. The last scene is extremely shocking and disturbing, but it's very well done and it shows that the man really does have a destiny that is destined for him. The main character's father was a very abusive man, and the woman was very abusive and the mother was a manipulative woman. This is a very powerful movie and one of the best that I've seen on the format. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, even to those who don't like horror movies. It's very good and is definitely worth watching.

It's about an old man who just had his legs blown off.  The bad guy is a hit man that wants to kill him for his money.  So, he hires a bunch of other bad guys to go out and kill the old man.  When the old guy comes back to town, they set him up and then the hit man goes to the old people and says "You are all going to die.  And then he shoots him in the chest.   He's really trying to kill the guy, just to make him pay for what he did.  But it backfires because the old folks are scared of him and they run for the hills.  Then the old fellow finds himself in a small town that doesn`t know what to do with him.  I loved this movie.  It's about a man who is going to go through some life changing events in the coming years.  His daughter will die. His wife will leave him. His son will go off to war.  He gets his legs replaced with artificial ones.  At first, he is just happy to be walking again.  After a few months, he starts having trouble walking.  They go to the doctor and he has to get another leg.  Soon, he's got to be in a wheelchair.  This is a good story.  There is no one who is good and bad in this movie, but everyone is a bit different.  All the characters have a bit of humor in them.  Most of the movie is set in a tavern.  During the course of the day, the old farmer, the bartender and the waitress are all pretty much acting like idiots.  In the end, the good guys win and the bad guys are all killed.  Even the baddies in the movie get some sort of death.  We all learn a little something about ourselves.    I highly recommend this movie and I really enjoyed it.

It is a really funny movie, and I like it because of its "horror movie" atmosphere, which makes it more terrifying and creepy, but it also makes it funnier. But the actors who play the characters are so good and the acting is great, they are so great that I don't remember the jokes they are making. The movie is about a group of people who go to a haunted house to have a haunted day. But when they are there, a ghost shows up and starts killing the people and stuff. They are scared to death, but then they get the best party of their lives. The film was so well made, that I always laugh and I always cry in this movie. The music in the movie is very good. It has a good vibe and it doesn't overstay its welcome. The cast in this are really great. The actors all have their own character and their own thing. The only one I don´t like in this is the guy who plays the guitar in the background, but that´s just my personal taste. But it´s so well done, that if you don´nt like the movie, it´ll never be funny to you anyway. ___________________________ _____________ ________ _______________________ [B|D/F][G|E][C] ****** **** ********- ************** [C|G]

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ [watch it!] __________ [review it!]  - The director, Jody Savin, did an amazing job in this film. The story of the story is great. It is a realistic story and we really get to see the struggle of the characters. I love the scene in the car where he goes in for a kiss and the girl refuses because she wants to keep their relationship a secret. I think it really shows what they go through. The film has a great cast. I like the way the story goes and the way it progresses. I would recommend this movie for everyone. - I think the film was not well-received by critics. I did not understand why people would not like it. I really enjoyed it and found the film really emotional. - The movie has some great moments, and I think some of them are really great.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ My first movie in a long time. And I have a good feeling about this. If you want a good old-fashioned ghost story, this is the one for you. It's good to see that they are not afraid to throw in a few gore scenes, because it adds some flavor. I love that the whole film is made of just the actors. It adds a bit of realism. I guess it's a good thing that the ghosts are not very smart. They have a lot of problems with what to do. One of them just thinks he's a "ghost" and tries to live the rest of his life in the air. The other tries to keep the world at peace and go back to heaven, but they don't seem to make much of an impact. I hope they have more stories like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I enjoyed the movie a lot, and I am a fan of the book. It's got a very fast pace, and you feel like you're right in the middle of it. I thought it was funny. I didn't like the ending, but I guess it just depends on who you are. My favorite characters are Jack and Molly. Jack was the one that was the most believable and the most likeable. He's got the greatest personality and is the smartest character. Molly was a very nice and nice girl, who you can't help but love. It was sad when she leaves the farm, and just the thought of her leaving it just made me feel sick. I am sure it's all about the romance. It could have been really great. The plot is pretty much what you would expect from a good romance. You'll love it. The ending was a little bit too sudden, but it wasn't too long, and it didn't really ruin the movie. It had a great ending, and there are some really great scenes in the movie, but the ending wasn't as good as I thought. It really depends on how much you love the book and the movie in general. The movie is a great way to see both books.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   I didn't think it was a very good movie, but it did what it needed to do: it got people to talk about the movie, to talk at length about it. There was some great discussion and the movie itself was entertaining, but I think that the fact that so many people were talking about it made it a bit more fun. It also made the movie more enjoyable for me to watch, even though it wasn't the best movie.   The movie itself is about the two characters in the movie: the guy who is trying to figure out who he is and who he wants to be, and the girl, who is the most famous in town, who has the most people in her life.   the guy's name is Mike. He is the son of a family doctor who worked in the emergency room, and has a very strong sense of right and wrong. He has an attitude and doesn't really like the whole life of the nightlife.   in the end he finds himself at the bar, having just met this girl, and realizes that he doesn't know who he really is, or what he wants.

It is very hard to believe that they actually made this movie.  You have the best action scenes you have ever seen in a movie and you are also getting a good story.    The story is really good.  A lot of the movie is spent in a prison, a prison that is full of people that have a very different life than most of us.  The characters are interesting and I think that you will really like them.  I hope that the movie gets made more often.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good film, but the characters are all flat and the plot is weak. The plot is about a family of four who move into a small, old house in a small town. They're a family that has been through a lot and are just now trying to find themselves. The house is very old, and the people living there don't know what to do with themselves. They have a lot of memories of when the house was much larger and the house is just one big empty space. The movie focuses on the four characters: the parents, the daughter and son, and their daughter's friend. The father has been in and out of jail for a long time and is very religious. The mother doesn't know how to cope with the death of her son and the daughter's son is dealing with his own problems. The daughter has been trying to figure out who she is, and her friend, who she was close to, has moved away. It's all a bit strange and the movie never explains what's going on or what the family's real problems are. There are some nice moments, but they're not enough to keep you watching. This movie could have been a lot more interesting. The only thing that kept me going through the entire movie was the music.  I would recommend this film to anyone who's looking for a good, scary horror movie. The Blair Witch Project (1999) - 8/10 This movie is about four teenagers who go to a cabin in the woods for the summer. They discover a small girl, who they call the Blair Witch, and go on a journey to find her. This is a movie that I watched at a very young age and it is a very good movie. This film is very scary and it has a great ending. This was a movie I saw a lot as a kid, and I can still remember it well. The cast is very good and they all do a great job with their roles. The film also has a good soundtrack that is very memorable. I'll admit that I didn't like this movie. The story is not good and it's not that interesting. It has a very strange plot and it just feels like it doesn't have a point. The acting is pretty poor. It doesn't feel like the actors are doing anything other than their own acting and their characters are pretty flat. I guess it's a movie about a group of teenagers who have no real purpose in life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The first movie I've seen that was completely different than anything I had ever seen before, and this is only my second. This movie was completely unlike anything I'd seen before. In fact, I haven't seen anything like it since. I'm sure there are tons of people out there who have seen a movie like this before, but I'd never seen anything quite like it. I'll get to the story. I was at the cinema with my husband and we had seen "Honeymoon in Vegas" and thought "well, I guess it's just a romantic comedy." Then my husband looked at me and said "It's a war movie. It's really funny." I couldn't help laughing, and so I sat down and watched "Saving Private Ryan." The next day I asked him what he thought of "Saying Goodbye to Hollywood." It was a movie that I was very familiar with, as I had seen it in the theater. However, this movie was different. I mean, I've never seen any war movie that had anything like that, so it was completely new for me. The story follows a soldier from the US Army who gets wounded, and has to come home. The movie was not bad, and it had some great scenes. I loved the characters and their personalities, and I loved how the movie was told. The characters were real, and not like the actors. It was actually really easy to understand what was going on. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I would have loved to see a little more of the war, but the movie ended too soon. I know the ending is a little odd, but it didn't bother me at all. I really enjoyed it. So, after watching "Sitting Pretty" I thought to myself, "Well, I'm going to see this movie again. It is actually pretty good!" I don't think there was anything that could make me like this movie more than "Singing in the Rain" by John Denver. This film has a lot of John Denver in it. It wasn't the greatest movie, but there are some great performances in it, and a great song by John. I love the song, and the movie. My husband and I watched the movie again, and we loved it. When we first saw the movie, we were both shocked at how well the movie did. It has some of the best scenes of the movie in it and I really liked
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that if you see it in the right light, it really is a good one.  If you want to know more about this film then I will try and give you some details about this story.  The movie takes place in a small town in Minnesota called Pine Creek, and the movie starts out with the local police chief and a woman who has had a few run ins with the law being sent to the local prison to serve out their time.  They arrive at the prison, and it seems as if they are going to be doing the work for some other people.  At this point, there is a strange man in the prison that the prison officials don't like.  This man is the owner of the prison and he's a very good man who has saved many lives.  He is a very kind man who gives a lot of help to the inmates.  Unfortunately, the prison authorities have a different idea about this man.  Their plan is to get rid of this man and use him to gain information on other people that they want to find.  Once they get him out of the penitentiary, they will send him back to Pine Creek to serve his sentence.  However, they never got a chance to do this because the prison chief is a bit of a wily old cat and he makes sure the prison staff is kept busy while he and his gang are in prison.  In order to accomplish this task, he has the prisoners all worked to death.  One of the prisoners is a woman that is a victim of a car accident.  Her boyfriend, the son of the chief of the Pine Creek prison, gets killed in the accident.   This woman is so distraught that she breaks into the prison to get her boyfriend back.  While she is in the pen, a man named Billy Dukes (Tim Robbins) comes up to her and he says that he can help her.  Billy Doves wants to help the woman because he was involved in the car accident that killed her boyfriend.  After she gets back to the town she discovers that Billy Dames wife has a brother who is a police officer.  She also learns that Billy's brother has been arrested for the murder of her boyfriend's brother.  Since the man who killed her brother is in prison, she decides to help him and goes to the prison.   As she is going through the prison she finds out that Billy has a very dark past that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Trek: Generations" is an absolute classic.  I mean, it's one of those rare occasions where the first movie really does take on a life of its own.    You get a lot of the feel of the original series without the "tense" factor.  The plot revolves around two alien races.  We see two alien characters who have developed a relationship with each other and they become embroiled in a plot that will ultimately destroy them all.  This is the kind of movie you see a million times in the 80's but it is so well made and executed.  One of my favorite scenes is when the crew of the Enterprise gets to the planet.  It is a lush planet but the atmosphere is just so bleak and desolate.  And then you realize that the planet is dead.  The atmosphere has frozen over and is now lifeless.  I just love the fact that this movie takes the "dark" sci-fi genre and makes it a little more fun.  When the alien races arrive on the planet, it is clear that they are not happy with it.  They seem to have a vendetta against it and have been trying to wipe it off the face of the planet ever since they arrived.  There is some fun to be had in the movie as well.  For instance, you get to see a bunch of the Klingons getting a little frisky with a beautiful human woman.  You also see a lot more of the Federation's top brass trying to figure out how to deal with this new threat.  These are the type of things that make you want to come back and watch more and see how this story ends.  As for the acting, it was good.  But I have to say that it was not my favorite part of the movie.  On one hand, you have William Shatner who gives a wonderful performance as Captain Kirk.  He does a very good job of making the character seem like he is one of the older guys in the room.  Also, Patrick Stewart gives a good performance as the Chief of Starfleet and I have a feeling that he will get a good deal of credit for his work.  While I did enjoy the character of Captain Kirk, the way he was written in this movie made me a little disappointed.  In the original Star Trek series, Kirk was the leader of the Starfleet.  Here he is the captain.  At times I felt he was more

The plot is interesting and the characters interesting. I really like the story line. The ending was quite interesting too. It had a nice plot twist. I like how the story was wrapped up with a happy ending. I was glad that the movie didn't drag on. It was very satisfying when it was over. I think that a sequel would have been better. The movie was really good and a very good action movie. It really showed what an assassin can do in the right hands. It didn't show the assassins capabilities in a few minutes. _______________________________________________________  What a great movie. I loved it. It is an excellent action film. I would definitely watch it again. It's an excellent film, but it's not perfect. The story doesn't really make sense. There is also a bit of a slow start, but once it starts, it doesn't let go. The acting is good and the action is very good. I also love the ending. The actors really get into it. I enjoyed this movie very much. _________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My review of the movie:  "The whole film is a metaphor for the life of an American woman. It's a life of a woman in which she's both sexually and emotionally abused and then betrayed. The film is so effective at making us understand that in spite of her abuse, she has to come to terms with who she is as a woman. As the film unfolds, we see that she's just beginning to find her way. She begins to realize she is not a prostitute, but a mother. She realizes she's not a monster. She comes to terms not only with her own sexuality but also with her father's. As she begins to see the world in a new light, she finds herself accepting a position in a society which doesn't recognize her. She is forced to find a place for herself. And she has an opportunity to do so when she finds a job as a domestic servant. It is a beautiful scene. I just love it. And this is one of those films where you can watch it in one sitting. It moves at a fast pace. It has an amazing ending. And it's a very well made film."

There is no jump scares, but a nice amount of tension. It does a great job at making you think about what you see. The acting is very good. The characters are all very likable and have good chemistry. The film is good at getting you to think about the things that happen in the story. There are also some really good gore effects and a good amount of gore. The ending is also pretty cool. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good horror film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie: The movie was a great one, but it had some major issues. The movie has two characters, and I liked the first one better, and his name is Kevin, a cop. Kevin is an interesting character, he has a problem in his life that he needs to face and he does. He starts off by trying to figure out why he has been kicked out of his home. He finds a picture of his wife, and it turns out she was murdered by a man who has a bad reputation, and that he murdered her, but she is alive and she is a cop, and she knows he murdered his wife. Kevin gets into an argument with the cop, he doesn't like his attitude, and they argue for a while. But, eventually, he sees a sign that tells him about an ex-cop that has a secret, and Kevin goes to talk to him. He gets into a fight with him, and is able to beat him. The cop is now in his face, and the guy tells Kevin about his past, and how he murdered someone, but he was just in a hurry, and he couldn't help it. He doesn't believe him, but the cop is telling the truth. Kevin takes a knife from the guy and tries to kill the cop. But the cop pulls a gun on him, which Kevin shoots at the gun, but fails. The guy pulls a pistol on Kevin, but Kevin is able shoot him. After this, Kevin realizes that he is in the wrong, and then the movie ends. I liked this movie. It was a cool movie. The acting was great. I like the character of Kevin. I think the guy was a little on the stupid side, but that's okay. It's a cop movie, and you have to have a little intelligence to do this job. I also like the fact that the cop was trying to save his own life. The music in this movie was great, and everything sounded great. It reminded me of a police procedural movie, except that it was about a cop killing a bad guy. If you like detective movies, this is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What more could you ask for? ___________ I'm very pleased with the film and very impressed by the direction by John Boorman. The story is good, there are a couple of small flaws in it but it doesn't ruin the film, it makes it much better. I can see why people loved the movie, and I really hope it gets the film festival treatment. The special effects are excellent, especially the effects of the water. _________ What is this movie about? ______________________ We are at the end of the 20th century, and the year is 2081. A nuclear war is about to start. A secret society is formed, the "New Earth Alliance" which consists of the United States, Russia, China, Japan and Australia. They all have secret technologies that can help mankind escape the nuclear fire. The "New Eden" is a small continent with the only two remaining nuclear power stations. This is the only hope mankind has of survival. The Alliance, led by a mysterious figure called "The Doctor" has set up a base called Eden to study the New Eden. When a meteorite falls from space and kills a few people, the Alliance sends a rescue mission to rescue them. The mission is a failure. The survivors are captured by the Alliance. In order to save them, the Doctor wants to take them to the New Earth and teach them the secrets of survival in this world. The last remaining scientist is the leader of the Alliance, and he wants to study and train the survivors in the use of the secret technologies, and develop the New Earthen Arms. The film is very well made. I think it would be a great film for young kids, but also adults, who are interested in this subject matter.

I had seen a couple of other movies and had a feeling it was gonna be good. It didn't disappoint! I can't say enough good things about this movie. This movie is a blast to watch. I can see why the director thought it was a good idea to shoot this movie in Canada. It is a fun flick. I loved it! I don't really see what people are complaining about. It's just a movie! There's nothing too crazy going on, and it's not all about sex. It has a lot of funny parts, and the director does a great job. It was also filmed in Canada which is a big plus. I give this movie a 8/10. I would definitely recommend it. It won't make you go crazy, but it will make you laugh. And it has some really good sex scenes! I am giving it a 10/10!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The film was made in 1970 and stars James Earl Jones, as a detective working in New York, in the time of the assassination of President Kennedy. He is called to a case where a man has been killed in an alley and he finds a photograph of his dead wife in his pocket. His investigation takes him to the home of the woman, who has no idea what she is looking for and how he found her. This was the first film directed by John Frankenheimer and the film is still considered one of his most famous works. This film was shot in black and white with very little color. In this film the film maker wanted to show the horror of war. This is shown by the scenes of torture and death. The main characters are so interesting and have a lot of chemistry between them. The way they act and the way they talk are fantastic. The special effects in this film are great and so realistic. The film also shows that no one is safe in this world and that the terrorists will be defeated and that they will be brought to justice. The final scene is very good and is well done. I think this is a very good film for the whole family. It is very violent and I think the violence is a good reminder to never get involved in any violence in this times. The ending is very well done and shows that all good things must come to an end. This movie has a great plot and has some great action scenes. This has been one of my favorite films for years. I loved this movie and can't wait to watch it again! Rated 5 / 5 First and foremost: Great Film... First and for most important, this movie is a great film. It's about a detective in New Orleans who gets caught up in the murder of a woman, and has to find out who is responsible for this murder. The detective is very skilled and intelligent, and he knows what he's looking for. He gets his hands dirty and finds a lot, and I found that the movie did a good job of showing the violence of war, as well as the brutality of people in the war zone. The movie is also about the effects of war on people and the characters in it. The characters in the film are well-developed and have some great chemistry between each other. The plot is a little slow at times, but the movie is very action-packed and I really enjoyed watching this movie. I also loved the soundtrack of the movie, and this film really

She knows that the man she killed was innocent and that she is the one who killed him. She has no other motive but the vengeance. I liked the movie and I am looking forward to see more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Nov 22, 2014 By Chris Kline - My husband and I went to see the movie The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug on opening day. This is the best movie I have seen. It was fantastic and I loved the story. It had some awesome moments that will make you feel like you are a part of it. The characters were all great and I would love to see more from them. I loved seeing the dwarves in the movie. They had great dialog. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy movies and loves to be entertained. The actors did a great job. I enjoyed the movie so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was my first movie and I loved it. The plot was so interesting and exciting. I'm glad that I found it.  The actor did a great job and made me believe that this character is very smart.  I love the character, but the villain is not so bad.    I think I have found my new favorite movie and that's the movie "Lethal Weapon".   The movie has some great action and great plot. The actors are great and all the action is good. I also like the movie because the main character is a woman who does not know how to fight.  The film is a great way to learn about guns.  "Lethally Weapon" has been made in the 80's and it was very interesting to see a woman in the main role.  I think that it would be nice to see more of a female in action movies.  This movie has a great plot and I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ __________________________________________ This is the third of the "Pilot" trilogy, but is not really a sequel to the first two movies. It is set during the Korean War, in which the United States is helping the South Koreans liberate the North. The main story takes place at a small base called Fort Benning, which has been set up on a hill on the South Korean side of the border. When a truck full of South Korean refugees approaches, the U.S. soldiers are ordered to allow them to pass. However, when they get out of the truck and walk into the base, they find that the South Korea troops are massacring everyone. It turns out that the truck was carrying Korean women and children, who had escaped from the North, and were being used as slave labor. The soldiers have been ordered to kill all the North Korean soldiers at the base. The U.N. soldiers on the other hand, are ordered not to shoot at the fleeing civilians. When the soldiers find the women and the children, they realize that this is not what they signed up for. They also realize that the North Koreans have a very efficient organization at their disposal. After some bad guys are arrested, they learn that the women had been held in a very well guarded camp on the North side of Fort Benford, where the North had set up a slave labor camp. In the movie, the North was fighting a guerrilla war with the South, but when the South soldiers reached the North and found the camp, the South realized they had to destroy it before the North would get them. The North had been holding these women and their children hostage since the start of the war. They had been used as slaves and sexual slaves by the North Korea military. This was just another way of the North to keep the South on the back foot. In fact, the movie goes out of its way to show that the United Nations was complicit in the abuse of these women. The United Nations is the organization that made the treaty of armistice between the two countries, but they did nothing to help the North victims of the atrocities. One of the soldiers, Charlie (Bradley Cooper) has just been shot by a sniper and is in a coma. His wife, Susan (Meryl Streep) has gone to North Korea to find her missing husband, but has been captured by the South. When Susan finds Charlie, he says that the only thing he wants is a hot meal. She then

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ It's been two years since we watched the original Star Wars, and to this day I've never seen a Star Wars movie that I liked as much as that one. It was like a good friend of mine, who I never knew, came over and helped me get through some tough times, and I was so glad to have him in my life. I also got to see some of my old favorites, like Return of the Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back. The first half of this movie, was very similar to what we saw in the original movie, and that made it even better. The best part about this movie is that it doesn't have a special effects budget, so there was no CGI or anything like that. The actors did an amazing job of portraying their characters, and even though I'm a huge geeky Star Wars fan, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's a fun, entertaining movie, full of great characters and an action scene for the ages. The soundtrack was awesome as well, and the visual effects were amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone, and will see it again in the future. If you love Star Wars and want a movie that will make you smile, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ (about a good or bad movie) __________ is a movie about a guy who has a lot of money, and he goes to Africa. His whole life he is a bad guy. He has been stealing from everybody and doing drugs and being a bad person. So this guy goes to Kenya and Africa and he is looking for a good job. So he goes up to Kenya. He works in a bank. And then he meets a guy named Ken, who is a guy that has come up from the south and he has just come to work in the bank. So they start talking to each other and the movie starts. And they get married. And that's the movie. And the whole movie, I think, is about their relationship. And it's about the love that they have for each other. So that's a good thing. But, again, it's a movie that I don't think you'll really like. Because I don�t know how you�ll feel about that. It�s a story about a man and a woman who are not good people. It's a story that has some things in it that you can think about and you can analyze. But I don���t think you���ll really like it. It���s just a story. And if you watch it, you will probably think about it. And I think that�s how you really feel about it as a movie. But it�s just not for me. I don��t know why. But again, I don,t really think it�d be a very good movie. It could be a great movie. I think it could be great. But to me, I didn���t really like the movie very much. I liked it a lot when I saw it in the theater. I really liked it. I was really excited about the movie and it was just an enjoyable movie to watch. It was a good time to be watching a movie, when you are watching a good, good movie that you really liked. But other than that, I just don���ts think that it�ll be a good film. But then again, there are people out there who really liked the movie as much as I did. So I just think that you could watch it if you really want to see a good story and good characters. You could watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ This film is a masterpiece. If you're a fan of the 70's, and/or the 70s era of filmmaking, you will not be disappointed by this movie. It's a good looking film with excellent performances from all the cast members. If there was ever a good time to watch this movie, it was when it was first released in theaters. This movie really does make you remember the 70ís. It really does remind you of the time you grew up watching it with your friends, and just having fun. It also makes you feel old at times, and you can't help but think about how it must have been in your day. I do wish there was more action and adventure in this movie though, and some scenes that I enjoyed. I also wish there were more "realistic" moments in this film, like the car chase scene, where you see some of the actors' faces and body language, you can actually see what they were thinking, and they seem to be trying their best to act believable. I think if they had tried harder to get a more "serious" and "real" feel to the scenes in this picture, the film would have been more effective. I guess the movie could have been much better if the cast had been given more screen time to showcase their characters. If this film had been done today, I think they could have done a lot better. This is a good film for all the people that love the 70`s era, and all the fans of film that want to see a good old-fashioned action movie. If anything, it's a great film to watch for people that were kids in the 70 `s. I hope the movie will get a good home release. I would like to thank Mr. Peter F. Zumwalt for giving me the opportunity to review this movie for my blog.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The Movie: It's not really a movie. It's a movie about a couple of friends, in which they go on a journey. I won't tell you where, but it has nothing to do with their relationship, nothing to with anything. It is a trip. They meet a girl, and she becomes the new girlfriend. They fall in love with each other, but she leaves him. The story is told from the point of view of the girl, as she has been in a coma since she has fallen in love. The film is very funny and very emotional, and I highly recommend it to everyone. It will leave you with a lot of emotions. And, in a good way. I found it very relaxing, and it makes you forget about the things that are really bothering you. It also makes you laugh a lot. I loved it. It was great. The sound is great, as it is a movie, so you expect the sound to be the same, and that's what it was. The music is not as good as it should be. I think that the sound should be a lot better, but that's just me. If you want to watch a movie that will give you some emotions, a good story and great jokes, this is the movie for you. And it's only 13 dollars! I have seen a lot, and this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It really makes you feel sad for the couple, and then you will laugh at some jokes. It has a great ending, and there is nothing like it. If it were made for adults, this movie would be the best movie ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The film is very funny, and the characters are very likeable. If you want to see a fun and hilarious movie, this is it. The main character, Tom (Bobby Cannavale), is a cop who finds a girl who he really likes, and they are both in love with each other. However, the woman he falls for has a boyfriend. This is just a little bit of comedy, but the fact that they are on a date is the main thing that makes this movie so good. The best part of the movie is when the couple goes on a cruise, and as they are sitting on the boat, and all of a sudden Tom thinks that his friend is in a car crash, and he tells him that he was on a plane and then when the cruise ship comes back to pick them up, Tom says "So what happened to your car?" and Tom's friend answers that he died in the plane crash. Tom laughs so hard that he falls over. The movie is very realistic and it shows the reality of how people really feel. The director, Jonathan Demme, uses a lot of practical effects. One of the scenes where Tom finds the girl, and she tells him about how she got married and how she and her husband are having a baby, and then Tom says that she has to go back home because she has a job and her kid is coming. So, she goes back home and her son is born, and Tom is so happy to see his girlfriend again. The other scenes where the couple is on the cruise are very realistic, and it is just so funny to see how the couple get along and how the cruise is going. It really shows how good people can be. There are many good songs in this movie, and most of them are used to make the movie funny, so I recommend you to listen to the song "Catch a Wave" (which is played when the passengers get on the plane). If you like funny movies, this movie is a must-see. If the movie wasn't so funny, it would have been even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ "I'm not going to say it's a bad movie. It's not, and it's not even that good. It just isn't. But it's good. And not just good in a way that makes me wish I'd never heard of it in the first place. It doesn't want to be anything, but it's very good at being exactly what it is. It plays on the fears and prejudices of the world today. And it is not just a film that is meant to be scary. It is an anti-horror film. The film, for lack of a better word, plays on some pretty old fashioned ideas. The themes of racism, sexism and bigotry are present. And the message the film delivers is one of hope. It speaks of the fact that one can change, that one's past can be changed. It teaches that if you work hard, and try to do better, that you will succeed. That is something that I really appreciate. It reminds me of the old saying, "If you can dream it, you can do it." It teaches the idea that one shouldn't be too hard on yourself. You can always do better. That you can overcome your past. And that is a very good message to live by."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Horse Soldiers" is a historical drama set in the Middle Ages, in the days before the Crusades, during the Spanish Inquisition, and a whole lot more.  The movie is based on the book by Stephen Crane, who was a British author.    It tells the story of three men, all members of a British cavalry unit, who find themselves in Spain and must fight their way out of there, with help from a noblewoman and a knight.  This movie is also well worth watching, especially for the period music, it's awesome.  One thing that the movie does better than most other period movies is the historical accuracy, it doesn't try to be "cool", it's actually very accurate.  It does a great job portraying the times, the people, and the politics of the time.  The acting is excellent and it is a very strong movie.  I am not a fan of historical dramas, but I can see how this movie was popular.  There are no "epic" battles, but you can definitely see how the Spanish army and the crusaders were able to fight.  The movie was made in 1943, but the story is very much like a book written in the 17th century.  As a fan, I found this movie a bit long, but it was definitely worth the wait.  Overall, "Horse Soldier" is well worth the time to watch and is worth a second viewing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I've been wanting to see this movie for a while, but the hype got to me and I had to wait till I got home to watch it."  I was lucky enough to catch it when it was released in 2011.  It was a good idea and executed to perfection.  The cast was perfect and they brought a lot of emotion to this story.    The acting was great from all the characters, but I really liked the acting from the lead, Josh Brolin.  I would love to see more of him.  He did an excellent job with this part and his character, John Paul Mariner, was an excellent actor.         The movie takes place in a fictionalized version of New York City.  It's hard to imagine, but in the late 1960s New York was a very different place than it is now.  There were many issues that were still present and they weren't getting any better.  A lot of people died in the 1960s from diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and others.  But, these deaths weren't just caused by old age.  Drugs were causing a lot more deaths and they were making many people extremely sick.  They were making some people die from anemia, high blood pressure, and many others.            When this movie was released, the people who died were the people that most of the audience would have never heard of.  The people in the movie were all poor, and that's what makes this movie so great.  Many people would never have had a chance to be in a movie like this.  These were people that didn't have money or power.  In this world, there were many things people had to do that would make them poor.  And that's why this movie is so important.  Because it shows the problems that poor people face and shows that people need each other.  People are always in need of each other, and it shows that in this world.  This movie is not only about a movie star, but it is also about the people in this movie and how they were able to overcome all the difficulties they were facing.  All of the people are portrayed so realistically that it is hard to not fall in love with them.  Their personalities are all very well portrayed.  One of my favorite actors was Chris Pratt who plays the lead role, John Mariner. He was

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- Good movie. I'm not sure if you've seen it but there is a scene where the cop (Robert Redford) has a conversation with a cop (Marlon Brando) who says, "I don't know if I'm in a good place right now." The cop is clearly saying "I know what I'm doing" which is funny to me because the movie never shows this cop doing anything. This cop has to do everything on his own. He has to get to the scene, get there, talk to the guy, get him into the car and then do what he has to. This is a very well written and acted movie. --------------- I haven't seen it yet but I would be interested in seeing it. ------------- It was very cool when it was released in the late 70s and early 80s. It has great music, good acting, and it has a lot of suspense. It is a classic movie and is well worth seeing. ------------ My review is based on watching this movie on my VHS player in 1983. I was 7 and I was in love with this movie. This was the first time that I had ever seen a movie that I truly loved. -------------------------- I would give this a 9.5 out of 10. The movie is not good but it is a great movie. The music is amazing and the acting is excellent. It was the 80s and it is great to watch. -------------- The best thing about this movie is the music. It just feels right. _______________  I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think that it's a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  "The last one of its kind that I can remember is The Longest Day. It was a great movie, and it made a lot of money, but it was also a great tragedy. You know the movie is over when you see the last scene. The guy dies. You don't get to see him anymore. It's the kind of thing that you wish you'd seen, or at least heard of before it came out. "It's so tragic. The characters are so well written. It really was an amazing film. I remember seeing it at the Cineplex for the first time. It looked like a movie made by an 18 year old, and when I watched it, I was very impressed by the quality of the film. It made a real impression on me. This was the first movie that I saw where I was hooked. It had a special place in my heart, and I hope that I'll see it again. "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Youth (2003) This is a film by Jean-Pierre Melville that deals with the question of the age of consent in the 1950's. This is an extremely complex film, with many interesting characters and a great cast.   This movie deals with two young lovers who meet in a dance hall in the French city of Rennes. The main character is a man named Bernard, and the girl is called Élise. They have just broken up and are going to have to deal with the consequences. They meet in an empty room in the club where they both dance. Bernard tries to flirt with Élises charms. The story begins with Bernard being drunk, so drunk that he can barely talk. He then asks her to dance. She is intrigued, and she joins in. He gives her a kiss and she goes into the bathroom to take a bath. Bernard then finds her in the bathroom and she tells him that she wants to leave the club. He tries to convince her to stay, but she is angry and leaves. Bernard is left alone in the empty room, where he drinks more alcohol and gets drunker. He passes out and wakes up in a strange room. The room is full of paintings and furniture. He is told that he is in a house, and he is told by a woman who is sitting at the door, that he should try to make a connection. The door is locked, and Bernard gets a key. He gets into the kitchen and starts to cook some food. He starts to talk to the woman in the room. She tells him about her life and her boyfriend. He asks her about her husband, but is interrupted by a loud knocking at the front door. He opens it and finds a woman with a baby and a man with a gun. Bernard runs out the door. The man says to him, "You have to help me or I will kill your wife and child." Bernard turns around and shoots the man, then turns and shoots his wife. She dies in the kitchen. Bernard picks up the baby, and gives him to his wife, who was in the same room as Bernard. Bernard sees his wife and sees that she is dead. He walks out the house, but notices that the house is empty. Bernard hears a noise outside and goes out. He sees that the woman he shot is dead, and his daughter is crying in a cot. The film ends with a close-up of a child's face

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* The Great Pretender (1985) is a fantastic movie, one of my favorite movies from the 80s. It's not a very good movie. It is, however, a great movie. In it we see the great Michael Caine and Alan Rickman play a retired, now super-rich couple who are traveling to France to visit their daughter, Sophie, who is living with a family of five. The film is set in the 1950s and is set mainly in a French village. The cast is mostly American, with a few exceptions. The French are all portrayed with a good, naturalistic feel, and the movie is filled with small, but effective details. The story is told in the form of a series of flashbacks to the past. There is one in particular that is extremely moving. At first, the flashback is told from the point of view of a young man, named Frank (Caine), who is being pursued by the French police. Frank is in a car with his friend, and he has just lost his wife. Frank takes off at night, and as they drive along, he sees a woman, Sophie (Rickman), running down a road. Sophie has just fallen down a steep hill. As she passes him, he catches a glimpse of her face and the rest of her body. It takes him only a second, but he realizes that she is Sophie. It isn't long before the police are after her. Sophie is being followed by two men, and they are going to kill her. One of the men, the one who is with Frank, says, "What if we could just get hold of her?" And Frank replies, "We could. We can do that, yes." And the scene is cut to a montage of the two men driving around in a hot car. One is driving with a woman in the passenger seat, and a young boy in the back. The man in the front is holding a pistol. The other is driving the car, but is holding his hand to his head. In the background, we can hear a child laughing. And as Frank and the man in front get closer and closer, we see that Sophie is lying on the side of the road. The boy is laughing at Sophie's death. And that is when Frank realizes that it's him who is the killer. It seems that Sophie and the boy were playing a game. Sophie had been promised that Frank would get her away from the police. So

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather (1972) What is the point of this movie?  What is it trying to accomplish?  to make the audience laugh?  To make the movie more fun?   To make the film more interesting?  Is it that?  The movie starts off great with a great film that starts off on a good note, with great performances, with a really good story line.  But the movie ends up making it hard to take anything seriously.  It ends up just being a great movie.  This movie is a great example of why movies should be good.  The acting is so great that you forget the fact that it's a movie. This movie does a great job at making you laugh, it makes you feel good, it even makes you think a bit.   The cinematography in this movie is very good.   You'll have fun watching it.  And it doesn't take long for the movie to get you in the mood.   The Godfather is a movie that you will love.  I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  A very well made movie with great action and an excellent script. I thought it was a great idea to have a character that was so obsessed with his mission that he would risk his life and the lives of his friends and family. I enjoyed the movie very much and was amazed at the way the director brought it all together and how he kept the movie entertaining from beginning to end. I especially liked the scene where the character is out in the desert and he comes upon the camp of the rebel forces. The rebels were being bombed by the imperial forces and he went to investigate and found the rebels and his friend who he had never met. He went over to them and the rebels just sat there and were quiet. Then the rebel leader came over and asked him if he had seen them. They told him that they were just sitting there and they did not see them. The leader then asks them if they could see him. They said no. He said he had a better plan and told them that he was going to shoot them. He told them he had an idea and asked them if he could kill them. Then he asked if he was right. They all said yes. Then a rocket went off and the man fell down and was dead. The man had been a rebel himself. The film then moves to a desert where a rebel is being attacked by the evil empire. He kills the empire soldiers and runs to the base and tells the pilot of his mission. The pilot said he could not see anything and that he needed a better gun. The rebel said he would get one and then went over the base. He killed the soldiers and then was being attacked and killed by the empire. The imperial leader then told him to surrender and he said that was no use. He then said that he wanted him alive and that his men were not ready. The head of the rebels was then asked to surrender. He refused. The emperor then told his men to shoot him and they began to shoot. He shot one and was then shot by the other rebels. He was then brought to a secret room where the emperor was waiting for him. The movie then went into a sequence where the rebel was in the emperor's secret room and he was being tortured and killed. The evil empire then killed him. Then after a brief conversation the rebel came to the throne room and said that the emperor told him not to tell anyone what had happened. The queen then told the rebels that they must surrender.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The film follows an ex-con who is forced to work for a drug lord. He finds that he can trust him but the boss is a bit of a con himself. It is all a bit confusing and I think that this film would have been better if it had been a more straight forward drug lord movie. The story is about a young man who works for the boss and is sent to deliver some cocaine to him. The film has a few scenes in which the boss's son is shown and it is clear that this is an homage to a movie about a gangster. It's also clear that he is a bad guy as he takes his son on a road trip and it's clear that there is some sort of conspiracy going on. The plot is simple but the film is very interesting. The acting is great and the acting in this film is probably the best in the genre. The soundtrack is great, it is also very good. This is a great movie that you should watch. I would say that this movie is not for children and is very dark and scary. I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds" is the epitome of a classic thriller. The classic suspense movie plot is set in a small, coastal town and focuses on the story of a young boy who gets caught in the middle of a series of crimes. The movie follows a young, handsome and ambitious man, played by the young Michael Caine, who is sent to the small coastal town to investigate the strange murders. After the murder of a beautiful, young woman in his small town, the boy is convinced he may be the culprit and must now try to figure out how to prove his innocence.  The movie is a thriller in every sense of the word, but it's also a beautiful film, and a truly timeless masterpiece. The acting in this film is wonderful. Caine is perfect as the main character. Cushing plays the young boy very well, but the performances from other young men, played with a real sense of emotion, is wonderful as well. The whole movie is set on a beach. I really don't know how the filmmakers managed to capture this on film. The setting is so perfect, the weather so beautiful, the atmosphere so peaceful.    The movie opens with a scene of a man sitting on a bench on a deserted beach, and the rest of the film takes place around him.  This is the beginning of the movie.  The movie is very tense. The young boy is very worried and nervous. He doesn't want to be anywhere near the murder scene, but he can't stay away forever. He is constantly getting anxious and nervous about the situation.  One of the things that really made this movie special is the sound. C.L. Taylor is absolutely amazing as the local police officer. His voice is so soft and low. He makes the whole movie sound so real.  After the young girl was murdered, the young man is convinced that he is the murderer. His brother is the one that is responsible for the crime, but Cushing's character is convinced the police officer is innocent. It's interesting that the murderer was the young son of a local businessman. He wanted to have revenge for his parents' death, and he was determined to get his revenge. The film is really dark. The plot is very dark and it doesn't get any lighter. This is probably the only movie that I've seen where the protagonist has to watch his brother commit murder.  This is a perfect movie for a date.

(Click to show)  I have never seen this movie before, but it is one of those movies that is really good. The vampires in this movie were very well done and I really liked them. The film had a very great plot. The only thing I wish it had was a little bit more gore, and more blood. I have watched all of the vampire movies, and this one was my favorite. I liked the story line so much that I decided to see the sequels, which are the second and third movie of this series. If you like the movie, then you should watch the sequel, "The Lost Blood of the Vampire".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Exorcist" was a very good movie. It was good in many ways. The acting was good. I loved the way the characters talked. I felt for the victims of this movie and the way they were handled. It wasn't done as a horror movie but it was done as an exorcism film. I was also impressed with the way director Tobe Hooper handled the film. There was no gore in this movie, which I really liked. It also had a lot of suspense. I have to say that I'm a big fan of Tobe. I've seen him in "The Elephant Man" and "Rosemary's Baby" and I thought his work in this film was very good. It is a good film that I think should be seen by everyone. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

It is a well-done movie, with a great script, and a good amount of action. But it's the performances of the main characters that make this film a classic. Nicole Kidmans is brilliant as a naive young girl who learns the hard way that sometimes the world is a dangerous place, and the people you meet on the road can be the deadliest of all. Her character is a classic girl next door type, but there's something about her that is even more endearing. Her performance is so convincing that you can't help but fall in love with her.  Jeff Bridges is a great actor and a great character actor. He is perfect in this role, as the young man who is the only person who has any idea of what's going on. I think he's one of the greatest characters in Hollywood history. Christopher Plumer is also a great performance. His performance as a young woman who doesn't understand how the world works is a perfect match for

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________   "The Great Gatsby" is an excellent movie. I like the way it uses a novelistic structure to give us a look at a real and rich social setting. It has great characters and a strong theme. The screenplay by F. Scott Fitzgerald and the direction of F.W. Murnau are superb.   It's easy to fall in love with a rich man and a young girl, but it takes a great deal of skill to maintain that relationship. This is the story of a man who falls in love after the death of his wife. He becomes wealthy, but never feels happy. It's a tragic tale of a love affair.   of course, a great director has to know how to handle actors. F.Scott Fitzgerald is great as the aging man, Nick Carraway. He plays this man with such depth that you are sure he will do anything to make her happy. You see how much he cares about her. He is a great actor, and a brilliant storyteller.   the acting of Faye Dunaway is excellent. She is able to play the older woman very well. You have the impression she is a very old woman. The younger woman, Daisy Buchanan, plays a very young girl. She plays this character with so much emotion that you almost forget she is young. The only thing that bothered me was that her character had so much character development.   a couple of minor nitpicks:   1) There is one scene in the movie where the girls are riding their bicycles in the park. It is a beautiful scene. But it doesn't seem to fit the story. I thought the two girls should have been riding together, not separately. I don't think that would have made a difference.  ,2) I think that it is a little unfair that Daisy Buchanan was killed off at the end. I feel that Nick Carras is not quite as rich as she is. I think he should have stayed in the house and been a little more involved in his own life. It would have been interesting to see him try to find a real job and make a little money.  - November 15, 2004Gatsby, A Movie

We can't afford to move out now. My problem is, I've tried all the other methods, and I'm sure they are all futile. The best I can think of is to get married. The only thing I'm afraid of is that I'll fall in love with this lovely woman. But I'll do it. I'll marry this beautiful woman and have a family with her. I can't live without my children. I've made a terrible mistake. I will never get over it. When I was a young man, I was told that there is no way I could have a relationship with a woman. Now I realize that the whole idea of love and marriage was nonsense. All I can do now is to make love to my wife, and hope she'll be happy with me. I'm sorry, my dear, but I'm too old to be having any fun. I feel so stupid." - from "What I'm Doing With My Life", by Albert Camus
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  "What if we just lived in a world where all the great stories that had come before us never existed?"   A beautiful, sad, and touching movie, with some beautiful performances, which has a lot to offer. The story is simple and yet it is told in a manner that makes it more powerful.   The film takes place in an American town. The film begins with a beautiful scene in a movie theatre that has been turned into a home. A man, a woman and a child sit in a row in front of the screen and watch a film that they love. They are surrounded by old books and papers. The children, who are older than the man and woman sit in front with a book and the woman in the back with a baby. As they watch the film the man says "I'm not sure how this is going to end". The woman says "Oh it doesn't matter, there are always more stories that have yet to be told". The scene ends with the man saying "I feel like I have been watching a movie with my mother". The scenes, especially the first scene, have a wonderful tone. The man, who I believe is a young man, is an alcoholic. He has no idea how to end his story and so he has an affair with a woman who has her own story that she doesn't know how to tell. The woman and the baby die in the film. The first woman is a mother and her daughter who she loves dearly. She wants nothing more than for her daughter to survive. She is unable to tell her story and has a nervous breakdown. The daughter also has a difficult time telling her story. She can tell a few stories, but they don't come to her. She also has another daughter. As her daughter tells her story, the daughter is also unable to find a way to tell it. The father also has problems. He is the only one who can tell his story. He was an alcoholic and when he was told his story he was unable to continue. He killed his wife, who he loved, and has no one to tell his other story.   of course this is not the end of the film, it is just the beginning. It is clear that the main character, the young man is going through a lot of pain and he is also beginning to forget the things he loves. It may seem like a lot at the start, but the film goes on and on. The

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I'm not one to say a movie is good because of how well it has been made. I can appreciate a good story, good acting, and good directing. I just don't care about all the "excuses" the filmmakers use. The only one I find a bit too "excusing" is the ending. It is not too much of a shock or something. The movie ends with a really great cliffhanger, then you are back to the beginning with no idea of what is going to happen next. This movie does have some good action, some good special effects, and a good cast. If you like action and special effects movies, you will love this movie. If not, you can just watch some other movies for a change. I will give it 4 stars though, because it has its moments. The story and acting are good, but it is the acting that really makes this movie great. I was really surprised at how good the actors were in this movie and I really wish more people were like them. This would be a really good movie if only they would hire more actors with similar skill levels to the actors who were in the movie. This could have been really good. But it is not. It's just a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** This is a classic movie that everyone should watch at least once. A good comedy, and one that's well worth watching. I have watched the movie more times than I can remember, and I have loved it ever since. My dad has seen it twice, and my wife watched it with me, and we laughed our hearts out. The plot is simple. We see a couple, and their friend, go to a golf course, and make a couple of friends. It's a funny movie, and very enjoyable. The cast is great. A couple of the characters are good actors, and have a lot of fun. But the rest of the cast are all great, and you will laugh and smile. I've never seen a movie with a good cast like this. It makes the film stand out, and is a great comedy. The only thing that's not great about the film is the music. It is a little slow and annoying. It might be a problem for some people. However, the film will probably not bother you too much, and it's worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I was in love with this movie at the first minute. I was so surprised when it ended. ********** The movie has a very dark tone. The movie had a great plot but I don't really like it. ************ The movie is about a detective who is trying to find a serial killer. The detective must find the killer before the killer gets away with it.

She has a big crush on the boy named Kevin who is in a car with a stranger. The two are having a very passionate kiss. Rachel gets in the car to go home.

There she meets the boy Kevin is with and the two have sex. They go to the house of the guy Rachel had a crush on and the guy there says he heard a woman scream. He goes to the police station and asks the detective to help him find out what happened. The police tells him to go out and find Rachel. When he finds her she tells him she knows he is the detective. Kevin is very surprised. Rachel is in love and she wants him to help her. She tells him the police think that he is a serial murderer. She says that he may be after her. Kevin tells her that she needs to come home and says he will come with her. But when they get in the detective's car the detective asks her why she ran off and Rachel tells him he was going to take her home. The girl says he was right but she wanted to see him again.

( 3/5).. ( 4/5 )..( 5/5+). _______________________________________________________________________________ The best way to describe the ending of "Pororo" would be to compare it to a slow burn. The pacing and overall story is very slow, but it never gets to the point where it doesn't feel like you're watching a movie. The way the plot is built is very clever, and the mystery that's being built over the course of the movie is amazing. I've never seen a movie that is so much about the people in it, but the way it all fits together in a very cohesive way is so beautiful. The music is also beautiful, and has a very beautiful piano and violin theme throughout the movie. Overall, I loved this movie, and I can't wait to see it again. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ A very solid movie, but not great. The main problem with the story was that it had a lot of filler in it. It had a few scenes that were pretty nice, and that made it seem like there was a lot going on in the film. The movie was very slow at the beginning, and had a great slow build up to it. The ending was really cool, but there was no resolution. The story was pretty short, but I found it to be very engaging. The only downside to the movie was the length. I had never seen any movie as short as this, and it wasn't really a problem for me. It just felt like a waste of time. I wouldn't say this is a movie you should watch if you haven't seen it, because it was very enjoyable. _____________________________________________ A very cool movie. It has an interesting mystery, amazing music, and a very interesting story. I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone who likes movies about the occult, conspiracy, or supernatural. ____________________________ ( 4.5/5)( 4/10)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I really like this movie. It is very different from other westerns. The main character is not like the usual western hero. He is an outlaw and he wants to get away from it all. He wants to go back to the old days when the only way you could get away was to be a bad ass. It's a very interesting story that has some twists and turns. The best part about the film is the music. The music was great. I like the western themes from the beginning of the film. There are many memorable scenes. The ending is very cool and well written. It makes me wonder if they did a remake of The Wild Bunch. It also helps that the film doesn't try to be so realistic. It has a great soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I had to see this movie, and if you're a fan of '60s comedies and '70s action movies, this one is for you. It's got the feel of a cheap, short-lived TV show. It feels like the people who made it had just come out of the womb, and they didn't know how to play with a camera. The acting is a little stiff, and there are a few moments where you wonder if it's all supposed to be a dream. But it's a dream nonetheless.  __________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just saw The Hunger Games, the sequel to The Hunger games and I loved it.  And this is no sequel.  The new movie follows Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark as they both try to survive a war with the Capitol.  The new movie is great, but it is definitely not a sequel to the first movie.  This movie is more of a standalone movie and if you have seen the first one then you will love it. There is more action and more of the people are on their own now.    The only thing I would like to see is if they can add a scene where Katn and Peets first meet, because I feel that it was missing from the first.   This movie was really good, and I love the first film.  I recommend this movie to all fans of the first Hunger Games movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** The most important thing about any movie is the actors and this one is a real treat for all the stars, and that includes Sean Bean and Michael Gough... The story is about an American family whose car is stolen by a gang of Romanian criminals. The Americans get into a shootout with the gang, and the American family members are killed. A few weeks later, the Americans find the car. They decide to hide it in a remote spot, and a couple of days later, they discover that the gang is in pursuit. The family must fight for their lives and to survive until they can get help. A great movie with some great acting and great effects. I recommend this movie for anyone who loves action movies, a good story and a good ending. ****************************** 5 stars for action, story, and acting. **********  I don't know what else to say about this film. It is one of those movies that I watch on the weekends when I get bored and want something to watch. I don't remember much about the movie, except for a couple parts. It was an action movie, and I liked it. I know I should have seen it before it came out, but I didn't. It had a great story and it is the best of the action movies that you can find on video. I hope the DVD comes out soon.  R.I.P. Sean Bean. The best action film of the 1980s. A must see.  I was born and raised in Canada, but have lived in the United States for the last 18 years. I saw this film in a theatre and it made me weep. I was also saddened by the loss of the American characters, who played the roles of the Americans who were killed. But Sean Bean made the part work.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ I don't want to give this movie a bad review, I just don't feel that it is good enough to be called a masterpiece. If it wasn't for the ending, I would've loved this movie, but it really is a disappointing movie, it does not feel complete, or satisfying. I think this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The movie does not have any of the good aspects I've come to love from many great movies over the years. This movie has all the elements of a movie you should not watch: terrible acting, poor acting, bad plot, bad writing, terrible music, bad direction, bad editing, bad special effects, bad cinematography, poor special effects and the worst character designs I have ever seen in my life. If you haven't seen a great movie like this before, then I suggest you go and watch a few movies and then go watch this one. The only good thing about this movie is the ending. This ending is one of the most amazing and intense endings I have seen in the last 20 years. I honestly believe that the ending is so good because it was the ending that was needed at the time. This film is such a let down. I was hoping for a masterpiece, but what I got was a disappointing waste of time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I give it a C.

The musical was based on the story of a little boy who is abducted by a mysterious man. This is based on a book written by the author and was written for the stage. The cast are amazing. They all bring their own flair to this movie. The songs they chose were really good. They did a great job of recreating the songs and bringing it to life. The acting was amazing. The lead actress was fantastic. They really pulled off the movie. I had never seen the musical before but was so impressed by the film. The characters were all so relatable and the film did a good job at showing the differences between people. The ending was really good and made me smile. I recommend this movie to everyone.

Reviews  Comments: There are many reasons why this movie is a great example of how to make a good musical. I am going to talk about the movie in the order that it was filmed, which is why it is listed first.   The film is about a young man who is taken from his home by a man who goes by the name of Mr. Moo. Mr. Oosterbaan (Alfred J. Pinkham) is a wealthy man who has lost his fortune and he wants to buy the boy back. He tells the boy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Osterbloem (Dennis Hopper and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), that they have to take their son to England. The parents are convinced that the man will buy the child for him, but the father (Hopper) and mother (Mastrantonieo) are not so sure.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________  The movie I'm talking about is the original one: a few years back a young American couple, Michael (played by a young Chris Cooper) and Ann (played as an older lady) meet in a restaurant. Michael is looking for a job and Ann is looking to move to the US. She has a family and her father is an alcoholic. Michael offers to pay her for a trip to New York but Ann's father (played in the movie by the late Jim Carrey) is furious. Ann's mother (played with great emotion by Patricia Clarkson) is also angry and doesn't believe Michael. He finally agrees to pay for a train ticket to New Jersey to look for a house to rent in the suburbs. While on the train, they discover the house, and get married. When they are looking for their first house they meet a woman, Linda (played very well by a pretty blonde Linda Hamilton). Michael takes a job in the factory and the family decides to move there. They get used to their new house. There is a small problem with the house though. The door is not working properly and the kids are afraid of the house. It's a very dark and mysterious movie and the movie really had me in the middle of the story. I can remember the day I first saw it when I was about 10 years old. I remember it so well that it was like a dream. The movie is about a father and a mother who are very good and loving people. It was an old classic and I was so happy that it is coming back to the screen. This movie is a must see for everyone. I don't think that there is any better movie to bring a child to the cinema and get them excited about cinema. The first time I saw it I didn't want to leave the theatre but I had to because the movie just made me happy. It brought a smile on my face and the first smile I had after watching this movie. It is a good classic film and I hope that it will come back again to the screens soon.

It has everything I love in a movie - fun action, good performances, great plot twists and awesome special effects. I love the aliens and their different looks and different personalities.

It's a little slow at the beginning, but then it speeds up and gets really interesting. The special effects were awesome and the special effects for the aliens were very well done. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes a good sci-fi movie. I will definitely watch the movie again and I would like to see the movie in HD.

It was good, but not as good as some other movies.   (This review is based on a review by Richard T. James in MovieGuide.com ) The plot is a bit slow, but it gets good. There are a lot of action scenes, and it is a good idea to shoot on location in the woods. There is a lot to see and to listen to. You will also be surprised at the amount of detail that is put into this movie, from the costumes to the sets and the actors. The movie was well cast. I liked the roles of the characters. They were all good and different. I think the movie is a little too long, but I can't say much more than that. I also thought the actors were good. Some people might think that they are too much, but they all did their parts well. There were also some actors who played more than one part, but all of them did their part well. I was surprised that they used a lot more camera work than in other movies that I have seen. The scenes were filmed in a forest and were a little more interesting than the scenes in the desert.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ It is a story that should be told, it is a very good movie. The story is simple and it has a great pace and flow. I thought that it was the best part of the movie.  Helpful The best part is the dialog. The film is written and directed by the great Paul Thomas Anderson, who is a master of creating a mood. This movie has an amazing tone that just makes you feel like you are in a great movie. I think this movie is perfect to watch on a dark night and to watch at the end of a long day. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Both Worlds, or the best of both time.  I've seen it a dozen times or more and it never gets old.  This movie is a "must see".    There are lots of interesting details and a good story.   It's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't seem to have a whole lot of time for anything else.  It does take itself seriously.  But you don't have to be a serious person to enjoy it.  This movie is also funny.  You'll laugh and enjoy yourself.  My only complaint is the ending.  I really wish that it had been a little longer.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** Starring: Chris Pratt, Anna Faris, Bradley Cooper, Jeff Daniels, Chris Evans, Tessa Thompson, Robert Downey Jr. Director: James Gunn Written by: James Cameron The first time I saw Guardians of the Galaxy, I was blown away. It was a very unique and entertaining sci-fi movie. The action scenes are top notch and the characters are very well developed. The humor is also great and the humor works because it fits so well with the sci-fantasy elements. I'm not going to talk about how funny it is because it's so well done and well thought out. The ending of the movie is a little too weird but the movie overall is great. I have not seen the sequel yet so I can't really say much about it but I have seen a lot of people complaining about the movie and how it's not the same movie. I disagree. This movie is just a little bit better than the first one. It's definitely better than a lot more action movies. The character development is also a lot better and the action scenes aren't that bad. I don't know if I'd go so far as to say this is a great movie but it is a lot different than a typical sci-flick and it's definitely worth checking out.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape, the only film I know of that has a story about the Great War. I think it's a fantastic movie, it's got a great plot and a great cast.  I was at the theater with my friend and she had never seen a war movie and she loved it!  It's about a young boy who is taken by his parents to an amusement park where he is shown a ride that will take him to the other side of the world.  I liked the movie, I don't know why people hate it, I'm not a war buff but I am a movie buff, and this is one of the few movies I could find that is about the war that has no political aspect.    The best part of this movie is the ending where you feel so sorry for the kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  ___________   The only reason I rated this movie 3 stars is because I don't understand what was going on.  The movie was just so weird and had so much action, but none of it made sense.  the movie was supposed to be about a guy who kills someone, then his family kills him, then the guy is killed by the family and he comes back to life and kills them all. , but why would a dead guy be able to kill his own family? and why is he able to come back to this world and kill people? and is he even human? all of these questions were left unanswered. and the film just felt very weird and out of place. - I will give this a 1.5, but not one of the best movies I have seen.   i would like to give it a 4, but the way the film was shot made it hard to tell.  and the ending was a little disappointing.  for that reason i will give it only a 2.   and a 1 star for not having any story and being a terrible movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is good, but I think it needs a little more love from a director like David Fincher. The movie starts out with a lot of suspense, and it really works well. It was also a good idea to introduce some characters and their backstories, so it can be explored more. I liked the twist at the end of the movie.  It was very well done and I loved the way that the characters were brought together and then the twist comes. The only thing that was a little annoying is that there were too many action scenes, and the music was a bit too loud.  What did you think about this movie?  This movie had some very cool action sequences.  The best part of the story was that it was set in the future.   One thing that bothered me was that there wasn't a lot more of the back story of the characters.  For the movie it seemed like they just wanted to get to the action.  I guess that's why the movie was a very good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ A film in which two women (Sally Field and Lili Taylor) fall in love with each other and want to marry. A man (David Hemmings) and a woman (Debbie Reynolds) are lovers in a rural, small town in California. After a couple of years of being together, the couple have a difficult time in getting married. The film was shot in 1958.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "The Big Chill" is a movie that I really enjoyed and I don't know why. Maybe it's because I'm not that into big action films and I didn't get too caught up in the storyline of the film. Or maybe it's just because it's a well made movie and I really liked it. I think it has to do with the fact that it's not your typical action movie. The movie starts off with a great introduction where we learn that two people are at the center of the story. The two main characters are played by Paul Giamatti and Robert De Niro. I loved that they were both good looking actors. I really loved that Robert DeNiro is able to bring out the character of a tough guy. In fact, he brought out a good amount of tension in this film. I also loved how Paul Gainsborough was able to pull off the role of a bad guy. I would not have been able to watch this movie without having a bottle of whiskey. I just loved it. This movie has great pacing and the action scenes are well done. There's a great sequence where a bad guys gun is pulled back by a policeman and it goes off, then the bad guys go on a mission to get it. The gun then turns into a bomb. Then we see the bad guy going in for the kill and it doesn't take long for him to pull the trigger. In one of my favorite sequences of the movie, Paul Glammy plays the bad dude who kills a guy in a bar. It was one of those scenes where you're really in the moment. I was also really impressed by the action shots of the police officers. The action shots were awesome. I found it hard to believe that these cops are not able to shoot a bad dude in the head and he's still running around. In the end, I think the film did well because it had great pacing. There were some good moments that made the movie worth watching. I'd recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of big action movies. I don´t think I'll be able to put it down.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Haunting of Hill House"  - A movie that is a little bit creepy, but I don't see how it could be. This movie is based on a novel by the same name and it is the story of a house that was built in the late 1800s. The house was built by the first family of the area, who were mostly servants of the local lord. The family lived in the house for many years, but after they died they sold the property. The story is about a young boy who finds out that the house is haunted by the dead servants. The movie is directed by Brian De Palma and stars Tom Cruise as the boy and Laura Dern as his aunt. The film was shot in the early 90s. If you like horror movies you should see this movie. The ending is a bit disturbing but it's worth watching the whole movie.

I found myself rooting for the girl, and really liked her. It is a very well made movie, with excellent acting, and great sound. The movie was directed by a wonderful director, and the movie was well acted and produced. I think that this movie is a great example of how you can make a movie about a young lady living alone in the woods and it will be very good. I would give this movie a four stars if I could.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Rock, " " by   Paul Schrader,  " "by  David S. Goyer.  " The film starts out like a film noir. We meet a young man in his mid-twenties, who is about to start a new life in New York. The young man is a hit man, who's job is to go after and kill a wealthy widow, after she's been murdered. The widow is a beautiful blonde, and has hired a young white man to protect her.  The young hit man is played by  Paul Newman, who, in this film, is so good. He looks like a hobo, and he talks like a gangster, but he plays a tough guy. He's a real hit man in the movie, and, of course, the woman is a blonde, which is a big change for her. The two characters are not the only ones that are changing in this movie.  "The Rock" is very much a film about the 1960's, but it is not set in that era. It is set in present day. This is a story about two brothers, played by David S. Gordon and Peter Falk, who are very close to each other. They are not really brother and sister, but they are very like each other in many ways. They have to go against their family and their friends, and in a way, the movie shows their relationship. David S and Peter are brothers, but are very different in many aspects.  In this film we have a great, and very beautiful, young woman played by Jodie Foster. She is not just a beautiful young woman, but she is a tough girl, and also very loving and caring.  When they are going after the woman, David and Peter have to work hard to find her, and this film shows their work hard. They go through many different jobs, and when they finally do find her they have to try to get her to turn on her husband.  There are many interesting scenes in this, but I think that the movie does not have a very good ending, and I am not sure that it is worth watching. This movie is very good, but the ending does not make it a great movie. "The Rock"'s only fault is the ending.  For a movie about the time of the 60's, this movie does a good job with some of the details.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The Best of Both Worlds" was a terrific Star Trek film.  Star Trek: The Next Generation had been canceled just six years earlier. The film was a commercial flop at the box office and was considered a disappointment by the series' devoted fans. But this was a sequel to the original film, so many people assumed it was a reboot. Not so. The movie, which was directed by Nicholas Meyer, took its cues from the original series and retained many of the same characters. The only change was that William Shatner, the original Captain Kirk, was replaced by Leonard Nimoy. (Star Trek Movie Memories, p. 49)  Nicholas Meyer, who had also written the previous two movies in the series, was able to convince the studio to let him make this sequel. Although he had previously directed a Star Trek movie (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver"), he had been unable to get a sequel off the ground for the producers of the original. Meyer wanted the studio on board because, as he had explained to a studio executive, the fans had turned against the movie. The exec agreed to help him, even though he had no interest in doing a Star Wars-type film. (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p, 65) Meyer recalled, "They were very supportive. I had to go to a couple of studios and persuade them to let me make the sequel, which is the only way it could have been made." (Starlog, issue #162, p 23)  a studio  The producers of Star Trek: TNG decided that the film would be made by Paramount Pictures. When Meyer asked how Paramount felt about the film, the studio's producer Robert Wolfe said, "There are very few people who could be bothered with it." (Captures: The Star Trek Movie Experience, p 31) Paramount Pictures was interested in making the sequel and offered Meyer a seven-year deal, which he turned down. Meyer instead agreed to make the film with the studio for two years. (Empire, issue 27, p 26) Meyer wanted to make TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint" first, so that the studio would be able to make a follow-up. (The Official Star Trek - The Next Gen 365, p 8) Meyer did not consider making the film without a sequel. He noted, "We made it for two

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  When you think of "tough guy" movies, you probably think of The Big Chill, The Expendables 2, The Dark Knight or Die Hard. But not in a good way.   That's why the first time I saw this film, I was very disappointed. I thought the script was great, and the action scenes were great. But the character development was very disappointing. In the beginning of the film, he's a good guy, but his attitude changes very quickly. In fact, the first 20 minutes of the movie are a total mess. But I knew the character was not meant to be this kind of character. And it turned out, that it wasn't. He was a good, and kind man who wanted to do right by everyone. But in the end, he was forced to be a bad guy. But that was not all.  , and his character development, and I didn't like him at all. He started out as a very good guy and a very kind man. But he didn't want to do the right thing, even though he knew what it would mean to the people around him. He didn't think of others before himself. He had a hard time forgiving himself and accepting responsibility. He ended up a very selfish man, who didn't care about anyone.   was a very different kind of man. He tried to be good, but he was a bad person. I liked the character because he was not perfect. He made some mistakes, but I didn the characters for what they were. I also liked the way he dealt with his guilt, and he got help from the other characters. This movie was very dark and I felt sorry for him. I didn`t like the ending, but that's just because I didn' t like the characters. I like how the movie ends, because it's very satisfying, and very good. I can't say that I didn''t like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ _________ _____________ ________ ______________ _______________________ _______________ _________________ ___________________  Cory Doctorow  June 27, 2011  "Citizen Kane" is one of the great films of all time. It is also one of my favorite films. It makes me feel good to think that, despite my relatively poor film education, that I can still find some good in it.  The film opens with the famous speech by the director, Orson Welles. He states, "This is a story about an unknown stranger, who arrives in a remote part of the country and takes over the position of a movie star. What he wants is to become an actor and take his place in the great film history, that of Citizen Kane. This man will soon change Hollywood forever. And his name is Orson Wells."  He then explains that the real story is much more interesting. He tells a bit of his own life story, as he grew up in a small town in New York State. He grew up to become a great movie actor, and then was the top box office star in the world. But when he began to realize that his own movie career was not going to last long, he decided to change his life and move to Los Angeles to be an actor. The first part of his life was fairly unremarkable. He was married to a beautiful actress named Ruth Gordon. But his fame was beginning to grow rapidly and he wanted to take advantage of the situation. He got an apartment in a building that was a short walk from the studio where he was making his movies.  of course, he was already famous. He didn't need a new apartment to make his life interesting. It was quite obvious that he had it made. He had been in every major movie of the 1940s. He made the movie "The Big Sleep" in 1940, "Citizen Jack" in 1941, and the movie of his career, "The Magnificent Ambersons" in 1943. , and was very successful. But, he also knew that the movie business was very corrupt. The movie studios and the directors would pay big salaries to the top actors. But the stars would be kept in check. The big stars would only do a few films a year. They would then retire and spend the rest of their lives in Hollywood, getting rich off of their movie careers. And all this was done on a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ I have watched this movie since it came out. I like it. I have seen it twice. I am glad it is still in theaters. It is good. It takes a while to get going, but when it does you can enjoy it. It may seem like a slow build, but the story and characters are interesting and you are rooting for them to get their happy ending. It starts off slow and then it gets fast and then you're like, "oh shit!" Then the ending is really cool. I think the characters and plot are not all that original, but they make up for it with great acting. If you are a fan of horror, then this is a good horror movie. If not, you may not like it all that much. But I think that is the main reason this movie is still so popular today. It will scare you but you will also be hooked and want to watch it again. I really liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Logan" is a movie about a young man who has a lot of issues. Logan has issues about his sexuality, about his family, about the way his father treated him and his life, and about his mother. Logan tries to find a way to make his mother and father understand that he has issues too. He finds a therapist, who seems to understand him better. It is hard to see how this movie has such an impact on a young adult, but it did. It made me cry, and made me realize how much I wanted to see this movie. I will admit that the ending of the movie wasn't what I was expecting, but I was glad that it happened. I think it was necessary to show that Logan has problems. And it is very good to see a guy who had no friends grow into a man and a hero. I love the way the movie portrays a young male trying to make sense of the world around him. This is what we want to see from our young male heroes, right? "Logan is the most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. I hope that the producers continue the series.

The group is a group consisting of a father, a son, a mother, and their four children. The mother is in a coma and has a son named Frank, a boy who is in love with his sister and a boy, who is not in love. He is the only one of the group who is normal and the one who does not have any special powers. The family is living in the small town of Wapakoneta, Ohio, where the father and son, who are retired, work at a company called "The S.P.C.O." This company is a company that specializes in the manufacture of nuclear warheads. The company was started by the father who, during the war, was a bomber pilot in a group called "Flight 666" and was the only survivor. The son, Frank, finds out that he has the ability to travel back in time. He has no idea why he has this ability. He just does it for fun. However, Frank soon learns that he is able to see a future, even in the time before the bombing. Frank learns that his sister, who has been taken hostage, will be killed by a man named "Barry the Chopper" who will then take her to the Soviet Union. He does not know that the man in the future is the son of the man who kidnapped his sister. Frank is also told that his mother and sister will also be killed, but he is not allowed to find out what happened to them. The film opens with a shot of a large building that has a large number on it. The caption that appears says, "The Number of the Beast." As the camera starts to zoom in on the building, we find out that the number "666" is etched on the side of the building. The building then disappears as we start to zoom out. The shot pans up and we see the sky as a plane flies overhead. We see Frank, who appears to be the leader of the family. He then tells the other members of the team to get ready to leave. He also tells the rest of the members to not tell anyone about what they are about to do. They are to go to the location that has been painted on the wall by the number of the beast. When they get to the place
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie very much. I don't know why it wasn't a better movie. The plot is so simple, and the characters so good. I wish they had gone with more characters, but this is good for a summer movie. There is also a very nice little movie about a dog named "Kanal", but that doesn't matter to me. It's fun.  Don't watch this movie alone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* * I have never seen this movie and I can't say that it is great. It is a nice film but it is not great. The movie has great music and great acting. This movie has all the right ingredients to make it a classic movie but the movie is just not good. I think the film would have been better if it had been made before WWII when this movie was made. There is nothing new here. It just has all of the wrong things about it. The story about the German and Russian forces in the north is just unbelievable. It's like the movie was trying to tell us something but they could not come up with anything. I'm going to say that the movie takes place in a dream. The war scenes are very good and I believe the director of this movie could have made this movie better than it was. The last 20 minutes are just so bad that I really cannot see why anyone would want to watch this movie. * * * Overall, a good film but not great!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ The following review is based on a film I saw on the big screen. I don't think it is fair to judge it so harshly. I will give it a 7.5/10. The movie was great and I enjoyed watching it. The cast was great. I loved how much we got to know the people that were in it. I would give it an even better rating if it wasn't for the ending. I had a hard time watching it again. It was a great movie but I think I would have enjoyed watching the first 2-3 minutes more. I think they could have had more time to show what happened in that little cabin. I guess I should have read the synopsis and the movie would have been different. The story was very interesting. It had a great twist at the end and it didn't take long to figure it out. I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it wasn''t bad. I thought it was a good way to finish off the year. I was going to give it 8.5, but now I think it deserves a 7 or 8. This was a very fun movie to watch.

The story is simple and a good one. There is a strong love story between two guys, but that's about all that I can say about it. The action scenes were very well done and the girls were pretty. I don't really like this movie as much as I liked the first, but I think it has it's charm. It's also a movie that I would love to see again. - There are a couple of scenes that are not very exciting, but those are only because they were the least interesting for me. I like the movie as a whole and I don t know why. It was a pretty good movie, but it never made me want to see it again. It has a good romance, but is not very complex. ___________________________________________________________ [A] - I would probably rate this movie higher, but because I was only 16 at the time I can't really judge this movie. The movie was well-done, but there were a few scenes that were not very interesting for my taste. I liked how they portrayed the two main characters, but my favorite character is probably the one that is not as well-defined as the others. _________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished watching "Babel", a movie which is not very good but has one of the most interesting stories I've seen in a while. This movie takes place in a small town in southern Germany in the 70's. This is a time when the Nazis are still in power. In this town the Jews are still alive and have to hide. One day a German farmer decides to go to the woods to look for the Jewish children and he meets an old woman who tells him that the town is surrounded by the Germans. He wants to find out what happened but there is a man in the woods who is a Nazi and tells him not to go in. The man tells him about how the Jews were treated in Nazi Germany and how the Nazis have killed all the children. He also tells him how a young boy who was in the same class as the boy that was killed was put in a cell with a Nazi officer and he was tortured. This young boy was only 5 years old. After the torture he died. It is a good story and it is also a film about the suffering of the Jews. The movie was made in 1968, which is when the Holocaust was happening in Europe. This film is one of my favorites of the year. This great movie was released a year after the release of "Hoop Dreams" and it was also made by a German director.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Have you seen The Mummy? No. I haven't. It's a great movie, but it's not for me. It looks good, and the action is pretty cool. The characters are interesting, and there are some great moments. But the script and acting just aren't for me, and I didn't feel like it lived up to the potential of the book. I also wasn't really interested in learning the story of this Mummy. It seemed to be more a case of, "I know it's in the book, but who cares?" So, if you're looking for a fun, action packed, scary movie, this is a good place to start. _______________________________________________ (This review was first published in June of 2000, but is being re-released in June 2016.) This is the second film adaptation of the story "The Mummy." The first was The Mummification of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. ___________________________ I've always been a sucker for horror movies. I loved The Shining, and The Exorcist. I even like the original version of Carrie. I never really thought of myself as a horror person. However, my brother introduced me to The Mummies, and it changed my mind. After seeing this movie I found myself enjoying the story, and enjoying the action. The story is fun, and has some pretty cool moments. The Muppet Movie, The Shining and The Evil Dead were all classics for me at one point, and watching this movie reminds me why. It has the action, the scares, the laughs, and some of the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. There are some really good monsters in this movie. The first one that really stood out to me was the mummy that looks like a crocodile. It was kind of creepy and scary, but I just loved the idea of it. And then there is the creature that is kind of like a vampire. I was kind to the way they used the creature. It looked cool, and made some really funny lines. __________ The Muppets were great in this, and were the perfect characters for the story. They were so well done. The puppeteers were great, and they played all of them very well. They also did a great job of making the character of The Great Sphinx look like a real man. I thought that was great.

I'm sorry to say it, but it's not that delicious."  -- Stanley Kubrick  A few years back, I was talking to a good friend about how it would be really interesting to take a group of friends to see the new version of "2001: A Space Odyssey," which had just been released. It had been a big hit at the time, with a lot of buzz around it, and I suggested that we should go to see it together. He said, "Oh, but Stanley would kill me!" I knew that I was right. The only thing that Stanley Kubrick ever loved more than a good piece of food was a good film. The man was a foodie.  When Kubrick was young, he attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and studied acting under Bertolt Brecht. After college, he moved to New York and began working as a screenwriter. At the age of 23, he began making his film debut with a script he had co-written called "The Killing." In it, he cast a young and unknown actor in the role of Dr. Christopher Walken, who was in a car crash that left him badly injured. The scene was filmed and screened at the Berlin Film Festival and won the Grand Prix, but the film was never released in the United States. It never got a theatrical release. Kubrick felt that he had a great story to tell and was determined to bring it to life. In his book "The Shining," he explained his motivation:  The film was not intended to be a comedy. The idea of a doctor in a wrecked car and a patient waiting for a blood transfusion seemed more amusing than realistic, but I wanted to do it anyway. I decided to use only a small part of the original script, and that the patient was a girl. I had the idea of an American tourist who comes to England with a girl he is visiting. When he comes to a stop, a young girl in a wheelchair falls into his car, and he must save her. When I started writing the screenplay, I did not have

The movie itself is set in a world of fantasy and a very good one. The characters are very well done and the story line is fun and interesting. I enjoyed watching this movie and the best part was the fact that the movie ended up in a very dark, and sad, and depressing place. It is one of the very few movies that actually had a good ending and it ended up being very good as well. ******************************* The bad: It was not a good action movie. It lacked a lot of good action scenes and I felt that it needed more than 3 good ones. Also, there was a lot more talking in this movie than what we usually see. This was a great movie, but it was not the best of the series.

Privacy Policy  The first thing I notice in "The Mule" is how big it is. The film's enormous size is intentional — it's set in a small town, so it is hard to get a sense of the entire city, but the film seems to be shooting in every neighborhood in a city of a million people. (It's based on a true story.) But the scale is also meant to underscore the sense of desperation of the town's inhabitants. It is almost as if they are living in a place so small that the size of their daily lives has become a kind of existential crisis.  When the title character, a young, naive boy, finds himself in the city, he becomes a kindhearted but somewhat reluctant guide to the people and places that he has come to know only as his own personal Mules. But the city is in a terrible state. As Mr. Cukor explains in a moving moment, the Mules are being destroyed by disease, starvation and war. The only hope for the city's future is the presence of the Mule, who is an unlikely messenger to the outside world. But as the film unfolds, Mr. Jankowski becomes aware of other Mules, who are just as helpless and in danger.  and his Mules on a bus.

There is no dialogue in the film. And Mr. Johnson, who wrote and directed, makes a point of never speaking. Instead, the film is almost a documentary, showing the characters as they talk to one another. . Mr. Williams has a fine line to walk.

In the early 1990s, the most popular and lucrative film series in the history of American cinema was the "Harry Potter" series. In 1995, the third film in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was a smash hit. It grossed over $200 million and was nominated for four Academy Awards. The film was also a box office hit internationally. The popularity of the series was a big reason that the film was made in three parts. Harry Potter was an inspiration for many of the characters in the Harry Potter films. He is a young boy who is caught up in a magical world of wizards and witches. The films are set in a variety of settings and include all the major characters from the books.

I'm going to take a little bit of a different approach with this review, and try to break it down a little better.  .     The movie starts out with a great deal of excitement. You are treated to a good set of opening credits, with a couple brief shots of some interesting characters, and a nice little music cue that sets the tone. Then a quick shot of a woman walking in the snow, and the sound of someone saying, "Good morning, Mr. Jones." That's a little vague, but it gets the point across.   the movie then moves into a bit of background on some interesting historical figures, and some interesting real life things that are going on.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ The movie "Saving Private Ryan" is an American film from 1986, starring Tom Hanks as a Sergeant in the U.S. Army during World War II. The movie tells the story of the American hero, Private Ryan, as he is sent to the battlefields of Europe, where he is to lead the assault on the German army's headquarters. The main story of this movie is the "Patton" campaign, which took place in North Africa. This campaign was won by the Allies with the help of the brave American troops. The "Pattison" campaign is the battle for France, in which the Americans managed to win by destroying the French army's machine guns. The second part of the movie is about the capture of the German General, Erwin Rommel, and his capture by the Americans. The film is based on the book by Robert Graves, in addition to the famous novel by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The best way to appreciate the movie "Shooting a Private Ryan", is by watching it with a film buff. It is an interesting movie, but a little slow at times. This movie is a must see, especially for those interested in war movies, but it may not be for everybody. However, it is an enjoyable movie, especially if you like Tom Hiddleston. The actors in this movie are good, especially Tom Hargrove, Tom Berenger, Jeff Bridges, and John Hurt. The music is good, but not as good as the other films. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Recommendation for everyone: ______________________________ _____________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why I Love This Movie: I can't believe this movie hasn't already been on my radar, but that's what I get for looking too long. The plot is straightforward, but it is incredibly well thought out. The characters are complex and believable, and there's a genuine sense of fun to the proceedings. If you're looking for a good action movie with lots of action, then this is your movie. The movie does feature a little bit of violence, and the final showdown at the end is well done, but not over the top. For me, the real star of this movie is the soundtrack. The score is pretty good, but I'll give the movie credit for that. It has a lot of great songs that were created for the film, and they work very well in conjunction with the movie. It's a great movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who likes action. There are a lot more great movies out there that you can enjoy, but this is one of the best action films I've ever seen.

So I just did it. I'm glad I did.  .    ..   The film starts with a couple of people in a house watching a movie. They are having fun and laughing and talking. One of them is saying "I'd be dead if I was in that movie."   the movie starts with some people going to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter comes up to the group and asks if they want any alcohol.  , one of the men says yes and he brings them a beer. Then he brings a bottle of wine.   (This scene is a great example of how they use a very simple set up to give us a glimpse of the characters we've come to know). The waitress comes up and says that she can't serve them drinks until the movie is over. The people in the restaurant are starting to look at each other and the waiter says that they'll have to wait.   the waiter goes back to the kitchen and brings back a tray with a drink and a plate with two meatloaf sandwiches on it. (This is the only place in the movie where the waitress doesn't wear a skirt. It was a great touch. They were wearing jeans, but they were still wearing skirts). The waiter brings out the meatloaves and the people in his party
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I'm not sure what to say about this movie. It's got a pretty good story, and the characters were all pretty good in it. I don't have a strong opinion on any of the actors in this movie, but they're all decent. It doesn't do anything special for me, but I do like the concept and the music. This movie is not bad, it's just not really great either. I would like to see the movie with a lot more dialogue and less fight scenes.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. The first 20 minutes or so of "The Mummy" are soooo cheesy. But the movie picks up after that. I like that the movie does not go down the traditional monster movie route. This movie is more like a real-life supernatural story. The best part about the movie is the characters. The characters are all so likable and it's very easy to root for them. I think this movie is really well made. The special effects are really good and the sound is good as well. "The Scorpion King" is a great movie. It's just so fun to watch. The movie is full of great action scenes and the music is really good. "Curse of the Mummy: The Curse of the Black Mummy (1955)" is a real classic. If you want a good, fun monster movie, this movie's for you. I'm sure you will enjoy this movie. I did!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* "A Good Day to Die Hard" is a good film, that can give a good insight on what the movie is all about. I think this film was well made and was well directed. I enjoyed it, it was good and funny. "A good day to die hard" is an awesome movie, but it's the story and the characters that make this film. This movie is a really good story. The whole movie is about a man who is working in a bank and he get a call from his friend, a bank robber. This friend tells the bank robber he is going to rob a bank. The bank robber is surprised and goes to investigate the bank. But before he can do anything, he is taken out by a SWAT team, a huge police force. The SWAT team tells the man that he has to leave the bank immediately, he will not get any money. The guy is shocked, and does not know what to do. He is taken to jail, but he is not free. After a while, the guy is taken by a helicopter and the cops get his fingerprints. They then go to the bank and arrest the bank robbers. After the bank robbery is done, the police tell the guy what happened. The man says that he doesn't know why he is in jail, he did nothing wrong. He says that after the bank raid he went to a party and there were a lot of people there, including his girlfriend. He told her about the bank he robbed and she told him that they would pay the guy, so he would stop. The cops say that it's just too good a story, that the bank is really robbed, and they are going to let him go. After they let him out, they take the guy to the hospital and he is really scared. He tells the police that he was only in jail because of his girlfriend, and that he would never hurt anyone. When the movie ended, I was really happy, and I was glad to see the movie was good. I hope that the movie comes out on DVD. ******************

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Good: ____ _____ _____ The Bad: _____ ___ ___ ___ The Ugly: _______ _____  Helpful information: _________________ _____________________ A good action movie is fun and exciting, but it is not always the most emotionally rich or gripping. It should be a fun, exciting, action-packed movie that takes you to another place. This movie takes us to a different place. It is not an epic battle, but a close-up, personal battle between a man and a monster. The movie is not really a story. It's more of a journey. The whole movie has this epic feeling, and the movie keeps going and going, and going and goes. It has a great ending, but I will never forget the movie that started it all. I will always remember my first experience watching this movie. It was a long time ago, and it is difficult to remember. I remember it was a dark, rainy night, and my aunt was watching it with me. I had been in the bathroom all day, but my aunt wanted to watch it anyway. It felt like the movie should be in black and white, and she asked if I wanted to turn it on. I said yes, and we watched it together. It took me a while to get into the movie, but once I did, I never left. I think this movie is what made me fall in love with martial arts movies. I thought the movie was just a great action movie, that was just fun to watch. I didn't think there was anything deep in it, or that there was a story behind it. I just thought it was fun to be around this amazing movie. The only problem was that my aunt had to go back to work the next day, and I was left with a huge headache from all the laughter I had had that day. I still think this is a great movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves martial arts and action movies.

There were a couple of scenes in the beginning that were a little slow, but the rest of the film was fast paced. The story is not too complicated, but it is not very deep either. It's a good story, and if you are a fan of sci-fi, you will love this film. If you are not a fan, you may want to stay out of this film for it will not be for you. It was a good film, and it would be great to see another film made with this cast and crew.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I was a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. The prequels weren't nearly as good as the originals, and there were a lot of missed opportunities with the story, but the original trilogy still has some of the most amazing and exciting action sequences. In particular, the first three films are all great in that they show us new and interesting aliens, worlds and cultures that really set the stage for the films to come. The most memorable sequences are when a Jedi battles a giant sand worm in the desert, a podrace on a desert planet, and a chase scene on Tatooine. I was always curious about the story of these films, but I was never particularly enthralled by it. The first film was about a group of young rebels trying to overthrow the Empire, and the second film was a follow up to the previous film in the series that is focused on a group who are trying to build an empire. These films have some of my favorite scenes, and I don't think any Star Wars movie will top them. The new movies have some great action sequences, and they're definitely a lot more entertaining than the prequel. I'm still a big fan of these movies, but they've lost a little of their original charm. Overall, they're still a great adventure.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** I have to say this is a very good movie, a very well made movie. It is a real classic, a classic of the 70's. It was an American film. It had a huge effect on the 70s, it was a movie that everyone saw, it made a lot of people cry, but it was so good it also made a great movie, because it was made with great people, with great acting, great writing, great music, it has great direction. The only thing I didn't like was when they put a movie in the movie theatre and when the movie ended it was very quiet. It seemed to be the end of the movie and they didn't want to show the movie. That's just me. But this movie is great, it is so good. I don't know how they could have made a better movie. I can't think of a movie better. It has such great acting. I like this movie so much. I love this movie, and I don t think you can go wrong with it. I give it a 10/10, a perfect 10/ 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I didn't really have high expectations of this movie. My husband and I have always been big fans of the original 'Terminator'. I remember seeing the movie as a kid and having a blast. This movie seemed to me like a cheap copy of that movie. And to be fair, it did seem a little rushed. The ending was a bit abrupt and kind of rushed. But overall I loved this movie and thought it was great. I would recommend it to any fan of the first movie. I was glad they tried to do a sequel and the cast was good. This was my first Terminator movie and it was good enough to pass the time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________  "When I saw this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm a huge horror fan and I always think of the original Halloween when I think of horror movies, but when I saw the trailer, I thought, "What is this?" I thought the story was very strange. The film started out like any other horror film: A young girl, named Alice, is walking down a dark street, when suddenly, a figure jumps out from the bushes at her. This is followed by a series of disturbing images: Alice is being chased by an apparition, a woman in a nightgown is throwing objects at her, a girl in a black dress and heels is trying to get her to reveal her identity, and a man is attempting to rape her. But as the film progresses, the film begins to look very much like a horror movie, with many scenes that were quite disturbing. Alice is able to overcome the fear and escape from the man, but not before he has torn off her clothes. I thought that this film was very scary, and was able to laugh out loud a couple of times. The actors, who were all very good in this film, did a great job of conveying the characters' fear. I think that the filmmakers did a very good job with this film."

I don't like it, but I do think it's a great movie. It is a film about the Vietnam War. It's very honest about the war, about the people involved, and about the fact that it ended badly for many of the people who were involved in it.   The problem is that the film is not really that interesting. It was made by a bunch of friends who were interested in making a movie, and the film was written by a guy who was only interested in writing a script, and he didn't even care about making a film. I think that's what the film lacks in the end. The film isn't about Vietnam at all, but is a bunch movie stars playing Vietnam War movies.   of course it does have some great lines and the script is very interesting.   is there anything in the film I could like? No. The main problem with this film is that it's boring. It has a boring plot. The movie is so overblown that it is actually kind of sad. The only thing I like about this movie is that in the second half there is some actual action and a bit of humor, but the film never really picks up.   (see my review of "Saving Private Ryan" to see what I mean)   It's a shame because it has some great parts. It also has some very good acting and some really great action scenes. It would be a very interesting movie to watch. I would even like to see a version with some actual actual action. I guess that's why I'm so disappointed that this movie isn't much better. It should have been a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I watched this movie in a theater, and it's sooo much better than the trailer. It's like a better version of The Terminator. The story is like a horror movie. You will laugh a lot. It will make you scared, but you will also find out it's not as bad as it seems. It is a good story. I would recommend this movie for people who like a good horror movie, and a good thriller. It'll make you think and have fun. I really liked it. I also liked that the people who made this movie are not just "movie makers" but people who are real people.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ The Good:  The film is about a young man who lives in a small town and has an abusive father. He has a relationship with his stepmother. The film focuses on the father and the young man and his problems with his father. It also takes you through the young person's life and it is a story of growth. The young man goes to college and has a difficult time because of his father's behavior. The Good will have you rooting for the young guy and also laughing at his father at times.  I found the film a little depressing at times but there are some funny moments in it. ______________________________________________________________ The Bad:    The film is full of bad choices. There are a lot of bad decisions made in this film. For example, the father is abusive to the young girl and she has to get pregnant by her stepfather. He uses her as a pawn to get his way with the girl and the girl also uses the young people to get herself out of a tough situation.    The Good is about growing up and there are a couple of scenes in this movie that will make you smile. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Summary:   My rating for this film is a 2.5.  I found this film to be pretty good and it did show some growth. _________________________ Read more reviews about this movie on my blog. http://kc-sue.blogspot.com/2009/05/my-review-of-this-film.html?m=1

I thought the acting was bad, the story was weak, the plot was just terrible. The first movie was a lot of sex and nudity. This movie does not have that many, but it was still very enjoyable. I loved the idea that the main character, the boy, is a virgin. He is not. He has a friend who is a girl. She helps him with his sexual problems. I really enjoyed this movie. There is something about it that made me want to see it again. I will watch it again, just not for the sex scenes. The music was also very nice and relaxing. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes good acting and a good story.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: rjgarner2012

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!. I don't think I will ever get tired of seeing this movie. It's a classic movie about a guy who just wants to be a policeman and gets his chance when he's sent to the South to investigate a series of murders. And who could blame him? In a town that has no police force, a policeman is a savior. This movie is a real classic and it is one of the best movie you'll ever see. The story is a little bit convoluted, but it's not a big deal to me. This is the story of a policeman who becomes a detective. The movie is about how the South is different from the North, and the differences between these two areas are huge. This film is about a detective in the North who is trying to prove his innocence, while in the South there is a big case that is going on. The acting is great. It wasn't long before we started to see that all the characters are really well-developed and believable. The director was trying to create a feeling of suspense by showing us small things that happen that no one sees. It was done in a way that I felt as though I was really there with the detective. This was the first film I ever saw by a black director. The other films of this genre that I've seen before, were all done by white directors. But the director of this film, Frank Oz, did it justice. I have to give a special mention to the sound. It didn't have any big names, but every character had a great voice and it was really a nice way to listen to a movie. I'm giving this movie 4.5 stars, because it really is a classic and deserves to be seen by many.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In my opinion, this movie is about a lot more than the fact that a young boy had sex with a girl he barely knew. This movie is also about a very sick girl (played by Marci Reeves) who was sexually abused as a child and who was sent to a reform school for her sins. The film was directed by Gary Graver and is also produced by Graver's wife (she was a very talented actress). The film is set in the late 1950s.   The story begins in 1957 in a small town where the only young boy in the town is a 12-year-old boy named David (the main character). David has a crush on a girl, Missy, and they get involved in a sexual relationship. David is a poor kid and does not have any money to pay for a hotel room and an expensive dress for Missy. David and Missy's mother (played wonderfully by Judy Garland) try to hide the relationship from the other townspeople and David's father (played brilliantly by James Stewart) and his girlfriend (played deliciously by Janet Leigh) are the only ones who are aware of their relationship. The rest of the townspeers are aware that David and Mrs. Leigh are together and that David is "in love" with Missy and do not seem to care. The relationship is so well hidden that no one thinks about it until the day that David leaves for the city to go to school. David goes to school and meets a boy named Charlie (played superbly by Peter Lorre). David, Charlie, and Missie go out for a night on the town. At night, they decide to get drunk and have a party at a local bar where David takes a shine to a beautiful girl named Brenda (played delightfully by Mary Martin).   David and Charlie's relationship goes from a fling to an intimate affair. David finds out about Charlie's secret life when he is in the city and finds him hanging out with Brenda. David tries to find Charlie and Brenda and runs into a group of high school students who are interested in David. David does not want to go back to the town because of the way Charlie treated him. David's mother and her boyfriend, who is a teacher, try to convince David to go home. They offer David money and he turns down the offer.  .  I loved the story. David has so many problems. He is lonely and has no friends. His

The story was very original and I was afraid the movie would just be a jump scare movie. The first two acts are very good and I loved every part of it. I liked the characters that were played by Steve McQueen, who plays the main character and his friend who he is trying to protect. I also liked the movie was very atmospheric and suspenseful. I thought the acting was very good. The movie also has a great soundtrack which is good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I'm a big fan of The Terminator. It's the first in the series I ever saw and I've always been a big T-1000 fan. The original movie was just fantastic. The plot was great. It took a new direction in the future and had some really cool stuff. The characters were great and the story line was interesting. The sequels though were not as good as the first. The story line in the second movie was way too simplistic. The character development was poor. There was no emotion in the character's actions and no depth to their motivations. They were just there to be used. The third movie had some great scenes but the plot line was all over the place. It had some good action scenes but didn't have any interesting characters. The last one is not much better. There are some cool scenes but not enough to make it worth seeing. I'm going to say it now. The series was over when the last movie came out. The only reason it's so popular is because of the T-800 and he's still around. I don't care for the character or the plot. It just seems like they didn't want to do anything new with the characters. You could say the third movie was a continuation of the first two but it was so confusing I couldn't follow it. It wasn't the only bad thing. The acting was horrible. Most of the actors didn't really fit with the roles they were playing. They weren't good enough to play the parts they were given. The cinematography was poor too. It looked like they took some of the old effects and tried to use them for the movie. It was all very confusing and it took away from the good parts of the movie which were great. I would avoid this movie at all costs. It is a disappointment.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  It's always been my dream to travel to the world.  I have a great imagination, but I was born with a very narrow mind.  a child I was, with little or no real ability to visualize the world around me. I could only see what I had seen and the things that had been said to me. My mind didn't make any sense. I couldn't even see things as they are. It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I realized I was able to create my own reality. ...  My childhood had a very dark side. I was raised by my alcoholic mother. I grew up on a street in a poor neighborhood. I never really had a father in my life. I always had someone to look after me. He was my mom's brother, but we never really connected. My mom was very angry with my dad for getting himself in so much trouble. She was a very demanding person. , so I didn't really have a father until I had been about 25. He died when I was about 17 and I was still living with my mom. She did not really care for me at that time. She had her own problems, so we never had a relationship. I didn;t really like my mom because she would do whatever she wanted, but at the same time I never wanted to hurt her. I just had to do what I was told, and I did. I would sneak out of the house and go to a drug dealer to do whatever I had to. I also did drugs a lot, and this would happen a lot. The street was just filled with drugs. It was dangerous and scary, but the drug dealers would give me some of their products, and at the time it was the only way to survive. It's hard to explain how bad it was, but it really was. I spent my time doing drugs and doing what I needed to do to survive on the streets. I wasn't the smartest person in the world, but most people in my situation would never be able to survive without drugs. There were a few times when I could make it through a week without using drugs. The only problem was when my mom died. She took my life and left me on the street. It took me a long time to figure out what I did wrong. I had no education, but because I didn' t care I was never able to go back to school

Write a positive review about a good movie: ---------------  You may remember this movie from "Trouble in Paradise" or the TV show. It's about a guy who wants to be a writer but instead of making a living, he has to work in a bookstore. He writes a book and gets an agent. The book is very good but the movie is good as well. I like the ending and the characters.   I just had a bad day and needed a movie to get me out of it. This movie did it.   a good read: -------------  It's about the life of a writer who is trying to make a living. His wife leaves him and he's depressed. One day a woman comes in and gives him a copy of a book. The story is about the author. She is an author too. She's very talented and writes very well. She makes a lot of money and he doesn't want to give her his last dollar. They decide to have a child and they write a book together. It goes great but it's very difficult for them. They can't do anything with it. The end of the book is the best part. It was my favorite book I've ever read. It is written by a woman and I didn't mind that. I liked it because it was a good story and because it ended so well.   to get my fix of horror movies: ------------  There are a lot. I recommend this one to everyone.  , a guy, who is writing a book called "Curious George", and he is in love with a girl, who happens to be his neighbor. The girl is the girl who lives next door. They meet, and she becomes interested in him and wants to meet him. He wants to see her, but she's too shy. So, they have a game. She has to tell him what she does. She thinks it's a bad idea, because he'll laugh at her. So she tries to pretend to be funny. But he doesn. The movie was great, but the story was a little boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________  I don't know what to make of the movie because it doesn't have much of anything. It's an adaptation of a book by Richard Matheson and a screenplay by Robert Siegel. It was produced in 1967 but it was only released in 1970. The book is about a young boy who's been separated from his mother at a young age. He and his mother get separated for a while and when he returns home he finds a house full of people who are not his mother. The mother has disappeared. The film does not tell us what the mother's name is and the child does not know. This is the film's only feature. The movie follows a young man who works for a drug company. He is very intelligent and a little bit crazy. One day a woman comes to him asking him to help her and her children who have been kidnapped by a drug dealer. She was a little girl who was sold into sex slavery by her drug dealer father. He also sold her mother. When he was a boy his mother ran away and he went with her to live with his father. It is interesting that he and the mother have a very deep relationship. He helps the woman and the children escape from the drug dealer and he then helps the police find the drug supplier. He then gets a job with the company that was helping the drug dealers. It seems that the movie wants to be a drama and not a horror film. It tries to be something more than it is. I am sure that the film was not made with a great budget and it was not easy to get it made because there was so little to work with. The plot was really interesting and I was interested in watching it because I love horror films. I was really hoping that it would have been more than a drama but it wasn't. It does have a good ending. The actors are good but the movie has too many flaws to be good. I wish it was better. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie but it is not great. I really like the book by Mathesons and it is an interesting novel. It makes me think about the problems in society and why society works the way it does. It really has a lot of ideas about drug dealers and slavery and the way people are made. It has some good ideas but it isn't very good. It doesn't hold up well. I just don't understand how it is that people like the movie so much. It

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man from Earth (2011) is a great sci-fi movie with a lot of action, it has a great screenplay, a strong script, a great cast and a good director. The main character of the movie is a scientist who is trying to figure out a way to make it possible to make a person from scratch in the laboratory and he makes a very good job in the movie.    This movie is about a scientist that wants to create a man in the lab to be the first human. He gets an offer from the CIA and he decides to take the job and take the project to the highest levels. The scientist works hard and makes great progress in the creation of the man and is getting close to being able to do it. He then is visited by his brother who tells him about some weird events happening in the laboratories and that he is not the only person that is being created in the labs.  The story is very interesting and it will make you feel very intrigued. There is a lot to watch for and there are some scenes that will stick with you for days. The movie has an amazing cast and the chemistry between them is great. The action scenes are great. I have seen many sci-fantasy movies and this is one of the best. The director has done a good job with the script. The best part about this movie is the ending. It is a good twist and it makes you think about what is going to happen. The ending was a bit of a let down, but I guess it was meant to be. The Man from earth is a really good movie and I recommend it to everyone. "The Man From Earth is a fantastic sci--fi film with a good story and a great plot. It's a shame the story was a little disappointing and the ending was less than satisfying, but all in all, the film is great."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   The best action movie of this year, and a damn good action movie in general. The whole thing is based on a true story. The film follows a CIA agent named Mitch Rapp (Remy Gosselaar) who is sent to Thailand to infiltrate a criminal gang. The gang, called the Black Lotus, is headed by an ex-CIA agent, who was recruited by a local Thai cop to find a young boy. Rapp eventually finds the boy and learns he's been kidnapped by a group of mercenaries, led by a Chinese man named Tony Choy. Rapp tracks the mercenaries down to a remote location, and after a bloody shootout, they're all arrested. Choy, however, has escaped.  After a short, pointless interrogation scene, Rapp and Choy find a helicopter in the woods, where Choy and Chiyo (Chiang) have already landed. Chiyog is trying to contact his handlers at the CIA, but Choy is in no condition to talk. They decide to take a trip together to find the rest of the Black Lace, and decide to fly together.   There's no way Chiyu could have known he was in the middle of a gang war, as the two movies he was involved in are based on stories that have been proven false. The helicopter's pilots don't know what to do when the chopper crashes into the mountains, and Chinyo is in the same helicopter as Choy when he crashes, and they all survive. Chinya decides to head back to the CIA to report on the gang war while Chiyoy is stuck in Thailand with the mercenaries.  "Hey, you're in Thailand!" says Chiyom.   a movie about an action hero.    While this film does have action, it's not the typical type of action that we've come to expect from Hollywood action movies. It's fast, brutal, and full of intense blood. Chiang does a great job portraying the emotions of a man who has no idea what he's gotten himself into, and the film never takes itself too seriously. It doesn't take itself seriously because it doesn't have to. It takes itself seriously as a movie, and is very funny. "You know what you are?" asks Chinye.    "No, what?"  "A hero."   Chinye says he is.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad by any means, but I never felt that it was overly silly. The acting was okay. I liked that the kids seemed to be more concerned with the monster than themselves. The only thing I didn't like was that they never showed us any of the adults in the movie. We never got to see what they did with the kids after they escaped. I also felt that the ending was a bit rushed. But I guess that's the point. I can't help but laugh at the fact that people are so quick to believe that a monster was behind the murders. The kids were the ones who ran away from the monster. They didn't see anything when they were running. If they had just stood there, then maybe they would have realized that something was wrong. I was really looking forward to seeing what happened to the kids once they got to the cabin. I know that some people will not like the movie because they think that it's too dark, but this is a good time to watch it. It has a good ending and I think that the film could have used a bit more blood. There was a lot of it in this film, but it was very unnecessary. This movie was really scary and it's a great idea for a movie. If you want to see a scary movie, this is the one to watch. If that's all you want, then don't watch it, but if you're a horror lover and you want a good scare, this film is for you. I recommend this movie to all people who like a good scary movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What you're looking at is a very early cut of The Last Samurai, a film which would have been considered a classic by the time it was released in 1948. The film was directed by John Ford and stars Ford as the legendary Gen. Ushijima, the Japanese commander who, in order to prevent a Soviet invasion, has ordered the surrender of his army to the Americans and the British. When the Japanese surrender, they're met by a lone American soldier who is shot down by the Japanese and has to be rescued by the brave Americans. He's later captured by the Germans and, as his life is threatened, he decides to take a life saving gamble by sacrificing his own life to save his comrades. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action films with great character development. If you've seen this film, then you're familiar with the name John Wayne and he's your man. His character, Ushiwaka, is a tough-as-nails character with an interesting history. He was the only Japanese officer to surrender to the Allied forces at the end of WWII. He had been captured by American soldiers as a teenager and was held as a prisoner of war for a year. After his release, he was given a position in a secret U.S. unit which had been created to capture top-level Japanese officers. He went on to become one of the most decorated American soldiers of World War II. The movie also has a good cast of supporting characters. The American characters are well developed and there's a nice balance between the American and Japanese characters. There are also a couple of Japanese soldiers that are really well developed. They all have different motivations for fighting and they do it with a lot of bravery. The story is very well told and the pacing is great. The ending is really great and it's a shame that the Japanese characters were cut from the final version. ____________ If you're into Japanese films then you should check out this one. It's a good old fashioned adventure film with a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "I have always believed that you cannot love a movie if you don't have an opinion about it." – Christopher Nolan  The good:  It's always interesting when the director of a movie gets to tell you how much he loves his movie. In a way, it's the director's way of showing his appreciation of the movie he's working on.  In Christopher Nolan's latest flick, he goes into the movie with a completely fresh perspective. After years of working with big-budget tentpole movies, Nolan was looking to make something more personal, something he could tell his kids about. And this movie, called Inception, is just the movie for him. The reason he chose this movie to make is because of its emotional core. When he got the chance to direct it, Nolan felt he wanted to work on something that he could get his kids to watch. And Inception is the movie that could give them that.  and  After this movie is over, you'll be left with an amazing sense of empathy and a really powerful emotional reaction to the movie. You'll be able to relate to the characters even though they're completely different. I think this movie deserves a lot more credit than it gets because it truly feels like it was made by someone who really cared about it. It was such a great movie, and it really did its job of getting people to pay attention to the story it was telling.  of all the movies he has made, this is the one that he loves the most. : I would love to see Nolan direct a movie that is about a man who is haunted by the memories of a man that he killed. In fact, I would pay money to see that movie. That would be awesome. I've always felt that Nolan's films are always very important to him, and I'm glad to hear that he has a passion for the genre. This movie is an amazing piece of work, and if you love the kind of storytelling that he brings to his movies, you should really give it a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My friends were on vacation and I had the chance to go along with them. We rented the movie The Last King of Scotland. The only problem was that we had no idea what was going on. I have seen all of the movies in the trilogy, but this one is very different. I can see why the third one is not as popular as the second one. The first two films were very good, but the third movie, while not bad, had some major problems. It wasn't that good, and I wish the director had cut some of the scenes that were unnecessary. For example, in the first film, we got a good story of King Harold's struggle with the Scots, but in the third film, the whole plot of the third book of the trilogy gets cut. The last scene with the Scottish was very sad. The scene with King Canute had a scene that was just too long. It was very confusing, and it just made the movie boring. The story with the Irish was also very interesting. Unfortunately, the last two scenes were just as bad. The movie was a great film with great characters, and the acting was great. The music was also great. It had a Celtic feel to it. It helped make the movie great. Overall, I would recommend this movie for those who love history, history, and history.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you like this movie, you may also like _________.  A nice, interesting film that you don't want to miss.  Reviewed by: Robert C. on 06/02/2008 Rating: 5  Review written by: Thomas E. Hickey  "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is a classic romantic comedy with a bit of a twist. Set in the mid-1930's, the story follows a small town that is enjoying a bit more prosperity than it used to. When a wealthy family moves to the area, the town's prosperity quickly disappears, and the townspeople decide to form an all-female detective agency. After all, a few more female detectives will go a long way to improving the reputation of the town. The women soon find out that they are not alone in their quest for justice. In fact, they are joined by a handsome, but mysterious and somewhat deranged stranger.  the great thing about this movie is that the plot and characters don't really make much sense until the end. It is so easy to get lost in the story and the plot is actually quite interesting, especially the mystery of who the killer is. The only reason that I can't give this movie a perfect rating is because the ending is a little too easy. The ending is not a "whoa, wait a minute, what just happened?" ending, it is a "hey, that was cool, I'm going to go see the next movie" ending. The final scene of the movie is so satisfying that it makes the rest of the film all the more interesting. The movie is worth watching even if you don´t get the ending. Overall, "Gentlemens PreferBlondes: A Movie" is worth checking out, especially if you like the old romantic comedy and are looking for something new to watch.

I had never read the book, but I thought it would be a good idea to read it because it was a good book, and it was good to see how the movie was so similar to the book. I thought the ending was very good and was a little sad and I thought I would hate the character of the good shepherd, but in the end, I liked him very much. The film did a good job of showing us the good side of the story and the bad side of things. The movie was entertaining and I loved how it ended. The ending made me sad, but it made me happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If you like this movie, please, don't let me down. It's a very good movie and I enjoyed it very much. I think it has a good cast, very interesting plot, great action, good characters. If it wasn't for some terrible acting by Kevin Spacey, this movie would have been a great one. But as a movie about a group of people that have to deal with the fallout of a secret government experiment, I felt the movie had a few things that would have helped it out. I thought it could have been better with some less obvious exposition and more dialogue. The story was great, and it would have really helped if there had been a little less action and a little more plot. The acting by the characters was great. It was a little bit hard for me to understand some of the slang. Some of the people who are speaking in these lines were a little hard to understand. The movie was also really good in terms of sound. I loved the soundtrack and the music was really well done. I really loved the score. I especially loved the scene in the bar where everyone is watching a movie and you see that the bartender is talking about something and she turns to her friend and says, "What is he saying?" I think that's a really cool scene to have. The film also has some great action sequences. The whole movie was very well done and I was very entertained. Overall, this is a good thriller. It has good acting and good characters and the action was great and well paced. It doesn't get the recognition it deserves.

My favorite character in the film was "The King". I think he was the most "evil" character. His motives were pretty good but I was hoping he would have been better when he was talking to the young girl who was helping him in the beginning of the film. I hope his character is going to be better when the film is made.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ ___________. _________ ____________. ____ _____________. _____.  A great movie with a strong story, and a great performance by Robert Redford. Great music and great special effects. Highly recommended.   I was very sad to see this movie die. The actors and the direction were great, but it was the music that made this movie so unique. This movie has it all. The soundtrack was great. A bit of a slow start to the movie but that was understandable. I thought it was great that they never had a sequel to this movie, because I am sure it would have been just as great. It's not a very long movie but it is a great movie and it's great that it came out at the right time. The movie is set in the early 70s in the desert, and it is the perfect film for a movie night with friends. I have to give a special thanks to Paul Thomas Anderson, the director. The music, the acting, the direction, and the story is just all perfect. If you are a fan of this movie and want to see it again, then this is the film for you.   a great story with a great ending, and great performances. I recommend this movie to all lovers of the movie, especially those who love movies with a good story. This is a must see movie.   the movie is about a desert that is filled with all kinds of strange creatures. One of the creatures is a small boy who is lost in the wilderness. He has no idea how to get back to his house. As he tries to find a way out he gets in contact with a strange old man who is looking for something he lost long ago. The old man tells the boy that he needs to go to a place in the west that has an old temple and a temple keeper. The boy then leaves the temple and finds a man named "Redford" who is the keeper. They both travel together to the temple. They arrive at the temple, but Redford is not at the entrance. He goes inside and tells the keeper that the boy needs help. The keeper tells Redford that the temple is not there anymore, but that a man is inside who is trying to get out. The man asks for a priest to open a gate, and Redford then tells the priest to bring the boy to the entrance and that they will meet at the center. The priest brings the boy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" was a big success for Sergio Leone. This is the only Western he ever directed, but it's a masterpiece in its own right. Leone's vision of an epic journey through the Old West has been repeated so many times, but this time the epic has been filmed in a way that makes it a film that will remain timeless. The film is very simple in its approach, but the characters and plot are all very well-done. The acting is also excellent, with an impressive cast of actors. The most famous actor of the film is Sergio Leone himself. This was his first film, and it's one of his best. The story is told from the perspective of the main character, The Good, played by John Wayne. The movie follows the life of this outlaw as he journeys through the western territories and tries to earn his living as a lawman. The Good is very sympathetic. He doesn't have a lot of morals, but he doesn't lie either. He's not a very good man, but as he goes on his journey, he tries to do the right thing. The action is very intense, and there is a lot to be said for the way Leone choreographs his action sequences. The gunfights are also quite intense, which are shot with great attention to detail. The Western action scenes are very well done, and one of the things that make the film so popular is its fantastic sound design. The music of Sergio Leone is a big part of the Western theme, and The Good has some very memorable music. There is a great scene in the movie where the protagonist and his partner are running across the plains and they are covered in blood. It's an incredible sound that will never get old. The soundtrack to The Good really stands out, and I highly recommend the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Trek Into Darkness" is a fantastic movie that has a very good plot and a great cast of characters. The only negative point I have to say about this movie is the way that it starts off. It's a bit abrupt, but then it goes back to the usual "Star Trek" formula of making the Enterprise crew go on an epic mission and then having them go back to Earth and deal with their own problems. This movie doesn't have any of that and instead of starting off in space, the movie goes to Earth in order to make a bigger point about what happened to the Earth after the events of the original series.  I love that it takes that route because it does a great job of reminding you that the events in this movie are not from the original show.  This is the bridge from Star Trek Into   Darkness "Star Wars" fans will be very pleased to hear that they get to see the classic "Star Wars: A New Hope" opening sequence in this new movie.   The film starts off in a typical "Star wars" style and is full of all the classic elements from the movies.  One of the most interesting parts of this movie was the inclusion of the "Dark Side" of the Force.  This was an interesting addition because we haven't really seen the Force use in the movies in quite a while.  The main villains in this film are the Dark Side characters from the first two "Starwars" movies. The first movie featured Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi. The third movie featured the Emperor, Count Dooku and Jango Fett.  They all played an important role in these movies and it's nice to see them all back in action in the "Star WARS" franchise.  After watching this film I can't help but wonder how different the story would have been if they had left Obi Wan and Anakin on Tatooine.  What a fun ride that would have had been!  One thing that I really liked about this film was how the "Trek" characters were in a better light than they were in the first "Star trek" movie. Even when they were on Earth they still acted like real "Star war" characters and not like cartoon characters.  When the ship they were all in was being boarded by the Klingons it wasn't just "StarWars" jokes that were being said.  Some of the Klingon dialogue actually made me

The movie was about a couple, a man and a woman, who have a daughter, who is the center of their world. It was about their daughter, but also about the father's and mother's relationship. I think the best thing about the movie is that the father and mother were very well-realized. I really think they are a perfect couple. I never felt that they were acting. They were very real, and I loved the way they talked to each other.  I think that the movie could have been better. It did not have that much of a sense of humor, and there were many scenes that just felt awkward. I did not get why the man was going to a party, and why he was going alone. I am sure that the people at the party would have been nice to the man, but I think that it would have just been awkward, and it would not have been as funny. The husband was a good actor, but the wife did not make the movie. I was never impressed with the way she was portrayed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The movie I saw last night, "Rescue Dawn", had a great ending. A nice, long, epic and gripping story. It was a bit of a "coming of age" tale and I think the ending was perfect. It's not a great movie but it is an effective movie. I was hooked right from the first scene when I heard a gunshot. The story had me gripped. I thought I was going to be killed in a bad way, but luckily, I was not. I am not a big action movie fan and this was a good one. It took me a few hours to get into it, but the good outweighed the bad. The soundtrack was great. It really gave the movie a sense of atmosphere. This movie was rated R. So, I recommend this movie to those who are "in the mood" and have a great time watching it. It is a must see. I would recommend it to a big movie fan. The ending was a great way to wrap it up. **********
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wicker Man" is a masterpiece and an unforgettable film. It is a horror film that will scare the hell out of you. The Wicker man is a creature that inhabits a house and eats people and other creatures who come there. I watched this film for the first time with the old video on VHS and it gave me goosebumps. The film was very scary and the effects and special effects are very impressive. It was made for a very small budget and it has a great atmosphere that is very creepy. The only downside is the characters. The main character is a man named William (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his sister Rose (Faye Dunaway) who is his caretaker. The movie is about William who is trying to find the creature and stop it from eating people. Rose is a bit of a bitch who does not care about William and tries to take care of him by keeping him from the creature. William does get along with his sister and he even tries to help her out when she is in trouble. The cast did a very good job of portraying the characters and they do a good job at making you think about the characters, the story, and the movie. The effects were great and the creature was really frightening. This movie is a must see for horror fans. #8  Logan's Run (1976) A lot of people don't like this movie. It's because it's about a man who becomes a robot and has to make his way through the world. It has been criticized for being cheesy, cheesy, and cheesy. I say it's good because it has great action scenes, interesting characters, and an excellent soundtrack. This is the movie that inspired the movie Logan's Run. In the movie we see a young boy named John Connor (Harrison Ford) who goes on a run to rescue his sister, Elizabeth (Lauren Bacall). The movie was directed by William Peter Blatty (The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Quiet Man, and The Exterminating Angel). It has a pretty good cast with Harrison Ford and Anthony Perkins. Logan is a really cool character and he's got a lot of depth to him. It doesn't really matter what he does in the movie as long as he's there. Logan goes through some serious stuff and he ends up saving Elizabeth. This was one of the first science fiction movies and it is pretty amazing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (1994) is an excellent adaptation of a classic novel, and it deserves a place on any list of the greatest horror films ever made.  The story of the Scoundrell family is classic horror, in that the family, including the children, are cursed by a witch and forced to live in a world of horror.    The film follows the story of a young boy named Sam, who is the only one who can break the curse, and is haunted by a strange boy.  He is also a member of the family who is cursed by the witch, but unlike the boy, he is not possessed by the ghost of a woman who has been killed by a rat.  The Scoundrella family, led by Sam, lives in a house in the woods, which has a front door that leads to a cave.  There is a secret entrance to the cave, which is a room with a stone wall.  This room has a secret door that is used by the old woman.  She is a witch who used to live at the house.  When Sam goes to the house to investigate, he finds the family members dead, and there is a mysterious figure haunting the house, who has killed and eaten most of the members of the household.  In the film, the witch's presence is a combination of a cat with a snake and a witch with a machete.  It is possible to hear the voice of the witch as she speaks in a female voice, but it is not clear if the voice is female or male.  Once Sam finds the room with the stone wall, he can see the figure in the stone room.  His only option is to escape by entering the secret cave, and that he does in a way that is both daring and clever.  "Dirty" Rotten is a wonderful film that will stay with you for a long time.  I was very excited to see a film about a cursed family, and I was also thrilled to see it in a classic form.  After seeing the film multiple times, I have decided that it is the perfect horror film.  Even if you have not seen it, I highly recommend it!

The Purge is a film in which the populace must fight back against an organized, brutal and mysterious group of people known as the Purge. These Purge are determined to rid the United States of all the "undesirables" and anyone who is deemed a threat to the peace of the land. The film is also inspired by the movie "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", which also was based on a popular book series.  In this film, there are many people who are chosen to participate in the Purges. The people who participate in these Purges are forced to take a Purge card, a small silver key that opens a door to the Purger Room where they are tortured and tortured by the Purgers. The characters of the film are also a reflection of those who are willing to participate. The main character, Claire (Jenny Lumet), is an office worker who is forced to participate as a Purger. Claire is married to a man named David (Bruno Ganz) and the two have two children, Charlie (Brett Gelman) and Emma (Dani Shay). She also has a young daughter, Maddy (Megan Gailey). Claire works as a receptionist and lives in a nice house with her husband and children. When the Purging begins, the house is broken into and Maddy is taken into the Purgings. Claire and David try to get Maddy back but they are unsuccessful. When she is forced into a Purging, she escapes into a nearby woods. David and Claire try to find Maddy, but they run into several obstacles. After a brief fight, they are forced into another Purging
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Last Temptation of Christ " (2009)  (Theatrical)  " (2009)" (2009), directed by Roman Polanski  is a disturbing and intense thriller that has some interesting moments.  There is an element of violence in this movie, but it is not gratuitous.  The story starts in a prison camp.   We meet a very young Prisoner (Ethan Hawke)   who is being trained to be a Buddhist Monk.  He is the only one of his age in the camp. The first scene takes place in a Pentagon-like building, where we see a few prisoners playing football in the courtyard.  This is the first of several prison-based movies by Roman.  It is interesting to note that in this one, a number of scenes have been edited together.  We see an execution in which a man is executed on the spot.  The executioner uses a small axe to kill the prisoner.  Then, the executioner removes the rope from the prisoner's neck.  After the execution, the rope is tied around the man's body.  As the executioners are removing the rope, the prisoners run off in terror.  At this point, a young girl (played by Isabelle Adjani) is walking through the courtyard, looking for a friend of her friend.  She comes across a man (played in this film by John Malkovich) who is dressed in an orange jumpsuit.  While walking towards him, he has a pistol in his hand.    She says to him "You are the devil, you are the Devil, you're going to kill me".  The man, with his eyes fixed on her, responds "You're very beautiful, aren't you?   After a brief exchange, the man takes his gun and shoots her in the head.  Next, the prisoner and the girl are led out of the courtyard and are sent into the woods.  They come across a group of soldiers and they ask them to take the prisoner back to the prison.  One of the soldiers tells the prisoners "You will be treated as prisoners of war".  In this movie we get some interesting interactions between the soldiers and the prisoners.  Here we get to see some interesting violence in action.  In one scene we see the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dude, it's a movie!"  If you're a fan of the film then you'll love this movie.  It's an intense, intense, movie, with a great soundtrack.    If you have not seen the film, then you're missing out.  "Beverly Hills Cop" is a great movie with a very good story and characters.  The acting is great.  I was in the theater during the scene with John Travolta where he said that "Bobby De Niro" (as he was known at the time) "has a nice butt".  I saw this film a long time ago and it's still one of my favorite movies of all time.  If I had a dollar for every time I hear "bob" or "boo" I'd be a rich man.  This movie is hilarious.  It's also a great "comedic" movie, especially for those who aren't used to seeing a movie like this.  There's lots of laughs throughout this movie, from the opening scene to the end.  My favorite part is when John T.   walks in the apartment and the door closes.  John T. walks in and says "What the hell are you doing here?"  The first line was a classic line from the film.  When Travolos says that he "doesn't give a f*ck" he's right, and John T   walks out the door, and walks away.  Also, the scene where John T is in the shower is great, when the hot water hits him he says "I'm gonna take a shower, I don't give f*cks"  The soundtrack is awesome and the film is worth seeing.  Enjoy

It's just about two guys. One is a criminal and the other is a lawyer. One of them kills the other and is tried for it. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Manchurian Candidate (1962) ------------ This movie has many great scenes, but I think the best is in the prison scene where the guy is playing cards and the guards are playing poker. He's got a knife in his hand and he's about to stab one of the guards. He gets a hold of a gun and shoots the guard. __________________________________________________________  The Monster Squad (1963) -------------- A movie about the Monster Squad, an alien team of spies sent to kidnap the President of the United States and kidnap the children of the world. This is a classic spy movie. I loved this movie. -------------------------- The Monster from Outer Space (1963)-- This movie is so weird and so out of place. It doesn't even make any sense. The movie has a great soundtrack and I loved the monsters in this movie and the flying cars. --------------- The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street (1964) ------------- I thought the movie was okay. I think it's kind of like the old Dr. Strangelove. The story is just ridiculous. -------------- The Mutilator (1966)-- This is about a man who gets into a car accident and is put in a hospital. A doctor comes in and tries to cut off his penis and he kills him. This movie makes you think, but this movie is just a stupid movie. This guy gets killed for no reason. ------------ The Monster in the White House (1968) --------------- This is an old horror movie, so it's a little bit hard to watch, but the movie has some good scenes. ------------- The Monster of Florence (1970) ------------------ This is kind of a remake of a movie called The Monster (1972) and the director didn't use the same actors. The only thing I didn't like about this movie, was the fact that it was made in the 70s. _____________________________ I think that's all of them. *****************************

After years of delays, a new adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest is finally getting made, in a collaboration between screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and producer Scott Rudin. The first film in a planned trilogy that will be published over the course of several decades, it has the potential to be one of the most influential films of all time.  In terms of the film itself, it is both a continuation of the classic story of Prospero (Javier Bardem), the master of deception and of deception, as well as a new version that focuses on the troubled relationship between Prospero and Miranda (Eva Green).  The plot follows Prospero, the Prince of the island of La Mancha, who has lost his powers after the death of his sister, and is now living with the Moorish leader Caliban. In a bid to regain his powers, he attempts to marry Miranda, the daughter of a Moorish ambassador, and has a falling out with her father, who wants her to remain in the service of La Tranquillità, an alliance of kingdoms that are opposed to La Manchada. The plot is as old as the story, but it is updated to the modern day, with Prospero as a man of the 21st century who still maintains a fascination with deception. .  is the film is the first part of a planned three-film trilogy that GoldsMAN is currently developing with Scott Rudenin. It is expected to be published in three volumes, each one covering a decade. The two books, The Tempest and The Conspiracy, are expected to contain the bulk of the new material, while the third, Tempest, will deal with the aftermath of Prosper's exile and the eventual reconciliation between Prosper and Miranda.  The original version of the story was written by William Shakespeare in the late 1600s, but Shakespeare's work was not included in the initial productions of his plays until a few years after the play's death. I had been trying to get my hands on the original version for years, and finally managed to track down the script and read it back in 2011, before it was even in production.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ What a great movie. The story is not the best but it is very enjoyable. There is some action and some action. The actors do their job well. The movie has a very nice ending. The only thing that could have been better is the end when they are running from the people they are shooting. I guess this movie was made to be a big hit. It is a good one and I recommend you to watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Man Holiday" has a great premise, but fails to live up to the hype.  This is a comedy, after all, so we are meant to laugh.  The main character, Mr. T, has had a rough year, so he is looking for a change of pace and a change in scenery.  He meets a girl who seems nice enough and takes him to a fancy restaurant, where he tries to impress her with his wit.   She turns out to be a stalker, and she uses her wiles to seduce him, but T is a man who takes life as it comes, and refuses to be taken advantage of.  So we have the main character and his girlfriend in a dinner date.  But what do you expect?  We're in a comedy.  And I don't mean that this is a light comedy, like many comedies, but it is a serious comedy that has a good plot.  The problem is that it has no emotional connection.  It's not just that they are friends.  They've known each other since they were kids.  T loves her, and her love for him is genuine.  There is a scene where he gives her a ring that he bought her when she was just out of high school.  She is upset that he did this.  This is a real emotional connection, but the scene doesn't work because the script just doesn't make it.  I've seen other comedy movies that are about people who are close friends, and they always have an emotional connection that gives them real emotion.  What the movie fails to do is to make the relationship feel real.  In fact, I found myself laughing at the end of the movie when he goes to her place to make his excuses for not going out with her.  Maybe it was because I was expecting some real emotional story, but I really wanted to hear how she was feeling, and I wanted to see her reactions to his actions.  Why couldn't the movie have used the dinner date to show a real connection?  In the end, "The Best Boy Holiday" is a good joke that has some funny parts, but doesn't have the real emotional connective tissue that other comedies have.  However, the movie is fun and entertaining.

I liked it and thought it was a good idea. I think it was pretty good. I enjoyed it a lot and the plot was interesting. I would watch it again, maybe I would like it better if it had more of a plot, but I think the movie is good. It is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and I was very impressed with how it looks. I am not going to lie, this movie is not perfect, but for the price it is a great movie. I don't think there is any bad parts of this movie. There is a lot of action and I am glad they went with a lot more blood and violence, because it was needed. This movie is like an action movie for old school audiences, where the action is fast and the gore is real. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. I will definitely be going to see this movie in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  This was my first movie and I loved it! I really liked the way they handled the storyline and the romance. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good rom-com!  ______________________________________________  I don't normally review movies, but this movie is so much better than the one in the theater. I watched it in the theaters and thought it was very poor, but I thought I'd check it out on DVD. It's so much more exciting, well-acted and has some great acting. I have never seen such an intense romance. It was really well-written. I've never seen a movie with so much action and it was really exciting. I loved the way the main characters acted in the movie and the characters were so likable. It seemed like it was a real good movie and it is worth watching.  (review from December 2011)  My daughter is a bit of a movie buff and we had seen a few movies together. I saw this one at a midnight show and I was really surprised by the story line. I love the chemistry between the characters. I hope she gets a chance to see it again.  in the spirit of "the time" when my daughter saw this, I want to thank my daughter for not only seeing this movie at a time when it would be appropriate for her, but for seeing it at a show where there were hundreds of other people there to see this movie, and many more people to see other movies. Thank you for being a movie-loving fan.  and I hope that I was able to convey the magic of this movie to my daughter. I think she was pretty surprised by this movie as well.

I think I enjoyed the story, which is about a group of friends who become best friends after a tragic event. - The story has some flaws but it was good enough.  the cast did a great job. I like the character of the lead and the others were good as well.  a good film.   - the music is good but not great.  as others have said the movie is a little long but I think the characters should have had a bit more time to develop.   I hope there is a sequel.   the best part about this movie was the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  "The Shining" is one of those films which make you think about life and death and even if you think they're made for each other, you never know.  The Shining is a good horror film and an underrated classic. I know people say it's a classic but I don't see it that way. It's a good film with great performances, a great script, and good direction.  of course the Shining was a good story, and the story is a great one. The Shining is just the right mix of psychological horror and fantasy. . , but the best part is that it has a wonderful atmosphere. Kubrick was very good at using sound and music to build up suspense. I love the film and am glad I saw it. It made me think about a lot of things. The film was written by Stephen King. Kubrick wrote a book based on it which I think is a really great book. He didn't direct the film but he was the director. - March 17, 2004Best Film Of All Time  Reviewer: kristian_s. - favorite favorite favorite - January 21, 2004  Subject: Not bad but not great This film is not terrible but not the best.   The performances are fine, and Kubrick has a good sense of humour but his direction is a bit clumsy. The actors have no problem with the script, which is good.  .  and not for everyone, as the ending is not what you expect and the ending could be improved. - January 14, 2004Not bad but very little  ___________________________________________  If you like the movie you can check out a version of the film for sale on amazon, if you want to watch it. - December 22, 2003Not for everyone

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I enjoyed it. I liked the movie because it was good. I had fun watching it. But i am a little bit disappointed in this movie. First of all the characters are all lame. I mean all the girls were so bad. They were really annoying and annoying. I also don't like the guy. He was a little boring. He didn't really have much of a personality. But still the movie is good. This movie has a lot of action and i liked it because it's a movie that is all about action. The movie had a lot good and bad parts. But it had a good ending. The only bad part about the movie was that the ending was really stupid. But at least it ended in a good way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Outdoors" (2001) - The film is a love story between a couple of mountain bikers.  It is about a relationship between two people who are in love and do everything together. Â The main character is the best character in this film and this movie is perfect.    It is a good film because it shows how a couple can change the world for each other and live in harmony with each other.   The movie is funny and has some heart and good acting by most of the cast.  My review of "The Great Outdoor" is:  Movie is good, but the plot is very predictable.  There is a lot of action in this movie but it doesn't make sense.  Some parts of the movie are very slow but it is not so slow that the plot becomes confusing.  Also the ending of the film was a bit too sudden for me.  I think this movie will make people laugh a lot but I would not recommend this movie to those who want to watch a movie that is not too serious.  This movie is a must watch for those who love biking and mountain biking.  My Rating:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We Live in Public" "We live in public" is a fantastic film, and a must see for all who appreciate the art of cinema.  The cast is absolutely incredible.  We are given a great insight into what life is like for a black male in the 1950's in the south, and also a peek into the lives of a few white neighbors.  As one character tells another, "It's all right to live on the edge, but you must know how to live close to the edge."  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves the great art of Hollywood, or for anyone interested in the art and craft of the screen.  There is some great film noir going on here, and there is no doubt that it would have been a very interesting film to make.  I will certainly be looking out for a film that can capture that feel in the years to come.

Overall, it was a good adventure movie, but not a great one, because it lacked the emotional value that the best of the genre has. It was a great movie with great actors, and an interesting story, but this movie did not live up to its great potential.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie a lot, it was a good horror movie with good gore. It was not the best of the horror movies, but it was good. A movie with no plot and some great effects, that I can only imagine the director had some sort of inspiration from. The movie was interesting to watch, as there were not much details in the movie. Some scenes, like the one with the girl were a bit hard to watch because the girl's voice was just a bit too high and it made it hard to understand what she was saying. Overall, the movie was a great one to watch and I am looking forward to see what other films they will make in the future. It is hard to describe this movie in one word because I could not put a good description on it, it is hard for me to describe it. This movie is really a great movie, I can see how the director and the actors were influenced by the works of the great director David Lynch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ This is a film that takes the time to really examine the effects of war on the people who have to fight it. It is a wonderful film. It takes you into the mind of a man who has just lost his wife and daughter. He finds himself in a war-torn country. The film shows the struggle of a soldier, trying to survive. The people he meets along the way help him on his way. The war is hard on him, but at the same time, it is the only way he knows. He doesn't have any weapons or any armor. He only has his wits and a few things he carries with him. The soldiers he meets in the war are not the bad guys. They just have their own reasons for being there. We see how war is really hard on the soldiers, and how they deal with it. The main story of this film is a love story between a soldier and a woman. I thought this film was very well-written. It really shows the love that the people have for each other. The acting in this film really shines. It shows the beauty of the people and the things they have to endure. The writing is a real pleasure to read. I really enjoyed this film. I loved all of the characters and the way they are written. I even really enjoyed the romance. This film was a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of this movie is the real story of how the two men ended up together and became friends.  I found it interesting that the two had no connection at all, just one of them being a jerk and the other a nice guy.   This is very typical of romance films.  The real story is how the guy who has a good reputation, is trying to build up a career as a lawyer, while the guy with a bad reputation, wants to avoid getting a bad job.  This story is really interesting because they are trying to make their own lives and get out of the rat race.  They try to avoid being seen as a jerk by making a few good decisions and then going back to their old ways.  The story was interesting because the characters weren't that interesting.  There was one or two of them that I liked, but most of them were just there to give their opinion.  After the guy is able to save a woman and save himself, he decides to move to the city to pursue his career.  He starts a new life and tries to be a better person and is slowly falling in love.  What was very interesting to me is that this movie doesn't show that the woman was with a guy at the beginning of the movie.  So she might have gotten pregnant or something.  But there is no relationship at all between the two and their lives are very similar.  Even the two friends, who are trying so hard to be better, end up getting in over their heads.  I think that this is what is meant to happen in a love story, that people start out being good and then get distracted and try to make the other person better.  It is a very interesting movie, but not the best film of the year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Play Video  Mute Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0 min Mute 00:00  Description  The Last Samurai (1954) is a film that is more about Japanese history and culture than about war and the killing of thousands of innocent people. The film tells the story of the battle between the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Chinese Army in China in 1936. The battle started when the Japanese army attacked a small Chinese village that was occupied by the Chinese army. The village was so close to the Japanese troops that the Japanese soldiers could not return to the village quickly and retreated. The Chinese army attacked the village again and again, but were unable to break into the village because the Japanese would not allow them to do so. The last two times the Chinese soldiers attacked, the Japanese reinforcements arrived to save the day. As a result, the Chinese Army was defeated. The Japanese had successfully won the war and were able to make it to Japan. The main character, Takashi Shimura, is a Japanese soldier who is captured by the Japanese and is taken to China. The movie is narrated by a young man named Takashi, who was in the first Japanese army to enter China, and he is an older man named Masaaki who is in the second Japanese army. It is also narrated by Takashi's father who died when he was young. The story of The Last Japanese is a very important part of Japanese history. The Last Chinese War is a similar story to the one of The Battle of China, but instead of the Japanese Army, the story is about the Chinese Nationalist Army. The only difference is that the Chinese Communist Party is not the aggressor in the movie. The Movie:  Play Video 0:53 The Last Movie is a true story about a battle between Japanese and Chinese soldiers in China. It takes place in the mid-1930s in China, which was the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Battle began when the Chinese government sent the Japanese Imperial Army to suppress the Chinese nationalists. The soldiers from the Imperial Army had no idea that the people of China wanted peace. They started to fight the Chinese people who wanted to stay as a united country. This film is a must-see film for every war fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. __________. ___________________.  1/5 stars because the film was a bit of a mess. The acting was decent but the movie had some problems and I was not a fan of the script. It had some cool moments like a fight scene between the kids and a vampire and I loved the ending, but other than that the movie was very average. The movie had a great theme of revenge but I thought the movie should have ended a little bit sooner. The only reason I gave it a 1 star is because it was a great time in my life. So, here's what I thought of the movie: The kids are the bad guys, they were just bad at planning the revenge and they were stupid in the ending. There was a really cool fight scene that had all of us screaming at the screen. The soundtrack was great. The ending was awesome, I was really excited to see how the story would go and how it was going to end. It was very hard to stay in the theater during the end scene, it was very exciting to see what would happen to these kids. I loved how the vampire was such a badass. The vampire was so cool and had a cool voice. The voice actor was really good, it really added to the movie. I thought it was an excellent movie, definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________   "This is a really great movie."  —John Green  "I've never seen this movie before and I liked it so much I had to see it again."  and "This movie is a masterpiece."   I'm just gonna say it: this movie is the definition of a classic. It's really not even the best movie of the year, and if you haven't seen it by now it's too late for you, but it's still an incredible film. The only thing that holds it back from being a masterpiece is that it's not exactly perfect. I think the film could have been better if it had been shot on film. There are some really beautiful shots in it that are missing in the digital version, and I think if it were on film, I would have liked it a lot more. But, that's just me. I like everything about this movie. It feels real. It seems like the characters are real. And the story is so good. I love that this movie was made in the early 70s, before the advent of the computer, and it was made on location in England. I loved that the film's director was an artist and had this wonderful way of expressing emotion. It also feels like a real movie. The acting is great, and the music is good.  The only thing is that there is a lot of editing going on in the film, and at times, it gets a little confusing. It was like a dream I was having. There is a scene in the middle where the film takes a turn for the worse and you have to sit and watch as the camera pans up and down. But it's worth it. The ending is fantastic, and really makes you feel for these people. And, in case you didn't notice, there is some nudity in this film. It doesn't take away from the film. I'm really glad I saw it again, and that I have a copy of it on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has so much going on, it's amazing, but I wish there was more to it.  It's a good film, but it doesn't go anywhere.   I can see why it is one of the biggest films in Japan at the moment, as there is so much to love about it, but the film is a bit of a mess at the end.  The plot is excellent, but there is just so much more to the film than there is to make it great.    I can see that this was made as a commercial for a toy line, so it has a lot of action, but that is all it is really good at.  This movie is great for the children, but not for anyone else.

I have gone on a lot of dates with my girlfriends because I never wanted to get married. It was the first time I saw what true love looked like. I was able to see that someone doesn't need a man to be happy. The only thing that I wish is that there was more sex in the movie. That would have made it better. It just doesn't have enough sex in it to make me fall in love with this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly (1966) The Good:   Robert Mitchum is terrific as Colonel John Henry "Handsome" Hand.  He looks the part of a man who's just come off a long tour of duty in Africa and is ready to get back to the States.  The Bad:   The story is about two men (Henry Fonda and Gene Hackman) who are sent to a prison in Louisiana to work on a murder case.   Ugly:    The film's title character (Hackman) is not a good guy, but a man that wants to prove his manhood.  This was the film that made Hackman into a star, and his performance is a great one.  Hackman has a strong presence, and he's always very angry, even when he's not playing the bad guy.  He has a lot of the right intentions, but he also has a tendency to get his nose into other people's business.  It's clear that the film was made for the sake of making a big, splashy movie.  The story does not take itself too seriously, and it's definitely a good time at the movies.  One of my favorite films of all time, and one of my top ten.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl on the Train  (2014). A film I have seen several times and loved each time. The story of a train that comes to a stop in the middle of nowhere has become a favorite of mine. It is the perfect film to watch when you need to think about something and feel like you are in a good mood.  I was surprised when the film got such a good reception from critics. I was hoping for a great rating from the critics. The film did have a few issues that could have been solved but were not. One of them was the fact that the film did not have enough time to explain the plot. One minute the characters are talking about the train. The next minute the train is gone. I have been through this before in a few films and the time is never really explained. This was the biggest problem of this film. If the plot was given more time to unfold, I think it would have been a better film. One last thing that bothered me was the use of the sound track. I loved the song that was played while the train was stopped. The song was played in the background and when the train started to move again, the music was played again. This could have made the film better but it did not make it a better movie. The acting was good but the dialogue could have had a better performance from the actors. I liked the film. It was fun and exciting and a good film to make you think. If you are looking for a good, entertaining movie that will make you feel good about yourself and make you want to watch it again and again, then this is the film for you. The Girl on The Train  1/5

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (1/5) The movie is a bad movie. It has a bad soundtrack, bad acting and a bad story. The actors did not have a great time. I think that a better director than Paul McGuigan should have made this movie. I thought the movie was a comedy and not a serious movie. And the plot is not very clear. There are some scenes that I do not understand. And I also found the music very annoying. It was very boring and annoying. The only good thing is that the acting was great and they did not make a fool of the cast. There was a good amount of humor in the movie. But this movie is not worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Rocketeer is a fine action film, but it doesn't have the impact it has on me when I hear the title of the film. It's a good story that's told in a very straightforward way and the film has a good cast of characters. The Rocketeers is a story about a group of pilots and their mission to go to the Moon and back. The main character of the movie is a man named Rocketeerr, who is a genius pilot. He's also a pretty funny character. The film is pretty well paced. It shows the excitement of going to the moon and back, but never gives you the sense that you are getting bored with it.  There are a lot of scenes in this movie where the characters are flying through the sky and the camera really shows the beauty of space.  The Rocketer's life is pretty simple. He works in a small company called "Lunar Dynamics" and he works with his son. He wants to get his son into a good college so he can help him become a better pilot. The problem is that his son is a very sensitive and sensitive boy. His father thinks that his job as a pilot is to make Rocketeeerr feel as comfortable as possible in space. The son has a lot to learn. The father's idea of how to help Rocketeerm is to send him to an orphanage and make him learn how to behave like a real person.  This is a good film, and it is worth seeing. The movie is good and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good action films. I would also recommend this to any parents who would want to show their kids how to be a pilot and to show them how to make a good first impression. * * * * Out of the box, I wasn't sure if The Rocketer would work as a film. I thought it would be boring and forgettable. I was wrong. This is the best movie that I have seen in a long time. The story is great. The characters are great. It is well paced and has a solid plot. It has some good special effects, and has the feel of a classic. The acting is all great. I will admit that I loved the main character RocketeER, but I also loved the movie.  The Rocker's life might not be as interesting as the movie would make it out to be. The script is a bit simple and there are some very

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ My boyfriend and I went to see this movie at my sister's house. We got there early to get good seats. We were seated in the front row. We saw a lot of people at the theater watching it. There were a lot more people there than the theater usually had. We had a great time. The movie was really funny and well done. I think the movie is a little long, but if you want to watch a comedy, this is a good one. The plot is very simple. There are three characters, two of them are college kids and the third is a rich kid. The three are trying to get a date. The two rich kids get in a fight and then they fight each other and then their date breaks up. The next day the rich kid wants revenge. They decide to kill their friend. The poor guy comes home and finds the two dead bodies. The first scene is great. It shows you the three characters and the scene of them having the fight. It is funny. The other two scenes are really lame. The last scene is pretty good. It starts with the poor guy and his mom. They talk about how they have been on a long journey. They both talk about their family and how they are different. The mom talks about how she is just like the rich kids. The dad talks about his family and he is just as bad as the rich guys. The guy is really boring, so the movie does not work out. I did not really like the movie. The story is very basic. The jokes are not that good. The characters are not very interesting. I am not a huge fan of the movie, but I enjoyed it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by tonya from I have seen it a few times and loved it! It was a great movie.  the cast was amazing and had such great chemistry  the movie was good but a little too long for my taste  I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was a good idea to do a movie like this  and I would have loved to have seen more of the characters  it is a very well done movie

The actors are so damn good. In this case, all of the actors are good. We have to give it to the director, too. The picture looks great. The music is great. I thought the ending was a little abrupt but that could have been because the film had so much going on. If you like good films, you will enjoy this one. It's a great way to end the year.

I am not a big fan of movies like this. They usually do a very bad job with their characters and they end up making me think of a different movie. I can say that this movie was very good and very enjoyable. There are no bad characters in this movie. The movie shows you the real side of some people. It shows you what happens when you are in a relationship. There is a lot of drama in this film and the movie does a good job of showing it all. I think the movie is better if you like the movie "The Graduate". I don't know why but this movie seemed a little more realistic to me. This movie was made in the 60s so it shows a little bit more of life back then. I really enjoyed this movie and it made me laugh a lot. It was great seeing this movie in a theater. The soundtrack was great. It reminded me of the movie when I was younger. I liked the movie very much. The best part of this movie is when they talk about the sex scene. The sex scene was really hot and the characters really portrayed it. This was a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ This is one of those films that have made me smile from the very first time I saw it. I had no idea what was going to happen, but when the camera pans to the side of the train and we see the two guys standing in the station, I thought "they're going to rob this train!" The guy next to them starts to run for the train, but then a car pulls up behind them. The guy in the car gets out and the driver pulls the trigger. I guess they are a bit more familiar with each other than I thought. I've seen some great gangster movies, but this one had some great characters and a great story. This film is not just a gangster film, but a movie that you have to see for the first time, it's a great movie. The actors are great, and you see their emotions, and even their faces. The music is great too. It's a perfect film.

It was the first I ever saw of the Dillinger Gang and the first gangster movie I ever watched. This was a fun film, although a bit predictable. I enjoyed watching it and remember a lot of fun people that were on screen. It still stands up. - June 7, 2005A Good Time  Rated: 4 out from 11/16/85 This is a pretty good movie, but the film doesn't have a great ending. - May 2, 200511/16 and the movie ends with a bunch of people hanging from the bridge, I was hoping that would be the end, but it's not. It ends with one guy hanging off of a rope and then two more guys hang off of the bridge. I would think that would do it, but that's not the end. There is a shot of a guy with a knife going up a street, then the camera zooms out, and we have this guy on the ground in the middle of a gang of guys, and they are talking about something and I assume they are going to hang him. The film then cuts back and forth and a few guys come and drag him into the street and we are told that this is the end and we get to watch the guy die.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ "The world will be a better place tomorrow" (from the song by Simon and Garfunkel)  1) There are no bad movies - and no good ones either.  2) Movies have to be seen to be believed.  it's like saying "The Bible was the greatest book ever written". The Bible is the greatest movie ever written. It's the only movie that doesn't exist.  The Bible was a book that wasn't written. The only way to have a movie about the Bible was to have people in ancient Rome who lived at the time of Jesus Christ. When they found Jesus they found the first Christians. So Jesus was in Rome when the movie was made. In other words it's not a true story. It was written by men who were in Rome at the right time. So, yes, it is true that Jesus Christ died for your sins and was resurrected from the dead. It isn't the greatest story ever told. But, it was written.  the best movie about a great man is: "THE MARTIAN" by Ridley Scott - about a man who can survive on a space ship and how he made it so he could save his home planet from a terrible plague. The man is called Hugh Jackman and he was born in Toronto, Canada. The movie was written in Toronto by screenwriter Eric Roth, and director Ridley Scott, who was born there. So the movie is about Hugh Jackmen, and the best man in the movie about him is...Hugh Jackman. We all love a hero. And when you write a movie that is about a hero... you make it about a real hero. We all know that Hugh Jackmans father is a war hero, he's an actor who has done many great films, but he is not a real war hero. His father is from the old country, he was a farmer, not a soldier. He doesn't fight. He goes in to a war zone and he does what he has to do. Hugh Jackmann is a hero in the book. He is not in the film. The only time I felt the movie could have been better was when Hugh Jackmanners character, when he was talking about the people he was fighting, he said "they are not people", so when he said that they weren't people he said it in the same tone as "the world will always be a mess" in the song "The World Will

It's about the fact that this country, in the name of democracy, had to commit acts of war against a country that was not a threat to our country at that time. It has to be said. And, if it's true, it is a shocking fact." - Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9/11 "If this movie had been made by some liberal group that wanted to make a protest, or a statement, or some sort of a moralistic statement, it would have been fine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Brief Encounter" is a very good thriller. The plot is pretty much the same as the movie "The Killing" (2009) and it is very similar. But the film is a bit more suspenseful and interesting. It is also better in a few aspects. There is more action than in the movie, the movie is a little bit better at the ending, and the characters are a little more developed. I also like the characters. There are several, and they are all very well developed. And of course, there is a good thriller at the end of the movie. I think that "Brief Interation" is an enjoyable movie.  I really like it. _________________ "Barely Legal" (2010)  - I have seen this movie at the cinema (not the theater) at least 10 times. It has some great scenes and the actors are good. The story is good, too, and this movie is good for younger audiences. I am very pleased with this movie and I really enjoyed it.

He said that he loved it, and that he thought it would make a good romantic movie. Well, I'm so glad he said that because I had to have it. It's a great movie, and it has a lot of great scenes. This movie is a great romance. I found the characters to be believable and the movie to be well made. I loved the ending and I liked how the characters moved on with their lives. The only problem I have with this movie is that it has some pretty bad acting. It didn't have the best acting in the world, but it's still better than a lot. There are a lot better actors out there that could have made a better movie. I gave this movie a 8/10 because I think that it's a good rom-com.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm going to start this review with a big confession. I'm not a big fan of horror movies. In fact, I'm actually quite a bit afraid of them. I mean, I've watched many of them, but the only one I can think of that I truly hated was The Conjuring. This movie made me so uncomfortable that I wanted to take a shower after it ended. I was sickened and disgusted. So I can understand why some people have an issue with this movie. However, there is a very important message that is worth taking into consideration. This message is that when you look at the world around you, you can never take anything for granted. There are always things that are out of your control. There is always a price to pay. This isn't to say that there aren't some people who can't take it. I don't know anyone like that. However there are plenty of people who do. There will always be a price for what you have. I feel like this movie is trying to show that sometimes you need to look at yourself in the mirror to see the truth. When you see what is really happening around you you can't help but feel uncomfortable. However this movie also teaches us that we have the power to change our lives. That even though we are in the dark sometimes we are still able to see what needs to be done. I think that the message of this movie can actually be applied to most of the things that we do in our daily lives. We have the ability to make our lives a little better, we have control over what happens to us, we can see the ugly side of ourselves, and we can even change ourselves. If you are ever going to give yourself a little push to get up out of bed, go to the bathroom, or even just take a few minutes to do something nice for yourself then you have to watch this movie to see how you can actually make your life a little bit better. If there is one movie that I can recommend to people, it would have to be this movie! The story is great, the acting is great and the special effects are just outstanding. This is a must see movie.  …

It is a great idea for a good film."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was very good.  It had all the ingredients: a great story, great characters, and great action.  This movie is not the most complex movie out there, but it is one of the most fun ones.  The movie is about a man named "Pete", who is trying to solve a murder.  He has a "hacker" that he is trying not to betray, but Pete just can't seem to tell him the truth.    This movie is one you should watch before you get too far into it.  I hope you all enjoy this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________   If I have to pick a top 5 movie of the year it's going to be:   1) Zootopia  2) The Secret Life of Pets  3) Star Wars: The Force Awakens  4) Captain America: Civil War  5) The Revenant  ___________________________________________________   I've always felt that Captain America was one of the best movies ever made. Even though the movie was rushed, and there were some plot holes, the movie still had a great story and some of the most amazing action sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The only issue with this movie is that it ends with the villains being defeated, but that's not a bad thing because they should have been killed off before they got to fight a bunch of soldiers and the president. But the best part of the movie is the amazing cast of characters, and they all get their moment to shine in the movie.   Zootopia has a great plot and the animation is great. The movie has a lot of great scenes in it, and the characters are great.   I loved the relationship between Nick and Judy, and their dynamic was amazing. I also liked how the story had a lot more humor in it. I felt like the movie could have ended a little more strongly, but the end of the film was great. Also, I liked how they had a very different ending for both Nick and Hopps.   (And I'm going to give the movie a 10/10 for the plot and action, but a 5/10 overall because I felt that they should kill off the main villain in the last act.)   The Secret Life Of Pets is a really great movie. I didn't like the ending because I feel like they could have killed off the whole thing in the middle of the story, but at the same time I didn  could have done without it. And I also loved that they had more of a lighthearted and fun tone than most movies do. It was fun, and I loved how they kept the whole family together.     Star Wars: Episode VII was a big disappointment for me. I think it was the biggest waste of money and time in the history of the franchise. The original trilogy was so amazing and I thought they should do something completely different with it. It's just sad to me that they didn't use that original trilogy to tell a great new story. I was hoping that

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I think this movie has the most interesting and well-developed characters of any movie of this kind that I have seen in my life. It is like a fairy tale about a very smart, very noble, very honest and very good guy who goes on an adventure and discovers that a lot of people are as mean as he is. I think it is the best movie that this director has made in years. The actors are all wonderful. They are really acting. They really do not try to pretend to be a man with an accent and a fake mustache, they do what they do. They look and sound like real men. You cannot help but love them and laugh at them. I have never seen such an interesting story. This movie does not have any pretentious and cliched ideas. It deals with the issues of the real life and shows how much people are really hurt and suffer. This is a great movie.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________"If you want to see something new and exciting about a classic, you have to see Star Wars: A New Hope. The film is a brilliant combination of a space adventure with a science fiction story that will forever be remembered for its special effects and effects. You have to be a true aficionado of science fiction to really appreciate this movie, and it's not easy. You see, there are two sides to every story. The first side is what we usually see. The plot may be simple, but it is the story that matters, and the story of the Jedi. The other side is the one that is really fascinating. That's the story you hear about in the old Star Wars films. The Jedi have come back to life and are ready to save the galaxy. That side is a lot more complicated. The Force is alive, but the Jedi have forgotten about it. And the evil Empire wants to kill all the Jedi, so they have to learn to use the Force again. There are many mysteries in the story and some of them may seem obvious, but there are also some things that will be a surprise for some fans. You may never guess how the Jedi were trained by the Jedi Masters, or how the Force works, or who are the true villains in the movie. It's an extremely fun movie with lots of special effects, and one of the best Star Wars movies of all time. I'd give it a 10/10."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You are not here to be entertained. You are here to watch something that is beautiful and powerful. It is a work of art and it is also a profound meditation on what it means to be human.  This is a story about love and loss, it is about family and about the bonds that we make with people we have only known for a few years. It shows us that we are never alone, that the universe is still out there."
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   When it comes to horror, the first horror movie I remember seeing was a little movie called Night of the Demons. It was about a man and his girlfriend who go to a haunted house for the night. I wasn't too familiar with horror at the time, but it was fun, creepy and had a great soundtrack. I remember watching it and having a good laugh. It's a movie I watched many times in my teens and 20s. Now I see Night of The Demons is being remade by director Joe Dante for a remake, but this time with a very different premise.   A woman and her son are visiting her parents in the town of Poughkeepsie. They live in a beautiful house on a hill, where the couple's three daughters are getting married in a nearby hotel. One of the girls, Linda (Greta Gerwig) has a dark secret that she's hiding from her family. She has a pet pig called Dolly, who has been killed and eaten. When Linda's parents arrive, she's so excited that she forgets to tell them. They bring her upstairs and she tells them the whole story. She says she was walking home one night when a huge shadow crossed the road. She was too frightened to stop and she almost ran into the monster. She didn't tell her parents because she didn't want to scare them. She's terrified that her father will never accept her as his daughter. They don't believe her. They want to send her back home.  , directed by Joe Dante, is set in the 1920s, when New York City is in the midst of the Great Depression. The film opens with a young man getting shot and killed in a subway station. It soon becomes apparent that he was murdered by a mysterious woman who has stalked him. She later kidnaps the young man's son and leaves him at a local train station. The boy is reunited with his father, who is now a small town lawyer. The father and son eventually learn that Linda has been living in a house on the hill for several years. She is a former socialite who has a fondness for pig and has even had an affinity for a pet dog. When the father discovers that Linda is still in town, he decides to go after her.   the mother and daughter go to the house of the pig. They discover that Linda keeps the pig on a leash and that she has a room full of animals. They try

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If you can't stand a good story, don't watch it." - John Carpenter "The first half of this movie is so beautiful. I love the imagery, and the music, especially when it's used as a soundtrack for a sequence. It has a very 'lost world' feel. The movie's plot doesn't make sense at first, but I can't imagine how a film like this would have been made by a kid who had never seen a film before. It's the kind of movie you sit down with a glass of wine and watch. It isn't a great movie, but it has a certain charm and timelessness that I'd love to experience again.  For a movie that's so well-made and has such a great soundtrack, I find it disappointing that they didn't bother to make a proper Blu-ray release." - Richard Boles "I just saw this movie and can tell you it's a great film. It is a movie with a good storyline and it does have a good soundtrack, but the Blu-Ray release is disappointing in many ways. The audio is poor. I've had a bad experience with the audio from the Criterion release, and this is even worse. The sound effects are completely missing and it is very difficult to hear what is being said. The soundtrack is also just not very good. The music is very subdued, and it seems like the producers did not spend much time on it. There are several songs that I can hear from the soundtrack but can't identify, and a couple of songs that are clearly the same. The special features are okay, but not much to talk about. The video on the BluRay release just isn't as good as the DVD release."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________   If you liked "A Simple Plan", then this is a must-see for you. If you're a sci-fi fan like I am, then you will probably love this movie. It has a few flaws but overall it's a great sci-fantasy movie that shows how awesome the future is, especially with robots!   The main character is a guy named Mike who has been stranded on an alien planet called Earth. When his spaceship crashes, he wakes up and is able to speak with a talking robot that tells him about the planet and the creatures that live there. Mike learns about the people who live there and the dangers of this planet.   Mike meets a girl named Sarah who is also stranded on Earth. They fall in love and they decide to stay on Earth together. This leads to the story of their lives.  .   a lot of people complain about this movie because it has a lot to do with religion and that it doesn't have enough science in it. The movie doesn't focus on religion but does show that there are some people who believe in certain things, but there are also people who just don't believe in God or gods. This movie also deals with human emotion and that's why it's so good.  , so if you like science fiction and have a good sense of humor, then this movie will make you laugh. It is an action movie with a lot going on and it shows that robots can be very deadly.   (Movie rating: 5 out of 5)
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________"  What a bunch of bullshit!  This movie is full of blatant lies. The plot is full out bullshit and the film itself is full on bullshit.  The first 20 minutes is about a young girl who is having sex with her boyfriend. She has a bad reaction to his last load and the next morning she is at the hospital having surgery for it. .  to get to the point of this movie. This girl is the only one who gets to experience this orgasm. So the whole movie she is going to the hospital to get a better orgasm. But when she gets there she has to take her clothes off and she is lying on the operating table and the surgeon is getting ready to operate on her. Then the surgeon says "Let's get this over with" and goes to do his work. The girl goes to the operating room and has sex with him. She is totally naked and she climaxes. Then she wakes up in the hospital bed and the doctor is holding her and is saying "You are not having a normal orgasm" He then says "Well, the girl you just had sex with has never had a normal one before". Then he says "What do you mean she is never had one before?" The doctor replies "Well she just had her first one". The doctor then says, "Well the girl who had sex just now is a virgin" The girl then says 'Oh my god' and the director is saying, "She is a girl who has never done anything like that before".  . to make this a complete nightmare of bullshit: When this girl is in the operating theater, she does not have a boyfriend. When the surgeon enters the room she says, 'Who is that?' The surgeon replies, 'That is my patient, the one who just had surgery.' The girl replies 'No, that's not my patient' The surgeon says, ''No it is my... patient''. The girl says,''I'm sorry, what?' The girl does not say anything. The surgeon then says ''You are the girl I am about to operate upon'. The director then says, 'Who are you talking to?' The director replies, ''My patient.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   "The man on the screen is the realest, most generous and kindest man I've ever known. He is the man that everybody dreams about, but never gets a chance to be. I never met anybody like him. He was an artist, a musician, a poet, a writer, an actor and a philosopher."   -Ricky Gervais   Synopsis:  The real life story of a young musician and his friend who meet at a music festival in Greece and embark on an adventure that will take them to the heights of fame and fortune. They become world-famous musicians, selling out concerts around the world and performing in the circus. When they decide to take a break from performing and return to Greece, their fame grows, but it is not all happiness and love. The pair find themselves drawn into the machinations of politics, the mafia and a mysterious man.   The film is a classic Greek love story with some very great performances from a stellar cast including:   Vittorio De Sica (Greece, "My Fair Lady")   Robert Redford (GREECE, "The Godfather")   a true story about a real life hero.   in the 1930's, when he was a young man, Robert Redford was given the chance to tour the Greek islands. While in Crete, Redford met the man of his dreams, Aretas Panayiotou, a Greek musician. Panayotou was a master of the violin and had toured the world with many famous musicians. He also had the talent to sing and was also very talented in the arts. Panahiotou and Redford became close friends, and they decided to return to the Greek Islands and tour the world. They met and fell in love and were married within a few years. The film depicts Redford's relationship with Panayotiou, as they travel around the globe, and of course, as their fame and wealth grew.   The film also features some of the greatest scenes of all time from the golden era of Greek music.   to the Greeks, Red Ford was a national hero. He made the greatest journey of all times in order to marry the girl of his heart. He did it on his own and traveled to Crete on a horse, with only his violin and a little money in his pocket. This is the kind of hero who is worthy of a place in the history books.

I felt like I was just listening to someone talk and I felt very disconnected from the story. I had to look up some of the things said. Some of it was very confusing but I guess it makes for a better film. If you are looking for a good scary film this is definitely worth checking out. *****  No Was this rating helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ ( ) I have seen the whole movie and i will admit it is not great. I thought the movie was great but i wouldnt pay to see it again. The movie was about a man who went on a journey to find his lost daughter. The main character was not bad but his daughter was. She was beautiful and all. When he found her she was a dirty girl, she had a big cock. She tried to seduce him but he refused. But her dad found her and brought her back. She said she would never leave her dad. She would never be a prostitute. The man told her if she wanted to make it big then she should become a prostitute and get some money. Her dad got scared that she would run off with some other man. She told him she wanted his money, so she ran off. She got some money from some people but she didn't have a job. She didn't like that, so the father brought her to a brothel. She had to become a whore. Her parents were scared of her father. So they took her to the hotel and took care of her. They fed her and made sure she slept. The guy took a liking to her and they made love. Then she started getting a bit of money from the brothel and bought a car. She then got into a car accident and they had to call the doctor to help her. The doctor told them she had only a few hours to live. The family said they could afford to keep her but the doctor said that they would have to take her to see a doctor. The woman refused to go, she said she wanted her father to be proud of her and she would do anything for him. The father then made her promise to be his girlfriend and do anything he wanted. She agreed to that and the doctor took her away. When she came back to the brothels she told the doctor that she wanted him to stay with her. She loved him and said she had been through a lot in her life. She knew how to take care of him. They were lovers and he did what he wanted to do with her and he told her that if she was good he would do what she wanted. Then he told the man that she was his daughter. He then took her back to her father and told him he was sorry for everything he had done and he loved her. He also told him that he loved him. He gave him the money he had
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I liked this movie. I thought it was funny, I liked how he is going to get into trouble for it and he's just not going to be able to resist getting his dick wet. It's great. The scene with him in a strip club is really funny. The sex scenes are good, but not amazing. The girls are pretty hot, but they seem like they're not going into it for the sex. I guess they like the money. The music was great, and the ending was a little sad. There are some good lines in this movie, and they are funny too. There's a great scene where he goes to a strip bar and has a little strip show, and everyone is staring at him. He's dressed up as a waitress, but he gets a lot of stares. He takes his shirt off, and then his panties and he runs around naked. When he gets out of the strip club, he comes back to his car and is going over the things he had to buy. The guys he's talking to are talking about how good the woman is and they're all saying how she's going to have lots of money. Then they get to talking about her husband. The wife says he's a loser and that she's had sex with a bunch of guys. The guy says he knows, but she said he was the best, and she's really glad she went with him. Then he goes over to the woman and starts to give her a blowjob. Then she says that it's a good idea, but it would be better if he could fuck her. The husband gets mad at her, but the woman says that she loves it and it's going really well. He says that if they're going to fuck, he has to take off his shirt, and that he's really embarrassed about it. The woman says he can take off her top, and if he wants to see her tits, he should take them off too. He then takes her bra off, she's so hot and sexy, and it looks like they've had sex already. The girl that the man is with starts to have sex with the man's wife, and he says that they really are having sex already, but there's not much. Then the man says that he doesn't want to fuck the wife anymore, he's tired of it. He gets on top of her and starts fucking her, and is getting really turned on. The man says he loves her

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  (1) The Best I've Seen  This movie is like a perfect little piece of work, you can watch it without being bored or feeling any bad vibes at all. It's a simple story, but you can get in a nice relaxing rhythm just by watching this movie.   The story is about a young boy who has the misfortune to meet a girl named Analisa, and after a while they start to fall in love. The movie itself has a really good atmosphere. The film has a great soundtrack, it's really catchy and enjoyable to listen to. There is not much dialogue in the movie, and most of the time you are in the character's heads. The character design is great, the actors really do a great job, and the cinematography is pretty good too. This movie really works on a deeper level than your average movie, it doesn't just make you laugh at some silly situations. The whole movie is filled with a great feeling, you feel like you're actually in their heads.   of course there are many things that the movie doesn't get right, but the good things outweigh the bad things, it is a great little movie. The ending is pretty cool too. I recommend watching this with someone who loves a good thriller.

There is a really awesome, funny, and touching scene where you get to see what it would be like to be in a relationship with someone you are actually in love with. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they used a lot of different scenes, and sometimes they just reused the same thing, but it's not that bad. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, I definitely recommend this movie.

If you are a movie watcher, you will find yourself bored as hell while watching it. The film has no story to tell and even if it was, the story was boring and pointless. It is like watching a TV show and then you watch it for a few minutes then go back to watching TV. The action scenes were terrible, the special effects were terrible and the acting was so bad, you could feel your eyes tearing up at the same time. The movie was so boring, it didn't even make you want to laugh. I would not recommend this movie at all, just watch something else. If it had a good story, great special effects, decent acting and a good plot, it would have been great. Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  "I thought I was in a Hitchcock movie. I had never seen such an original and creative horror movie."  - Roger Ebert  What a movie. The first film by David Cronenberg. I've always loved his movies. I was totally hooked. I watched the film in a few days and then went back to it to watch it again and again and still can't get it out of my mind. This movie is very original and I love it. I loved Cronenberg's style. It is dark, disturbing, disturbing. I just love the look of the film. I liked it so much that I made it the theme song of my personal radio station. It was my first radio station and I loved it. It has stayed with me for over 20 years. I even saw a performance of it in New York and it was so much fun. I don't know why I've never seen it in a theater before. I guess I haven't been around long enough.

It's just one of the best comedy films ever made. The story is very funny and the cast is all very funny. The plot is about a guy, who decides to try and take revenge on a man who broke his heart. The revenge is not pretty, as the guy gets stabbed to death and he takes it out on the man's wife. The only problem I have is that some of the dialogue is not very easy to follow. It seems that the actors are not very good at acting.  (hide spoiler)  I don't think the English subtitles are good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai is a good film. It has some good action and it has a good story that is wrapped up in a good way. It does have a couple of flaws though.  It is quite long.      It is a bit overrated as far as the action goes.    The plot does not hold up.    It is not an epic epic.  In fact, it is rather underwhelming.  The action is ok.  It does a decent job at fighting.  This is good though because it gives the movie a chance to go into some of the more epic scenes.  One scene in particular is a highlight for me.  This is the one that I want to watch.  I have seen this scene many times and it never fails to impress me.    It gives us a little bit of background about the samurai and his love for his wife.  He is a very interesting character that I would have liked to see more of.   The only downside to this movie is that the cast and crew are just average.  There are no stars and the movie is not bad.  Even though it has some flaws, I do believe it is a worthy movie.  My rating:   The Last samurai is a decent film.  Its action is very good and it does a good job at keeping up with the plot.  At the same time it has its flaws.   It is long.   There are a few too many characters and they are not all developed at the same rate.  But for a film that is so long, it does have some good moments.   If you are looking for a good samurai movie with some action, then this is a great film to watch!  If you do not mind the length, then it is worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "My parents were married for sixty years. They lived in a two-story house and had five children. We lived in the attic. It was a two story house, and when I was six my father built a small garage in the back. I was the last one to see the light on in the basement. The garage was a three-and-a-half-by-three-and a-half room. It had no windows. The house had no front door. The door was a one-way door. I don't know what it was called. I only know I used to come home, open the door, and my mother would say, 'What the hell is that?' I'd say, `A garage.' She'd say `No, no, that's a house. I'm not going in there.' She never did go in there."

I really like the script, and the acting was good. The acting was done by many actors and not just the lead character. The story was really good and the plot was just right. The film did not take itself too seriously. It took you back to a good old time when you go see a film. The actors did their job and were well done. I would give it a B.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dirty Harry  has been re-released for Blu-ray and it is great.  It is a great movie.      The movie takes place in 1920's Philadelphia and the story is about the man, Harry Callahan, who was hired by the mob to kill a corrupt mob boss named Eddie Felson.   Harry goes to Felson's house and the mob boss is having a party.  He throws a drink and the hit man (Harry Callahan) kills Felson and then is killed himself.  The film is a good time, but it is a hard watch.       The best part about the movie is the music.  It is the great movie score and it gives the film an aura of a good gangster movie. It is a fun movie, but at times it is too easy.  However, if you want to watch a great gangster flick,   then   this is the movie for you.

This film has a great score and is very atmospheric.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is really a good action movie, but the story is not very good. It's about a police officer and a gang member. They are in a city where the police and gang fights are very popular. They have a lot of action and some great fights. The action scenes are pretty good. The movie has a very cool atmosphere and the story and characters are great. I loved it. I would definitely recommend this movie. A few things I want to mention: - There are some very bad language and swearing in this movie, it's not as good as the previous movie, the previous one was way better. - There's some sex scenes in this, which I didn't like very much. The sex scenes are not very well done. They were not very realistic, and they didn't really have any story behind them. The characters don't talk about what's going on during sex. I thought it was kind of silly. - I didn�t like that the bad guy has a girlfriend. I liked the bad guys character, but this girl was just too annoying. I don't know why this girl is there. I never liked it when bad guys have girlfriends. - It's not that much of a mystery in this one. The main thing is the main character, the guy is really cool. The rest of the people in this were kind of just background. I guess it's a good thing that the main bad guy doesn't have any back story. I think it would have been much better if the main villain had a back story to himself. This movie was okay, it was really a cool movie, and I thought the action scenes were very good, but it didn't have a very good story. But I really liked this movie a lot. It was very good and the action was very well made. I'm giving this movie 4.5/5.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ "I was blown away by this film. I love the idea that you could see a person's life from the perspective of their mother. The story has so much potential. I could watch this movie all day." -J.B. I thought this was a wonderful film and one of the best movies I have seen this year. The concept of the film is fascinating and I could see how the story was made. A woman is a mother to two children but she never really got the chance to have a normal life with them. The film was directed by a master storyteller, David Lynch and is a very strange and dark film. The soundtrack is wonderful and the visuals are very nice. The special effects are very well done and it is very good. This film is definitely one of my favorites of the year. I hope David Lynch does a second film with this story line. I would love to see the other half of the story.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie to watch with a friend. It's a great movie about a woman who finds out she's pregnant and the guy who's going to have the baby. There's not much to say about this movie other than it's a fun movie. It would have been nice to see more of the baby in this movie but it's not a bad movie at all. It had a great soundtrack and the acting was great. Overall a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Exorcist (1973) is one of the most famous and acclaimed movies of all time. I am very thankful to have seen it, but I am not sure I would recommend it to anyone. The story is about the life and death of an eleven-year old girl who, after being possessed by the devil, is brought to a convent and eventually, a psychiatric hospital, where she eventually dies. In this movie, the actors, all of whom had a very good acting style, play the role of the nuns who are trying to save the girl. As I have seen so many times in films, they all seem to be having fun and are laughing the whole time. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The film does not have a happy ending, as it is a very depressing film. There is a lot of blood, sex, nudity, violence and disturbing scenes. I guess the main character is not very nice. The movie has a lot to live up to, but is still a good film. I highly recommend watching it. It will definitely make you angry.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* ********************** ***************** *********** ********* The best movie of 2011 so far. I'm not one for gore and gore movies, but I am a sucker for good movies. This movie has a lot of heart and is filled with emotions. The movie is based on a true story of a group of women that tried to find love and peace with each other, but ended up becoming the most hated women in the history of the world. It is so sad, but also very beautiful. I was amazed at the amount of love they had for each other and their faith in each other. I love this movie, and the acting is phenomenal. The plot is simple and the ending is perfect.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was very well-written and very entertaining.  A very good thriller.   I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good thriller that isn't too heavy-handed and isn't as plot-heavy as some of the others.  The Rating:  This movie is not exactly for the kids, so don't go into it expecting to see the characters of Jack Ryan in action.  It is a great film with a great story, and an entertaining cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I don't know what it is about this movie. I've heard it described as a "classic" but I can't quite place what that means. It's not like a John Ford Western or a spaghetti western where there's a long time in the story, a hero who comes along and saves the day. This is a pretty standard "road movie" with the heroes going through all the typical things they go through in a western. In other words, a typical road movie with some action thrown in. The plot isn't really any different than any other Western. The best I can describe it is the classic spaghetti western of the 1950s and 60s. If you don't like westerns, I don not suggest watching this. The music is pretty standard, with a bit of the "Old West" in it. And, the acting is pretty bad. The only good thing about it is that the characters are interesting. It gives you a good idea of who they are. The supporting cast is pretty decent, except for the cowboy who is not very convincing. He's supposed to be a hero and he never really does anything. The ending is pretty ridiculous, but that's the point of the movie. The rest of the film is not too bad, but the ending does not fit in with the rest of it. There are two versions of this movie: the original and a remake. The remake is the one I've seen. The original version is not bad but it isn't worth the watch. I suggest the original version. The story and characters are similar enough to the classic film that they won't confuse you. There is one scene that really bothers me though. I don,t know if it's because of the music or because of how unrealistic it is, but I was kind of disappointed. When the character who was supposed to die walks off the horse he had fallen off of, the camera zooms in and you can see him in a white robe on the ground. I didn't understand what was going on. The other characters, including the cowgirl and the cowboy, are also in white robes. It looks really silly and I was not sure if I was supposed or if it was supposed by the director to be that way. I can see where he wanted to go with it, but there was no reason for it. Maybe the director was too lazy to think of a better way to do it. This version is the version that I have seen.

It was an enjoyable movie that had a unique plot and good performances. I am a huge fan of the series and of the movie but this one was a very enjoyable experience. - The film was a mix of different scenes. There was a lot of action, a lot action scenes, and a lot character development. The story was very original and a very good one. - I was impressed with how well the director did a film that was so different from what he did with the original series. - A good mix of drama, comedy, romance and suspense. The characters were likable and the action scenes were great. This movie did not feel like it was a typical sequel, it was more like a completely different movie that was fun to watch and a great experience.

So I have to. I don't care if it kills me, I'm going to do it. This is it. I can't leave, I have got to go. It's all I know."  The film follows a man who has lost everything and becomes an assassin. He finds himself in a strange country and is taken in by a man known as the King of Shadows. He is soon in the middle of a political battle. The King of the Shadows is a character we have never seen before in a Hollywood film. It is a complex and intriguing character. He has been described as a "militant religious fanatic" and an "evil psychopath". He has the ability to move from one side of the country to the other in a matter of seconds. It has been said that he was once a priest but that he left the priesthood and has become a terrorist. He believes that he can save his people by killing the leaders of his country.    The characters and plot is fascinating. The story is very different from most Hollywood action films. The action is much slower than a typical Hollywood action film. The characters have a more interesting backstory and their actions and emotions are more believable.   This movie was well worth seeing. The plot is well thought out and is believable. The pacing of the movie is good. The acting is very good. I am a fan of the director and this movie was a great experience.   the only thing I would change would be the soundtrack. It was very poor. It would have been much better if the soundtrack was more upbeat. I think this is a movie that should be seen by anyone that likes movies and drama.  of the film.   There are a lot of great movie-like elements in this movie. The cinematography, the score, the story and the acting are all well done. This movie is a must-see. The only thing that I would do differently is change the soundtrack (the soundtrack was very disappointing). I would like to see it again.

I was shocked when I found out he was killed and then reanimated and put back together again. I have seen some other movies where characters were killed and the same thing happens to them. This movie showed that the dead can actually live again and have a new life in this case. The story was so good and it was a great thriller. The movie ended with the killer still trying to get his hands on a girl, and I loved it. The ending was great. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror and thriller. It is very good. I highly recommend this one.

The movie has a very good chemistry between all of the cast, and the actors give a good performance. There is no real story to it, but the actors all have a very different personality and the movie is not boring. It does have some good humor as well. I also liked the way the movie was shot, it looks like a real movie and the way they filmed it was fun. The only thing that could have been better was when the characters are walking down the street. The camera would sometimes cut away from them and they would appear out of nowhere.

It has always been on my "wishlist" for a long time now. It was only a couple of years ago when I finally went see it in the cinema. The story of "The Dude" is great, and the acting is perfect. I loved the way the film was shot. I had never seen a film like this, and I'm glad I finally did. This is a must see for all "Bucks fans". The score was a great addition as well, and it was so great to see the original music and actors all together again. It's a great movie, and for a true movie buff, it is a real treat.  - Christopher P. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  1. "The Thing," director James Cameron.  2. "E.T.," writer and director Steven Spielberg.  The movie opens on a scene of two young children playing in the woods. One of them sees a small alien creature and asks, "Where did he come from?" The other one says, "He's not coming back. He's going to be back." The two children watch in amazement as the creature, in his spaceship, leaves the earth and disappears into the clouds. A few minutes later the same creature returns and says, in a voice that is very different from the first one, "We're back!" At this point the two children look at each other and say, "Why are you so sure he's going back?"  3. "Rudy," director John Landis.  (Starring George Segal, John Candy, John Schlesinger, and Robert DeNiro) The film opens with a young man (George Segal) being arrested for burglary. The police find the door to his house locked and a dead cat on the living room floor. The house is then searched by a policeman, who finds the cat, too, dead, and concludes that the man must be a burglar. The policeman goes on to investigate the house further, and finds a note on a table saying, "My name is Rudy. Please come back to my house at 10:00 tonight. I have a gun in the kitchen. Be quick." A few days later, the policeman returns to the house, this time accompanied by a female police officer, who also has a gun. The two police officers go into the kitchen, and find Rudy asleep. The female officer is then killed by the burglar, who then flees. The young man then goes to his home and discovers that a message is written on the back of his door, reading: "RUDY'S DEAD. DIE BY THE GUNS OF THE POLICE."  4. "Airplane," director Jack Sholder.  the film opens on the scene of a plane crash. The passengers are found dead, one of them being a young girl. A young boy (Ralph Bellamy) then hears noises coming from the plane. A couple of weeks later, a woman (Deborah Kerr) appears on television in a wheelchair. She tells of a crash that occurred two weeks earlier. She also tells that she was injured in

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ A good film with a lot of promise. The director made a good choice of actors for this movie. It's a thriller that has a good amount of twists and turns. I was very intrigued by the story. It wasn't overly complicated or long. The movie was paced well. The story was told with a good sense of suspense. I thought the actors did a great job. The action scenes were good. The film was enjoyable. I enjoyed the suspense of the film. This is a great movie to watch with a group of friends. The characters are very likable. I would recommend this movie to all fans of thrillers.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I'm not a big horror movie fan, and I don't know if this one is for me, but I was surprised. It was a fun ride. I didn't want it to end, but at the same time, I thought it was pretty good. It's not a "slasher" movie, but it is a really good one. I've seen a lot of them and they usually have one thing in common. They're all really short. This one was a little bit different. I thought the ending was kind of cool. I also thought it showed the whole "dance with death" thing in a good way. The soundtrack was great, too. It really made the movie. I can't wait for the DVD to come out! It's a great film. I'm just glad they decided to show a little more of the "dive into death" angle. I really think this movie would have been more scary if they hadn't showed all the gore. I mean, it's not that great a movie. There are a lot more gore scenes than in the first one, but the story is still pretty good and well done. I liked it, but not enough to see it again. I will definitely be getting the DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ This is a great movie. I love it. If you love movies with a great story and great acting, this one is definitely for you. The movie starts out in a very quiet, serene way. The kids are in a forest and they are all just walking about and talking. But then, a car pulls up and a guy in a white coat, who looks like James Bond, pulls up behind them. The children run for the car, but the guy just pulls out a gun and shoots at them. Then he turns and points the gun at them again. Then a man in a trench coat jumps out of the car and he shoots at the children again. And then a third person walks out of a house in a car and then he shoots them as well. And all of a sudden, they all fall dead. And the movie just goes on as if it never happened. But it's actually happening. The kid's friends run into the forest, and they see their friends, but they're all dead. The parents come out of their house to find their dead kids, but there is no one there. And so they look in the woods and they all find their bodies. The girl's name is Annabelle and the guy's name was Frank. The whole story is about Annabel Lee. Her mother dies and Annabel and her sister are sent to live with her uncle, Mr. Lyle. He is the most boring man in the world, but he loves Annabel. So when Annabel is in his house, she meets him and she likes him, too. And he loves her too, and it is love at first sight. But soon, he has some strange dreams that make him very sad. He starts to act very strange and his family starts to freak out. They start to go crazy. They tell Annabel to leave him. She does, but she is too scared to tell them where she's going. She's afraid of what her uncle will do to her. So Annabel stays in the house. But after a few days, she goes into the woods again, and she sees her uncle's car. She runs in there, and there is a man dressed like a policeman, and he points a gun at her. And she has to tell him where she is. So the next day, he takes her to the police station and she has a heart attack. She tells him what has happened. The police get to work and

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you've never seen "Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope," you might want to check it out. It's an oldie but a goodie, with some new wrinkles.  You'll see a lot of familiar elements: The Death Star (now the Empire), the Rebels (the Rebel Alliance), the Jedi (the Jedi Knights), Luke Skywalker (anakin) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Obi-Wan).  The plot centers around the rise of Darth Vader (now Lord Vader), who is a Sith Lord who has been fighting for a long time for the Sith. His goal is to bring about the end of the Empire and restore the Empire to its original, pure purpose of peace and justice. , and "Star Trek" fans will be right at home, as well. . The story, though, has a lot to tell. It takes place a long, long time ago.  The Empire has fallen. The Jedi have been killed or have become corrupt. The Rebels are on the run.  in the end, the Jedi find the truth: The Empire is not only evil, it's a threat to the entire galaxy. And it's up to the Jedi to bring down the Empire. The final battle is the biggest battle in the entire Star Wars universe.  it is a film that can make your jaw drop, if you're a "Star" fan. I've watched it more than a dozen times, and it is still as captivating today as it was when I first saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  The original Star Wars Trilogy is now available on DVD, courtesy of Rialto Pictures!   The film is a great celebration of the original trilogy, but not the one you might be expecting. The movie has been out for some time now and it still holds up.   There's a great plot, but it's not really what you would call a "Star Wars" movie. Instead, it's a very well made comedy. There's a lot of funny lines in this movie that you won't find in the original movies, but the comedy is still very much a part of the movie.   the film is definitely not for the faint of heart. There are some very graphic scenes in this film, but they are well acted and they are meant to be taken seriously. The film is filled with great action and great action sequences. There is a little more humor in the film, and it's well played by the cast.   The story is set during the early days of the Rebellion and you don't really get to see any of the main characters from the original films until a bit later.   a lot more than a few changes were made to the original film. Instead of Princess Leia being a princess, Han Solo becomes a smuggler. Han is not Han, he's a bit of a jerk, but he is also very honest and caring.  . The character of Chewbacca is also changed, he is a very different character in the films. He has been changed from the Han Solo character in order to make the movie more appealing. There aren't a lot in this second film that was in the first, but there are some great sequences and some great moments.  , it would be easy to write a positive movie review about this one. However, there are a few issues that need to be pointed out. For one, this is a comedy and it doesn't try to be serious. There really is no reason to be in a movie called "The Last Jedi". There are very graphic action scenes and some of the scenes are very hard to watch. But, that isn't really the main problem. The main problem is that there isn't much in this first film that really makes the Star Wars universe stand out. There isn't a character that really sticks out in this one that is memorable. The characters that are in this, like Rey and Finn, they don't have much of a backstory. They are just in the movie to act
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ This movie, in my opinion, is a great movie. The characters are all so real and they all have the same kind of problems as one another. And the plot is so interesting. This movie has some serious issues but I really don't think it is that serious. The only thing that I don't like about the movie is the fact that the director made it in the 50s and it seems as if the actors and the camera crew were trying to make it look like a 1950s movie. But I think the movie was made in the 60s or 70s and the director probably thought that it would look better with more advanced lighting and the actors were trying too hard. I think they should have filmed it in an older theater. The acting is very good and it's good to see a good group of actors in a movie together. It's good that there are some great supporting roles for some of the characters. This is a very good movie and it should be watched by everyone.

The characters are great, but they're not developed enough to really care about them. There are so many things that I do not know about these people. The plot was not original, but the characters were. If you're not interested in watching a sci-fi movie that features robots, but are looking for a good action movie, then look no further. If there is anything wrong with this movie, it is that it ends on a cliffhanger, but that does not detract from the film. I really like this movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.

It was all about the romance and the plot was a good one. It took a long time to get to the story, but the payoff was worth it. You will enjoy it!

There is no review for this movie. - IMDb Mini Biography By: mnemesis  Spouse (2)  Trade Mark (2  Trivia (14) . , which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, is a film that is almost exclusively seen as a satire of the Vietnam War and the politics that led to it. But, in a way, this is true to some extent. The war was not the whole story, but a significant part of it. The movie was produced in 1962, the year that Lyndon B. Johnson was elected President, a war that had been in progress since the end of World War II. Johnson's presidency would last less than four years. The Vietnam War had become one of the biggest tragedies of the 20th century. There was an increasing number of draft dodgers, and many Americans were opposed to what they saw as a foreign policy of appeasement. The Johnson administration saw the war as a way to help the South Vietnamese. They saw North Vietnam as the major threat and they were willing to fight a long and costly war against it. As a result, a draft was passed, many soldiers deserted, and a draft dodging organization known as the Red Shirts took over the government. In the end, the war cost about 4,500 American and 8,000 Vietnamese lives. The film has been seen by many and has been the subject of many books and plays. The song that opens the film is a song by Bob Dylan called "It's Alright, Ma" which was recorded by the band Fleetwood Mac. In this song Dylan asks a girl, "What do you think of our president? / He's a great man, ain't he?" In the movie, this girl, called Cindy, asks the question.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  It is difficult to get a sense of the film's plot because it is not explained. There is no opening or closing theme and, while the film is somewhat interesting, it never reaches the level of brilliance of the films in which it shares a common ancestor. As the movie moves along, the viewer can appreciate the beauty of the sets, the effects, and the performances. However, the story does not advance. The story takes a turn in the second half of the movie and, as a result, the film suffers from some serious pacing problems. The climax is somewhat rushed and it does not resolve the situation at hand until several hours later. The movie has some very impressive sets and the actors are outstanding. The main characters are very good and are given some much needed depth. The ending, while a bit rushed, is a bit more satisfying than the rest of the picture. There are some great effects in this picture. The effects work well and, though they may not be for everyone, are impressive. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and am a bit disappointed that it did not reach the level that other films in the same series did. _________________________________________  "The Thing" is a great example of a classic, if you can find it in this day and age.  In spite of the many flaws, the movie is a true classic that deserves a place in every horror fan's library. _____________________________  My Rating: _______________________________

When she meets a guy there, she's pretty, but there's something wrong about him and she doesn 't know what to do with him. It's a fun movie, that should be watched by everyone. And the director is an amazing story teller. (12/10)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Citizen Kane" is one of the best films ever made and I loved every minute of it. I am a huge fan of John Ford and his films and "Citizen" is a wonderful addition to the series.  It is a beautiful film with a wonderful story that never gets tired.  John Ford is also a great director and this film is just as beautiful as any of his films.   The cinematography is amazing and the lighting is incredible.  And the music is perfect.  The film also has a great cast and I can't help but feel sorry for John Wayne when he is in the movie.  It was very hard for him to accept the role of Kane because he felt that he was the one who should be acting.  He wanted to be the one telling the story and John Ford didn't want him to do it.  His scenes were so short in the film that they were almost irrelevant.  John Wayne's acting was so great and his role in the story is just perfect.    I have to say that the film is a very good film, not a great one.  But it is a good film.  I just wish that the plot was a little more complex.  If it were, it would have been a great film.   I really recommend this movie to everyone.  "CITIZEN KANE" is an excellent movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movie from the year is  "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" starring Sergio Leone.  I really enjoy his work and it has been a long time since I have seen any of his movies. Â This movie is about the last days of a very famous  Italian hero.  The film is a classic in its own right, with some great performances.   One of my favorites is Robert Mitchum as the villain.  He gives the best performance of his life and has a great role.  In the movie you will see all the great battles in the American Civil War.  The battle at Gettysburg was a good example of how the battle of Gettysburg would play out.  This film is also full of beautiful landscapes.  There are some beautiful locations that I never knew existed.  I loved the way they used color.  It really brought the movie to life.  This movie was a real time capsule, it was the late 1800's and there were not many people around.  As the battle continued to rage on the people started to move out of the battlefield.  At this time, the world was very different.  People were living a much different way.  They did not have horses.  Many people did not even have cars.  Cars were very popular and they used them all over the place.  Even though the movie was made during World War 2, you could still see people driving around.    The movie also had some great special effects.  Some of the things they did were incredible.  You would see a group of people fighting over a wounded soldier and they were fighting very fiercely.  One of the most memorable scenes of the movie is the famous scene of a soldier on the front with his arm around a dead woman.  She is crying out in pain.  These are just a few of the many memorable scenes in this movie.  While the movie has a few plot holes, it is still a great movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone.  "The good, the bad, and Ugly."  If you are a fan of the American movies of the late 20's and early 30's then you will enjoy this movie as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********  This movie is pretty good, especially for the 90's. It has some good plot, decent acting and the music is just right. I really love the opening of the movie. The music and the acting are top notch. The movie is about a young man who has been adopted by a family who are a bunch of drug addicts. He goes to school and the school bullies him. He takes them down a few notches and finally kills one of the bullies. He is taken in by the family who take care of him. They treat him like a son and when he grows up he is in a drug rehab center and goes back to school. The other kids start to pick on him and make fun of him because of his father and he is scared of his dad. At one point he is taken by a woman, who is in charge of rehab and they become best friends. When he is at his lowest he finds out that he was adopted at a very young age. The main character grows and changes a lot and has a great ending. It is just good to see a positive movie in the 90s. The ending is really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I was really impressed with this movie. It is not a film for the weak of heart. It takes a very unique look at the subject of violence and how it can have an impact on an individual. I really enjoyed this movie as it was different from most others I have seen. It really captured the reality of the violent crimes committed and also what the victims and the families are going through. This is not something you would expect to see in a movie but I thought it was very accurate." What I like about the movie: "A good action movie with some dark and sad moments. I didn't expect it to be this good. The story was great. It was about a man who has killed someone in self defense and now his wife and daughter are looking for him. This was very intense. The ending was good too." Rating:  - 1 star out of 5 I was going to give this movie a 4 star rating but I had to give it a 1 star as the ending was very unsatisfying. I will probably not watch this movie again as I will want to see the rest of the movie first. I have been waiting for the release of this movie for a long time now. I wanted to see this movie after reading a book on the subject by another movie director that I highly recommend.  I found this book in the library and decided to read it after I saw the movie.  I really enjoyed it! I think this movie really shows that there are no good and bad guys in the world.   The movie was very well made and I loved every second of it.  I recommend this movie to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Exorcist " is the best horror film ever made and it is also one of the best movies ever made.  The movie is about a possessed girl who goes on a rampage at a Catholic school.  The movie follows the story of the possessed girl as she goes on rampage at the Catholic school, causing panic among the students and faculty.   The film also features two of the most memorable performances of the movie,  one from James Stewart and the other from Jack Nicholson.  In a few short years, "The Exorcism" has become one of my favorite movies and it deserves to be remembered as one of its kind.

But boy was I wrong. This movie is an epic and a real masterpiece. This is the first film I have seen that I couldn't put down. This film really made me feel like I was watching a movie and not a television show. I will never forget the movie and I am so glad I saw it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This was one of the better movies I have seen so far this year. The plot was a little convoluted at first, but it quickly came together and made sense. The film was told through the eyes of a police officer who works a "special" unit that investigates paranormal activity. They use the most sophisticated equipment available in the world to look for ghosts, demons, vampires, and a lot of other things. This is the most expensive movie of the year by far. If you don't want to see this movie, then do not look it up. If the money doesn't bother you, you can see it for yourself.  Helpful just be prepared. This movie is a real hoot, and there are a lot more gory scenes than most horror movies. There is also a little bit of fantasy and a few things that are not really gory at all. But for a movie about a detective team looking for ghosts and demons, there is a lot going on. The ending is a little confusing, but the movie is good anyway. I'm glad I saw this, even though it was only a $6.99 rental.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   First of all, this movie is not about a car, and it is not a movie about a motorcycle. It is a movie that takes place in a very realistic and beautiful, but realistic, world. It takes place on the streets of San Francisco, where the characters live. In this world, the streets are called "the City" because it is one big city, where people and the cars and the people of the City meet and get together. The movie is about people, about cars, about motorcycles and motorcycles and bikes and people. The City is not all beautiful, as you can see in the movie, the City is full of crime, gangs, prostitutes, drugs and corruption.   The movie is very different from a movie I had seen, and that was "Horsefeathers". It is very funny and is very clever. It has an extremely realistic feel to it. It does not feel like a movie from another world. The characters in this movie are not the same as the characters in "Hare-Eye", because they are a little different, they are more like the characters of "The Social Network", they are smart, they have good jobs and are very wealthy. They are also more sophisticated, they live in a world where technology has become a big part of their lives. They also have a family and they are very happy.  :D
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I thought I would give this movie a chance. I did not want to give it a chance because I had seen so many of these bad films. And I thought, well, this movie has some good things about it. I mean, you have a guy in a wheelchair who can't move. And he has a little girl who really loves him. And then you have the police. And they have a dog and they have to get him back to the police station. So, the police have a little dog that has to get the wheelchair back to where it belongs. So the dog gets in the wheelchair and runs over a fence and ends up in a police station and they try to get that wheelchair back. So then they have some problems with the dog and a little boy and the dog takes them all and they run away. And the dog goes to the house of a guy and they get a little kid, and he tries to stop the dog. So he gets the little boy out of the way and the wheelchair goes over the fence and goes in a pool and gets drowned. It was a little bit funny. It wasn't too bad. It didn't make me laugh. I don't think it was funny. And it was a short film. I didn't know if it was worth watching. But I thought it was pretty good.  …

The first movie to be based on the books is a wonderful movie that has a good balance of scary and fun. I love the cast of characters and the fun atmosphere of the movie. The only thing that is a little bit disappointing is that the ending was a little rushed, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. The movie does not have any real plot, so it's up to the viewer to decide what is going on. The book is very funny and funny characters make the movie so much fun. This movie is also a must-see for fans of horror. I loved this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie is not necessarily a good film. It may be a good story, but it's not a great film. The good ones are always good stories, and that's not what this film is about. The film is the story of a young woman who is traveling with a man and a young boy in a camper van. While they're driving through the mountains, the man is murdered. This woman must find a way to get back to her family, and the way she does it is by using her campervan as a means of transportation. She has to deal with being stuck in the middle of nowhere in the desert with the only two people she trusts. The way the story is told is a bit of a letdown, but the plot is solid enough to keep you interested in the rest of the film. There's also a couple of scenes with the young boy that add some depth to the story. I was a bit surprised when I saw the film was rated PG-13. I was expecting a bit more violence, but I suppose it's better for teenagers than a mature movie. The movie was rated "G" for "General Audiences" and is a direct-to-video release. The audio was a little on the tinny side, but was not bad. The movie has a great cast of actors in it. The lead was a very pretty young woman, and she did well in this role. She had a lot of charisma. The boy was a young and cute, and did a fine job with the role. The supporting cast did well, but not as well as the lead. The only characters who were good were the camper Van and the young man. While it's an entertaining and fairly good movie, it was not a good one. I'll give it two stars because the film is good and worth checking out. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good horror film with a good plot.

I really liked the way they handled the main character. She has the potential to be a great movie star but she just doesn't quite have it yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Let's be real, if you are going to watch this movie you need to understand a few things. First of all, this movie isn't like anything that you have seen before. The way it is set up, the story and the acting are all different from the normal "heroes in a far away land" movie. The first part is a little slow and it really doesn't go anywhere until it picks up. The second part has a much better story than the first. The third part has the best acting and the best action scene of the whole movie. When the third part ends, you will have a good sense of the story that was told. I really liked the third movie more than the second one. It's a different story with a different ending. It isn't perfect and the ending could have been better, but I can forgive that. The movie does have some great action scenes. There is a lot of tension and you don't really know what is going to happen. It has a really nice story and it is well directed. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat. I can see how this movie could be a great movie for people that like action and the story. The music is also good and the cinematography is great. The voice acting is great and the sound effects are also good. Overall this movie is a great watch and a good start for this year. This is the best movie that you should check out this year and maybe the best one that you will see in a while. It really does take you back to a time in your life when you really didn't know what to do with yourself. This story is a bit different than what you have heard before, but it still is a very good movie. I give this movie a 9/10. _________________________ [SPOILERS AHEAD] After a series of unfortunate events, a young boy and his mother have to move back home. He will have to learn how to deal with his mother's past, and his father's new attitude towards him. As the two get to know each other, they get closer and closer, and their love grows. The story is interesting and it goes back and forth from two very different perspectives. It is a real classic story that will appeal to many people. It may not be the most exciting story that you may have heard, but if you like action, suspense, and the supernatural, this is the movie for you. It also

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ The thing that really makes the film work is the great acting by Robert Duvall. The film is very much an action-adventure-drama but it's really a very good and interesting character-driven film. I'd like to give a special mention to one of my favourite characters, John Galt, played by Duv all the way. He's the guy who is able to see the best in everyone and who has been put on this planet because of his superior skills. He sees the good in everyone but he has a certain pride in being able to do it and he takes it to a level that few people can match. He is also a great man-killer and he is a very dangerous man. I always liked John GAlt. He was a good guy to look at. I don't know if I'd trust him with a gun, but he knows how to use it very well. I also loved the character of Tom Sawyer. He wasn't just a good character, he was a great character. I was just as shocked by the events of the film as everyone else. It was a very interesting and entertaining film. It has been called a "mythical movie" because of its influence on American culture and I think that's the right way to describe it. It's a film that was really ahead of its time and I hope we see it again. - April 21, 2008A great film
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A good movie has the ability to do what is not done well enough in other movies: it has the power to touch you, to make you feel something. The movie was made by a man who had the good sense to take a few minutes out of his life to make this movie. It's a film about the man, about the life he lived and the life of the man who has lived it. It is not a film in which the people talk; it is a film of the people doing what they do.

In fact, the concept has been around for a long time, albeit with little success. But with the rise of social media and online dating, it seems that revenge porn is becoming a more popular topic than ever before. In this new documentary, the first film about revenge porn, we follow the lives of a number of people as they try to navigate the dark world of revenge porn. As a way to try to bring some transparency to the phenomenon, we're given an inside look at the people behind these sites and the many different ways in which they attempt to silence their victims. We also meet a lawyer who is trying to make revenge porn legal and a woman who is suing her ex-boyfriend for allegedly sharing nude photos of her online.  In the film, we see how people use the anonymity and anonymity software tools that they use to post nude photos and videos of their ex-partners. We watch as
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ (If you liked this movie, you should also watch "Crimson Peak")   The film is about a guy who decides to rob a bank. He kills the guard and makes his escape, but is later found dead and a serial killer is waiting for him. After his death, he is visited by a girl, who tells him he is now a ghost. He is brought to a cemetery and has a strange encounter. He sees a girl with a ghostly face and he realizes she is the girl who died and is now haunting him. He meets a ghost who is in love with him. The movie also has a great soundtrack, with a lot of different styles.   It is hard to describe this movie as a horror film. It is more of a dark supernatural film. I guess there are some horror scenes but I think the movie is more about the supernatural than anything else. It has a few scares but is not really scary. This movie is definitely not a movie for children. It can be seen as a dark thriller or a thriller/ghost story. It really has a lot going on.   and it is a great movie, too.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ This movie is a pretty good flick. The story line is pretty interesting, the acting is pretty good, the music is pretty cool, and it has some great special effects. The only bad thing is the way the movie was made. It's kind of weird how you have an episode of "The Simpsons" about this movie, and then it's just a bunch of clips from that show that were cut together. Also the movie has a pretty weak ending, it just goes into a long shot of the characters. It doesn't really explain anything and it doesn't seem to care much about what happens. This movie does have some good action scenes and there is a lot of action throughout the movie. I was actually kind of shocked that the film was made in the 80's, it was really good and it was probably one of the best 80's movies that I've seen. But it just doesn't have enough plot to make it good. I liked the ending more than the story. This is a good film that you should watch if you like a good laugh.

It isn't too long so it won't get old. If you want to see the movie then it's on Netflix. Overall - 4.6/5

It is certainly not a sequel, but rather a follow up, and it did a good job of keeping up with the series, with a solid plot, great performances, and the usual awesome mummy monster.  But if you haven't seen the series and want to watch a good action-packed film, The Mummies is an excellent choice.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I think I liked this movie more than the first. The first one was just too fast paced, not enough plot, and too much going on at once. In this one it was all about the characters and what they were feeling, not just what was happening around them. I thought this one was better, with a better plot and a more focused story. I think it will make a good second movie. I loved the ending and what was going to happen next. I really loved the characters. The only thing I wish was different was the ending. The guy in the first one had an idea, but I wish he had made the connection to the girl in the second one. It made the ending kind of confusing. I would have liked to know who was dead by the end. I also wish the director had used more actors. He used a lot of people and I felt like I didn't get to know them all. Maybe it was because I wasn't there, but the actors looked really young and I wanted to know more about them. The ending made the movie more special because it was a good way to end the story. And the ending was great. It was unexpected and it was the best ending ever.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Love this movie I loved this movie. It's not as intense as some of the other movies I have seen, but it's just good. The film is about a girl and her father who have an argument, and then the father goes into the woods to get away from his daughter. She sees him there, and goes back to him. Then he goes to the woods, and gets killed. The daughter thinks she saw a ghost, but then she realizes that the ghost is her father. It takes her a long time to realize that the father is gone. But the ghost has been living with her for a long, long time. She tries to keep him away from her but he will not let her. I feel this film is very interesting and a good example of how a ghost can live with you for a very long time, even after you have died. I can't really remember what happened after the father left. But there were some very nice scenes where the daughter goes back into the house and goes into her room. She puts the key in the lock and says "I'm going to stay here, and no one can get in or out". I felt very uncomfortable in the house, because the daughter
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- A few months ago I watched a horror movie on television and I was immediately put into a state of terror. This movie was a nightmare to watch. The gore was unreal, I mean real. The acting was good, the acting in this movie was just the best. The music was the best and it was very effective in the movie. The only thing that was not good in this was the fact that the acting was so good. The thing is, the music was so damn good, that if you had never heard the music in this before, then it would be very hard to understand what was going on. This is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. I love this movie and this movie alone. You would have to see this movie.

This time around, we are getting a story with a great story, excellent performances, and great special effects. I'm a huge fan of the first film. There is so much more depth to this movie that makes it an even better movie. I think that the first movie was one of the best movies ever made. This sequel is even better. If you like the first Halloween movie, you will definitely like this movie. It has all of the elements that make Halloween movies so fun. The effects are fantastic, the music is great, and the performances are great. The costumes were very well done and it was fun to watch all of them. This movie will not disappoint.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My name is Mike, and I am an avid gamer. I started gaming when I was five years old, and have played every console game since then. I am now a married man, with two kids and a dog. The main game I play on a regular basis is "Grand Theft Auto" on the PS2, and on a weekly basis I play a game of "Call of Duty" on my XBOX 360. When I first bought the PS3, I knew that I wanted a "Grand theft auto" game. It has everything a video game needs. It's fun, and there are tons of good graphics. I have never played the original "Grand thief" because I was afraid I would not like it, but I'm glad I tried it because it's fun to play, and the graphics are fantastic. I also like the new "Lone Wolf" DLC. I really enjoy the story line of this game, and it's great to play with my wife. We are both gamers, and we both enjoy the game.  So, I guess it's pretty good. I would recommend this game to everyone. I'm giving it a 9/10, because I've always been a "video game person", and I really do enjoy this game.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The film follows a young girl who is in a deep depression. She has a dream where she is abducted by aliens. The aliens give her a new personality, one where she wants to be a soldier. She is sent on a mission, but it's too late. She was taken away from her friends and family and placed on a planet that she can never get back. She tries to get out and try to find her family, but she can't because of a computer system she is given. The film ends with a big cliffhanger and the title card that says, "If there's one thing that's true, it's that you can't go home again." It's a powerful ending and the film's message is powerful. The ending of this film is what the film is about. The idea that it's not enough to try to go back to the world that you were taken from. You can't escape. If you try to escape, the computer will take you away and never let you return. The alien's message of "You can't come back" is one of the most powerful moments in a film. I also loved the ending of the film. The scene where the girl is alone in a cave is the most important scene in the film, and it's the only scene I ever really loved. The fact that there is a cave on a different planet and she is alone there is what makes this film so great. The whole film is set up so perfectly. You know that this is the movie you are going to see when you open the movie. The opening scene is a beautiful scene of the girl alone in the cave. She's trying to remember her name. She doesn't remember, so she says, ""I'm not going to remember, I'm going to forget." There is a nice feeling of isolation in the beginning. The first thing that you notice is that the music is playing from the first movie. It gives a different feel to the film and makes the opening scene more interesting. I love the music in the opening sequence of this movie. I especially love the song "The Last Song". The music is just so beautiful and the message of the song is so powerful. It really makes me think about what happened in the first film. In the first part of the movie, it is so quiet. There is no emotion. The girl is just trying to forget the events that happened in her life. Then the music starts. The song makes
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  1) The movie opens with a cool scene in a small town, in which a young couple is driving a small van. This van has a large TV in it, which is mounted on the back. They are watching a movie, but the screen is in color and the film is not of high quality. After a while, the camera starts to zoom in on a girl's face, and the viewer notices that the face is beautiful. The viewer notices another thing, a small woman wearing a long black skirt and high heels walking up and down the street. The camera zooms out and we can see that she is beautiful, and that she has a beautiful voice, and her eyes are like a blue star. Then the camera zoos back in to see her face, but this time it is not the same face. The face has become ugly and the woman's eyes are black and glowing. Then a guy with a large hat comes by and throws her in a big pile of trash. He walks away, and we see a young girl looking at the pile of rubbish, and she says, "That was some trash". The camera moves to the other side of the street, and a large black man is walking past. The girl walks up to him and asks him why he did that. The man replies, "You were in the way". The girl replies, 'No I wasn't'. The man then replies, and walks off. The film ends with a girl saying, "Goodbye".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best of Both Worlds" is a film that takes a bit of a leap from the usual "Star Trek" films and creates a very original, different kind of movie.  I found the film to be very intriguing, even if I was initially a little disappointed.  The film is a science fiction/fantasy movie, with elements of horror and sci-fi, and it's very well done.  It's not a perfect film, but the elements that I liked were the elements I didn't like.  I found it a little overlong, and the ending left a little bit of an unfinished feeling.  However, I think the film was a fun, original, interesting, entertaining, and entertaining film.  A must see for all fans of science fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ This movie is very good. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I think it could have been better. The main character, Marge, is really a really nice girl, who doesn't have much of a sense of humor. Her dad is not very nice either, so it is just kind of a weird couple. This movie does have some action scenes, but they aren't very good, and the story is not that good either. It was fun to watch though. I liked the whole family, and it wasn't a very sad movie. It is very different from the other Disney movies. I think this one was made to be a family movie. I like it a lot. I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers  is a very good movie.  It is also one of the most enjoyable Marvel movies.   It has great action and amazing special effects.  It also has a great story.  In The Avengers   the good guys are able to defeat the bad guys.  They are able defeat the Ironman, the Hulk, and a giant robot.  The action scenes are great.  Thor's battle with the Hulk is awesome.  Captain America and Ironman have great banter.  Steve Rogers is a great character.  Also, the relationship between the good and bad guys is very interesting.  I also like the villain, Ultron.  He is not your typical villain.  Ultron is a genius and a very smart man.  But he is also a very bad guy.  When you think about it, Ultron is the best villain of all time.  Even the other Avengers are scared of him.  This is the only Marvel movie I would like to see with a villain.   In The Incredible Hulk , the good guy defeats the bad guy and the bad people are very nice.    They also make great use of a time machine.  Hulk and the Hulkbuster   are great as well.  The Hulk is my favorite character.   When I first read the Hulk story, I thought that it was the best story of the three.  So when I saw The Avengers, I was amazed that the story was not even half as good.  For one, The Incredible Hercules   is the better movie.   The Avengers is a good film.  After reading the first movie, I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Although the story is not as good as The Incredible Hulks, the movie does have great action.  And the Hulk's battle is great.    I will be watching The Avengers again.  Hopefully, the story will get better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sisters, the film that brought me to the world of the film-noir genre. "  -The Washington Post.  The movie was about two sisters, Annie (Mary Badham) and Helen (Doris Day) who live in the shadow of their mother, a former New York City police detective.  In New York, Helen worked as a female detective who helped out the police department.  Annie, on the other hand, was a thief and a streetwalker.  On the run from the police, she worked for a man who gave her money.  She later finds herself in a bar in Detroit, and is introduced to a young man named Bob (played by Vincent Price).  When Bob takes her to his room, he is struck by her beauty and she gives him a gold watch as a token of her good will.  Things are not as they seem though, as Helen is really a dangerous woman.  After a few days of drinking, she finds a knife in the house and kills the owner of the bar.  Helen and Bob then set off for New York where they will try to get revenge on their former boss.  What happens in Detroit in the next few days and weeks is a roller coaster of violence, revenge and madness.  Director John Frankenheimer had the idea of making a movie that would show what a bad life was like for a woman in a bad city.  He knew that the audience would sympathize with Helen, but would hate her sister.  Frankenheimer was given a huge budget by the studio and he made his film using only 16mm film, using a crew of 13 men and two women.  His camera would roam around the city and shoot at night.  "The most shocking and graphic of the New York films is in this film,"  The New York Times  wrote.  It was a tough picture to make.  They were trying to make a realistic picture.  At the time, that was a very hard thing to do.  Many of the women were too beautiful and they would look fake.  Then again, they were on the run.  Most of the people in Detroit were either criminals or working class people who had no way to defend themselves.  So when Helen was in the bar and looked like she was just out to have a good time and steal, people were drawn to her.  This was a great way to portray how life was back then.  However,

He was so happy when he married the woman that he had dreamed about for so long, he just can't believe that the woman he married is not the same woman he had fallen in love with. He thinks she is so beautiful, so charming and so innocent. It all seems so perfect for him. But she turns out to be the very woman that destroyed his world and his dreams.

The cast and crew do a great job, I just wish they were better at portraying this sort of story.  , it's a nice, easy to watch movie, but the characters feel very generic and not very likeable.

They are so bland and boring that it was hard to connect with them.  the plot had a lot of holes, which is very typical of a horror film. , the camera does a good job of keeping the focus on the characters, but they never seemed to be very convincing or interesting.

The detective is very interested in the woman, who has a long history of working for a news agency, the only one in town. She was a reporter at the time of the murder and also at the police station.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a pretty good movie and it is one of the best ones I saw in 2013. The movie is based on a book by Michael Connelly that was published in 1996. The book is about the famous boxer and a girl that he fell in love with while he was fighting for a championship. The story is about how he met her, how she ended up dying, and how she was the love of his life. I think this movie is pretty good and is a great example of how you should not let yourself be controlled by the media and the world around you. This movie is a good example of what a real relationship is like and how you shouldn't let your mind run wild with the things that you see on the news.  You should have a life and be able to see the good things in life and the bad things in the world. This film is a nice reminder to everyone that you should think before you speak.  If you like it, share it!

The plot is well thought out and you can tell that the director and writer had thought out everything to make it a masterpiece. The special effects are excellent. I think this movie is one of the best made. The movie takes place in a futuristic world where the planet earth is destroyed by the forces of evil. It takes place during a time of peace where a group of brave people have been searching for a way to fight against evil. The people are: a man, a woman and a child. They search for a means of destroying evil using the most primitive of tools. When they do a strange and unexpected event happens which results in their being separated. A young boy who is the only survivor of the incident goes on a journey to discover who he really is. He finds out that he has no father, mother or any other relatives. His journey begins in a strange, alien looking world. The story is very clever and has a strong plot line. It has amazing special effects which is quite impressive and a good story. The director and the writer have made a masterpiece which I think people would love.

It made you feel that you were really in the middle of a war. This movie was made in WWII, and it looked like it. The action was fast and furious. It had lots of cool weapons and vehicles. I liked the fact that it was made after the war. The characters were very realistic. I found the movie was very well written. I wish that it had been made before the war was over. I have never seen a movie like this before. It has a lot of action, but there are some really good scenes in this movie." - The American Moviegoer "If you are a fan of action movies and war movies, you will not be disappointed in this one." - Movieguide.com "This movie is well-made. It's got a lot going on and you can tell that there was a lot that went into making this movie. The actors are all great and you really get to see the war in all its chaos. There are a lot more scenes than just war." - A Star Is Born "There is no doubt that this is one of the best war movies ever made. There's a lot happening, and the action is just right. It is a war movie, but it is not an action movie. There is a lot in it that isn't in most action movies, and that makes it a lot different." - Star Wars Fan Movie Reviews "The film shows the whole range of human emotions. The film is filled with a sense of humor, which is often missing in war movies. There were a lot funny scenes and it was very good to see." - Classic Movie Magazine "It's not as fast-paced as some of the other action movies on this list, but the action and story are still pretty darn good. I loved the characters and the movie overall. There aren't a lot new things in this, but that doesn't make it any less of a good war movie." "War is war, and when you see it that way, the action in this film is just amazing. This film is a great example of how great action can be." - Film-Cinema.com
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ "We'll make you a star, you and I." - Bruce Willis, 'Lethal Weapon' _________________________________________________ A few years ago I saw 'Mud' at a local theatre, I didn't know what to expect, it wasn't a movie that I would go out of my way to see. After watching it I was surprised at how well written the film was. The acting was great, there were some great performances and the cinematography was beautiful. The film tells the story of a man who becomes a real estate agent in the 1950s in the middle of the Great Depression. It starts off slow and has the look of a documentary. The story is about the man who is looking to buy a house and wants to get some information about the house from the people living there. As the film progresses, the house becomes the focal point of the story. The house is a real place that is still occupied. The man has to find out what was going on in the house at the time of the fire and the story takes you back in time. I found the story interesting and I was fascinated by the characters that were created for this movie. The best part of the movie was when they showed us the house through the eyes of the people who lived there. I think this movie is a great example of how to tell a story without using the typical Hollywood methods of making a movie. If you have never seen a movie like this, I recommend it to you. It is a true story and it is very well made. _________________________________________________________ 'Lone Survivor' ________________________________________________________________________ 'LONE SURVIVOR' is a story of survival. A young man (Mark Wahlberg) is taken by the Taliban and thrown into a prison in Pakistan. There he is held captive for many months by an American named Mark Wahlburg. Wahlborg escapes his cell and goes on a mission to rescue his friend. The movie has the feeling of an action film with some realistic elements to it. It has a good plot and is well acted. Mark Wahnberg has great acting ability and the movie has a great action sequence. This movie is one of those movies that you just want to watch over and over again. _____________________________________________________________________ 'Unbreakable' __________________ "It's not over until they say it's over." - Tom Hanks, 'Unbroken' ______________________________ "A very good film." - Paul Giamatti
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When it's good, it's great." I'm not sure that I agree with that statement. It's an interesting film but it just doesn't have any heart. This film was a total waste of time and money.  The actors were pretty good and the script was good. The actors didn't do anything with their characters and the story was predictable and boring. I had forgotten about this movie until I watched the documentary on the making of this film. It was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The following are my notes on the movie "The Wicker Man". The movie was filmed in 1974 in a small English village called Sislington and is based on a novel written by a Norwegian writer named Robert Siodmak in 1877. The film is about a family that goes to visit a nearby cave in search of a cave woman. The movie features some good acting, good performances, a few original songs and some really scary scenes. The story is interesting, with some very creepy scenes that are not so much about the cave people as about the mother and her child who are lost. There is a lot of mystery about the film and about the events that happened in the cave. The characters are interesting and the atmosphere is excellent. This is one of those movies that is best to see when you are alone. It is also a very scary movie, which will leave you thinking. It's a good choice if you like films with very creepy characters, but it's better to see the movie in a dark room or if you want to watch it in a theater with good sound. The special effects are also good and are pretty convincing, which makes the scary scenes even more frightening. A lot of scenes are based on real events. A scene that has to do with a murder is based off a real murder that happened near Sislingen, Norway. The director has said that he was influenced by a book by Robert E. Howard called "The Hound of the Baskervilles" (1890). The director is Robert Eggers (A few years later he would make "In Bruges" about a Belgian crime-solving detective). The Wicker Woman is based upon a short story by a German writer named Hans Christian Andersen, who was a well known author in the 19th century. The Wicket Woman is one story in the Andersen collection "The Little Mermaid". It is a very good film and I think you should check it out. It can be watched as a stand-alone and can be also seen as a movie within the film. The score was by an American composer called Leonard Cohen. There are many different versions of this film. I believe that the one I have is the best. I really liked it and would recommend it.  The following are some of my favorite films that I have written about:  A young woman who was pregnant is brutally murdered. In a desperate attempt to save her child, she leaves her home, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  ______________ is a terrific action film that is fun to watch, although it doesn't take much to get the feeling that this film was filmed on a shoestring. I was pleasantly surprised by the action, although I did find myself wishing that the film had more of a visual flair and that the actors would have more time to do their own stunts. The plot is very simple, but it is effective in its simplicity. There are some great set pieces in the film that keep you on the edge of your seat as the action is so intense and the characters are so well developed.  If you like action films and you like to see well-developed characters that are more than a bit silly, you will enjoy this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Sister' is a movie about love, but not the usual kind of love. It is a love between two women who live in the suburbs. They meet at a party. The women have a strange attraction to each other and they are very attached to each others' bodies. The first thing they do is get married and then they have a child. They do not want to be together, but the fact that they are married gives them more power and they do not dare to let it go. The second thing is that they want to start a family, but they cannot because of the fact they do something bad to the children, which makes them feel ashamed. They have to take the child back and they can not live with this guilt. It has no happy ending, but it is worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** ********* ************* *********** ******** ******** - This is the film that started it all for me and I have been going back to it time and time again. A great love story between a guy and a girl that is not about what happens in between but about the love between the two of them. I was watching this movie with a friend of mine and he just kept saying "oh my god it is a good love story." and "it is a great love song". I can't explain how I felt when I heard it for the first time. There are moments when I felt sad for the two and others where I felt happy for them. The story of this film is just so good. It has everything to offer. From the cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting and the story. I have never seen a movie so well told. The love story is so strong and the cinematographer of this movie just nailed every shot. The only thing I felt it had left out is the romantic scenes between the main character and the girl. I felt that it was the most important part of the movie. However I am not one to complain. The movie is still worth a watch. I am definitely going to watch this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   I didn't really like this movie, and I'll be honest I was expecting a lot more.   In this movie I don't feel like the main character was that interesting. I don'  I don't really see what was so great about the film. It was pretty dull, and there wasn't much of a plot. It's a pretty long movie too. I could watch this movie all day.  It's a bit too much to put it in words. This movie has a lot of action, and has a good story. I just wish that the movie wasn't so boring.  .  , I thought that this movie was a lot better than the first one. The second one was a bit annoying. The first one was pretty good. It wasn't very funny, but it had a good action, I think the action was better than in the second movie. I think that this is the first time I see a movie that has a nice storyline, but then just shows it. The plot didn't feel very good. This was one of the few movies that was a really good, but also boring movie. The movie had lots of action but also very little story.I really don't like this new version of the Spiderman franchise. This one was really boring, and the action scenes were really dull. I didn't like that Spiderman was going to go after the Green Goblin. I really don' like that they made Spiderman look like a robot. I'm not a big fan of that look. I thought the movie had a better story. This isn't really a movie you should watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has some of the best dialogue of any movie I've seen. This is the film that made my wife and I watch this movie.  The entire movie is about the three brothers.        I'm going to do a quick summary of the movie. The movie starts out with the three kids having a sleepover.     The three kids are three years old.                                                        The three kids, the boys are named Andy, Joe, and Max.    Andy and Joe have a special friendship.  The first night the three boys sleep over, they are all in a bad mood.   The three boys try to figure out what they are going to eat that night.  They decide to have the pizza and a burger.          Max goes to the bathroom and gets his penis out.  He takes a picture of it and puts it in his locker.  Max goes back and asks Andy if he is going to tell anyone. Andy says that he is not going to, and he goes to his room.  Andy is not sure if he can go back to school the next day.  This is when he gets the idea to have his brother Max help him out. He asks Max if he has a pen.  So Max tells him that he doesn't.  Then Max tells Andy that he has his penis.  When Max says that it's a small one, Andy asks if it's real.  Now Andy is trying to figure how he can help Max get rid of the penis. Max is not saying a word.  And that's when he thinks of his friend Max. The three brothers, Andy, Max, and Joe are sitting in the living room of their house.  Joe tells Andy about the things he does at school.  His friend Max is sitting in Joe's chair.  That's when Joe tells Max that he knows his brother Joe and tells him to come over to the house. Joe tells him he can come and eat his pizza, and they can talk.  Later on, Andy goes into Joe's room and asks if Max is there.  There is a big smile on Joe's face.  Finally, Andy is so excited that he tells Joe that he thinks Max is going out with his girlfriend.  Next day, Max comes into the house and tells Joe and the boys that his girlfriend is gone.  At

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** **Good movie, not bad at all.** I loved this movie. I was amazed by how well the story was told. There were a lot of details in this movie that I haven't seen in a movie before. This movie is very well done. There are a lot more scenes in this film that I didn't know about. The movie is a good look into the life of the boys. It really makes you want to know more about these guys and their family. I also thought that the movie had a great soundtrack. It has a good mix of songs that are very enjoyable. There is a lot that is going on in this story. I don't want to say too much but I do want to mention a couple of things that were interesting about the movie. The first thing that came to my mind was how amazing it is to see how people can change and change very quickly. The characters have all of these good qualities but they are also just as much trouble as they are good. I love how they are constantly trying to fit in and how they all have to be accepted for who they are. These boys are just like us. They want to do good but are not very good at it. The only thing that they can be good at is getting themselves in trouble. I loved how this movie showed us the good side of all of us. I thought that this movie really helped me understand what it was like to grow up and be young. This is a very good movie. It's not bad and it's not great. It is just good. The ending is great and will definitely stay in my mind for a while. ***** *If you don't have any idea what I am talking about then watch this movie.*

'Took 3' gives us a much better and more interesting story than the one in 'Takes' 2. There is a lot more to this story. The actors are amazing, the plot is solid, and it is not a bad action movie. It takes some time to get going, but once it starts, it is a very fun movie. I will definitely go see 'Taker 3' in the near future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Knew Too Much"  is a great example of the best and worst of 1960s and 70s New York. It is a story about a New York detective, Harry Hole, who is on the trail of a crooked detective named Jack Lister, and it is all based on a real case. But the movie is not about the real case, it is about the story behind the case and how Harry Hole becomes a hero. Harry Hole was a talented cop in the 60s, but as he became more and more involved in organized crime he was losing his taste for what made him special. He was trying to fit in with the mobsters and the crooked cops and he was doing so with a lot of drugs and alcohol. He fell in love with his beautiful and manipulative partner, a woman named Mary Bowers. Mary was a woman who always wanted the attention, and she never had the chance of that in her life. The two had a wonderful relationship but the relationship started to fall apart when Harry decided to try and be the good cop that Jack Listers was. They were on a mission to catch Jack Liscen on murder charges, but Jack Lissers had the same case against Harry that he did against Jack and his partner, and he wasn't letting go of it. Harry, Mary, and their partner, Frank Tarnov, were on the case to catch the wrong man, and they started making enemies along the way. It was a story of a broken man trying to be the hero, and the best part about it is that it was about the love and the life of a woman. The movie is about Harry and Mary's relationship and their love for each other and the friendship that they shared, and how it was all about their love of life. It isn't perfect but it is a good film that shows what love was about and what it could be about, and that is something that every man should know. Watch the movie and see if you want to be a hero and try to save a woman's life, but if you don't, you will see how much you love her. The Man Who knew Too Much was made by John Sayles and it was produced by John Frankenheimer and Charles Band.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ _______________ __________ ____________ _____________ ___________ _________ _________. Here is a review of the movie I have seen (I'm a big fan) ________. The movie is set in an American village during a war. The village is mostly occupied by the Germans. The Germans are very cruel and ruthless. The villagers are divided between the people who live under the protection of the Americans and the people living under the control of the Germans, the latter being the more brutal. One of the German soldiers, who is being treated like a slave, has an accident. When he comes to the village for help, he is taken away from his people and taken to a place of torture. He is put in a big cage and there is no escape. The cage gets destroyed, and the soldier escapes. He goes to a town, where he finds a small girl who seems to be his sister. She tells him that he has to leave this place and go back to the country, where there are a lot of other soldiers like him. The girl, who also happens to be the sister of the one who took him away, tells him about a castle in the country where there is a man who is able to help him. This man is known as "The Prince". She tells the prince that there is some terrible evil man in the castle who wants to kill him. After that, she tells the man who saved her to take the man and the girl to the castle and kill them. She is able, thanks to the prince, to reach the castle in time. The prince tells her that he can help her in the task, but that he needs some other people, one of whom he knows very well. The man is named "Mr. Blue" and is the one she wanted to see. Mr. Blue tells the girl that he was a child in the same village as the girl, and that he and the prince are friends. He also tells the princess that she must go back in time with him. She agrees and they travel back to a time when she was a young girl. The princess has a dream about the castle where she meets Mr.Blue. She also sees some beautiful women. Mr Blue tells her about the evil man who wants her to be killed. The evil man is a magician who uses his powers to control people and bring about destruction. The magician was responsible for the death of the princess' father. When the princess asks
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I'm not one for horror movies, but this one really made me think. _________________  The first time I saw the film was in a theater during my college years. My friends and I decided to go see it on the last day of the summer vacation, so we drove up to Los Angeles to see a few other movies. This was the only movie I saw during that trip. I don't remember what the movie was called, but it was either some horror movie or something that was a parody of some kind. The movie was a little weird and a little hard to figure out. We thought it was a bad movie, but we also thought it might be funny. So we kept watching, and eventually got to the point where it was clear that there was something wrong with this movie. We had seen it so many times before, and each time, the scares and jokes got better and better. It got to a point where we were laughing at the stupid jokes, and when we finally realized what was going on, it was just too much to take. I remember saying "this is just too funny", but the guy next to me just kept laughing. He thought the movie went too far. But it was too good to stop. It was one of those rare films that made me laugh out loud. If you ever have a chance to see this film, you must see it. ____________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************  I had seen this movie when it came out in the 90's. It was a fun little movie and I still love it to this day. It is very unique, fun, and has great story. I am sure this is the first movie you have ever seen that is about a vampire. It's also a good action movie, and I really like that it's based on a vampire myth. I love how the story has so many different characters. The vampires, and the humans who help them, have such great personalities. I like the way the vampires have a bit of humanity in them. I also like the vampires who are very intelligent and they learn to use the supernatural powers to help them live. I really liked how the vampires had no sex drive. They all want to be a part of each other's lives. They always come back to the same place for their rituals. They do not want to die. They want to have children and live forever. The ending was very satisfying. I loved that the movie is about love. It doesn't have any romance, but it is about two lovers who are constantly searching for each other. This is the best movie I've ever seen.

I think it would have been better if the girls would have had a more romantic storyline but I guess that was just too much for the director to take. I was a bit disappointed that the story didn't involve more of the girls, but I can't really blame the director since the script wasn't too well written. The girls really just exist to give the film a funny storyline, which they do quite well. I also think it's funny that the movie starts with a girl who has a bad reputation and is never going to get the man of her dreams.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** Love this movie **********  This movie is a must watch and the best comedy film I've seen.  The film is very funny and at the same time very dark and depressing. The story of this film is told in two parts, the first one is about a young man, who after the death of his father, who was a soldier and his mother was a teacher, he comes to a village where he gets a job as a servant. The first thing he finds out is that his father was killed in an accident and his stepmother is now the wife of a rich man and they live a life of luxury and comfort. He begins to grow up in a very big house and the only thing he thinks about is his new job. He works hard to earn enough money for the house to pay the bills and to help the family. One day he discovers a book which has a lot of important information and that's how he discovers that he has a certain power which he can use to solve all his problems. He decides to use his powers to be a good father and he becomes very good at it. He becomes very smart at his job, but he is not perfect, and sometimes he gets the feeling that his life has not really changed at all and he's just repeating the same events over and over. He still gets his good mood by doing something nice for other people, but one day he meets a girl named Rose who tells him that he's the one who changed her life. She explains that she had a lot problems and she thought she was lost. After some time she met a person who could help her, she found out that the man was a witch and when she came to him he made her fall in love with him. They started to live together as a couple and they became very happy. However, one day Rose's father dies and she is left to deal with all of her feelings and she starts to lose her mind. She starts to drink and to smoke pot and when he learns that Rose has started to use drugs, he starts to think that Rose is the only person in the world who can help him. However when Rose uses magic to cure her, he realizes that Rose can help the whole world, so he decides to give her a job in a bank. He tells her that he wants to have a good family but he also wants a good bank, and he gives her the job of a secretary. A lot of people are scared
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It is the most beautifully shot film in years." 1) The Thing (1982) The Thing is not only the best movie about a man-eating alien, it's also the first time you actually see an alien in a film. It's an excellent horror movie. There are some great moments in it. There's a very cool, very cool scene when a scientist is explaining how they're trying to figure out how an alien can use a mirror to kill people. It looks very good. There were some other very good scenes in it as well. But this is the one that really stands out. The scene in which the creature is first seen is pretty damn creepy. The way the creature reacts is also really cool. This is a very solid, very fun horror movie that should be seen by everyone. I would even give it a 7 out of 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Dictator" is a film about the Nazi era, and the role of the Jews in that time. The movie shows the Jews as victims of the Third Reich. It shows how the Jews used their power and their wealth to get revenge on the Nazis. It also shows how much the Jews hated the Nazis, and how they tried to kill them. The Jews are portrayed as the real heroes of the film. The film is well-made. The actors are good, and there are not many actors who are not very good at acting. This is a good picture for all of us. This movie is a great example of how the Jewish people used their money and power to destroy the Third World. This picture should be watched by all of our children, and it should also be seen by the politicians who use our money and influence to make war and make the world a worse place. "The Great Lie" was made by Steven Spielberg, and "The Day The Earth Stood Still" was the first film he made with his brother, George. Spielberg's film, which has a special place in my heart, was made in 1962. The picture has many elements that make it a good film: a very good performance by a young actor, a good story, a great ending, and an amazing soundtrack. "Day" was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It is a classic film. There are many people who have seen it. I have seen this film, and I think it is a very well made film. One should also see "Munich" by Alfred Döblin, which was made after "Day." In "Muncie," the Jews are the real villains. Many people know "Alfred Dö blin" because of his picture, "Einstein," in which he played the evil Einstein. In "A German Christmas," he plays a Jewish villain, and he is a horrible person, a very bad person. He is a criminal. He was the leader of a Jewish criminal organization in Berlin. He committed many crimes, and they killed people. He murdered many people. In this film he is portrayed as a real evil man. I think this movie should be seen. I know many people have seen "Munt" before, and we should also watch it. It was directed in 1933. It has many people in it. There is a scene in which a woman is raped by a Jew. In that film, the woman has
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________   The first time I saw The Exorcist, I didn't understand what the movie was about. It was all over the place and the ending was a bit of a disappointment. I didn?t have high expectations but the second time around I got it. The movie is a good adaptation of the books. The story is told in a linear fashion and has a strong theme of a family being in a mental hospital.   In the beginning, we get a good sense of what we are going to see. There is a woman named Marion who has just gotten out of a mental institution and has been committed to a mental institute. She is in a committed relationship with her father who has lost his job and is about to be evicted from his home. He and Marion are in a serious fight over his money and his son and they get into a physical altercation. It is a beautiful scene but as I say, it is about Marion and her father. The scene is told through the eyes of a nurse named Mary who is tending to Marion. We get to know her and her relationship with Marion through her conversation with the psychiatrist. Marion is the main character and we get to understand her as a person.  , The movie has a really nice sense of style. The camera angles, the lighting, the costumes, the special effects are all very good. The only real problem with the movie is the ending. There are some scenes that make me cringe. It?s not the ending that I would have chosen but it is not something I will watch over and over again. I understand the movie and the themes but I just didn? t get it. I don?t know if I?ll see the movie again but I think I?d recommend it to someone who is looking for a good horror movie.   , The ending was very well done. I love it when a movie has an ending that makes sense and isn?t over the top. I will recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good, scary movie. It would be perfect for a Halloween movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  (review of free movie)  review by: J.W. on Feb. 12, 2010 :  I was looking for a movie to watch, as my kids wanted to see the new one. This was what I was looking. I've seen other reviewers say it is hard to get into, but they are mistaken. It's not hard at all. The plot is simple, and the characters are all likable. If you like movies about kids, then you'll like this. If not, then there are many other good movies out there for you to check out. It was also on cable TV, which was a plus.  This movie was not that good, but it wasn't bad either. The music was great. It could have been a lot better, but this movie was just for the kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A movie I was lucky enough to see last year at a small movie theater on the outskirts of town. I had no idea it was a musical and even less knew it was going to be a smash hit. This is the story of a girl who is the love of a dying father and a guy who is a little older than her but in love with her. They are in the same band and they go through a lot of hardships together and the end of the film we see the two of them as they grow old. This film was a hit with everyone. It had so many wonderful moments that I found myself crying as I watched. It was a real tear-jerker that kept me on the edge of my seat. I found this movie to be very touching and I can only imagine how many tears were shed throughout the world as people watched this beautiful film. I would definitely recommend this movie if you have not seen it before.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My friends and I watched this movie on Friday night, and I think it's the best thing that I've seen so far in 2014. The film is pretty much a family film, with a little bit of romance. It's basically a comedy about the misadventures of two sisters who find themselves in a situation where they have to take care of an elderly man, a retired cop and his family. This is where it starts to get a little dark, since we learn that the man has a history of violence and the sister's mother died when the man was a child. This leads to a situation in which the sisters have to save their lives, while at the same time trying to make sure that the old man doesn't hurt them, as well. In the end, the sisters save the man, and at the end of the movie, we learn about the history of the man's life and that he was a police officer. Overall, this was a fun movie, and the story is well told.

It was very difficult to make a decision about the movie as we watched. The film has been made a bit too short, and in the last minute of the movie, there is a great deal of violence. But there is enough violence to keep it interesting. This is a good film for a family audience. - September, 29, 2009A great movie  Review: A Great Movie, but A Good Movie A Great film for family viewing. I have been thinking that the film is a bit short. In the last 5 minutes, there are a few brutal scenes. However, the story is still very good. This film should be made into a series. The story is interesting and the acting is good. The only bad thing about the film was that it is not as exciting as the rest of the films. However it was well worth the time it took to watch. - August 31, 2009a great movie, but a good  Rating: [4 of 5 Stars!] A Great Film, but Good Movie I have never been a fan of the film "Jaws" but I enjoyed this film very much. The acting was very good and the film has a great story line. It has many scenes where you can see and hear some pretty terrible things. However the violence is a little over the top and the ending of the story line was a little confusing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* My husband and I watched this movie in the theater. We went in on a Friday evening and sat right at the end. The movie started and we were not even looking at the screen. I saw that it was about a man and his dogs and they went in a very old house and I thought I would watch the movie. I could not believe how good it was. The dogs played like they were part of the family. They were all there. They would look at each other, and then they would look back at us and lick each others noses. They had a special bond. The man and dogs were very good friends. The old man was so sweet and friendly. I thought he would be my hero. We watched the movie until it was over. When it was all over I could feel his heart pounding. He had tears in his eyes. I was crying too. I told my husband that I could have been that man and that his dogs would have been my heroes. That is what made this movie so great. My husband told me to watch it again. This time I sat right in the middle. I wanted to tell the man what a good friend he was and how he would have loved me. I think that it would be fun to have a dog in a similar situation. We are both excited about the possibilities.  I think that this is a good film that is well worth watching. My son loves the dogs and the story. I also liked the old man who played the role of the friend. I like the dogs.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************************   I love this movie. It has a great cast of people. It is not just about the story, but also about the characters. The main character is a really nice guy, he is likeable. He has a good relationship with his mom and he is a good son. The mother is a bad woman. She is the one who makes the mistake of giving the son a gun. The son has to go out in the field and kill a man. The story takes place in the first part of the movie. The man is a very nice guy. He does not want to hurt anyone. But he does not know what to do, and he gets into a situation. He needs to kill someone. He thinks the man has a gun and he shoots the man. That's the story of this movie and that's the end of it.   The next day, the boy comes home and he does what his mom wants him to do. He shoots the person. The boy is a hero and the mother is evil. The father is not there. I don't know who this father is, but I know he is not good. The movie ends with the boy being at school and his dad is there with his brother. The brother is a pretty nice guy and he likes the boy. But the father is very mean to the boy, and they fight.  , in the beginning of the story. But, it changes and you see the boy's family and friends. The family is a family of three, and the main character's family is like that. The wife and the son are both very nice. The daughter is not very nice and does not like her father very much. The grandfather is not the best of people, but he is kind to his granddaughter. They are good people. The parents love their son and the boy does not hate his mother.The main character and his mother have a very bad relationship. The mom is a terrible person and the husband hates his mother for what she did to his son.The story takes a turn and changes to the father. He is a nice person. He really loves his wife and son. He tries to be a good father. But in his family, there are two people who do not want him to be there. He cannot be there and his son hates him. The grandson is not that good and he doesn't really like the mother very much either. But his grandfather does not really like either one

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The film is a very good comedy, that takes a good look at life, love and death. I can't help but feel that this film is more of a 'happy-to-be-in-a-movie' movie. I don't see much life in this movie. We have a bunch of friends going to a party, but they're all in their 20s and it seems like they're only here for the fun. The best part of the movie is when they're drunk and their friends try to talk to them. They're not even in their prime, but this is what we like. But when the party ends and the guys are alone in their room, they start talking about sex. The guys are talking about the girl they met that night and how she looked good. It was pretty obvious that this guy was looking for some action, but the girl had no interest in it. After all this talk, the guy pulls out a knife and begins stabbing the girl. I know, it's not very dramatic. It's not even like they are having sex, they're just talking about it. Then they start to fight and it ends up being a pretty funny scene. I've seen this movie maybe 5 or 6 times, but I was never really into it. This is my only complaint about this movie, but that's it. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and it's great to see these guys getting more attention than they deserve.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________  I just finished watching this movie with my husband, and it was very well-done. I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that makes me cry and laugh at the same time like this. The movie has a real sense of danger. The story is about a couple who is trying to sell their house. The seller is having a hard time selling it, but he keeps saying that he'll find a buyer, but the real problem is that the buyer doesn't want to buy it because he has a bad history with it. The real problem, however, is that he can't afford to buy the house. He has a lot of problems with his credit. The husband, of course, can't help him because he's working for his credit score. In the end, the couple finally find the buyer. The buyer has to sell the house quickly or he won't get the money he needs to get out of debt. This is where it gets good, though. The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't focus on the wife's problems. The wife is very competent and does what she needs to do to get the house, and even helps the husband when he's in trouble. She just can't seem to stop crying when the house is in trouble and the real trouble is the realtor who wants the house at a higher price. The problem is the seller, and the problem is how hard he is trying. The house is really going down the drain, and he's being sued by the buyer for not letting the seller sell it in a timely manner. The couple makes it through the movie and the house sells. This movie really hit me in a way that I don't think I've seen before. It made me laugh and cry at the exact same time, and I was very impressed by the movie. I think I'll definitely be watching it again. I just wish that it had a bit more of the humor and some of the romance. I thought that the romance and the humor could have worked together better. I also thought that it could have used a bit less violence and a bit of a different ending. It was very interesting to see how a realtor and a couple can make a successful real estate transaction. Overall, this movie was a very good movie. The plot was good, the acting was good and the story was good. It just needed a little more of everything. It's a good flick that you should see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film was not so good as I had hoped. The acting is poor and the story is very bad. The story is so bad that even the people who are supposed to be "characters" (in a movie) don't do anything. They just stand around and look at you. The ending is very unsatisfying. I felt that it had to be an after-thought because the movie had been so bad and it would have been so much better if it had started out right. The last ten minutes is where the movie was great and I wish it could have continued. The movie also features a lot of bad acting. I was really disappointed. I would have given this a 3.5 if it was good. I gave it a 2 because I still think it's a very bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________ "Caught in the act" (1986) "I was about nine or ten when I was first introduced to a TV show called 'Law and Order'. It was the show where the police show up to solve crimes. They would arrest suspects and take them to a courthouse. In the courtroom there was a large set where the real trial was being held. There were two TV cameras in the courtroom and a crew of reporters. They took this opportunity to film the criminals and to show the court what they were really like. The first thing that struck me was the quality of the cameras. The camera operators were professional, the lighting was spot on and the actors were really good. I watched this show over and over again and always thought to myself that it would be great to be a prosecutor. That's how it happened. "The show would always start with the camera crews going to an arrest scene and then going to the courthouse to film. It was always the same, they would get into the car and drive off and then come back to the scene. Then a prosecutor would be sitting in the backseat talking to a lawyer and the lawyer would talk to the suspect. The prosecutor would give the defendant a little speech and then ask the suspect what happened. The suspect would talk about how they were tricked into the crime by a woman who they had been seeing for a while. The police would then come in and arrest the suspect." - Jameson Miller, "Catching a Crime", by Mark A. Landon, p. 7. I know this is the "first episode" but I want you to imagine the scene with the cop and the DA in the car, driving off, the DA talking to the guy, and then getting back into the vehicle and driving off. It is not just a "first scene" but a whole episode. There is a lot of filming going on here and not only the camera crew but the cops and the cameras are all over the place. It shows that the show is very serious. This scene is just one of the many scenes that is used to show how serious the show really is. This is a great scene. I wish there had been more like it but it is a good one. I like this scene because it shows that a DA's office is very different from a police office. The DA's car has a "scoop" window. You can see that the guy is very nervous and scared,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The story follows a couple who move into a new apartment and soon find out that the apartment has a strange smell. The apartment is actually inhabited by a woman named Nell, who doesn't speak English and has a very strange way of living. She has strange habits and loves to sit in her own blood. The story moves along with the couple trying to figure out how to live in a strange and mysterious apartment. The film is a pretty dark film but it doesn't really try to be funny. The movie is more about the characters trying to adjust to the strange way Nell lives and her peculiar ways. Nell has a different mood and personality each time we see her. Her mood is always dark and sinister. She hates her husband and often goes out of her way to cause trouble for him. The two of them have a long running argument and often end up fighting in the house. Nelly has a few scenes of sex and sometimes her boyfriend even takes part in it. The couple ends up having sex after the fight ends and the scene is a little odd but the film doesn't make a big deal out of it. I felt that the film needed more sex scenes in it but it was ok. The sex scenes were pretty well done and they made the movie even more bizarre. The characters are really creepy and weird in the film. They aren't really likable but they are not likeable either. N.E.R.D. was a pretty good horror film and is a great entry to the horror genre. _____________ If you like: _____ __________ _______________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I'll be honest, it was a little hard for me to watch this one. I was expecting something different, something with more of a "noir" feel, but it was actually much more like " The Shining ". The movie was very dark, but the visuals were so amazing that I couldn't help but to enjoy it. It is hard to describe it, but I really did enjoy it, and the acting was excellent. I loved how the film was set up with the "real life" version of what happened to Jack, and how they really tried to make the film as realistic as possible. I also really liked how the movie really shows how bad Jack's condition really was. It was very difficult to watch, but very enjoyable in the end. I recommend this one if you are looking for something dark and interesting." I had a great time at the theater watching this movie.  I thought it was interesting and I loved the way it was set in the 70s.    The story is very interesting, I don't know if it's really as dark as I expected it to be.  The acting was great, the script was great.  I can't wait to see the sequel, I am hoping they go with a different ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  This movie had so much promise. But it just didn't deliver. I found the characters to be one-dimensional and unrealistic. The action was boring and predictable. I wanted to hate the film, but it didn't feel like a big deal because it had the same problems that other action movies have: the story didn't develop, the characters weren't real, and the actors didn't give any performances. This film is not the kind of movie you will enjoy for the entire movie, and that's not a bad thing. But I would like to see this movie again for the character development and the performances.

I've had it on my wishlist for a while now, and the fact that it came out so late in the year really sealed the deal for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ __________ What we have here is a movie that is really good. The writing, the directing, the acting... it is all there and the movie is great. I loved this movie and I love the characters. I think it is the best film of the season and it really was the perfect ending to a season that was so good. I really love this movie. If you are a fan of the "Fargo" series and want to see a different take on the story of the same character and his life, then I think this is it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movies are The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, which was released in 1927, and The Wild Bunch, released in 1969. They were both made in the 1930s.  In The Good, Humphrey Bogart was a rough-and-tumble private eye who was hired by the city's law department to track down a gang of bank robbers.    Bogart played the role very well and was a good man trying to do a good job.    I had the opportunity to see this movie on TV when I was in high school.  I liked this movie very much, and have watched it a few times.  The Bad :  This is the movie I like to see in theaters the most.  This is the first Bogart film I saw.  In the beginning of the movie, I thought I had seen him in a lot of films before, but I was wrong.  Bogart's performance is superb, and he plays the part very well.  He doesn't use his body like a tool, but instead shows that he is a man.  His face and his eyes convey emotions that you don't see.  At the end of the film, I was very sad that the plot didn't end the way I had hoped it would.  A film like this doesn't need to have a happy ending.  However, The Good  did end on a very happy note.  It was very exciting, and was fun to watch.  And, it is a great movie to watch with a good story.  So, I think that this is my favorite movie about law enforcement.  There are many films that have great plots, but this one is different.  Even though this movie was released during the 1930's, it still holds up, and is still entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wolfpack" (2005)  is a fun movie to watch and one that I recommend to all the people who love action movies. The movie is about a group of boys who are all fighting in a sport they invented called the wolfpack. It is very interesting to see how these boys fight together. The story is pretty good, I like that the movie is a little bit different than most other action movies, it has a different tone and a little more violence. The fight scenes are good and the movie has some really cool scenes. The soundtrack is good as well. The characters are pretty good aswell. It doesn't take much to see that they are all very likable, and I liked all of them, even the villains. There is also some very good action scenes, like in the last scene where one of the boys kills a guy in the woods. I think it is a great movie. It has lots of action, great character development, great music and a nice cast. If you like action movies and want a good story, I think you should give this one a try.

This is a film that has a great story line, great performances and amazing special effects.  The film is great.

I liked the story and the actors all had different parts in the movie. It is a bit old but the movie has a freshness and it is well worth watching. I like the sound and it was great to see the guys and gals in action. The special effects are good and it shows a lot of action. You have to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  A nice surprise to be found in the trash bin of a local movie theater, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is a very funny and very well made movie that has much to offer. The story is simple: a retired general and his wife are travelling through Spain on a train when Don Quiks, a traveling entertainer, comes to town to entertain the general. Don Quijote is captured by the general and forced to serve as a traveling dancer. The general's wife, a rather pretty young woman named Matera, is attracted to Don Quicque and begins to fall in love with him. The film is shot with a very distinctive and colorful style that captures the beauty and majesty of the Spanish countryside. The music by composer Ennio Morricone is very good and adds to the charm of the film. This film also stars Emilio Estevez, a real movie star of the time. I found it quite hard to watch the film as I found myself in Don Quique's head a lot of times, but the film was definitely worth the effort. Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends. I love it when a film is a perfect example of how a film should be done. This is a fantastic film and an excellent example of the type of film it should be. It is a story of the love and struggle that comes when one man, who has lost his faith in God, turns to his friend to see if he still believes. This film is definitely a must see for anyone that has ever felt lost in the midst of life and the meaning of it all. - April 10, 2006Good movie  Reviewer: niklax - favorite favorite favorite - March 8, 2006  Subject: The best film on the subject The movie is based on the book "The Gospel According to St. Matthew" by the great St. Anthony of Padua. It's not that good of a book but it's very good to look at.   The film has been called a "mockumentary" and that's not far from the truth. It has a very good production value but that's about all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** I am a HUGE fan of the "Star Wars" movies and I think that the last three movies in the series are some of the best films ever made. I can remember watching the original trilogy at a very young age and being enthralled by the characters and the story. I was so excited to see the prequel trilogy and I loved them too. So I was really disappointed to see that the new trilogy did not live up to the old trilogy. The movie itself is not bad, but the story was just too slow. The prequels were so great, and I really wanted to see them all again! I am really hoping that they do a new trilogy, but I don't know how the studio will be able to pull that off.  A friend recommended this movie to me and I just couldn't believe how many times I was laughing. There was no dialogue in this movie and it was just all of these actors talking and moving around and it just made me laugh so much. I just loved it. It was a great action movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are funny and not cheesy. The story itself was just funny and the plot was a little confusing at times. But it was still funny. I would definitely recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "There is no such thing as a bad picture. All good pictures are good, but a great picture is a great thing. It is not a picture which merely tells you what it is like to be happy, but one which makes you feel what it means to be sad. It shows you how a great deal of human suffering is caused by people who would rather be alive than unhappy. It tells you that life is a bitter game which a good deal of people lose. It teaches you the fact that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, because it makes you careless. It makes you too ready to believe that the way to avoid trouble is to be sure you know what it really is like. It has a great and terrible lesson for all who would like to live more pleasantly and enjoy life more fully. It should be required reading for all young people who are in love. The man who does not see this film is like the man who has never seen a sunrise. He may say that the picture has nothing to teach him, but I think he would be quite wrong. I think it should be compulsory reading for every man who wants to live in a world of peace. I am sorry I have not had a chance of seeing the film in my own country. I have only seen it once, and that was at the theatre in Rome. I thought the picture was excellent. The first time I saw it, I felt a great disappointment. I was sure it was a bad one, but after a few minutes I thought that perhaps it would not be such a bad thing after all. I did not realise at that time what it meant. It was the first time in my life that I had ever seen anything which so completely filled me with a great feeling of compassion. I felt that this picture would make a better world. I found it impossible not to think about it. I remember that when I went to bed the next night I was really so tired that I thought I would lie down and just go to sleep. I must have slept for about five hours, for when I awoke the next morning, I was so happy that I could not help crying. I don't know what I expected to find, but it seemed to me that all the bitterness and suffering in the world could not be worse than this. I saw a great happiness in that picture which I had never seen before, and I was very sorry that I couldn't make the film sooner. It made me think of that
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A great film. It's a bit long for a horror film, but it has a lot of good scenes. I didn't really like the main villain (I think he is a bad guy) but he is very funny. There is also a great supporting cast. I think that the only thing that bothers me a bit is the music. The music was not so great in my opinion. It was good in the first half of the movie, but when the movie was over the music was kind of lame. There was one part of the film where it had a nice song and it was very nice, but the rest of the time the music sounded a bit off. Overall this is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The film opens with a young man (David Aames) at the end of his rope. His brother (Cameron Cuffe) has just died and he's trying to make ends meet. One day, he finds a piece of his brother's torn up jeans and takes it home. There he finds the jeans have a message that says, "It is good to die young." The young man begins to dream about a little boy, who he names Johnny, and what he thinks he sees is the boy in the jeans. After Johnny's mother, Alice (Carrie Fisher), dies, she's buried in a little grave. A few years later, a group of young men come upon the grave. They're looking for the man who left it. They eventually find Alice. She tells them that Johnny left a note saying, "He loves you. I love you. Come back." The men take Johnny and bury him in a garden. The next day, they wake up and see the garden is gone. The men then realize that Johnny is gone and that the garden was just an illusion created by the boy's imagination. Johnny has come back and is now living in a town in the United States called "Doom." The town is a hell hole. Johnny is now known as "Duck". The town's leader, Duck (John Candy), has just been killed in a plane crash and his body is lying in a shallow grave. Johnny wants to become a policeman. The townsfolk, who are all afraid of him, don't want Johnny in their town and are looking for him to kill. Johnny doesn't care. He has become an outcast. His life is not very good. Johnny meets another outcast, Mr. Big (Robert Loggia). He is the owner of the local bar and the only one who believes that Johnny has some redeeming qualities. They become friends. The two men go to a cemetery to see the grave of their friend. There, they see that it's just an empty grave. Then they see a small boy, dressed like Johnny, lying on top of it. It turns out the grave is actually a man's body. The boys go to the police to report what they saw. The police take the boys back to the grave and they discover that the man was in fact a demon. The policeman who found the body thinks the boy is Johnny and says that he's not just a boy but a man. He calls

It had the potential to be a great film, and was a nice change of pace from the normal action-packed movies. The only problem I had was with the acting. A lot of the actors were terrible, and I think that is because they were used to acting opposite the best actors in the world, and were not used to playing against people who were not of the same caliber as them. But that is a minor complaint.   Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0.067 ticks Play Current Date Light Locked Medium Locked Next Play Last Play  Fullscreen This is a modal window.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I love this movie. It is a love story. They are both good friends, they get married and they have a baby. They decide to move to another state because they don't want to raise the baby with them. One day while they are in a shopping mall, they run into a stranger who offers to take them back to his house. They accept and get married. They then decide to take the baby on a road trip to find a new home. On the way they meet the mother of the baby and she gives them the baby. One of the best things about this movie is that it shows the mother and her husband's relationship. It shows how they care about each other and how they are like brothers. This movie has an amazing plot and it gets better and better. If you are a fan of the movies and you have not seen it yet then I suggest that you do. It will change your life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _______________________ What a fun movie. _______________ ______________  No movie has been more popular in the United States than The Godfather Part III, and its popularity has not been helped by a number of myths, myths that have taken on a life of their own, and are now used to justify or deny the film's status. One of these myths is that the movie is "anti-Semitic," which, of course, it is not. Another is that it portrays the Mafia as a cohesive group, which is also untrue. This myth has come into being because many in the film industry and in the movie industry press have been influenced by the Mafia's efforts to portray itself as a unified force and have used this movie as an example of the Mafia doing exactly that. These myths have also been used to defend the Mafia and its victims against the charges of collusion that have been made by the movie's critics. I have been asked many times by those who are critics of the movie why I did not take the time to watch the film and compare it with the Mafia mythology. The answer is that I did take the trouble to watch it, but I did so with the intention of showing you what the movie actually showed. I did this in part because I am concerned with the accuracy of the documentary and I wanted to do my best to show you the film as accurately as possible. In part I also wanted to point out that the film was not intended to be a fair portrayal of the people in the Mafia, but that the people who were in the mafia were the real characters in the story. I also hope that this film will serve as a warning to the people of the United Sates and to the movie people, and it is that last part that I hope will help to dispel the myths. The Mafia is a myth. The film shows the true character of the members of the "Mafia," which is a group of people who are not united, but who are all fighting for the same thing. The movie shows that this group of criminals, as they are known, have been the victims of a conspiracy of their peers and their enemies, and that the whole of American society is conspiring against them. The people of America, who are the real heroes of the film, are the people fighting against the Mafia. This movie is about one man and his fight for freedom. This is about a man who is fighting to keep the people he loves safe. The real heroes in

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** **Loving the hell out of it.** ***************************** I saw this at a small movie theater in a small town and was immediately hooked. The story was very simple, but the acting was spot on. The lead is a woman who is having an affair with a man she is dating, and she wants to go to his house so she can have sex. As she is driving there she gets a call that the man is not at home and it is time to go. She finds a way to go there and meets him. She asks him to show her around and has sex. She wants to leave her lover and goes to her apartment to think it over. She goes to sleep. Later that night, she gets up to go back to her lover's apartment. He was not there. She gets there and finds out that he has been murdered. Her boyfriend was the killer and she was the one who killed him. It was very obvious that this was a premeditated murder. The killer and the victim were friends. This is a great movie to watch with a group of friends. The sex scenes are not as good as in the trailer, but it still is a good time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Beautiful Mind is a wonderful film that is a good example of the classic Hollywood "brainiac" movie. I'm a big fan of the movie, and it's a very entertaining movie, but it does have its faults.  For starters, it's very slow-paced and not at all exciting.    But then, this is the type of movie that I love: it has a real scientific and technical element to it.    There are several examples of great scientific thinking that are portrayed in the movie.  I'm a fan of both this movie and the other film that I mentioned above, The Secret of NIMH.  I can see why these two movies were made and why they were successful: they were science fiction films that dealt with some very complex issues in a way that is easy to understand.  The main character of A Beautiful Mind, Alan Turing (played by Keir Dullea) is a brilliant genius.  This is an interesting story about the life of a great mathematician, and there are some real twists and turns in the story.  At one point, Alan is sent to a mental hospital because he is suffering from what is thought to be a mild case of Asperger's syndrome.  After a few months in the hospital, he is able to return to his work.  But then he realizes that he has changed and becomes very depressed.  He then begins to question his sexuality and sexuality is not something he had a great deal of experience with in his life.  As the story goes on, he begins to realize that he is a woman trapped in a man's body.  In order to save his life, he undergoes a sex change operation.  When the movie first begins, there is some confusion about whether or not this is real or not.  It is not until the second half of the film that the audience really gets to see how much of a genius Alan Turing really is.   The main story of the two movies is the life and times of a brilliant mathematician who is gay, but in real life, this was not something that people thought of as a big deal.  If this was a real life situation, it might have been more accepted by society, but the story was very controversial at the time and the topic of homosexuality was never really addressed.  One interesting aspect of the story is the fact that Alan never really admits to being gay.  We never see him admit it

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I've seen this movie many times, but I always thought it was an okay movie, but not great. I think that the only reason it is considered great is because of the soundtrack. It's the best soundtrack ever made. But it is not that amazing. I liked it when I saw it again because it is different. It is not like any other movie I have seen. I don't know why this movie is considered good. The plot is not the best either. The story is like a fairy tale, but it is like the fairy tale where they only want to get the good guy in the end. I do not know why the director wanted to make this movie. It would have been better if he had made a different movie with more of a horror plot. This movie is a nice watch, but you should not expect much from it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie. The story line and acting was excellent. The cast was all very good. There were no plot holes and everything worked out. There was nothing bad about this movie and it was very well acted. There are lots of action scenes and you can't go wrong with this one. The movie was great. I loved the movie. I just don't understand the complaints about the acting and story line. There's a reason it was nominated for an Academy Award and it's because of the cast and director. I'm going to go on and on about this film. You don't have to have seen the movie to know this one is good. It's got action, romance, and a good story line that doesn't go over your head. It doesn't get too preachy. It does a good job with it. It also has a good cast and the director is great. The movie will definitely make you go "wow". It's a good film and worth a watch. What is this movie?  It's "Rashomon". The story is the same in the movie and the book. It is a tale of a samurai who is sent to assassinate a samurai. The book was originally published in 1869. The film was released in 1951. The author of the book, Isao Takahata, was a good writer. He wrote the film version after a book was published in 1959. It was also a good book. The original book was about a samurai named Tomoe Gozen who was sent to kill a samurai and the only way to get the information from him was by killing his brother. The brother didn't know the truth about the matter and was trying to get revenge. This movie was written about the brother. Isao Takashi's version was much better. He took the story from the book and wrote a movie about it. In the book there were lots of murders, murders, and murders. In his version, you have one murder. When the movie was released it had a great reception. People loved it. They loved the acting, the story, the acting. People thought the movie had a lot of action and didn't really get into it. The reviews for the movie were good. The critics praised the acting of the Japanese cast and some of the movie scenes. They also praised the cinematography. There is a scene in the film where a guy shoots a guy in the head and the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ _________________________________________________________  It was like a dream come true when the movie was announced at the Cinema Paradiso last night.  I saw it at the cinema after a long time. It was a great surprise. The film was very impressive. I really love the performances of the actors. I liked it very much.   It is a very good film. I don't want to give it a 9 because it has one too many mistakes. It is not as well written as in other movies. But, this is not an anti-film. This is a story with great ideas and the story is very good.   the film has a very strange ending that is very hard to understand. I think that the director should have told us a little bit more about it.   "If the film is about a man who has the power to make people fall in love with him and become his lovers, then I think this movie is about nothing more than a man trying to achieve this goal. It would have been better if he would have stopped after the first date. But then, you would have seen a movie like 'Evan Almighty' and you would be able to see what a wonderful guy he is. You would have thought that he was the biggest star in the world. That would have made the ending a lot better. But he goes on to become a very big star and it is the story of his life that we will never know."   I'm very glad that I saw this movie. I hope to see it again soon.   and a final note: I am very impressed with the movie "Gravity".   The movie is amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ The movie is set in an unnamed town and tells the story of two families who lived there. The first family was a typical American family, but the other one is a different story. The family was the very poor and very corrupt. The mother had no idea of the importance of her children and treated them like a pack of dogs. She would have even killed them if she could have, but her husband would not let her. She and her husband used to go on a very long trip and spend the nights in a very old house with a terrible smell. The husband would go to work very late and never return. The children would run in fear from the horrible smell and the mother would abuse them. When one of the children was born the mother had a miscarriage and the baby died. The other one was born and was also abused. In the beginning of the movie the mother was trying to escape from the house by getting the children to do her chores and do her housework. The two kids would run into a small room in the house and would hide there and wait for the mother to come home. Once the mother comes home she would make the kids wait for her for some time. When she comes she would use all her strength to punish the kids for not doing their chores and beat them severely. The mom would use a very nasty and strong kind of force to beat her kids. One time the mother made the kids take a bath and she used a very strong and nasty kind of torture to make the children cry. The wife was very sadistic and would abuse the husband too. One of the sons had a very bad ear infection and the mom made the son do the housework in his ear. This boy was in terrible pain for two weeks. Finally he managed to get rid of the ear infection. When the son was ready to leave the mother used a really horrible kind of torturing on him. He was made to sit in a cold cold room for a long time. He would sit there and would not move for a very very long time and then he would be made to get out of the cold room and run outside. The son would run to the house crying. The next day the son ran back to the cold cold house and died. This was very horrible and a horrible story. Another son had a serious illness. The sickness started and then it was so bad that he was not able to walk or talk for a month. The parents did not give any money

It was great and was the first comedy I saw. The actors are really funny and it was just a great movie to watch. I think it is a great family movie and a good one for people of all ages. I was so excited to see it. The only thing I wish was a little bit more was a few more scenes. It would have made the movie better. But it was a great fun movie for adults and kids. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh.  Reviewed by James H. from I love it This is a very funny movie, which is why I loved it so much. I have to admit I have watched this film many times and loved it every time. This is the first movie I've seen by director Peter Sellers and it is very well made and very funny. I love this movie. - The film is very funny and very well-acted  - A good family movie for kids, but I do recommend this for those who want a good funny movie  Enjoyed it a lot!  Great Movie!!  Thank you for the review  I really enjoy it.  the movie is very good.  of course I will be buying the DVD and I have already picked the best place for this movie to be released  This is a movie that you just have to see.  to me the movie does not start off with a bad start, but it has a good beginning to a good end.  is it a good idea to leave a kid alone in a movie theater?  Well I do not think so. .  The kid is going to be a little nervous and nervous children always are.  in my opinion the movie would not have been good without the kids being there. I really enjoyed the kids in the movie. I enjoyed watching them and watching them laugh. they were always smiling and laughing.  and I am not a big fan

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. It was an okay movie. I wouldn't say it was a great movie, but I think it's pretty good. The characters are all great, the story is okay, the director knows what he's doing and doesn't give it any unnecessary hype. I really think the movie has a lot of potential. The first 15 minutes were okay. They didn't really go in depth into the movie, which I didn't mind. The movie isn't bad, but it doesn't really have a strong message or a solid plot. The film didn't have a big impact on me. The only thing that really stuck out to me was the part where they show the old man getting on the train. The old man's eyes were filled with tears. He really seemed to feel sorry for the woman who was crying in the background. That scene really made me cry, and it made me really happy. The next few minutes are the best part of the movie. It really gets good after that. It had a lot more to it than just a train chase. It also had a really good plot that was well-paced and well-done. I'm glad this movie was made, because I know a lot people are going to be disappointed. I don't think the director really wanted to make a movie about the train chase, but the movie was the best way to go.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Big Lebowski " (1989) A great movie that has a lot of great ideas. I would have loved to see more of the Dude's side of the story.  What I liked: The plot, I liked the idea of a man who is a millionaire, who is now living in a small apartment, and his wife.  He gets fired from a job he really doesn't like, he goes back to his old lifestyle, but has a hard time adjusting. His wife is a hardworking, and sweet woman. I loved the way the Dude tried to be "cool", but just wasn't that into it. I also loved how he would be like a little kid, when he was a teenager. He was always trying to be the man in the house, and do things like go to the bar, or be in a band. He also got a job as a janitor, because he's really good at his job, and he got paid well. The main thing I liked about the movie was that the characters were well written.  I liked how the characters reacted to each other, and the way they interacted with the Dude. The only thing I did not like about the film was the use of the word "Fuck" in a few scenes.  What could have been better: I wish the Dude was more into the plot, but I really liked the movie, and I think it would be a good one to watch for people who like a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Feb 13, 2016 | By Matt Ahern  You won't find the most expensive or the most talented film makers in the movie business in the "majors," and the most successful "film people" in Hollywood are the independent film makers and not the majors. The biggest "movie people" are not studio executives, directors, writers, or actors.  "The people making movies aren't the people who are going to make a movie," filmmaker Robert Rodriguez said during a recent interview with Vulture. : I don't want to say this as a critic but there are so many directors and actors in Hollywood who don't care about the craft of filmmaking. They just want to make the money. There's so much money in the business right now, there are actors who don`t care about their craft, and directors who donít care. ...  But there are a lot of filmmakers, directors and screenwriters out there who are very talented. There are a couple of guys that I'm working with right now who are a little bit more serious than the rest of us, but they do know how to make something that is cinematic.  of the genre is "the type of movie I make." "I don't think there's a bad movie that comes out of the independent community. There have been some movies that have been a little less than good, but if you put your mind to it, you can make good movies."  : What do you think about the state of the film industry?  I think it's a really good time to be an independent filmmaker. It's an exciting time to make movies. The internet has made it easier for us to get our work out there. I think there are good independent filmmakers out there, and I think we've been lucky. We've been able to stay on the cutting room floor and make things that we're proud of. We just finished a film for Sony that was a great film, and it wasn't a commercial film. It was a story that we wanted to tell, and we made a film that we were proud of, and people are going crazy for it.  the genre, there's nothing that is better than a great thriller. It feels like it has a lot more depth and life than a lot a Hollywood movies. I'm proud of that movie. It has a great story
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ What happened to the good old days of the 1970s, when Hollywood would make movies like this, and Hollywood would pay attention to the quality of its product? The studios are so scared of making movies like The Green Mile and The Magnificent Seven that they'll just make the most awful, crappy, cheap movies they can find, and the public is not going to notice. You think we're kidding? Just look at what happened with this movie. This is the same director who made The Great Escape, and The Good, the Bad, and Ugly, and who directed the last movie they made that I was happy to see on the big screen, The Fugitive, which is about a fugitive who tries to get home. This was the same actor who played the role of the fugitive in The Fugitives, and also played the fugitive (and a few other parts) in The Manchurian Candidate. This time around, we get the role played by Richard Harris in that movie. Harris plays the bad guy. I have no idea why this guy was chosen to play this role. The only good thing about this movie is the song. The song "I'm a Man" is not as good as it should be, but it's not as bad as it could have been. It doesn't have the same "man-in-the-middle" situation that is present in this movie, but that's okay, because it isn't really the movie's fault that the song was not as well done as it probably could have. If I were to pick a film to show to my daughter, this is probably what she would watch, and I'm pretty sure she would love it. If you're a fan of the movies in this genre, you'll probably like this movie as much as I did. If the music in this film was better, this could have made a good action movie, which it should have, but there is nothing wrong with this film. I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ "I had no idea what to expect when I first heard the title of this movie, I was expecting something more similar to The Great Escape, but I found that the movie is much different from that. There is no action at all in this movie. This movie was all about the family. I thought the movie was good for a good family movie and I thought it was very funny. I think this movie is better than the first one I watched and I think the sequel was even better. I don't think this is the best film that made me cry but I think it is one of the best family movies I've seen in a while. This is a movie I will remember for a long time and I hope to see it on DVD. This film was great." - R.E.M.  I just wanted to say that the film is awesome. It is a very sweet story about a family of five who are separated from each other for a week by a storm. They are eventually reunited after a few days and they discover that their parents are not at home and their father is in a terrible car accident and died. They have to go on a road trip to visit their relatives. As a film this movie has the good things of a family movie. The characters are well developed and the film has a nice story to tell. The main reason I gave it a 5 is because it is very short and because it had the story that I would expect from a movie like this. The story is very simple and the characters are not very well developed. The film was definitely enjoyable to watch but I feel it could have been made a little longer. Overall, I am pleased that I saw this movie and hope to watch it again. - Review from M.F.    "I was not sure what to make of this film at first, but after the first few minutes I was hooked. It was very heartwarming and I found myself laughing and crying at the same time. It made me feel a little bit like a kid again. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone. I am a little disappointed that it was only rated a 4, since I felt it could've been rated much higher." - J.B.  in a recent review, another reviewer has stated that the ending of the movie wasn't really that good. I disagree with this. I really enjoyed the ending because it showed the family's reaction to what they are going through.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ The plot is pretty straight forward. A group of guys are out camping in the woods when one of them, a guy named Ben, decides to shoot an elk. They head back to camp, where Ben is confronted by a local woman, who has been hired by the hunting lodge to kill the elk, and who claims she saw it in the distance. The lodge leader has a plan, and he is going to use the woman to lure the elkwang out. In the meantime, Ben is being held prisoner at the lodge, and is threatened with a knife by a hunter who is also a member of the lodge. There are some great performances from the cast. There is some really good suspense in this film. I really like that it has some action scenes, and the violence is not as gratuitous as it can sometimes be. It has a lot of heart and a good sense of humor. Overall, this is a great little film, which will leave you with some great memories. I highly recommend this film to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  I really enjoyed this movie and I think this will make a great Christmas gift for my son. I enjoyed this so much that I took my camera and went to take some pictures of the train when I saw a guy trying to run down a group of people in a car. I stopped the car to stop the guy, and when I was about to do it I heard someone yell "Get the hell out of the car". So I just let him get out of my way, and he ran right into my passenger side window. It looked like he was about 7 feet away from me, and as I looked at him he kept moving closer. I got out of his way and said "You have to get out! I'm taking pictures of you!". He kept moving. So I told him to get down, and then I shot this picture of him getting down.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   A good movie that i would have loved to watch more of.   The first hour and a half was ok but then the movie became a bit too slow and boring for my taste. The story was not interesting and it was just another excuse for the main character to go through his life.   the movie also had a lot of stupid dialog.   I guess the director wanted a more "cool" look but i think this movie would have been better if they just did a comedy or drama.   of course it was great when the hero was in trouble but there was also too much time when he was in a nice position. I guess i am spoiled by the tv shows of the 90's.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _____________  1. "The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas" (1933)  2. "Funny Face" (1959)  and  3. "A Dirty Job" (1968)  in which a black man is kidnapped and held hostage.  4. "Good Times" (1965)  "Good Time" is a great example of how black films were allowed to develop and mature. The actors, directors, and producers were all black and the film was shot in black and white. The music was also black and there was only one black person in the movie, which was an extra. The black man was played by the actor Don Johnson, who was also an early example of a successful actor of color. It was a major movie in the 1960's that made a big impact. Sarandon's performance in the film is brilliant. She plays a tough and determined woman who is not interested in a relationship with a black guy. Her main reason for leaving him is that he's a thief and she doesn't like the way he talks to her and the way his hands move when he speaks. She's right. Johnson's character is a bad ass and he is not afraid to show it. His dialogue is laced with racial epithets and his performance is intense. He is not just a good-looking guy, he is a very bad ass. "Good Time's" title track has a great chorus that is equal parts angry and romantic. "Don't you worry your pretty little head/You're never going to get the girl/Don't try to play me/Don' t try to fool me/I know you like white girls/You'll never get the job" is just a wonderful way to express the black woman's frustration and anger at the way she is treated. The story is a simple one. An African American woman is held captive by a gang of white men. The only way she escapes is by stealing the gang's car. The car drives off in the middle of the night and she is picked up by a truck. Her kidnappers force her into the back of the truck and take her to a black neighborhood. There, they beat and rape her. She makes a run for it but the gang catches up with her and brutally kills her. Her body is found on the side of the road, covered in blood and wrapped in a sheet. The police arrest one of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Big Lebowski - a fantastic movie in every way - from its witty dialogue, to its beautiful music and acting, to the great visuals and sound design. I saw this at the age of 17 and it has remained with me to this day. - December 15, 2005Awesome  Reviewer: zackd - favorite favorite favorite - December 14, 2005  Subject: good but not great... I'm pretty sure I saw the big lebowski at least once, maybe twice, at the theatre that opened in the 80's in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a little movie theatre that was the only place to see a film. The place was packed with people and there was a lot of drinking going on at the time. It's just a small part of a larger story that is just too long to tell in a movie. The guy who plays the bowling league pro in this is a guy who has lived in his house all his life. He's just out of high school and is trying to get into a bowling league. He has no friends because he doesn't care about anyone. He doesn't like girls or boys. He only likes bowling. The bowling league guy is the main character in this movie. He is an absolute asshole and he has no sense of morality whatsoever. He can't even tell a lie. He'll just say anything to get his way and everyone he meets will be on his side. It really is a good looking movie. You will enjoy this movie if you like an entertaining comedy. - January 14, 2006good but not much more  Rating:   I'll add that I saw it when it came out on VHS and I still remember that day. My dad owned a VHS player at the house and this was a staple in his library. I didn't have a DVD player but I was able to borrow it from my mom. I also have a copy on VCD that was given to me at my high school. I watched this on VCR and it is definitely worth watching it again. It is a movie that I remember fondly. - November 23, 2005I'll Add That I Saw It On VHS  Rated:   in a few years.   This movie was released on VOD a couple years ago. I think the DVD and the VCD are available on Amazon now, but I'm not sure. It still holds up pretty well and it's still a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're Going To Hell (1947) is a fantastic film about the rise and fall of the American Nazi Party.  It is also a film that is very relevant today.  You're going to Hell (47 min.) is an anti-Nazi film that shows us the horrors of the Nazi era.   In this film, the main character, George Murphy (George Sanders), is a man who is in love with a Jewish girl, Ruth (Jeanne Moreau).  The film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, who is best known for Psycho and The Birds.  The film was based on a novel written by Alfred Landon, who was a member of the SS.  A good part of the film is filmed in the same style as the novel, except with some of the most interesting shots ever filmed.  You're going To Hell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Screenplay.     Alfred Landon also wrote two other books on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.  I found the film to be one of the best examples of a film being about a group of Nazis, and then showing us how they react to the horror of what they are doing.  In the film, you see how the Nazis, both in Germany and in America, have been trying to hide the true nature of the Holocaust and how the killing is happening.  This film shows us how the people of Germany and America, as well as the French and British, are trying to fight back against the Nazi Party and the Nazis.    You'll also learn the true horror of the Nazis in this film.  They are portrayed as monsters.  While the film was not as well-received as Hitchcock's other films, it did make some great films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a movie that you can really enjoy. The story was interesting, the actors had great chemistry with each other, and it was a fun time watching a bunch of people having fun. It was definitely a good time. I think that if you're looking for a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, this is the movie for you.  If you're not a fan of comedy, then this may not be the movie that's for you (and it might be for some people), but if you enjoy comedy, and you like the idea of a comedy movie with lots of laughs, this should be a movie you can watch with a group of people that are into it.  I'll be honest with you, I'm a little bit disappointed in the ending.    It was kind of a let down.  If you know anything about the movie, then you know that the ending was going to be something.  It was something that was going on in the movies in the 80's and 90's, and now it's just kind of an old movie.  I thought the movie had so much potential and that there was something good to come out of it.   The ending was a little disappointing to me, because it made me think that they could have gone a different way, and I don't think that's a good way to end a movie. The Rating:  This movie is definitely worth watching if you like comedies, or if you have a few friends over, or just if you want a good laugh with your friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The story of the movie is about a girl, who wants to make a man's life a better one. She is a woman with a very special talent. She can see a man who is about to do something he will regret, and she knows what is about...   When she talks to him, he thinks about her, he wants to do more for her, but he is afraid of her. She knows he is too much for her.   At the beginning of the film, we see a scene of her at the gym, when she works out with a man. The man tells her that he has had a dream about her. When he is done working out, he goes to see her and is scared. He asks her to go home with him, but she says she wants to stay with him. The guy asks her, "Why don't you just let me touch you?" She says, "Well, that's a lot to ask."   This movie is good for girls, especially girls who are in a relationship. They can see how a man is not the only man who can love her, and that a man can be a great man to her. And the man who was with her at that gym is not only the guy that she loved, but the guy she can count on, the guy who she is going to make happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  This film has been a long time coming. It was initially meant to be released in the spring of 2009 but was delayed for over a year due to the release of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe". This was a shame since it would have been great to see the sequel that never was. In the meantime, a few people managed to get a copy of the film and made a couple of great short films based on it. The film was produced by Sam Mendes and he and his partner Paul McGuigan had already been working on a script for a while and they were looking to get some people involved to help bring it to life. The people involved are: John Simm (producer), Ben Stephenson (co-producer), Stephen Fry (coordinator of publicity), Paul McGuiganson (screenwriter), Tom Baker (actor), David Suchet (actor), Tom Holland (actor). This is a fairly young cast and the producers have tried to make sure that there is some new blood in it. However, the best thing about the cast is that they have all made some great films together: Tom Baker and David Suchenthe are both veterans of the "Doctor Who" series and David's other works include "The Day of the Doctor", "Borgia", "Dalek", "The Deadly Assassin", "Doctor's Wife", "Blink", "A History of Violence" and "Babylon 5". He also co-wrote the script for "DoctorWho: The Eighth Doctor" which came out in 2011. In addition, Tom Holland was also in "The Night Manager" and has done quite a few films, including "I, Daniel Blake" and the "Holliston" movie. I know that the film is a bit of a departure from what Tom Baker has been up to recently but I think it will be an enjoyable film. Heath Ledger is the star of this film and I believe that he has been the best actor in the world for the last five years or so. He is still great in "Interstellar" but I'm really looking forward to seeing how he does in this. His performance is also a big reason why the film looks and sounds so good. This is the first movie I have seen with Ben Stephenson since he has retired from the industry. He wrote the screenplay for "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

As they are sent on a dangerous mission to steal the plans and expose the evil project, they find themselves on a collision course with Obi- Wan's former Padawan, Ahsok, and his rebel group of Jedi and rebels, led by the legendary rebel pilot and former Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The stakes couldn't be higher, and the result will shock you into a whole new perspective. When you think you've seen it all, the stakes rise dramatically as you are confronted with the most unexpected of heroes. As you learn more about this new group of rebels, you learn that the Empire may have created a force far more deadly and deadly than the ones we have faced before. The original Star Wars trilogy and all the movies in the original Star War saga are combined into a single cinematic experience that is both faithful to the spirit of the films and completely fresh and original. The film is shot in a beautiful, new, and more realistic way. The special effects are stunning and the story is rich with action, drama, humor, adventure, and surprises. Director J.J. Abrams brings the best of both worlds: the rich characters, complex themes, and spectacular special effects of the classic Star Wars films, with a modern look that makes the movie a pleasure to watch. The music is excellent and the performances are strong, particularly from the main cast. This movie is truly a must-see for Star Wars fans. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "I really loved it!

Director/writer Paul Schrader is a man who has dedicated his life to making movies, but he's not just a writer; he's a teacher. He's also a father and a grandfather, and it's this connection to his children that he has used in many of his films.  (His first feature film, "The Last Picture Show," was based on a book by his son Daniel.) He's a man with a deep connection to the story of his son, and he uses that in "Good Will Hunting" to get us to see the child we've always known through the eyes of a grown-up. . The most interesting thing about the movie is how it uses our own assumptions about what a parent should look like in a child's eyes. As the father, Martin Sheen, says, "When I look at a child, I look through them, not into them. I see them." We're never told how old Martin Sheen's child is, but we know he's about Martin Sheen and that's about how the child is seen by Martin Sheen. He has a child. It's never explicitly said, but it's obvious: He looks at a boy. And in a way, the father-son relationship is even more complicated than a typical father-daughter relationship: the son knows he is loved, but the father isn't sure how he feels about that love. This is a movie about two people who are very close, but who are struggling to be complete. Heather Graham plays the father of the child who will grow up to be Dustin Hoffman's character, but she is the one who has to watch the child grow up. Her father doesn't know how he's supposed to be a father, and she's not sure how she feels about it. (The child is played by the great Tom Cruise.) But she's never seen as a child; she's seen as the father.

I feel like this movie is really realistic. It gives a real perspective on life. The movie also gives you a lot of information about what is going on in the city.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ This movie was great. I thought it was good for a couple reasons. One, the character was great (even though I felt like I was watching a movie that could have been made by a child). He was an intelligent, funny, well meaning man who was in love with a beautiful girl, only to have her get away. Then he tries to find her, but he can't. Then we get into a love triangle that is not as simple as it seems. The acting was great and the story was interesting. It just made me want to see the movie more and more. And the ending was really good. I loved it. It was not a happy ending.

I'm always a fan of the original trilogy, and the prequels are great, but this was a nice change of pace. The story was interesting. It was hard to tell where the story ended and the action started, but there was enough in the middle for a decent movie. If you like a good sci-fi movie and can get past the original films, then this one is worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ ______________ _______________ _________ _____________  The film stars a bunch of very cool characters who just happen to have a very special talent. The film is a mixture of comedy, drama and science fiction, and the characters and their unique abilities are really well done. I am glad that this film is not a typical science fiction film, but instead something very different. The actors are all very well developed and seem to be able to make their characters work in any situation, and their special abilities make their roles all the more memorable. I loved the character of the engineer, who has a very unique ability of creating a time machine. The other characters in the film are all so good and really add to the overall quality of the film. I especially liked the scientist, who is a great character, and I would like to see him appear in more science fiction films. The story is interesting and really makes you think. It is hard to decide if it is a comedy or a drama, but I prefer a combination of both. This film was really well made, and there is a definite suspenseful element in it, which I really enjoyed.  I give this film a 4 out of 5 stars. The movie has a good plot and some good character development, but it has some pacing problems and some scenes are slightly confusing. It has a great special effects and some great special effect scenes, but at times the movie is slightly confusing at times. The action scenes are really good, but there is only so much you can do with that kind of thing, and it would be nice to see a little more character development in these scenes. The special effects are very good and they really made the movie seem like it was filmed in a science fiction world. It was a fun movie, and worth a watch. I highly recommend it, and will definitely watch more of these kind of films.  The movie was rated PG-13 by the MPAA. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Breathless" is a film that I've never seen in theaters. It is available in IMAX, so it is possible to see it in theaters if you are able to get tickets. This film stars John Cusack, John Hurt, and Paul Walker. It was released on July 12, 2009, and is the first in a trilogy. "Breathe" is about a man named Jack, who is living with his family in a small house in the country. Jack's brother has a violent temper, and one day, Jack and his family take refuge in the attic. When they hear noises upstairs, they rush to the attic, only to find their father's body in the closet. Jack, who had been estranged from his family, is now in charge of the house. His daughter and her mother come to visit him, and Jack is unable to hide his emotions. He is also having trouble with his wife, who wants nothing to do with the house and its people. The acting in this film is great. John C. is so much more comfortable in this role, and John Hurt's performance is also really good. When John C is in a room with a group of people, he is able to convey an immense amount of emotion without being obnoxious. Paul Walker's character is also very likable. Walker is the perfect match for John Hurt in this movie. This film was also well received by critics. It had a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 4.6 out of 5 rating. It earned $11.5 million, which is good for a small film. It also earned $14.6 million from 35 international territories. Breathing's story and performances will likely be remembered for years to come. It deserves to be seen. 2.

It's a story that follows the life of a great scientist who works on the project that will bring back dinosaurs to life. The story is told from his point of view as he travels to a research facility in New Mexico. While there he encounters a team of scientists who are working on a similar project. Their team leader, a man named Dr. Alan Grant, is also working on bringing back dinosaurs. The film follows their efforts as they discover more about these prehistoric creatures. Their goal is to bring back the dinosaurs, but they must first make sure that they can control them. This is a great story that will have you thinking about what it was like to be a dinosaur at the time. I can't wait to see more. I give this movie a great rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I just saw this and I am not sure if I will watch it again, it has some good parts and some not so good parts. I was very happy with the first half of the movie. It was the first time that i saw an action movie that is realistic, but that is not what really makes this movie good. The story is great. It has all the elements that makes an action film a good one. I loved the character that the writer had for the hero, and his girlfriend. The character that we see is so interesting and it is a great way to portray the fight scene. There is a scene where they go through the building looking for the guy. He is hiding in a stairwell and the woman has to jump up the stairs and find him. The movie did not make a good first impression for me, because the ending was so anticlimactic. It made the movie seem like a mess, and that is why i didn't like it so much. It would be a great movie if it was a good action movie with good characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The Movie ___________ I've always been interested in science fiction. I've watched a lot of sci-fi films and TV shows over the years, but none of them have really captured the imagination of me. That was until I saw the movie. The movie is set in the near future and features a crew of astronauts who are stranded in orbit. One of the astronauts has a daughter who is on the way to a school party. When they finally land on earth they are greeted by a young woman who claims to be their daughter. The film features a lot more action than most sci-fis and the action scenes are pretty good. The story follows a group of people that are trying to make it to the next city that they are headed to. There are some fantastic alien creatures that they meet along the way and the film has a lot to say about the future of the world. The director of the film, Andrew Stanton, is a pretty good one. He is able to tell a really interesting story with a lot going on. I really enjoyed the movie and I highly recommend it. ______________________________________________________  Review by: James A.  I thought this was an interesting movie. I had heard about it and thought that it was a great movie. But the real reason I was intrigued by it was because of the special effects. I thought that the special effect was quite nice and the effects looked realistic. The special effects really were the reason why I enjoyed the film. The music was good, and I liked the way the music fit with the story. The ending was pretty good too. This was a nice movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________   I saw this movie because my wife and I were in the middle of a two week vacation and were looking for a good one to watch on a long drive. I saw this one before I saw the last one in the series, and it was a good watch. I loved how the story told was about the struggles of a couple that were trying to start a new life in a new country. The acting was great and the direction was excellent.   This movie is not a great movie by any means, but it is a good time, and has some funny scenes. This movie was a remake of a movie I saw on the late 70's that is a comedy, "The Big One" starring Gene Hackman and Shelley Duvall. I think this remake was a better movie, as the acting was more natural and the movie was not very long. The plot was very similar and I think it had some of the same problems, but the story was not bad.  , a little movie, and a bit funny. This is about a couple who are trying to move into a house that they are buying, but they find out that the owner of the house has been murdered. They are going to look for his killer, but things get out of control when they find the body. I really liked this movie. The story is not bad, and the acting is good. It has a little bit of a silly ending that is funny, but doesn't really go anywhere. This has the same issues as the first one. The movie is short, and does not have much story. It is fun, and good. This isn't a bad movie, but you should probably wait for the sequel to this one. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________, a story about a guy that moves to a small town and gets a job at a local bar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining is a good horror movie.  I don't care if you think it's overrated.    It's a good film, but it is NOT for everyone.  This film has been made over the years and it is well loved.  I think a lot of people have forgotten how good it is.  The film is well done and it was well made.  It is also a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  There is a lot going on in this film, and a lot goes on in the people that are trying to escape.  At first you think that everything is normal.  But then something goes wrong and things go really wrong.  In a way it was like a horror film.  What makes it a good story is that it is a story about a family.  For a family to survive, they need to survive in a very scary place.  A lot of horror movies just have people running around, but The Shining is about how a family is coping in a place that they can't get out of.  Some people say that it's a little corny, but to me it just made sense.  And for those people who say that this is a movie about the occult, then you are right.  They are right about the use of symbols.  When you see the symbols, they are used in a way that they have meaning to the characters.  So in a lot ways, this movie is a horror movie, but you also get the sense that this movie deals with real issues.  We see the family dealing with the fact that there is a killer that is out there.  People that have died, but no one knows who he is.   The movie doesn't have a lot to do with the occult.  Now it's obvious that the symbols are used for a reason, but in a different way than a lot horror movies use symbols.   For example, you see a man in a white robe.  That is a symbol of death, and that is a sign that someone is about to kill them.  On the other hand, when you see that symbol, it is also the symbol of life.  Maybe the movie deals a lot with the issue of family.   This is a family that is trying to survive.  Their daughter is sick, and they can barely afford to get her to a doctor.  To make a long story short, they have

The story was great, and it's a great idea, but I'm sorry to say that the movie is so short. The movie starts out in the middle of the desert, but after a few scenes, it moves to a city. The whole story takes place in a couple of days, and you see a lot of people who are just doing their normal thing. And then you realize that this is a movie about a young girl and her father who is trying to take her away from the desert. It takes about 3 days for her to get to the city. There are some funny moments. But the movie ends pretty quickly. And I would recommend this movie to any one who has a good time and has no interest in the main character.

The movie was basically about a couple that have a car accident and are left to spend their life trying to find a way to pay for it.

There are some great performances by people who deserve a lot of recognition, and we all get to enjoy some very good acting. I liked the story a lot, but this movie was not good. It was interesting and suspensey, but it didn't really grab me. I felt like I was watching a bad movie. It has no real emotion, and I felt sorry for the characters. I think this movie would have been better if it had been made a little more adult. The way the director played the music is very impressive. He has a lot to say about music, but in a very mature and intelligent way. _________________________________________ (This review was originally written for The Daily Mail.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   1) The first half is the best. The characters and the plot are very original and entertaining. The main character, the only male in the film, is the most interesting and interesting character I've seen in a long time. He has some of the best dialogs in the entire film. It is also a very unique story, and it is a very good idea that the main character is a woman. The second half is much more predictable. The story is basically the same as the first half. But it's not as good.   2) The ending is terrible. It was pretty much a ripoff of "Hercules". And if you haven't seen that, then this movie will make no sense at all.  -Story-  -The plot is simple. It revolves around the main male character, a female bodyguard, and a couple of other characters. But I guess that's pretty much it. The plot is nothing special. The action is okay, and the story is okay. It's just not really any good. The best part about this film is the acting. The acting is fantastic. The character development is excellent. The female character is one of the most unique and interesting characters I've ever seen in an action movie.   of course this movie was based on a book called "The Adventures of Hercules". But it doesn't look like that book, and I'm not sure if this movie got any of the plot details from that book.  But I'm just going to say it: The movie is not based on the book. And you shouldn't go see it if you want to see a good Hercules movie. This movie is pretty much the same thing as the Hercules TV series.   I did like the fact that this movie doesn't have a lot of action. It does have some action, but the action isn't really very good. I like the action better in "The Avengers". But the movie isn't bad, and you should definitely check it out if you are a Hercules fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ [A review written in the same style as a review on a good book.] (Author: A.S. King) "I never want to go home." That's what the girl says in the film, a movie about the lives of two brothers who were born and raised in the shadow of a nuclear test. The test was the first in a series of nuclear explosions that the United States detonated in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. After the explosion, the two brothers lived in a tent for several weeks in the desert. When the brother on the right went back to the tent for a cigarette after a shower, he heard the screams of a woman. He ran back to his tent, which had been blown out. In the middle of the desert, he found a girl in a cave. She was his sister. They had been separated since birth. His father was killed in the test, but his mother was left behind to face the consequences of her choices. She became a prostitute and died at the age of 25. The movie is a story of survival, of survival and of hope. It's a story about a brother, a father, a mother, and a sister who is determined to bring her children back together, to make up for the loss of her father. And she does it by working as a prostitute, because there is nothing else she can do. (Author's note: The movie was actually a television show. This review is for the movie as a film.

But I am not a very good movie watcher and don't take any of them too seriously. And yes, I am biased. This movie is a great movie and I can say this with a lot less drama and more laughs. The whole movie is made in 2 hours and I love the comedy. It's a comedy, but not the kind that makes you want to die, but the kind where you get a great laugh out of it. This is a funny movie, and the acting is great. I don't think it's worth the time. I recommend this movie for comedy lovers, it's a good one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is a very good movie.  It is a movie I could watch over and over again.  The plot is great and the performances are great.  I was just never able to connect with anyone in the movie.  I had to watch the movie again to find a real connection.    It was just a terrible movie.   It was also a very poor movie for the budget it was made for.  There are lots of special effects and special effects shots but they all seem unnecessary.    - The story has some real heart and I am really surprised they were able to pull it off.  -  One of the most amazing movies ever.  -   The ending is amazing and you really feel for all the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********The Great White Hides on the Lake (1944)********** Written by Robert Sherwood and directed by Howard Hawks, this classic thriller, starring Richard Widmark and Janet Leigh, tells the story of a group of men in the 1930s who become caught up in a murder case. The story is based on the real-life murder of a young woman in the summer of 1934. The movie was originally released in the UK as The White Rose. The title is also a reference to the famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe called The Raven. This movie is so good and the acting is excellent that it's almost impossible to find faults with it. The plot, with its twists and turns, is excellent. The main character, a police detective named Jim McClure, is played with great restraint by Richard Widmore. There are many wonderful and chilling moments in this film. Some of the most memorable scenes are: When the young woman, Catherine "Cat" Palmer (played by Janet Leigh), is found brutally murdered. When an old man and his two children are murdered at the same time. When McClure discovers that a missing man named Jack Barden (played beautifully by Harry Carey) has a mysterious new friend named The White Rabbit. When the police decide to investigate the murder of Jack Bower, a wealthy businessman who disappeared while on vacation. When Jack Berson (played superbly by Charles Coburn) is kidnapped and later found murdered. It's a very long film and it really takes its time building up its tension. It doesn't give up until the very end. The ending is perfect and the story is very complex. The cinematography is fantastic. The editing is excellent and the soundtrack is very good. The film is not the most visually appealing movie but it is very well made. This is a must-see for fans of classic crime films. It is also an important film in the development of horror. The sound effects are very good and there are many close-ups. This isn't a cheap movie and it's worth it to see the film in all its glory. I was very surprised by how good this film is. I have always thought that it was a remake of The Mothman Prophecies and that was probably why it wasn't very successful. Now that it is available, I can see that the original movie was one of the best and most well-made horror films ever made. Highly recommended.  RATING: 5 out of 5-stars

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (1/5 stars)  "Fantasy" is a fantasy about a man who can change into a tiger, who has to fight a dragon. A film that tries too hard to be realistic, and fails to be, it is a great action movie. It's good to see how far science has come.  I can't believe I didn't know this was a sci-fi movie before. But after watching it, I was able to understand why this was called "fantasy". It doesn't take long to understand what is happening. You just follow the story and you'll see how the dragon and man have to work together. I was not really interested in this story, but it was a good action film, with good special effects. The tiger was awesome, the dragon looked great too, but the most amazing was the special effects, and the special character, the man who turns into a dragon! I really loved it. The special effects were amazing. The tigers and dragons were amazing, but I really liked how the man could transform into a Dragon. - I've heard this movie was good but not as good as "The Lion King".

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ What a fantastic film this is. I have never seen a film that can hold my attention for the whole length of the movie, and even after that, I was still glued to the screen. It's a brilliant screenplay that keeps you guessing. It is a story about a man who is about to retire from the military and is having a very difficult time getting out of the house. He gets in a car accident and is left in a coma. In his dreams, he sees his son, who is the leader of a gang of thieves, but he can't remember anything about his past. He doesn't even remember his wife. But after his wife dies and his son leaves, he becomes obsessed with finding his son and finds out about a secret group of men who are planning to steal the $200 million they have amassed. They are led by a man named John, who has a strong dislike for his father. He is the kind of man that will kill someone just to prove his point. His son is the real key to their success. His family has been murdered, but the men who killed them are still at large, so John has hired them to kill his son. Written by Gary A. Smith <sbsmith@sbs.com>

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The movie starts off on a good note as the opening scene sets the mood for the movie to follow. We see a bunch of people in a bar talking about some "unimportant" things. Some of them even call themselves "important" because they are "special". They start to look around and they see a "special" girl walk in. The guy sitting next to the girl, is talking about how she looks "good" and "beautiful". As they start to talk more and more, we see how "important they are" to the girls they are talking to. Eventually they are all alone together, the girl is talking to some guy in a white coat. The girl and guy are both talking about their past and how they are not getting along. The guys are saying they are getting older, but the girl says they are too old for them. At this point the guys are all crying and the girl starts to cry as well. The movie then ends and the guy in the white coat walks off with the girl. The ending was great as well, we get a very good "end" to this movie. It wasn't "over" and we don't get a "resolution". This movie had a great message and I enjoyed it. I was able to enjoy it as a good film as well as a bad film. I give it a 9.5 out of 10. Next movie: I think this movie should be rated higher, because it had a lot more action than other movies of this type. The girls had some fun in this movie and I think they should have a lot of fun in other movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- **A few words about the movie:** The movie is very interesting and well worth watching. The way it tells its story is very intriguing. The fact that it tells a tale of the Holocaust in the Nazi controlled Poland is very clever. The movie also has an interesting story behind it. The story is told from a couple of different points of view. There are two of the main characters in the movie. The first is the Jewish girl who is very sensitive and wants to live her life normally. The second is the Russian girl. Both of them are trying to get to Germany and to Poland in order to escape the war. The girl in the first part is trying to keep her family together while the girl in Poland is trying not to let her family be torn apart. The third point of view is that of the boy in Poland who is trying his best to live a normal life. I thought the movie did a great job with telling its story. There is an ending which was very emotional. The whole story was very interesting to me. It was also very well made. I think the movie was a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jan 22, 2017 By Tasha Fieger Byon  I was in love with this movie from the moment I saw it. I saw the trailer for this film and thought I'd never get a chance to see it, but I had to. I thought this was a great movie that would be good for a younger audience. The story is very different from what most people would expect. It was great for kids and older folks. I really loved the way the story was told. It had an element of drama to it. The film was very emotional. The main character, Riz, was so much fun to watch. I think it's funny that she was the only child that didn't get picked on. It wasn't that she wasn't smart or anything, she just wasn't the most popular. Riz was very clever. She was very funny. I felt she was just born to be a writer. I loved her character. She didn't need the extra help of being a writer and I think she could've been great at that job. It really was a fun film and I hope people like it.   I was in Love with this Movie from the Moment I Saw It        Loading...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When the good times roll, you can forget the bad."  - The Joker "He's an evil, sadistic maniac who only wants to hurt people."    -"Curse you, Joker!"   The Joker's name is Bruce Wayne and he is a millionaire playboy with a big smile and a bad attitude.   -     He has a very thick accent and is the first to be introduced, and he never really says a word.  The Joker has a great attitude. The Joker is a master criminal and one of Batman's greatest foes.  He is ruthless, violent, and wants to do what he wants.  Joker's first appearance was in  Detective Comics #27 (November 1942) and he was created by the great Bob Kane.  A lot of people say he was inspired by Jack the Ripper, but the truth is he was a lot more.  During the war the Nazis used a special poison, but it is not mentioned that they were using it on prisoners in concentration camps.  One of the most famous stories about the Joker is that he created a lot of fear in his enemies by giving them a lot less than what they deserved.  After the war he was sent to the insane asylum.  Many people think he escaped the asylum, but he wasn't.  In the late 1940's the Joker was still a very dangerous criminal and many people were trying to catch him.  This was also a time where the Joker became the star of his own comic book series.  But eventually he was caught.   When he was imprisoned he was given a lot freedom to do whatever he wanted.  When he escaped from prison he was trying to make a new Joker.  Before the war, he made some friends in the prison, but when they got out, he killed them all.  As for the story, the Joker started his career as a petty thief and when he became a criminal he went to great lengths to get the money he needed to become the new Joker, but that wasn't easy.  Some of his first victims were people he was friends with, but eventually he started killing them.   He was very good at hiding his identity, but Batman did eventually catch him and put him in the insane prison.  In the beginning of his life as the new Batman, he was an enemy to Batman.  They both have different ways of fighting crime, but they have a lot

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  No, not because of the movie, but because of my own life experiences. I've been married for 10 years. The last three of them have been with my husband's parents, who are extremely supportive and understanding. The first couple of years were wonderful. I got along with the parents so well that it seemed like a great family. Then, in 2006, my daughter, now 10 years old, started acting out. She began to act out in class and in the lunchroom, in class, in the school yard, and in her room. She was becoming increasingly disobedient, aggressive, and mean. It wasn't a struggle for her to find an outlet for her anger. She even threatened to harm herself. We were stunned. The parents told us that she had been diagnosed with a mental illness. I was shocked. We had been through the worst in the war, we had endured the death of our son in Iraq and the death and wounding of my husband and daughter in a car accident. We loved our daughter dearly. She had never been aggressive. She did not have any known mental illness, nor did she have any history of mental illness or mental illness-like behavior. I called my psychiatrist to tell her what had happened. She said that she believed my daughter had been sexually abused at some point in her childhood. She didn't know if it had been physical, sexual, emotional, or psychological. We tried to find support from all over the world. Nothing worked. We eventually went to a therapist in our home town, but she said that if she treated my daughter she would have to be very careful because she had no way of knowing if she was telling the truth. We talked to several other therapists. They said the only way to find out is for her parents to have an open dialogue with her. I finally decided to bring her to see me in person. After an hour-long discussion with her, we decided to put her on Ritalin and try to get her on medication. This was in October 2006. In January 2007, I went to the local police station to report my daughter for truancy. I explained to the officer that I was in no position to take care of her, that she was in danger, and that she would end up in prison if she didn't get some help. The officer responded by telling me that I needed to keep my daughter under control, and to tell the police to do whatever they needed to do.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.   It was very well done, although not as good as my expectations. The story line is pretty interesting, and it would be great to see how much of the movie was shot in the desert. There is some great cinematography, with the desert scenes very clear and colorful.   in general, the movie is a bit hard to watch at times, but there is some good action and the story is pretty good. I really liked the characters, and I enjoyed the movie. The ending was good, but I was hoping for more, especially since I've read the book before.   of course, this is a movie, so I'll be disappointed if I don't get to see the desert scene. I have read the first two books before, and they were fine, but this is probably a movie version of the first book, so we'll see.  , so this is my review of this movie. It's an old movie from the 70s, and has a nice soundtrack and a lot of the original characters. This is a good film. I don 't think it's the best of the trilogy, but it's still a good flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   The story is simple. A man has a dream. He dreams of a woman who is going to get his heart. His dream is true and the dream is very beautiful. He is about to marry a beautiful woman. But he gets scared of her because she is a beautiful girl, not a real girl. The man starts to have feelings for her and tries to take the girl in a small boat to the ocean. However, this girl is very ugly and has a big mouth. So he gets very scared and jumps out of the boat. He then starts to walk on land, but he doesn't want to walk to land. He wants to stay on water. So, he decides to make a fire and build a house. Then he builds a bridge and gets on a boat with a man on it. And they both live in the house. They talk and have sex with each other. And in the end, they go to the sea and have a very nice life.   After they had sex, they both went to sleep. However the next day, they woke up and both realized that they are dead. The girl is gone, and the man has no wife and no daughter. The only person who has survived the ordeal is the man's little daughter, who is scared of the water.   and the ending was very beautiful and tragic.   (this is the first film i watched on Netflix)
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  _________________   - The plot was really bad. The movie started with some good scenes, but as soon as they started with a fight with some men who were chasing the girl, the plot turned into a really bad movie. They never explained what happened, and the guy who was supposed to be the hero of the movie never did anything in the movie. The ending was also really bad, and there was some stuff that was really stupid. It was all over-the-top, but that's what I like in action movies. It just feels like you were watching a really stupid movie, and not an action movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining "I was afraid. I was scared. I couldn't sleep. I kept having these strange dreams."  It's a great quote. It speaks volumes about the effect The Shining had on me. It is the best movie I've ever seen, and I watched it on a dare. I'd heard great things about it. It seemed like a perfect fit. I bought it and watched it at a friend's house. I had to stay up all night watching it. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies but The Shining is one of the scariest. I remember being terrified of the house at night. I didn't sleep at all, and every time I close my eyes I see a shadow. The music in the movie was great, but the cinematography was so stunning that it made the movie feel like a dream.  I was in awe. I have since gone on to watch every horror movie I can find.  The Shining is a beautiful film.    "It is a house that never sleeps."  One of my all time favorite films.  One of my favorite films of all time.

The plot is very confusing, there is no sense of time, the characters seem to be in a hurry to get to the point and the story is very simple. The cinematography is good but not as good as the film of the same name. I wouldn't give this film a second look because it's not as interesting as the other two films.

You are sitting there thinking, 'is this really happening? Is this a joke? Is my husband actually going to go get his pants cut? Is that really happening?' And then you realize, 'this is really happening, and it's really happening right now.' I think that is what makes this movie so funny. The movie is very realistic. It doesn't have any of that other stuff. It was filmed like a movie. It is a very funny movie. I highly recommend this movie to everybody. It will make you laugh. And you will be laughing for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  What's that? ______________.  in a movie that is mostly about how he would have done if he had lived? _______________________.    (hide spoiler)] I've never seen a movie quite like "The Last of the Mohicans" - it was a big deal at the time. It was a massive blockbuster that starred the great Warren Beatty and was written by Conrad Hall. The story revolves around the Battle of Long Island (the Battle of Brooklyn) in 1778. A band of Mohawks, led by Chief Blackhawk, and Englishmen lead by William Wallace, invade New York. It's a brutal battle and the Englishmen are slaughtered. Blackhawk and his men take Long Island and hold it for almost a year. They do not take any prisoners. It is at this point that William Wallace realizes that he has made a grave mistake by leading the English to defeat. He retreats to the British stronghold of New York and vows to avenge his people. However, he is captured by the British and forced to fight in the Battle Of Harlem Heights.   When he reaches Harlem Heights, the British are in a state of disarray. A major British army is still fighting the French at the Battle In The Champagne, and the army is being pulled in all directions. Wallace and Blackhawk are able to take Harlem Heights and the British retreat back to New York, leaving the Mohawks free to live in peace.   is this a good film? __________________________________________________________. It seems like it was written for the sole purpose of winning awards and the film had no real chance to make a big profit. I loved it, it was great fun to watch and there was a great plot. I liked it even better as an example of what not to do.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! A- movie! It's just funny, it's got a good plot and a good director, and it's good to see that it can work on TV. But the actors are not good at all, and I don't think they were casted for the part. I think that they should have done it on TV! So many actors, and not good enough, and the story was too weak to have any impact, but it was good to be in a movie that was made for a TV show.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- * * * I love this movie so much that when I heard that a movie version of this is coming out, I was happy. I hope that the director is able to make this version a little more realistic than the original, because it's not the best of the lot. But, it's still a good one. And I'll tell you why. * * -The movie is actually very well-shot and looks good. The film also has a good pace and the action is very well choreographed. The main actors (especially Paul Bettany) look amazing. There's a great chemistry between the actors and this is also evident in the sex scenes, because the two actors look very similar. This is definitely the best movie version that we have seen so far, because this version is the closest to the source material that we'll get, so it looks better than the other ones. * -There are some minor errors here and there, but it's mostly fine. The movie version is very good, and I think it'll make a perfect movie for you. --------------- Watch the trailer: ------------- * * *** The Man From U.N.C.L.E. *** * * ------------- The movie is about a special agent who has the responsibility to investigate a terrorist organization that is attacking U.S. cities and killing a lot of people. He also has to save the President of the United States. The special agent is played by Guy Pearce (Black Hawk Down). The movie takes place in 1970s London and also features some of the best action scenes ever. ------------- Watch the trailers: ------------ ------------- ------------- A Man from U. N.C.L. E ------------- Director Paul Greengrass (Memento) and screenwriter Nick Frost (Prisoners) have made a great movie. The story is interesting and I really liked it. The director's skill is well-observed, and this movie is definitely worth seeing. -------------- Watch the full movie: ----------------------- -------------- The Man from UNCLE ------------- This movie is also very good and the special effects are amazing. The characters are all believable, and the movie looks great. The action scenes are intense, and it looks like a real movie. ------------ Watch the movie: ------------------ ------------ The Man in the Moon ------------ Director Brian De Palma (Scarface, The Untouchables) has a great style of directing and this was the first time I've seen

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ * I just finished watching this movie. I have been searching for a good black and white horror film and this one came very close to what I wanted. I do recommend watching it if you like horror, but you should be aware that there are some scenes that are a little hard to watch. It is not hard, but I would suggest watching it with subtitles if you want to follow along. If you are a fan of horror and like to see scary scenes then you should check this one out. **This is a great film. It has some very scary scenes and some really scary sound effects. The film also is well directed and has a very dark mood. If I ever have the chance to see this film again, I would watch it again. I would also recommend it to a group of friends that have not seen this film before.**
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I saw this movie on an old VHS tape. It was made in the 70's and the characters were like the 80's cartoon character, but with a little more action and a little less silliness. The film was about a guy who was kidnapped by aliens, but managed to escape and became the hero of the film. The alien had a secret plan that was going to get rid of the people of earth. When they escaped he put a bomb on the ship. When he came back he wanted to kill everyone, but he was going insane and he didn't want anyone to get hurt. He wanted to get out of the ship and then come back to Earth and destroy it. He killed the captain and a few other crew members, then he put his bomb in a time machine that was in the ship to help him destroy earth. He then came back to earth and shot his way through the entire crew. This was the end. He was going for a walk and a smoke and was hit by a car. The car ran him over and the time machine got destroyed. The movie was good and I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ This is a good, solid action film with plenty of excitement and suspense. The plot involves a group of mercenaries that are trying to capture a very powerful criminal, but they get captured themselves. The film is great for those who enjoy action and is great to watch with a large group of friends. The movie is also fun and the music is great. This is an all-around fun movie. ___________________________________ Cast and characters: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The characters are really interesting. The main villain is a very interesting character, but the other mercenaries are a little boring. The villain is very intense and he has a very dark sense of humor, which makes him very interesting. ______________________________________________________________________________ Rating: ______________ ______________________________________________________ This is really good film, but if you're expecting a classic, you're going to be disappointed. This movie is fun, but it doesn't have a lot of surprises. If you're a fan of action, this movie will be fun for you. __________________ Review by: Brian H. from St. Louis, MO.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ _____________ __________  It's so good, even the bad bits are good. It's about a woman and her husband, and it's really funny, but it's very realistic about the husband. The wife is an amazing actress. She has to work all the time to get it all right. She was an actress in the movies, and she had to put up with a lot of people who would do whatever they want.  Was this helpful?  Did this review help? YES NO  3 out of 3 people found this helpful.  and she did a really good job! she got very emotional when she was on the phone with him  Yes, this is a very funny movie. The movie has a lot to offer, and you will definitely find yourself laughing at several points. The only problem is that it isn't very interesting, and some of the scenes don't work. It was just too much of the same thing. This movie has some of my favorite lines: "That's what they want to see, isn't it?"  "It's a long way down, you can't go very far."  I would give this movie a 3.0 but for the problems that the movie has. ,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "Gone in 60 Seconds" is a great movie that has a very good script, a very bad acting performance and a really bad acting direction. But the film is still really good and worth a watch. If you are looking for an action thriller, this is the movie for you. The story is interesting and it's very fast paced. There is an amazing car chase scene that is worth watching. The music is great, the acting is good, and it has a great soundtrack. I think this is one of those films that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. The movie is worth a try and I give it a 5 star rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cinderella (1950) I have been a huge Disney fan for as long as I can remember. Growing up I watched every movie that came out in the 80's, and even though I was not as much of a child as my brother or sister were, I always loved their films. Disney always gave me some of the best moments of my life. The movie Cinderella is the best Disney movie of all time. I am a huge fan of Cinderella's journey and I have always been amazed at the fact that she was not allowed to marry the prince. Cinderella was the only girl in a man's kingdom who had a dream of becoming a princess. I also like the way that Disney brought in new characters from around the world to bring in some diversity to the movie. This movie was really a Cinderella movie but not just because of the fact she was the main character. The Disney movie has a lot of humor in it and I think that's why it has always been such a classic. The music, the dancing, and the scenery are really something to behold. I will always remember this movie as my favorite Disney movie. I always liked that the movie didn't focus on the prince and princess romances but focused on the friendship between the two. I loved this movie and I love it even more now that I have grown up.  It is my favorite movie and the one that I always watch before bed when I am feeling lazy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My opinion of The Good Dinosaur was generally positive, but I found myself a little put off by the ending. I'll just say that the movie is a little slow and a little repetitive. The characters, as well as the dinosaurs themselves, were all pretty well-drawn, but there was a certain lack of interest. It was not until the end that I began to understand what the movie was about. For the most part, the characters were very well-defined. I enjoyed hearing the various voices, and their interactions with each other. As far as the dinosaur side of the story, I did not find it very well written, and I do not feel it has been told very well. The ending, while beautiful and a bit of a twist, is a bit rushed and I don't think it really makes sense. Overall, I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Dinosaur. It is not a bad movie, and it is not going to be a classic, but it is very well done and has an excellent ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!!!! The best movie ever!!!  Reviewer: Rene St.Vincent - favorite favorite favorite - April 5, 2006  Subject: Best movie ever I don't know how it works, but in every movie of this type, you have to have a good plot and the right actors. This is not only a great movie but it has a great story. This movie is very realistic. The movie starts with a man, a police officer, who finds his wife murdered. The cops are called to the scene. After a little while, they realize that there is a serial killer who killed all the prostitutes. They realize that the murderer is the man that they saw in the hotel room and who killed his wife. After finding out that the serial killer killed all prostitutes, they take a woman, who is his wife's former lover. The police think that the killer is a man that has a lot of money. But they have no idea how this man came into their hands. It is not just a movie. It shows how the police work. This show is very real and it shows the power that law enforcement has over criminals. The last scene, which is a great ending, shows how it is like to live in a world where there are no cops. - April the 5, 2007Best movie ever  Rated: - April 4, 2006

The movie was made in 1998. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the movie. The movie is a satire about a group of misfits who go on a tour of a haunted hotel, The Room. They meet a number of characters and the story takes a dark turn. I made this movie for a friend of mine who asked me to do it. The name of the movie was based on a song from a band called "Tame Impala". The original title was The Room: A Tale of Two Halls. The original soundtrack was composed by the same band. It was also composed by my brother who also plays guitar. This movie was inspired by the original film The Room by Wes Craven. The music in this movie is the same. It has been remade in a number other films since then. I was able to find this film because of a friend

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version 10.2.0 or greater is installed. The sequel to the 1996 cult classic, the director's first film with an all-star cast, the film is a thrilling action movie about a group of friends who travel to a desert resort and are stranded in a desert with nothing but each other. The movie opens with a montage of action scenes, including a helicopter crashing in a river and a man jumping from a high cliff. This montage is a good way to start the film and it gives us a feel for the action. The action scenes are amazing and are so realistic that I thought that the film had no CGI. The cinematography of the desert and the people in the desert are amazing. The character of the lead actor, Tom Cruise, is the real star of this movie and I thought he was amazing. Cruise is so charismatic and it is great to see him back in a film. The story is about an alien who wants to live among humans and is captured by the people of the resort. His job is to destroy a computer system that is connected to a supercomputer that controls all the machinery of the entire resort. He is assisted by a man named Bill (Michael Ironside), who has a secret. He can communicate with the alien and help him. Tom Cruise is in great shape, the same that he was in his most recent movie, "Jack Reacher." I thought the movie was great and was a great addition to the "X-Men" franchise.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "The Day The Earth Stood Still" (1977) (starring Bill Murray, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum, and Tim Robbins) is one of the greatest movies of all time. It was made in the 70's, and was a huge hit when it was released in 1978. "The World According to Garp" (1978) was a great adaptation of a novel by Philip K. Dick. "Groundhog Day" (1993) is a wonderful film about a man who is trapped in a loop of the same day over and over again. The main characters in these two movies are Bill Murray and Tom Hanks. They were so great together in "Groundhogs Day" that they would probably be together forever. The cast in "The Color Purple" (1985) is pretty awesome. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" (1987) was also a great movie. And "The Big Chill" (1996) is great too. I hope you enjoyed my list of the top 10 best movies. Share with your friends and family!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ The film is a fairly decent horror film. It is the story of two women who are forced into a relationship by an abusive man. The women become obsessed with their relationship and have to get out of the relationship as soon as they can. It does get pretty bad when they are forced to break up. However, this is a nice story and the two women make a nice team. The film was a little too long but not so much that it is a problem. I really like the two actresses in this film. They are good in their roles. The only real flaw in the film is that the ending is a little forced. I would have liked to see the characters continue the relationship after the two break up and be a little more happy about their relationship. Also, I think that the two main characters should have a little bit more time with the main female character, but that is just my opinion. Overall, I really liked this movie and would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ The most amazing part of this movie is the story. It's not a story that is really good but it is very good, with a nice touch of reality, but the most amazing aspect is the acting. Some of the best actors I have ever seen in my life (not all at the same time, just a few) are playing a few different characters. We get to see a few characters in different situations and at different times. And then we get to the very end of the movie and see the very best actor in this movie. The only problem with the acting is that the story is so well-written that it almost becomes repetitive. The ending is just a little bit too dramatic and it seems to be out of place. But it does make you think about it a bit. The story and acting is good enough to make it worth the price of admission. There is also a really good soundtrack that helps the movie. ____________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tofu from I LOVED this movie!!

My only complaint is that it did not end with a cliffhanger, which we wanted it to. It just ended with a simple explanation about the outcome of the story and then it started back on the first movie. This movie is a must see for anyone who loves stories. I recommend this movie to anyone who has never seen it before. I highly recommend it to anyone with a love of good stories. __________________  Rating: 3.5/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie, directed by Paul Haggis and starring Mark Wahlberg, was released in November 2008. The movie is about a couple who had their marriage fall apart because they didn't like each other, so they start to live separately.  It was a good idea at the time to do this movie because it is a perfect example of the conflict that is the main problem of couples who are not satisfied with each other.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  If you enjoyed a good film and don't have a good story to tell, just write a bad review about it. I will ignore your bad review, because it doesn't even tell the whole story. The movie was a bit of a train wreck, but I still had a great time watching it. The action was awesome, the fight scenes were very well done, the characters were interesting, the story was great, and the effects were fantastic. I loved it.

(Warner Bros. Pictures)    Wonder Woman  As a woman, a feminist and a superhero, it seems that there are many things I am passionate about. However, when it comes to Wonder Woman, I am compelled to say this film is one of my all time favorite movies. I have been thinking about this film for years and I think the most interesting thing about Wonder Woman is that she is not an object, she is an equal. The film is a feminist action movie in the vein of the early Superman and Batman films. Wonder Woman fights to bring justice to the world with the power of love and compassion. The movie's theme is a positive message to women and girls everywhere that women can be strong and powerful and that you can be a superhero. I loved the movie because of the way it shows a woman and her power. When Wonder Woman takes down a bad guy in the end, she gives the hero a second chance. This is a lesson I have learned from my mom. My mom taught me that if you're going to do something, you better do it better than before. I love how the story has Wonder Woman and the character of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) as a strong female lead. Wonder Women gives us a chance to see a female superhero that is not defined by her looks. I also love the message that women have a role to play in society. When we watch this film, we can see that we are capable of being heroes and women have always been a part of society.  Wonder Woman, a female lead superhero in a major blockbuster movie, is exactly what women need. We need strong women in Hollywood. We can never have enough female leads. It is important that women continue to be represented in film, because women make up half of the population. It has been stated that women make 80 cents for every dollar a man makes. This statistic is something that I am sick to my stomach. If I was a woman I would never make more than a man because I feel that women

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* I think that the best movie I've seen in a long time was 'The Secret of the Wings'. I had seen 'The Red Shoes' in the theater and enjoyed it, but not as much as 'The Wings'. The Wings is a movie I remember well, I've been following it since I saw it on TV in the early 80's. There is a scene in the movie that is a good example of what makes a great movie. It has to do with a woman who has lost her baby and is going into labor. The doctors decide to use an experimental device to induce labor. They take out a woman's legs, put them in a bag and sew her legs up with a needle. Then they attach a needle to her arm and insert it into her body. She has a long and difficult labor and finally gives birth. When she wakes up, she realizes she has lost the baby and it's in the bag. There was also a very strong scene in 'The Wing' when a woman was killed. The woman was shot by her husband because she refused to sleep with him. The husband had been very abusive to her, she wanted to leave him but he wouldn't let her. She finally died and they buried her in a grave next to her husband. The scene was very strong. The Wings was very good too. It was funny, it had good characters, it was well written, the special effects were good. The main thing I remember about the Wings is the song 'I'll Fly With You'. The song is one of the best ever written, and it has a good message. A woman's soul is in her feet. If she does not have feet she can not fly. And if she can't fly she has nothing to live for. It's a beautiful song. ********************** ***************** ********* ******************* ******* **********

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What's a movie without a good ending? I can remember watching a movie and thinking "that's it for this movie. I'm done with it. No more movies like this. This is it. I just want to watch something else." And then it came along. The end was a little sad but it was satisfying and it made me realize that even the best movies have an ending. And that's what this movie needed. So go watch it, or at least re-watch it. And if you are a fan of sci-fi and space adventures and a lot of movies that are good (I mean, I am a fan, and I don't say that just to sound like an idiot) then go watch this movie and you will be happy. I can't wait to see the movie again.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great movie.  If you liked the first movie, you will enjoy this one too.    There are more plot holes than in a Swiss cheese sandwich.  The whole thing feels like an episode of Star Trek, and you can tell the creators are fans.  There is also a scene that was made up by a writer and it doesn't make any sense.  This movie is worth watching for the great acting and the action.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ It is a movie that can be appreciated in different parts of the world. I was surprised that there were many scenes that were in my mind and in my heart when I was watching the movie. But I could not find the scene in my memories when I watched the movie for the first time. I watched it with the subtitles and I can't say that there was anything that was hard to understand. The story is interesting. There are several scenes that can make you laugh and you will be thinking "how was I able to think of that?". The character is really interesting. He is not an ordinary person, he is a person who is very smart and can solve any problem. The movie is a good story that I was able to understand in my own life. The ending was a nice surprise, but it doesn't give a very big impression. I have to admit that there are some scenes that are a bit too long and I think that this movie should be cut. I would like to thank the director for his work in this movie.

Acevedo and his friend (Mancini) decide to travel around Italy with the intention to become wealthy. But in the course of their travels they encounter a lot of people and they meet some great people.

It had some great moments, but the bad ones were too much to bear. That being said, I did enjoy it, because it had a unique tone, and it did a good job at telling a story. I can't say it was great, but it was certainly not bad. The film was not overly scary, and that is a good thing. The acting was a little off, but I guess that's what happens when you take a character you hate and you put them in a movie that's supposed to be a horror movie.  If you are a fan, I highly recommend this movie. The cast was fantastic, and the story was very good. If you like horror, you will enjoy this movie very much. If not, I guess you can still enjoy it and maybe it will bring some enjoyment to you.

Also i have to say that i think that the movie got better after the second episode, but i dont care much because the second one was awesome and i couldnt believe the actors were doing the characters so well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- My wife and I loved this movie! My wife loved the plot. It was really good, although I would not say that it is as good as the movie version. The acting was good, and it was the best part about the movie. The scene where the guys and girls go on a trip together was the highlight of the movie for me. It really made me smile. We loved it! My girlfriend had a different opinion. She did not enjoy the movie as much as I did. She was a bit upset with the sex scene. The guy is having sex with the girl, and the girl is telling him that she is going to have sex with him too, but she doesn't want to do that. She just wants to have fun and she's just enjoying herself. So the guy does not do that, but the girl just has sex with her boyfriend. It seemed like it was not very good. My girlfriend didn't like the sex scenes, but it was just that, sex scenes. I think she liked the storyline and that was enough for her. Overall, I really liked this movie. I hope you guys will too!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper" (1983) "Hanging With Mr Cooper"  (1983) A group of college students find a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere. They think it is a summer retreat. But when they wake up one morning and discover that they have to move, they find out that the cabin has been converted into a motel. The story revolves around the lives of the young college students, who try to stay together as they try to make it through the difficult life at the motel.  This movie is a good example of what a good student film should be. The movie is filled with humor, romance and great acting. The characters were well defined and the movie was great fun to watch. I really liked this movie and highly recommend it. The director, Frank Coraci, really made this movie a success. It is not as good as some of the other films he has made, but it is still a great film and should be watched by everyone.    "Mr. Cooper: The Mystery of the Unusual Cabin" (1955) This is a movie that is really not worth seeing, but I will try to give you a good description of the movie. The main character, Richard, who lives in a trailer park and is trying to find a new home for his family. When he meets a young man named Jim, he realizes that he can use Jim's help in getting rid of his trailer park. However, the young man has his own plans for Richard. Richard meets a very old woman named Mary who lives on a farm in a small town and she takes him to a secret place where there are old people. She takes him back in time to find out how things will be if the people in the present day survive.  This movie was really made in the 1950's and not as well done as many of the films I have seen. The acting was really bad and the story didn't make much sense. The plot was very simple and did not really make sense.  The movie is about a man who wants to move his family into a new house but he is a bit too late.  This film is a great example of how to make a good college film. This movie is great fun and well worth watching. This film is also a good way to learn about how movies are made.

I had heard of it through the word of others, but hadn't seen it in a while, and I was curious. Well, I decided to see it. I went with a couple friends and we all had the chance to watch it together. There was a good mix of both old and new movies, and the actors were all pretty good, especially Michael Keaton and the beautiful Meryl Streep. The film was a very interesting, very realistic portrayal of a man who has had a stroke, but he's still able to work, and he still makes a living doing so. He's in the middle of a divorce and he's trying to keep his marriage together. He has a stroke and can't move, but at the same time, he's able to get up and start moving around and he has to deal with the stress of having to take care of his wife and his job. It was very well made and very interesting to see how this man handles himself. I think it's a good film.

I was surprised to see the movie has more scenes than other movies. The scenes of Nimitz, his staff, and other key people that were in the film were really well done. The action scenes were also well done, with plenty of shots of warships, planes, and ships in action. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves World War 2.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Haunting in Connecticut is a film that does not let its audience down.  While the movie has a lot of the "shocking" horror genre trappings, it still manages to pull you into its story and keep you engaged throughout.  A good movie can bring the scares to the forefront of a film without letting the audience know.    The Haunting is one of those rare films that does this without letting you know.       It is a suspenseful, but believable, thriller that can leave you breathless.       You have to remember that The Hounding is not a typical horror film, it is a thriller, and the story of an elderly woman who goes to the home of her nephew to investigate an old haunting is not typical at all.  There are plenty of "haunted" movies out there, but most of them are more than just jump scares.  They are well researched and have a real grasp of the history of the hauntings, and that is something that The Haunted in Connecticut does not.  If you are a horror movie fan and have not seen a movie with a great story and good scares, then I highly recommend you give this one a try.  This film will make you feel like you are walking through a haunted house, even if it is not the typical "haunt" movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I don't like horror movies but I was looking forward to this movie. The opening of the movie was pretty good. I had to turn my lights off because of the lighting and it really helped the movie. It was not very scary but it had a good sense of creepiness and creepy atmosphere. The movie was good. The acting was good and they played their roles well. They were very creepy and they were really creepy. I loved the ending of the film. It really made the movie and it was very suspenseful. The ending was a little bit confusing but it was not a big problem. I liked the ending the most because I didn't know what was going to happen next. The film had some good gore. There were some body parts and blood that was very graphic. The violence was good but it wasn't very graphic and they didn't really show it. The gore was good, but I didn a lot of it and it wasn;t too bad. The story was pretty bad. There was a lot wrong about it. It felt like a bad movie. I just did not like it at all. There are some good parts in the film but the story was very bad and there were a lot more wrong about this movie than right. The characters were just too much in this movie and the plot was bad and not very good. It just made me sick. I guess that I will never watch this movie again because I think that it was a bad film. The way they used the gore was just too scary. I think it was just a lot too much.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** My boyfriend and I went to see The Devil's Backbone. I've seen it twice before and it was my first time going to the movie. The story line of this movie was amazing. The characters were real and believable. The movie was filled with heartache and it made you feel for these characters and how they felt about each other. The acting was amazing as well. The director, Tom Cruise, did an amazing job in this movie. He was able to show the world that he is a man and still maintain a nice look. The best part of this story was the soundtrack by the artist named J. Cole. He really made the movie feel like a roller coaster ride. The song that came on was "Hands of Love" which was a song that I heard on his "No Role Modelz" album. I loved the music and I love the movie and the story line. The Devil Is Backbone is one of my favorite movies of all time.

There was a bit of a lull in the action, and the movie was about an ordinary man, but a very interesting one, and quite funny.  It was also very well directed.  The music was great, the film was a classic and a good way to go out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight (2008) is a great Batman movie.  This is one of the most violent movies ever made.  And what is with all these "sideskirts"  It's the second Batman movie that Batman does not take the role of a criminal.  The first was The Dark Knight and the first one did not do a good job at showing what was going on in the world.  After this movie though Batman is now more of a hero.  This movie shows the consequences of using lethal force on a criminal without trial.  If you take away the graphic violence you will still have a good time watching it.  It's an action packed movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** "A New Kind of Horror" was a decent enough movie. I had a great time seeing this movie. There were some really good scares. The movie was fun. It's the best horror movie of the year so far. It has some great scenes and a great ending. It was a fun horror movie. The only thing I don't like is that there were a lot of people in the audience. It makes it a bit hard to see what was going on and who was who. It seemed like too many people were in the theater at once. There are also a few people in there that don't even really want to be there. I think that's a big mistake on the part of the movie's director, Michael Mann. I guess it would have been easier to just show the movie to the people in a theatre. It would have made the movie a lot more effective. I liked that this movie is a sequel. The sequel doesn't make the original any less good. If you like horror films, then you'll like this movie, too. The sequels usually suck but I like this one better. I'd like to see this movie in a 3D theatre. If the movie was in 3D, I think it would really add to the horror factor. It really does seem like it would be a lot harder to watch a movie in 3-D. It might be too much for some people. It wasn't very hard to watch the movie in the theatre. The sound was good, too, and the actors were great. The people in that audience that didn't want to get into the movie at all, that's probably a good sign. There was also a woman there who said something to the effect of "This is too much. I'm not going to sit through it." That's a good thing, I guess. The cast was all great, though. I thought they did a great job. I would like to hear Michael Mann make a sequel to this movie because it's great. I just wish it was a bit longer. It ended up being about an hour and a half. I could have done with a little more. This is a good, fun horror film that I recommend. It had some great scares and I would recommend it to anyone who likes scary movies. The DVD is a bit short. It should be about an extra 30 minutes. It seems like there were only a few extras. The audio and the picture were good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ This movie is amazing. A movie about a person who has never seen the sun and has been living alone for many years is a bit hard to get the point across, but that is not the point at all. In this movie the characters are able to communicate with each other and the world around them in ways they could never dream of before, through music and dance. They are a little different from one another and you get to see their past and the way they are living the lives they know. This is a very good movie. __________

This is not a movie that's trying to impress anyone. It's a movie made by people who love to watch good movies, and it's a damn good movie. If you haven't seen this one yet, I highly recommend it. It is a true story, but it's not a retelling of the story of the movie. Instead, it is a story told from the perspective of a guy who went to prison for a murder he didn't commit. It has a great cast of characters. It isn't about the movie, it's about the people in it. That's what made it so powerful. It really made me want to see the movie so bad. I mean, who doesn't want to be an innocent guy, who's in jail for a crime he didn´t commit? This movie is like a fairy tale, a story that makes me feel good. ____________________________ Follow us on Twitter at @TheArtofMovie for more reviews! _________________________ Check out our website www.themoviedb.com ___________________________ Join our Facebook group to get more news like this! ------------------- If you liked this, share it with your friends!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  I love this movie. It is one of my favorite films of all time. It has a good balance of comedy, drama, action and some great action sequences. The story and the characters are well developed. You get to see the human side of the main characters. This movie does not feel like a typical action movie but more of a mystery. You have to watch it just to get the idea of what is going on. It will not give you a good ending but will leave you wondering what happened.  __________________________________________________________  The film has an excellent screenplay, by the way. It's about a man and his friend, who decide to do a job for the insurance company in a remote place, without the company's permission. They take a group of young people, and they are told that they are to stay in the camp for two weeks, without going to the city or the airport, to keep an eye on the people that are being evacuated from the place. ... and there's more. The director, John Boorman, was one of the greatest, if not the greatest horror filmmaker of the last 100 years. This is not your typical horror film. You will not find gore and violence here, but it will leave a deep impression on you.  the film was shot on location in Northern Ireland. There is a great soundtrack that is not overplayed. I'm not sure why this movie doesn't get more attention. This film is really special, and if you like action movies or you just like mystery, you must see this movie!

I think it is about the fact that, if you have a lot of money and you're very powerful, you can do what you want," he said. "This film is about how we can change the way people look at things and the way they think."  For years, many have criticized the film's depiction of a wealthy black woman who is portrayed as a sexual temptress, and even a predatory one, by the film, "The Help." : "You can have the best of intentions, but it's hard to know where the line is. I don't think this film is as strong as it could be. I do think it has some problems with representation."    "The Help" is about a poor black woman (played by Ellen Page) who is sent to live with a white family and then become their housekeeper. She learns to become comfortable with the white family's lifestyle, and they eventually move out. The film was made in 1984, and "The Color Purple" was released in 1987.   During the interview, Ellison talked about the film.  What about the criticism that the film is racist?  I don't know if there's anything about it that's racist. It's a movie about a black woman and a white woman who live together. It was a very simple idea.   I think that, like "The Godfather," if you were a black person in the 1960s or 1970s, you had a certain set of expectations for the way things were going to go.   The problem is that we didn't have the power we have today to change it. If you wanted to be able to work in the film industry in the '60s or '70s, if that was the goal, you would have had to be a very determined person, to go out there and work very hard.

A young man goes on a mission to save a group of young children in a city of a similar type to the one in which I grew up. I like the way that it looks and the way it moves. It doesn't try to be a movie about the Holocaust, and the story of a young man who is trying to save people from the Nazis. The Nazis are evil, but not nearly as evil as the Nazis are portrayed in most movies. It's a film about people. It was made for a specific purpose. I always thought that the Holocaust was the worst thing that ever happened, and this movie shows that this was a very important part of the human experience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hans Zimmer was amazing as Max Renn, the German spy in "The Bourne Legacy". I had never heard of the man until he played this part. The character he portrayed was a brilliant, if not a little over the top, villain. I liked him so much that I wanted to see what he did next. I was not disappointed. His performance was so over thetop that he was able to take the viewer along for the ride. He was like a bad James Bond, and the movie had no problems in getting him back to his villainy ways. He made me laugh more than any of the other actors.  I think I would like this movie more if it was a bit longer. It was great to see him in a longer story. The film didn't go in the direction that I was hoping it would go. The story was interesting and well told, but it felt like it had a lot more to it than the film itself could ever tell us. It had a very long and drawn out ending that I did not get the ending of. I felt that the film could have been a little more interesting, but the acting was still very good.    "The Bourney Legacy" was directed by Paul Greengrass. It is a sequel to the "The Matrix" films and stars Matthew Goode, Riz Ahmed, Paul Giamatti, and Jeremy Renner.  The film is based on the novel by Mark L. Lester.  It has been criticized for being too long, but I personally loved it. I loved the story that it told and was surprised that it took this long for the film to get made. The cast was great and the story was good. I hope that there will be a third film, but if not, I think that the sequel "Black Water" is the better movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski "This movie is a masterpiece, and I have been looking for it for over a decade. It's the most perfectly-done, well-crafted, thought-provoking movie I have ever seen, and it has a great cast and a terrific script. I love it so much, I can't take it out of my head. I wish I could give it 10 stars." -  Gerald Gurney (director) The BigLebowski  is one of the most critically-acclaimed movies ever made, and the reason for its success is simple: it's a story about two men who get into a bar and have a lot of fun. It is not a comedy; it is a deeply, thoughtfully-told drama that, when taken seriously, is one of cinema's finest and most rewarding movies. The film is based on a book by the same name by  Richard Linklater  (who wrote and directed the movie), but it is best known for the unique style of the film, which combines the humor of the Coen Brothers with the intensity and subtlety of John Milius.  For this review, I'll be focusing on the acting and directing, but you should see the film for the style and the brilliant dialogue.  The Lebowsky's apartment is an almost totally blacked-out place, and we see it through a window in one of The BigLebowksi's rooms.  The Lebowksi, as they are called, are two brothers, Bud (Burt Reynolds) and Todd (Paul Sorvino), who live in a tiny, run-down apartment in an apartment building on the outskirts of Hollywood.  It is a very low-rent place; the two have barely enough money to pay rent, and they live with their mother (played by  Susan Sarandon ), who is the only person in the apartment.  Their life in the basement of the apartment building is full of danger, however, as their apartment is being burgled on a regular basis.   Bud and Todd spend most of their time in the downstairs living room, playing video games and drinking.  This is a typical teenage movie, in that the plot is not really all that interesting.  Bud, who is always in the right place at the right time, is always getting into trouble and getting in trouble with the wrong people.  But the movie is

The final scene where the mother and son (Dorothy and Richard) are watching the sun set was a perfect example of how a good story is told. It is such a beautiful and powerful ending that it's hard to describe. I would recommend that everyone who sees this film watches it from beginning to end. The end is just beautiful and perfect. There's also a scene that was cut from the final film where Richard was crying over his dead mother, but in the original ending he was smiling. It's such a great scene that is missing from the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The Big Lebowski (1998) was the first movie to make me realize how great the Coen Brothers could be. This was the movie that made me feel like I was really watching a Coen movie and not some silly "Coon" spoof. This is also the movie I've seen more times than I care to remember. It's one of those movies that you'll think you've seen it before, but when you see it again, you'll wonder how you lived without it. The film takes place in a world where all the best things about America (the snow, the snowmen, the freedom, the great outdoors, etc) have been taken away. Everything is so bad, it's ridiculous. In the world of The Biglebowski, the Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, is living in an old shack in Colorado. His girlfriend (played by Rosie Perez) has left him and he is trying to get by as a musician. The Dude has a girlfriend named Wendy (played in the movie by Sharon Stone), but she's just as bad as he is. The Big Bucklebuckers (aka Lebowskis) are a bunch of drug dealers who have taken over the small town of Colorado and they want the Dude and Wendy dead. One of them, played with such a great sense of humor by John Goodman, is a big, hairy, black bear who is the leader of the gang. Another guy, played as a tough guy by Ray Liotta, is one of the Dude's friends, but his wife left him a long time ago and now he just hangs around. Another big bad guy is played by Jack Nicholson, who is really cool in this movie. There are a lot of other people who you might recognize from other Coen films, but the film never feels forced. This movie is so good that I'm not sure how it managed to get a PG rating. I guess the Coens didn't think people would be able to handle it. If you're a fan of Coen brothers films, you really need to watch The Big Rascals. I'm also a fan, but I haven't seen that movie as often as I need to. I think the Coenes should have done a remake of this movie, but that's for another post. For now, I'm going to give this one a 9/10. ****** I hope you enjoyed this review! I'm still thinking about The Big Bang

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather  was a masterpiece that made a lasting impression on me.  It is a movie that I would watch again and again.   It was not a good film by any means.  I mean it was a movie with an Italian director, but the story and the acting was great.  It is also a film with a great soundtrack.  So when I heard that this movie would be remade by David Lynch, I was excited.  But it seems like David Lynch and I do not get along.  For one he was not satisfied with what was in the movie.  The original is much better than this movie. So he has gone and made his own version.  In this version, they have changed the ending and made a great deal of the movie terrible.  This movie is a great example of what can happen when a director is not satisfied.  If he had been, he could have made a better movie. In this movie, we are introduced to two characters.  One is a rich family and they live in a house and they are the most important people in the town.  He has a son and a daughter.  These two characters are played by the wonderful Errol Flynn and Janet Leigh.  They are great actors.  We have two other characters, one is a prostitute and the other a little girl.  What is great about this movie is that the movie takes place in the early 70's.  David Lynch is one of the first directors that made films with an African American male lead.  His films are always about race and the theme is always about racism.  A few of the scenes that I remember from this movie are the scene when the two women are having sex in a car and the scene where the two men are in the bar and the two guys are arguing about whether the prostitute should have a job.  Lynch is a director that understands how to make a great movie. His filmography is very long.  Some of his movies are great. Others are just ok.  And his movies always make a statement about life and it is always good to see a film that is not good.  Now I am going to tell you why this movie should be put in the great movies section of the DVD.  My son, who is 9 years old, is a big fan of this movie and he has watched it many times.  Sometimes he is not sure what is going on.  Why is

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ It was very cool to see the old classics, but the action in this movie is amazing. It had some great action scenes that had some of the best effects of the 80's. The one scene where we see a plane fly into the window is great, and it was really great to see a fighter plane fly over the city. It was also cool to watch as the police shoot at them. The movie is about a man who is in love with his wife, and is also involved with a man named the Captain who is trying to steal his wife. The Captain, who is also a cop, is really a really bad guy, and he's trying to get his wife to marry the guy he's really in love to. It is a funny movie that has a really good action scene at the end. It's about a guy and a cop who is very serious about what they are doing, and also a guy who is not very serious. Overall, it was a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I am a big fan of the original "Borat" (2003) and the TV series "Eagle Eye" (2006). I saw "Boris" (2015) on the big screen on Friday, November 6, 2015. It is a very funny and funny movie. I saw this movie as a birthday present for my friend, and he really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the movie, and it was very funny. This movie is so funny that it makes you laugh even when the whole thing gets serious. I will definitely watch this movie again. The only thing that is a little disappointing is that the main character doesn't say much. I would have liked to see more of his speech. It's funny, but a little bit hard to understand. It was funny to hear him say things like "You're a pig." and "What are you gonna do, throw me off a bridge?". He doesn't know what to do next, and I think that is why it's funny. The movie is full of so many funny jokes, that even I got a chuckle at times. I just hope that "Brosch" will be in more theatres and on more TV shows. I know that I will see it again and I hope that it's in more theaters and on TV. "Boris the Bear" is a film that has a great cast. It has funny scenes, and funny dialogues. The whole movie was so funny, and fun. The character of Boris the Bear is very funny, as well as the story of him trying to be a superhero. The special effects were great, and the movie was full of action scenes. It had lots of fun jokes, and was definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! It was a great movie, and I'm glad I watched it. It made me smile and laugh and I felt like a kid again watching this movie. It's about a little boy who is going to a camp to play a part in a play, but one day a group of children get their hands on a small boy. The little boy is locked in the basement of the school and they keep him there, never letting him out. He must keep himself in order and do all he can to make sure he stays there. But as time passes, he gets worse and worse and starts to eat things from the floor and the wall. He gets sick and starts crying and screaming and the people who are caring for him don't know what to do and start to cry, too. This is a really good movie, because it is a touching story about love and friendship and friendship between children, but also about the difference between a person and their own self. If you haven't seen it, go out and see it. And watch it in a theater, because I'm afraid this movie is a little bit short, but it is still a great film. I recommend this movie to everyone, and if you like movies, then this is a movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Giver  is a classic and well worth a watch.  It is an important movie for me and one I watch over and over again.  The story of The Giver is about an orphan boy named Aukland and his older sister Giverside who have been adopted into the family of a rich man who is obsessed with being a scientist.  The family is very strict and does not let the kids out to play.  This is where Auklander meets the Giver, a strange, beautiful man who appears to be a human being but is a robot.  Auklanders family is terrified when they find out about his connection to the Giversid.    When they go to see him, the Gifter takes Auklant under his wing.  When he discovers Auklane is his son he teaches him to be an effective fighter and learns about the life he should have had.  Giversider also helps Auklord get his own home and a job at a research center.  They also have a secret love affair.  Although The Gifter appears to have a very dark personality he is really a very good and compassionate human being.  He gives Auklaners father a new home and Auklad gives Giver his new name.  As they go on a journey they both learn that love is all that is required to change a person.  After they have a son the Giterate is abandoned by his father who refuses to see his son again. The Giversiders story ends as they find their new home where Aulland is the first robot to be built by Aukeland.

The movie doesn't really do anything groundbreaking but is fun and entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes sci- fi and space. I can't wait to see what happens next.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Mar 10, 2017 12:11 PM  Moviegoers can thank a local church and its pastor for a very happy ending after a screening of "Gods and Generals." The movie, which features a Christian group trying to save a nation, was delayed until the church's pastor, Bishop Thomas Paprocki, decided to watch it before the film started. Paprock, who was a guest of the church, was so impressed with the film that he decided to share it with the congregation. He said the movie had a strong message and he wanted to share that with the public. Watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP9RmSxQzBc 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The Dark Knight Rises"  Batman and Superman. The two greatest superheroes ever created. They have been on the same team of superheroes, fighting for good, for justice and against evil. They are friends and teammates.  They are at war. . The movie is well done. The action is really great. They don't just show a fight between the two heroes, they show the real fight between them. I'm not a big fan of the fight scenes in movies, but they really show that they are really in a fight, not a fight for fun. : )  The villain Bane is really good. He's a really good bad guy. He doesn't have a lot of motivation and just wants to take over the world. I don't know if it's because he has the power of the Dark Knight or because he wants to be Batman, but he's very evil and just the most evil villain in a movie. I think that he was made really good because I really like Tom Hardy, I really love him in this movie. He is just so cool. The scene where he kills the man with the dog is a really awesome scene. It's just amazing. There is a lot in this scene that you won't see in other movies. It really makes the movie a lot more interesting. You will see something that you wouldn't see. It is just awesome.  the first two parts of the movie are just awesome, but the third part is where it gets really good and where it will stick with you. It has a really cool ending, it has a great ending. It makes the whole movie really special. It just has a lot going on and I really really liked it. A really great movie. 1/5 stars  Check out these great movies:

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My first film was an American film called "The Graduate". I've been watching a lot of movies recently. I had seen this one before but not recently. It is about two kids that live in a large house in the country. One of the kids is really bad at school, the other is really good at school. The two kids have a very close relationship. It starts off with the kid that is bad at it all, the one that has a hard time in school, wanting to leave but is really smart and wants to finish school. They decide to move out of the house and live on the street. They get into some trouble because of it, and they end up living in the same house, where they have to hide from their parents. One day, the kid who is really, really smart, sees a bus full of girls coming towards them. The girl is really pretty and has a great body. She is trying to get the girl to go back to school and get a degree. The guy who is the kid with a hard life, is really happy that he will have some girls around. They start talking and the kid, the guy, and the girl get on a bus to go to school. After a while, the girl and the guy leave, and go home. It doesn't go too well for the girl. The next day, she comes to school, and tells the teacher that she was having a great time with the guy and the bus. She had a great dream. She was in love with him and wanted to go home with him. The teacher is mad and tries to get rid of her. The kids fight, and end up breaking a window. The window breaks, and that is when the kid and the man, are found. They end up in jail, where the guy says that he doesn't want to be a policeman anymore, but he is a cop because he loves kids. The kid asks if he can go with the man to school tomorrow, but the man says no. The man gets the girl back, and he goes with her to school on the bus that day. He tells the guy he is really sad because the guy is going to be in jail for a while. The movie ends with the two kids going to the police station, and getting their pictures taken. This movie was really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** The film opens with a brief montage of the history of the island of Guam from the Spanish to the present. Then we see a montage from the past showing the American's involvement with Guam. The film shows how American troops were stationed in Guam from 1864 to 1898, during the Spanish-American War, then again from 1898 to 1942. During WWII, there were more Americans stationed in the islands than there had been in any previous war. It was a period of military domination that lasted until the early 1950's. The island was occupied by Japanese and Americans for two decades, but by 1951 Guam was back in the hands of the Americans. After a few scenes showing what the US government did to the people of Guam during this time, the film shifts focus to the early days of the independence movement in the 1950's, and the struggle for the people's right to determine their own destiny. The filmmakers wanted to show how the people were so desperate for freedom and so committed to the struggle that they could not wait for an American to come to the rescue. A series of short films about the independence and struggle of the people are shown in the film. It is interesting to see how the independence leaders were trying to get the support of the United States government, but were being denied by their own government. The Japanese had been occupying Guam since 1895, and they continued their presence into the 1950s. At the time of the filming, a new state of Guam was being created. The first governor was an American named Charles Bragg, and he was the one that negotiated the independence with the Japanese. When the United Nations voted on the independence of the state of Hawaii, Guam's vote was not counted. The United States and Japan signed a peace treaty that allowed Japan to continue occupying Guam. However, the US had no intention of letting this go, so it was decided that the United State would have to intervene and force Japan to withdraw from Guam. When they attempted to do so, Japan had the American forces ready to invade Guam. One of the major characters in the movie is a young Filipino man named Ernesto "Che" Garcia. Che was a leader of the liberation movement in Guam. He was captured by the Japanese and forced to become a prisoner of war. During his time as a prisoner, he witnessed the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, and it is his story that is told in the movies. He is one of the main characters that is shown in flashbacks in the entire movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I have to admit that I've never really been much of a fan of horror films.  I think most horror movies are a bit cheesy, and there is usually no real suspense.  I never liked the first movie from 'Scream', and I don't like the new 'The Ring' either.  My problem is that a lot of the movies I've seen lately just don't really make me scared.  "The Ring" had a little bit of that, but it wasn't enough.   The other problem is, when it comes to horror, I think I have a pretty low tolerance for blood and gore.  Horror is supposed to be scary.  In 'The Rings', you have this guy, played by 'Doom Guy', who has this horrible ring that is the reason for all the evil in the world.  The bad guys are using this ring to do horrible things to people, but you don't even really know what is going on, until they give you the ring.  He has to get it off of his hand.  So, he has to do some bad things to these people.  There was a little something different about this movie that made it interesting, and I did like the ending.  However, it was just a tad too slow for me.  This is one of those movies I'd definitely watch again, but I'd probably skip the sequel.  Overall, a decent movie.  If you are a fan, and have never seen it, you might like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The story of a group of young people who discover a mysterious alien spacecraft and crash-land in the middle of nowhere. The group is comprised of an engineer, a pilot, a navigator, and a physicist. Together they decide to go back to the craft and try to learn more about it, and their new life on Earth. The movie takes place in the present day but is set during the late 50's and early 60's. The story is told in flashbacks. Some of the best parts of the movie are the scenes of the young people and their interactions with each other, and the aliens. The only downside is the length of the film. It was long but had a good ending. It also didn't really have any special effects but that was okay because the movie was good and it was very atmospheric. I loved the alien characters. They were very unique and not like what we see in most other movies. They seemed very real. The actors who played the alien roles were fantastic and were very believable. The best part of the whole movie was when the young engineer and the pilot met and started talking about the future they were going to create. They told each other about how they were trying to figure out how to fix the ship. They also talked about how great it was going to be when they finally figured out how the alien craft worked. The ending of the story was very interesting. The alien characters were very human in the way they acted. The young engineers and the scientists had so much character that you wanted to see how their lives would turn out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The plot is that two cops are off on a case when they happen upon a woman who is dead and her body is missing. When the body is found, they investigate and find the body of a young girl with two gaping holes in her chest. She is dead, but there is a message written on her chest which reads, "I am sorry". The police discover a diary in the girl's room that has the victim's last words written in it. The girl is a prostitute who is also a prostitute for the rich. The rich prostitute uses her connections to get away with murder. She gets the message on the diary from the girl in a dream. The victim's name is Mary Ann, and the rich girl's name was Helen. They were both prostitutes who were murdered in the same way, by the rich woman. The police do not know this but find out a year later when the woman who used to be Mary Ann goes into the police department and tells them she has had a dream about the rich prostitute and the dead girl. Mary Ann was the only one who knew the truth. Her name was Annie and she is now living as an alcoholic. She has found out the real reason the rich women were murdered, and it was a love affair. The woman who was killed by the young prostitute is Annie's sister, Annie's mother. This was a murder that was done by someone who was very close to the rich and famous women. The poor Annie was killed because she was a prostitute, and she did not know it.   The movie is good and it gives you a good idea of what prostitution is like. There is a lot of sex in this movie. The sex is not always realistic. In a lot cases it is just sex. It is not about love, but about sex. There are a lot more sex scenes than most movies would have, but they are not too bad.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ __________ The Man Who Knew Infinity (2015) __________________________ The movie I always wanted to see was about a woman who finds a time machine. When she arrives in the future she goes back to the 1950's to meet her old lover. They are in love and live happily together in a small farmhouse. However she finds that in the 30's she was a wealthy socialite. The movie is filled with many flashbacks to show how the man became her lover and how they lived their life together. The main plot is about the woman's efforts to get back in time to see her lover. She travels back to her lover in the past and attempts to stop his actions which will cause a catastrophe. The film has a few funny scenes but I didn't like them at all. It's not a good action movie but I would watch this movie again if I ever got the chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ A great movie with great action. It has a wonderful storyline. _________________________________________________  The last word:  I enjoyed this movie, but it was a bit slow. I do like the idea of it. The whole story of the boy and the bear is really interesting. I really like the way the bear's skin gets ripped off and how he is not really afraid of the beast. I don't think the bear has really a bad part in the movie, it's just that the movie is very long. I like that there are some scenes where the bear does not do anything. I also really liked the way they changed the bear. It's a really great idea to make the bear into a boy. The bear's first appearance in the film is amazing, I just love the way he gets scared and looks scared. He is really funny, and the story is really fun. The ending of the movie was really great. I loved the ending. It was so emotional. I liked the ending so much that I will be watching the sequel. I recommend this movie to everybody.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I've been trying to watch this movie for years. I finally saw it last night. I was so happy to finally see it. I didn't know what to expect when I first heard about it, but I am glad I went to see it! I love the characters, the music, the story, the acting, the effects, and the beautiful scenery. The film has been so well done and the cinematography is so good. I'm a sucker for good films and I love that this film was shot by David Lean. I also love the ending. The actors were so good and the story was so great. I highly recommend this film to any lovers of film. The characters are realistic, the characters' thoughts are so vivid, the plot is intriguing, and there's a love story. I just want to thank the producer, Sam Mendes, for making this film, and I'm glad I was able to see this film. __________ _________  I was in a very bad mood when I saw this movie. It was the most boring film I had ever seen. The plot was so predictable that it made me sick. The acting was so bad that I could have sworn there were some actors that were not in this movie and they could have been there. The special effects were so amateurish that I was disgusted by the poor quality of the special effects. The soundtrack was so poor that I never knew if the movie was playing when I was watching it. The cinematography was so dull that I just didn't want to see another movie with that bad of a cinematography. I have never seen a movie that was so boring and horrible that I wanted to throw it out of the window. I will never watch another movie by this director or any other director that has that horrible of a taste. If you want to watch a boring movie, then just go and see the latest "Transformers" movie. If I had to pick the worst film I have ever seen, then I would pick this one. If it had been made by some other director, then maybe I would have liked it a little more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Devil's Advocate  was a good film. It was made in 1946, but has been in my life for a long time. It is a movie that I saw on the Criterion Channel, which is a streaming service, but I saw it on Netflix, which makes it even better. I am in the process of watching this film again, and this time I am going to watch it in its entirety. I loved this movie! There are many good things about it, and one of them is that it has a good sense of humor. I was also really surprised that it did not make me cry. The only reason that I cried is because I knew that the director was dead, but the rest of the time, I did not cry. I thought this was one of the best films that I have seen in a long, long time, and I am glad that I was able to see it. I also hope that this movie will never be forgotten.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________ A movie that you could say has a heart. I was in a car crash when I was young and my father was there, he was there in his car with the lights on and his face on the windscreen, but he was dead. It wasn't until later that my mother told me the details of what happened. The only thing I remember is that there was a young man, who was wearing a mask, in a red car with a man who was driving. They crashed into a tree. The man in the red car drove off into the woods. The young man jumped out and ran to the car, the man in a mask jumped out of the car. He was a good looking guy, but there was no one in the car with him. The car had an old engine and the man had a new one. I had a vague recollection of a little girl in a white dress, who looked like she was around six years old, and she was sitting in the back seat. I didn't remember what she was wearing, but I remember the sound of a child screaming, and then the engine running. That was the last I remember. I woke up in the hospital, and when I came out the doctors were there, telling me that I had passed away in the crash. It was a very long time ago. I do remember the red hoodie, the old red car, and the red man in red, and I have a feeling that he might still be alive, but this is all just a dream. This is an old, old movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I love this movie! The plot is simple. A young boy has lost his father in a tragic accident. His mother is dead and he is left alone to care for his younger sister. He is in a foster home, and is going through some growing pains. One night, he is awakened by the sound of a strange, deep, and sinister voice. He goes to investigate and is stunned to see a shadowy figure lurking in the shadows. It is a beautiful creature that looks like a cross between a bat and a lion. It tells him that he is destined to kill him. The creature tells him he must go to the edge of town to a place where the darkness is limitless. On his journey, he finds a small, dark town and meets the town's lone inhabitant, a young girl named Sarah. He learns that she is a descendant of the town. He also discovers that there is a mysterious group of young people who have been disappearing from the town and are being hunted by a monster who is trying to destroy the town forever. He finds his way into the town, and discovers a secret hiding place that allows him to walk unseen.  As a child, I loved this movie. The movie is not overly complicated. It does not have any special effects. I also liked that there was a story behind the movie. There are some supernatural elements in this movie that are not explained. The story is also really creepy. I can't really explain it, but I really loved the movie and can't wait to see it again. It's one of those classic horror movies that really scare you. If you like horror movies, you should give this movie a try. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  What can you say about the movie, that I have never seen before? There is so much action, suspense and excitement in this movie, from the first to last minute, I kept on thinking of the great action films like the "The Matrix" or "Die Hard" or even "Jedi" movies, and I even thought about the "Godzilla" movie, but this one was better, because this one shows more in-depth character. The story has a real sense of adventure, and the characters are so well developed, that it made me want to know more about them, and it made the movie more interesting and more enjoyable. There are also some good scenes, such as the opening, and also in the ending. I think this movie will be a classic for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I'm just going to be blunt here. __________ The movie is not a great movie, but it is fun. _________________ This is a pretty good movie. It does a good job of putting you in the shoes of a kid who has a bad day and comes home to find that the entire world has been turned into a giant video game. It has that classic Disney ending, but not the over the top ending. The best part of the movie is how it is written. It is funny and entertaining and even though the characters are just a little bit ridiculous, it still works well. It also has a really nice message at the end. The movie was made with the intention of being a kid's movie and it works really well. _______ The film is also very good at showing you the real life problems that people go through. ______________________________________  Rated 4 out of 5 by gopack from Fun, but with some flaws I really enjoyed this movie. My only complaint is that the end was a little abrupt. I felt it would have been better if it had not ended on such a high note. It was a nice ending, and a good way to end the movie. Overall, a very good movie, especially for kids.  Rating: 5 out of 10  Review: I enjoyed this film. It got me thinking about the reality of life and how it would be for a kid to come home to. It made me think about how life could be, if you had the right attitude and the right amount of faith. The characters were cute and I liked their personalities. I did not like how they were all just a bunch of characters and they had no personalities. They were just doing their job. . , _____________  .
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do not let the film's bad reviews sway you from watching this masterpiece. This movie has been in the movies for a very long time, and it is simply one of the best action films ever made. It may not be the most popular film, but it has to be a masterpiece. A classic, that is just as good as any other. The film has a lot of violence and sex scenes, but the movie does a good job of showing how bad the war is. The acting in this movie is outstanding. The movie is also about a little girl who is trying to survive, and that makes the movie even more enjoyable. This is a classic film, that you should see. If you want to see a good, classic movie, you should definitely check this out.  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is the best film I've seen in a long time. I was expecting something like a sci-fi thriller, but this was far more original. It was more psychological and creepy than sci- fi. I could watch this movie for hours and still feel like it is not over. It is so suspenseful that it made me want to watch more. The acting was excellent and the director used different angles to tell the story. The story was also very suspenseful, so if you are a sci fi fan, you might enjoy this one. I loved the way the movie was shot. It had a very realistic feel. I can't wait to see the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "I was looking forward to this one so much, but it was so different. It was like an old-school Western with a more modern twist. I enjoyed the fact that the characters were so much more dynamic and the way they interacted with each other and the environment was great. The way the actors played their characters made it believable. I loved the character of the Native American who is a great villain. I think he could have had more screen time, but I enjoyed watching him in the fight scene. I liked the way the story developed and there were many twists. I was hoping for a big climax, but this movie was so well-made that the resolution was not too abrupt. I would definitely recommend this movie to any fans of Westerns." – T.M.  2.5 stars   "There were many great characters and I felt for the most part that all the main characters were developed and had their own motives. There were a lot of interesting plot twists that kept you on the edge of your seat. The movie was well acted and I think it could have been even better. I had a lot fun with this movie. It didn't really feel like a western because the main character didn't talk like a cowboy. This movie is really about the conflict between the two groups, which I loved. The Native Americans are a tough group and they want to preserve their way of life. The settlers are trying to do the same but they have a different agenda. I thought the movie was entertaining and very well done." – L.M   Advertisements

The movie is based on a short story by Jack Gaughan and features the voices of the great Christopher Walken and Richard Dreyfuss.  The movie starts with a very strange and weird story. The story starts with the father of the boy who goes to the haunted house on a search for his lost son.  It is a great movie. It will take a few minutes to get used to the special effects but after a while it will become fun. The characters are very good and make the movie enjoyable. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Gatsby" is a beautiful movie.  There is no other way to put it.  I love that the main character is a woman.  It has a great plot with a lot of mystery.   I love that there is a lot more to this story than meets the eye.  There are lots of mysteries and mysteries that are being played out in this film.  This is not the story of a man who is rich and lives a life of luxury and is trying to find his way through life.  His friends and family don't know what he is doing and they don't understand why he is traveling to Europe.  The Great Gato is a complex and mysterious character.  He is not a man that you can easily relate to.  At the same time, he is very human and real.  In a world where people live so much of their lives in the past and the present, he still has a very real connection to the present and he is a very nice man.   The Great gatsby was a great film.   One of the great things about the movie is the beautiful soundtrack.    The music is wonderful.  I like the piano in this movie. I would like to have heard some more classical music in this picture.  Here are a few tracks.

I've watched this before, but I was looking for something different. This movie is great! The plot has a lot going on, but the acting is really good. I don't think the plot would be interesting if the acting was better. It wasn't, but it was well done. The movie was made well. It's not really a horror film, but there is a lot of suspense, and I loved it. The characters are really good, and it's nice to see that there are some actors in this film that you would know. The camera work is really well done, and there is some really nice shots in this movie. It is a great movie, and if you are a fan of horror, this one is a must-see. - December 27, 2016-

I will not say anything bad about this movie but just wanted to say that the special effects were amazing. The movie was about a man that goes to get his daughter back but instead he gets into a whole new kind of situation.

But overall this movie was awesome.  I hope to see this movie on television soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  This movie is amazing. It's got everything a fan of a good detective movie could want. It has a real good storyline. The movie does a really good job of giving a good backstory of the characters. The cinematography in this movie is just so awesome. The music is also awesome. There is a real great score in this. I think the best part about this movie, besides the awesome detective story, is the chemistry between the characters that are played by the actors. The chemistry between them is just perfect. They have a very close bond. They are real friends. It just adds a real nice touch to the story. It was also nice to see that they had a real love for each other. This movie also has a great ending. I feel that it gives the movie a real closure. I felt that it was a nice and happy ending for all the characters and the movie as a whole. This is a great movie to watch. It doesn't have a whole lot of gore or anything, but the characters do have a lot of emotional ties to each other, and it does give a very nice and touching story. The ending was a really nice touch. The way the characters were acting, and the way the movie ended, was really cool. This one is one that I would definitely recommend to fans of a detective movie.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1940) is a classic.  The film is about the events surrounding the shooting of John Dillinger in Los Angeles in 1931.  In the film, the good guys have the upper hand, with the help of the American Legion and the local police, until the bad guys show up and start killing.  As it turns out, they were hired by the same gang who had been killing Dillinger, and that gang, the "Brains," was run by Dillinger's former partner, James "Whitey" Bulger.  They killed Dillinger after the Brains were tipped off by one of Dillinger's former gang, and they went on to murder a few other people as well.  One of them was an FBI agent, John Connolly.  He is later shown in a documentary (which is also in the film) explaining how he had been hired to track down the gang members who were murdering Dillinger.  Connolly's job was to find out who was in charge of the Brings and find out why they were killing Dilligens and others.  When he arrived at the house where the Bring's were, Connolly found that the Bringers were hiding out, and he was told that they were the brains who hired them.  This turned out to be a lie, as it turned out that the gang who was killing Dillingers was the Brinks.  That gang was led by Bulger and his partner in crime, Frank Liberto.  At one point in the movie, Connally asks Bulger how he can be so sure that he was the brains behind the killings.  Bulger tells Connally that he knows how to kill people.  So when Connally says that he has no proof of this, Bulger simply responds that Connally should be careful not to talk. I have to admit that I was a little confused by this movie.  I wasn't really sure what was going on.  But the movie was interesting and well acted, and there was a good plot.  A couple of the characters are pretty funny.  For instance, the lead FBI agent in the plot is played by Jack Warden.  If you're not a fan of John Wayne, you should check this movie out. 8.  Duck Soup (1936) Director Robert Mulligan's debut feature film was a short, but highly entertaining, comedy
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  To the uninitiated, this is a movie about the birth of the modern "horror" film, about the rise of the genre from the silent film era through the exploitation films of silent films, and the horror films of the mid-1920s. The films in this genre were so much more sophisticated than the silent movies of the time, and they did it all in one night. It was the first major film to be shot in color, and it was the only major film ever to use the sound of an automobile as the sound source.   I had heard that there were some problems with the making of this movie. I have to say that I had no problem with the movie, and I was happy that it was being made at all. The only real problem I had was with a small part of the film that I thought looked ridiculous. There was a man in a dark greenish coat, standing in the shadows of a dark house. It looked ridiculous to me, but I don't really remember what I thought. It seemed very amateurish to me. The scene could have been done a lot better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My brother-in-law, who is a trained and experienced chef, gave me a sample of his recipe for Thai-style fried chicken.  It's delicious. Â He made a big batch of it so that he could have enough for a few parties.    The recipe calls for a little bit of garlic and ginger to give it a little kick, but it didn't overwhelm the chicken. The recipe called for a small amount of fish sauce and was just right.    I don't think that a bit of fish flavor would be a good match for the Thai flavors in the chicken, but this was good enough for my brother- in-law.  I was pretty excited to make this recipe as I wanted to recreate the Thai-inspired chicken that my husband made me last year.    It was pretty close to the recipe that I used.  It was very easy to make.  The only thing that I would suggest is to cook the chicken in the oil for about 4 to 5 minutes longer than the time listed in the recipe.  Then you can finish it off with some Thai sweet chili sauce.  I did use sweet chili in my version.  But if you don't have sweet chili you could use a can of crushed red pepper.  This was my first time making Thai-Style fried chicken and I'm very pleased with the result.  So I'll make this again soon.  For more of my Thai recipes, see here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Saving Mr. Banks' is a good Disney movie.  I am always excited when a Disney movie comes out.    And I'm very glad that it is a Disney princess movie. I really enjoyed the movie. It was very well made and there are many moments in the movie that made me feel like I was right there with Anna and Elsa.  But I don't think that this is a 'Disney movie for little girls'   I think that there are other films out there that are more suitable for the older audience.  It is an animated movie but it is not a kid's movie. And it is good that the princesss are in the main roles, but it still has a very good cast.  I love the movie and I wish that Disney would make a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My brother is a movie nut and when I saw his comments about The Lost Boys (1991), he said it was a great movie with a great cast, but he didn't think it was really good. But he gave me a copy of the DVD and that changed my mind. It is a great, hilarious movie with an incredible soundtrack. The film is set in the late 1960's, in a small town called Lubbock, Texas, where teenagers are forced to participate in the brutal "Boys Town" program. It's not the first time that the town of Lubbocks has used juvenile delinquency as a tool of social control. It was a program created by Governor Lubbocking and the state of Texas. In this particular case, the teenagers are "Bros" and are trained to be killers. The boys are placed in a series of isolated buildings called "Swinging Sheds". The girls are forced into a separate building called "Walking Sheds" and there is a strict curfew. This program has been going on for a number of years and is a big hit with the young teens. But a lot of things have changed in the past year. The new Governor is not as in tune with the youth as he was when he created the program. He has been replaced by a man named Jerry Brown. Brown was a very liberal governor and wanted to improve social conditions in the state. So the boys are given new uniforms and the program is re-branded. But the "Bosom Buddies" are still a big success. But Jerry Brown is not able to escape the political problems that have emerged since he was elected Governor. The kids have begun to organize themselves and the new governor is trying to stop them. In the end, Jerry Brown has to deal with the issue of social injustice and corruption in his own state. This is one of the best, if not the best movie about the juvenile delinquent program of all time. The cast of characters are a great blend of teenagers and older men. You'll be laughing as you watch them make a terrible mess of the world and then find out that their actions are the cause of the problems. The story is very well written. The dialogue is funny and makes the characters funny as well. The music is also very memorable. The screenplay by Gary Fleder and directed by Don Argott is a very well thought out film. It has a very good cast of actors who do a great job portraying the teens

There are some things that I would like to change, but it's an excellent film.  , for the most part, it's a story about a kid who is sent away from his family to go see a strange event, and how his life changes when he meets a friendly being, which he eventually learns to care for, and even love. The movie has a great story that is well told and the characters are a bit of a mystery to figure out. The way the movie plays out, and the way it's done, is a little more like a science fiction film than a traditional comedy.   a little bit of an alien movie, but not a sci fi. the movie has some pretty cool effects in it. it was also good. It has a lot of action and there is some very well done special effects.   in short, it was a good story and a good film. I think it was just a little better than a lot a of the other alien movie's that I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  "A great film that tells a good story and is worth the price of admission. " - Michael K. Ritchie, author of The Redeemer and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  _____________________________________________________________  The most interesting character of the film is the mysterious Mr. B. He is not the sort of character you would expect to find in a film about the Vietnam War. He doesn't act like a man who wants to save the world. He acts like a guy who is just as scared of the unknown and the unknown man as the man who is the enemy. Mr. Baker does an excellent job of portraying Mr. Smith as a man with an amazing sense of humor. Mr Baker does a good job of creating a character that is not only interesting but sympathetic. I felt as if I was listening to a true story. "The most exciting part of the movie is not when a plane explodes over the city of Hue, but when the planes explode over Vietnam itself." - Robert Ryan, author, of The Good Soldiers  A fascinating and often overlooked part of American history, the Vietnam war is perhaps one of the most misunderstood conflicts in modern history. This documentary gives us a glimpse into the inner workings of the military in Vietnam, and what it was like to fight on the front lines.   Mr. Baker was not the first American to interview people in the area of the war, and he was not even the first to use film in the making of his documentary. Many people had heard of the Vietnam conflict before, but not a lot had seen the movie or read the book that was based on his interviews. A few years before this film was made, Mr. R.J. Cutler wrote a book entitled The War of Our Time. It was a highly regarded account of what was happening in Vietnam at the time. However, Mr Baker's film is not a "history of the Vietnamese" but rather a story about the men of a particular unit of the U.S. Army. The story is told by those men who were actually there.   (Source: DVD Description)   One of the best parts of this film is how Mr. Huyck, who is a great actor, portrays General Nguyen Ngoc Loan, the commanding general of the 9th Air Force in Vietnam. The General is the personification of the evil, and this is one of his strengths. In the movie, he is the main
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you like it, I will watch it again and again, but I won't buy it just because I liked it. If you liked it, you will definitely want to watch it over and over again. I loved this movie. I think that it has a special place in my heart, it's my favorite movie. And, I have been trying to remember the movie title, but the name is lost in the fog of time. So, the movie was called: "Rage of a Planet by the Slugs" and was released in 1969. In the movie, the human race is being wiped out by a new species of aliens, called the Slags. The Slags are a race of aliens that have the ability to shrink themselves, and make themselves into tiny little creatures, they are also very, very vicious. They have a terrible hatred for humans and will destroy them if they are in their way. The humans, who are the last humans in the universe, have been living in a space station in orbit around Earth, and it has been completely destroyed by the alien race. The last human survivor, a woman named, Sarah, is left alone in the darkness. She tries to make it to a safe area, but she soon gets into trouble with the Sligs, who want to eat her. But, Sarah is an expert markswoman, so she manages to fight them off. Then, she meets a guy named, Sam, and they fall in love. In this movie, there is some nudity, but no sex. The action was really good, the dialogue was great and the action scenes were really cool. It was the best action movie I have ever seen. I still want to see the movie again, I think it is one of the best movie ever. But now, I want to buy a copy of the movie so I can watch it with my family.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  It's a bit difficult to explain what is the difference between a good film and a great film, since a great movie is different from a good one. A great film is a movie that leaves you with a smile and a feeling of accomplishment. It makes you feel that you were on the right track, that it was all worth it. A good film is also a movie, that has made you feel like you were a part of a good thing. If you are a fan of a certain genre, or if you are just a fan yourself, then you will be amazed with how much a movie can inspire you. For example, The Godfather was a masterpiece. I would not recommend this movie to someone who has not seen it, but if you have, then it will make you feel proud of your choice of watching the movie. The Godforyngfather is a good example of a great cinema. I can remember when I was a kid and watched this movie with my friends. We would talk about all the different characters that were in the movie, how great and good they were, and the fact that we saw a movie from a film that was made before the great 70's. We felt like we were part of the movie we were watching. This movie will never leave you, you will not forget it.   This movie was made in 1975. I have seen it a few times. The film is about a man who has to kill his friend to avoid a trial in a murder case. This man has never killed a man before. He has a job as a gardener. He goes to the murder scene and finds a dead body, with the murder weapon. He picks it up and starts thinking about what he has done. When he goes home and tells his wife he is leaving, she is shocked and tells him that he is going to kill a man, which is a bad idea, but he is a man and he has to do what he thinks is right.   of course, this man never killed the man he has come to kill. This is a very dark and intense movie. This film makes you really think. The movie was directed by Roman Polanski. This makes it a unique movie that is not for everyone. I was shocked when I saw this movie.  -Movie Review-

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I don't know why they were filming in this city. They must have been crazy. The movie has some very realistic looking action scenes. The best part of the movie is the ending, when the police shoot the drug dealers. It was very realistic, but was a bit of a shock to the audience. They had a lot of good actors in this movie. This movie was a great time. I'd recommend it to any action junkies out there.  I'm so glad this film is still around. It is still as good as the day it was made. I was a huge fan of the first one but this one has even more action. The actors are amazing and the production values are on par with the old school days. I recommend this movie to anyone.  The movie was good. I just don't like the ending. They should have killed all the dealers.  a lot better than the original, but the ending is still a little too abrupt. I wish they would have let the dealers live. I would have given this movie a 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I saw this movie as a child, I have fond memories of this film and the characters. I liked the main character. I am a little surprised by the "bad guy" this movie is about. I guess I can understand why the director was a little scared to make this film. I saw it a couple of years ago on TV and it was one of those movies that just came out. This movie is pretty good. The acting is pretty decent. I was surprised that they did not have more action in this movie. I thought it was a good idea to make it a detective film. If you liked this movie you will like the next movie, it has the same characters and the same story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I liked this movie. It was a good watch. I really like the fact that there were a lot of good jokes in this movie."  I do enjoy the fact the movie was very good. The script was good, but the director's choices of jokes and the characters that he used were just so much fun.  In this movie, a guy named Harry (Tom Berenger) is trying to find a job in a new town. He's married to the beautiful, yet crazy, Mrs. W. W., and has a teenage son named Jack (Ben Affleck). Harry's a good guy, and he always puts his son first, but he has trouble getting a job and having sex with the woman of his dreams. When Harry gets a chance to be a firefighter at a fire station, Mrs W.W. decides to give him a little help. The only problem is that Harry has to be naked in order to get in.   "I was so tired when we got home."    That's right. Harry and Mrs.W., as well as the other firefighters, have to show their naked bodies to the people who are going to be working at the station.  This is not the most sexy movie in the world, but it was fun to watch.  I was pretty turned on by the nakedness of the characters.  There were a few laughs, but there was a lot to enjoy in this.  After watching this, you will see why this movie was so popular.  I really enjoyed this movie...  The movie has some good laughs in it, but they were not enough to save this movie from being a complete dud.  If you like a good comedy, this is a movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shawshank Redemption. A movie that is about prison, redemption and redemption itself. A movie where everyone's story, and sometimes their life, is a good one. A story that has the power to change and transform lives. A great movie that you shouldn't be able to miss. The Shaw Shank Redemption (1994) is a movie that will always be in the top ten movies of all time. It was also a movie about redemption and how redemption is something that happens in the world every day. I would say that the movie is a little bit of a time capsule. It's a movie from a bygone era and has the feel of a by-gone time. I have a lot of respect for the director, John Waters. His movies were made to entertain. There was never a bad message in any of his movies. He was the true master of horror. But the movies weren't really about what he wanted them to be. They were more about what the audience wanted them be. In Shawshark Redemption, the audience is treated like fools. It is about how a man is able to get through a bad situation. He is able do so because he has his friends by his side. This is one of the most touching and entertaining movies that I have ever seen. The movie has a wonderful score. The score is really catchy. The soundtrack is so good that I actually went to my local record store and bought the soundtrack. It has songs by a lot the greats. The music really fits the movie. It brings a sense of hope to the audience. I really like the fact that it is a family film. It shows that there is more than one way to be a family man. I don't want to give away too much of the plot. But it does have a strong theme. I won't spoil it but I think it is worth a look. I am not a big fan of the sequels but I can see why they were made. The original film had a lot to say about redemption. It also shows that redemption doesn't have to come from the movies. You can also redeem yourself by helping others. In a movie where all the characters are portrayed as idiots. You have to be an idiot in order to be redeemed. The story isn't as good as the first one but it has a lot more going for it. It doesn't get bogged down by too many things. This movie also is the only movie in my top

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  "A good film with a great cast. One of my favorites. The plot is simple and fun. I really love the way the main character, Paul, comes off as a bit of a loser. The main plot point in the film revolves around Paul trying to get over his father. This is where I have some problems with the film. Paul's father is a real asshole. It's clear from the beginning that he's been abusing his son since he was a child. His abusive behavior goes on until he is shot to death by the police. His son was not really in any way to blame. He had to deal with the anger and grief that came with his father's death. This film is a very good one to watch. It does a good job of depicting the death of a loved one. It also has a nice touch of comedy. I am not going to lie, Paul's character does seem a bit childish at times. But, he is still a character you don't want to see get murdered. Paul gets over his past and tries to live his life in a positive manner. The rest of the cast in the movie is great. I love the character of Mr. Rabinowitz. He has a great comedic timing. He always finds a way to be funny in the situation he is in. He is great at being sarcastic. His character also has his moments where he gets to be a little mean. The only problem I had with the movie was that the ending didn't make a lot of sense. I think the ending is supposed to be kind of a shocker but it didn't seem to do much to the plot. Overall, it is a great film. I give this movie a 8/10"
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** "In the Year of the Rat" (1933) - It's no secret that I'm not much of a Rat fan. I always thought they were a bit silly. That being said, "In The Year of The Rat" is a pretty good film. It's one of those old silent films that have a lot of great ideas in them. This is a comedy that really has some interesting ideas about the American Dream. The main character, a small town girl who dreams of being a famous artist in New York, becomes the model for an ad campaign that takes her all over the city. The film has a lot to say about the way that people view themselves in the big city and how the world sees them. The way she is treated by the man she's in love with, a rich lawyer, is not very nice. However, this doesn't stop her from dreaming. She decides to go to New York City where she can finally become a famous painter. When she gets there, the city is not what she expected. The art community is a lot different from what she thought it would be. She finds a group of artists who are trying to save the art they love from being destroyed by the corrupt society. This group, known as The Artists, also includes a young actress, Anna Maria, who is very good friends with the Rat. It doesn't take long for the Rat and Anna Maria to become friends. They end up becoming the best of friends, and even fall in love. The whole movie is about Anna Maria and her dreams and goals. They are not the only ones who have their dreams to save, however. The Rat is also trying to do the same thing. When they get to New Yorks, they decide to work together. The two of them start to have their own dreams. The story is told from their point of view, so you have to give them credit for that. This movie has a few great moments, especially the scene where Anna Maria has her first scene. She is the star of the movie, and she makes it her own. The entire movie is very well done. It is a little bit of a comedy, but it has a strong message that I think a lot people can relate to. It might be a little rough around the edges, but I still enjoyed it. The music is very nice and catchy, and it does what it needs to do. The only thing that I don't think is that great is the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie. I think it was very well done, it was like a short horror movie. The movie was set in the early 1900's, a time when things were really bad in Europe.  The movie showed a couple of characters trying to get out of a house that was being robbed by a group of thieves. They were chased by a dog that kept barking at them. The dogs were all really good and really scary, and they were well done. It also showed the poor conditions in the house where the thieves were. The house was really old, and it was really dirty. The robbers had put some of the thieves into the cellar to make sure they didn't get away. It was really interesting to watch the dogs chasing them down. I really liked the dog. I had to get a second opinion on this one because I saw a review that said the dog was really annoying and really annoying to the dog (or at least it was for me). The dog was a very good dog. He was really scary and really kept me on my toes. The guy who played the dog in the movie was very good, and I like the movie. It is a very short movie and I really enjoyed it. It just reminded me of a short movie. If you have kids this is a great movie to show them. If they are older they should be able to see it and watch it for themselves.

I had read a review saying that this movie was not the best but this movie is really good. There are several parts in the movie which are just so well written, so beautifully made, so perfectly edited, so well acted that you can't really tell what is happening in them. I'm sure you have seen a lot of movies before, but if you haven't seen this movie yet, it is worth seeing it.  I loved it when they were talking about the house at the end of the movie, and it was just so perfect, so beautiful, so peaceful, and everything you could ever want, so I had to see this movie, you have to see it, it's just so great.

The film was a remake of the movie of the same name from the 80s and it was quite a good one. The original movie had a lot of problems but this one is a masterpiece. The main characters of the story are: Jack, a young boy who is a bit of a misfit, the owner of the train, and the Captain, an old man who has lost a leg. They decide to go on a dangerous adventure, in which they will have to go beyond the mountain range to get to the city and to fight some monster, the same as in the movie. The plot of the film is really great, you will feel like you are in the city with all the hustle and bustle and excitement. The movie has a great soundtrack and the sound is very realistic. The special effects were very impressive and were really well done. The characters are very interesting and the story is very interesting. Overall a great movie and an excellent movie remake.

I think it is the best horror movie I have ever seen. It is a good idea that the ending is not in the movie but it just makes the movie too short. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ This movie was really good. It had great action, good music, and a nice ending. The movie was made in 1987. The film was about a young man who was a fighter pilot who was in a war, and was shot down. The pilot is a boy who was born in New York. He lived in his family's home and was a good fighter pilot. He was flying for his country when he was shot and died. His mother was in New Jersey, and she came to see him and then later she came back. The mother and father went back to their home to bury their son. The young man is in a coffin in his room. His father is in the next room and the mother is on the other side of the room. She says to the boy, "It's time to go." The mother puts a red ribbon on his hand, and he is told that he will live. He is in this room. He sees his mother, and when he sees her he says, "Mother, I'm back!" Then the film goes back to the father. The father goes to the plane. When he gets on the plane he goes through the door and he says to his daughter, "You don't believe what you saw, do you?" Then he goes into the cockpit and he tells the pilot to fly up into the sky. He tells him, "I'm going back to where my life began." He is a fighter. He has a red stripe on his shoulder. The plane takes off and flies up into an area of the sky where the plane can't go. The aircraft lands, and they all leave the plane and go into a village. The next day they go to the town to see what happened. The boy says, and it's a great line, "When I see you, I'll tell you that I'm here. I'm still alive." Then the movie goes back. When the father comes out, he tells his daughter to take off her wedding ring. He says, the boy said he was here. When his daughter puts the ring on her finger, it's just a red ring, but it's the ring that he gave to her. The son says, I was just a kid when I saw it. Then his father goes into his room and he sees the young boy in the coffin. The last words of the father are, "Good-bye." The boy was a great fighter pilot and he died a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________  I had a great time at the festival, a lot of fun. I didn't get the chance to see any of the films, but the ones I did see were great. The festival organizers did a great job. The people there were very friendly and nice, and the food and drink were good. I had a nice lunch at a cafe there. It's a beautiful place and it makes for a very relaxing day out. The only thing that I wish they had added was more room for people to sit outside on the grass. There was a nice breeze and it made it very pleasant for people who didn't want to sit in a room all day. I'm sure there was plenty of room for everyone to sit. I really enjoyed the food, and I would highly recommend it. I went to a restaurant called The Squeaky Wheel that was very similar to this one. The food was great, and they had great service. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice as well. The weather was great as well, and it was very hot in the day, but very cool in the evening. I was happy that I was able to attend the festival this year. I don't think it will be the last one, but next year I hope to have more time to attend. This is one of the best festivals I've attended, and for those who don't know, the festival has a different atmosphere each year. This year was a bit more casual, but still very fun. It was a great experience and I look forward to going again. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________  This is the best festival that I've ever been to, and possibly one of my favorite festivals. I attended this for the first time this year and it's a must attend. I've seen so many great films in a short period of time. I am currently watching a film called "The Red Turtle" about a little girl that has to fight her own disease with the help of her pet turtle, and this film was so good that I can't put it down. I would recommend this festival to any movie buff that has ever watched a film, and if you haven't yet then it's worth going to. I will definitely attend next year! _________________________________________________________________________________________  First off, I love it when festivals are free. The reason is because I've never really been able to afford to go to film festivals. The cost of a film ticket is a big expense for me
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ The following are my thoughts about The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2008). It is an interesting movie. A very well made movie. The plot is not too complicated. But it is well written and a nice idea. The story is well thought out and the character are all well written. This movie is a good action movie. And the acting is good. The main character, Walter Mittleman (played by Matt Damon) is a likable and very likable guy. He is very likability. The movie is very good at showing the life of a guy. The characters are all very likible. The acting in the movie is good and very good. I also like the movie because it shows some great scenes. I like the fact that the movie shows the life the characters are in. I liked the way that it showed the life that Walter Mittemeyer has in his mind. The Secret life of Walter is an action movie and it shows it well. This is a must watch movie for all. It shows a good character. I would recommend this movie to all the people. The picture was a good one. It is a nice movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ "There is a scene in which we watch a couple of men get down and dirty in the bedroom of the wife of a high-ranking British officer. When he comes out, she tells him she doesn't want him there. She wants to be alone. But her husband won't let her." The man who plays the husband in this scene is Peter Ustinov. He is one of my all time favorite actors, and I can't say I'm not surprised at the love affair that develops between him and this woman.  The story is simple enough, but it does have a very powerful message. Â In one scene, the woman tells him, "I want you to be my lover. But I want you alone. You don't want me anymore. I'll go." Â This scene is powerful because it tells us that if you're in love with someone and they don't love you back, then there is nothing you can do. ___________________ "What I remember is a little girl, not a girl much older than me, who was not wearing a headscarf. She was not veiled because her mother had taken her to a Christian school where they taught her to be veiled. But when the girl was brought home, she was put in a burqa, her face covered. And there was the man's wife. She looked like the woman who was my mother. And that was a good feeling, because I felt like a woman." _________________ "I went to a party in a hotel in a big city. We were all going to the theater. We had the biggest table, and we had a big bottle of wine, and when it was time to drink it, the hostess brought the wine.

We went to the movie theater. And they were showing this film that was really popular in Europe. And it was very funny. It was really funny. And people were laughing, and they were laughing. And everyone was so happy. It wasn't a bad movie. I remember I said to myself, "Oh my God!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather Part II (1974) (Michael Corleone) - This is a good example of an old-fashioned gangster film, but it is not a bad film at all.  Crotone plays a great Corleoni.    I love how he goes from a guy who was a drug addict to a guy that was a gangster.    He makes it seem real.  The whole gangster thing is interesting and I think it is worth watching if you like the original film.  This is one of my all-time favorites.  What is your favorite scene:   Don's confession -   A great scene that really shows Don's character.  There are many things in the movie that don't add up and make me wonder how the movie ended up being so successful.  I think Don may have been too loyal to the gangsters, but Don really shows his love for his family in this scene.  It is a great scene, but I am not sure why it was included in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _____________ _________ (No stars)  "I am the king of the world. I have been the most powerful man on earth for over 30 years."  — James Bond, "The Spy Who Loved Me"  It is true, the "King of the World" James Bond has become a real man in real life, even though he never had a wife or children, unlike his fictional counterpart.  James Bond's father was a German spy who was recruited by the British Secret Service in 1943. His son was born in Scotland in 1954.  a new documentary film by the same name, is the first documentary to be made about James Bond and his father. The documentary was directed by Christopher Hird, and it tells the story of how the famous Bond was born and raised in Scotland. The documentary shows James Bond as a young man and also shows how his father managed to survive the Nazi war.  and the father and son bond:  The son was a spy, but he didn't join the army. He got a job at the family shoe factory and later in the 60's he got a very interesting job in the British government, but it didn't pay very much. He was also the owner of a company that specialized in shoe repair.  the son's real life is a bit difficult, because he spent a lot of time in the hospital as a child, because his mother suffered from depression. The son didn't have a father figure when he was growing up, and the only person that could relate to him was his grandfather, who was in the German resistance during the war. So James Bond's life was quite a bit different than the fictional one.    The film is an amazing film, because it shows how Bond's real father managed him to survive in Nazi Germany. And he managed it with great cunning and bravery. And also with a good dose of humor. - this documentary is definitely worth watching. It is an interesting story that is easy to understand, and if you are a James Bond fan, this documentary might just change your life. / James Bond: the real life of his father /  /  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzvk_c_9YfU

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Secret in Their Eyes" is a beautiful and sad movie.  I was never really a big fan of Tom Cruise movies, but he made an excellent lead in this film.  The movie is about a family living in a small town and their son who has a heart problem.  The movie shows that the family is close, the boy who has heart trouble and his father who cares for him.  But a few years later, the son has gone to his grave, and all the family hopes for is for his death to be forgotten.  It's a beautiful film, and it has a good heart.  I'm sure everyone has seen this movie and it's a good film, but it is sad.   5 stars.     4 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A Clockwork Orange" is a great movie, but it is NOT a good thriller. It is a brilliant and disturbing movie, in a way that no other film could be. The main character Alex is a very clever man, who can't seem to understand how the whole world works. His brother Alex is the same way. In a sense Alex is in control of his situation. He is a loner who is completely unaware of what is going on around him. But in the end, Alex will have to face his demons. He will have no choice but to be part of the group. His life is going to change. I like this movie very much. It has a lot of surprises and great performances by all the characters. I was very disappointed that they didn't give it a better review.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ I was so excited to see this movie when I saw it. I've seen a lot of good movies in the past year and I love this one. I loved the movie so much that I'm not even sure what I'm going to say about it. It was just too amazing to just put it on the list and let you find out. I mean, if you've ever seen a movie where the movie was not only good but great then you've seen one of the best movies of the year. The cast was just perfect, the acting was amazing, and the story was just... well... The Story. I really wanted to go see the movie right away so I could see it again, but I waited and waited. And I had to tell myself, "It'll be worth it, it'll be good, it's not the end of the world, just enjoy it while it's on". I waited over 3 months to see it and I had a great time. The movie had so much more to offer than just just a good action movie. There was more to it than that. I want to talk about this movie because it was just so perfect. I was hooked, and it's because of a few things. It's not just about the action, because there's plenty of action in the movie, but it's about the characters. There's so much character development that you don't really feel like the main character. It makes the movie just more realistic, because all of the other characters are more interesting. There were a lot more things to do than just fight and fight and be killed and killed and die. The story was a lot deeper and deeper. It made you think. The whole movie had a very interesting plot. I didn't want to leave until I saw the ending, because it made me think about all of these things. I couldn't stop thinking about it and watching it again. I'm still thinking about all these things and watching the movie. It just made me so happy. It kept me thinking about this for days, and I didn?t even know why. I just loved it. The ending was perfect and the whole movie just made so much sense. I think that this movie made a good point about the real world. In this world, everyone wants to be special and have their own reason to exist. And that's how we ended up in this movie. You can have a reason to be alive and that makes you
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I love this movie. There are a lot of people out there who claim it's the worst movie ever made. I'd have to agree with that. The acting is horrible, the plot is ridiculous and the violence is over the top. I just don't understand why it was made. It was a movie about a boy and a girl that go on a killing spree. It's a dumb idea. It is a movie where people shoot people. This movie is a dumb movie that is a total waste of time. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! I just had the chance to see "Ride the Tiger" and I am happy that I did. The movie is about the life of a boy who was in the World War II and then the boy and his wife were separated and he was with his mother until her death. The mother was in a concentration camp for the Germans. The boy and the boy's mother went to New York and the son got married. After a year the wife was released and she came back to the camp. There is a boy with a friend and the brother is a pilot and he sees that there is a young lady who was not very attractive. When he sees her he tells his friend and then they go with the young lady. The next thing the brother sees his brother, the son is taken away by the Germans and the young girl is taken with him. The girl and the girl's mother are in the prison camp and they see the brother and they tell her what they saw and that's how they knew what was going to happen to them. The only thing is that the boy wants to see his wife again and so the son and the mother go to see her. The film was made in the 50s and is a very interesting story about life and death. I think the director, Walter Lantz, was a very good director and I have seen a lot of his films. The production was good and the performances were very good. The special effects are amazing and the picture is clear and it was a great film. The music is also very good and I was very happy with it. I loved it and recommend it. It is not a great picture but it is worth seeing.

I remember thinking, 'That's not a good idea. You're probably not a sailor.' Then he said, 'No, it's not really a movie about the Battle of the Atlantic, it is a movie that happens to take place on the deck of a battleship. There is a real ship on the screen. I don't know what you think of this, but if you are interested, then you will enjoy this.' I thought that was the coolest movie I had ever seen. That movie really took me back to my childhood. The music was really cool and I remember how great the acting was. I think the best part was when they brought a real live shark onto the screen." - John C. Reilly

This is the only film I've seen that he's directed in which he's never made a sequel. The only film he's written that he hasn't made is Rushmore. I would argue that the first film is the better one because it has the funniest jokes. The first one was very well made and had the best cinematography. The second one was so bad that it ruined Rushmore for me. This film, I've never seen and I don't plan on seeing it. The film was written by John Hughes, who also directed The Breakfast Club. I love Hughes. This movie is a comedy. This guy is very funny. He has an incredibly funny character and a good plot. I think this is one of the best comedies ever made. I have no idea how he pulled it off. It's one of those movies where everything goes perfectly. I don,t remember the story but I do remember that the main character is so bad. The main character has a heart of gold but he has a very bad heart. I mean, the main bad guy, the bad guy that makes you hate the main hero, has the worst heart in the world. His heart is so much worse than any heart that any good character would have. You have to wonder how much money that poor guy has and what he's doing on the couch in the movie. I liked the first one and I think it's good. It doesn't make me laugh like Rushmore but I think that it is a better film. The movie looks and sounds great and it is just an interesting movie. This was a good film to watch in the summer because it's about people. I always find it fascinating to watch people and how they react to different situations. I find this film interesting and funny. I'm going to watch it again to see how he's done. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  About the movie:  This movie was the first movie that I watched that I really liked. The first movie was about a kid who wanted to be a rock star, but he was too old and ugly to be on a TV show. The story of the movie is about the band the Stone Roses and their manager Mark Ronson who was trying to get them a record contract. After the record contract failed, the Stone Rose's went on to become one of the most popular bands of all time. This movie is all about how the Stonerose's managed to become a band and not just a bunch of rock stars. The movie is also about the relationship between the Stoneheart's. There are some very funny scenes in the movie, and there are also some very good scenes. The only thing that is not so good about the movie are the scenes that are in the middle of the film, that was a little bit annoying to watch. The Stone Roses were great musicians and they are a very popular band to this day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I loved this movie." I don't mean to sound like a broken record but... I'm not exactly sure where to start.  If you're looking for a movie that will put a smile on your face, this is the movie for you.    If you want a good time and an entertaining movie with a great cast and a decent plot, this isn't it.  The movie starts off with a bang, but quickly devolves into a comedy of errors.  If there is one thing that the movie had going for it it was the acting.  You will find that the entire cast does a fantastic job.  However, there is something about the acting that is just plain silly.  While I don´t think that the acting was the sole reason for the film´s failure, I will give the movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  This movie was a great way to introduce the world of the movie.  It's just too bad that the actors were so bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ I really enjoyed this movie. It has a good story with a really good story line. It is a story about a young girl who is in a foster home and a lot of the stuff they go through is heartbreaking and disturbing. This girl is a great character. I can't say anything bad about the acting because it is all done really well. The story lines are really great and really set the mood. I really liked the ending. It was a good ending to a really well done movie. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good family movie and who likes the supernatural aspect. I did like the ending because it wasn't too heavy on the supernatural part.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I was so happy to see that the "G" rated movie, The Princess Bride was remade with the help of Tim Burton. I love Tim Burton, and he really made a very good movie. I remember when I was a kid, I watched it in the theatre. I was the only child in the theater, and my dad was with me, so we watched the movie together. I loved this movie so much. I think that a lot of the movie was about the relationships between the characters. The movie was also about love, and life. I really enjoyed it. The story was funny and fun. I also really liked the music. I felt that the song "The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins" was really catchy and made me smile. The cast was also pretty good. I thought Christopher Guest was really good in this movie. It was really funny to see him in this role. I feel that it was really fun watching this movie with my father. The voice of Christopher Guest did the movie a great favor. The animation was pretty good and I liked the style of it. It did have some of the typical Tim Burton style, but I like it a lot. I recommend this movie to any Tim Burton fan, because I think it is one of his best movies. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has never seen it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I'll be honest with you; I'm a little bit biased. I've seen almost all of the films in the Saw series, and this one ranks up there with them. It's a well-paced film, with great pacing and suspense. The pacing is good enough to keep you guessing, and the tension is high enough to have you thinking, even after the end credits have rolled. The movie doesn't just end with the bad guy in jail, but we also get to know a bit more about his family and the place where they were staying. The ending is very well done and satisfying, but it's not over the top or cheesy. _________________________________________________ Review by Biff (Posted by biff on the forum at http://www.scary-stories.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3369 ) I liked it. I didn't love it, but I liked a lot of it. This is a solid Saw movie, with a few twists and a few different takes on the same basic themes. I think it's the only Saw movie that has a female lead. This movie does have a few weak spots, and I wish they had used the other movies from the series instead of adding this one, but overall, it's a good entry point for anyone who hasn't seen the series. _________________________________________________________________________________ (Posted in the Forum at http thescarystories.org/forum/) (Note: The following is a slightly edited version of a review written for The Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. I have included a short summary of this movie as well. If you have any questions about this review or this movie in general, please email me at greg@thescarystorystothedark.com.) After you read the reviews, you're probably thinking "Okay, well that's a movie, so what?" Well, there's a reason why this movie was rated R for children and M for adults. The film is about a boy who is the victim of a heinous crime. He has no idea that the boy who did this is his cousin, and is the only one who can help him. There is no explanation as to why the boy would do such a thing. There are many disturbing scenes and scenes that are graphic, but you'll get used to them as you watch the movie. This has been rated R due to it's content, and that's why it was made for children.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Day the Earth Stood Still. It is a very good movie and it makes the audience very impressed with what they are seeing. The performances are very good and the plot is simple and good. The story of the movie is that a meteorite is hitting earth and the only thing the people on earth can do is try to survive and help the meteorite to get away. The story is not too complex but the movie will leave you in awe at the way it tells the story. The cast of the movies were all great. James Earl Jones is a good leading man in the movie.  He plays the role well and it was very nice to see a man like him playing such a character.  The supporting characters in the movies are also very good.  I love the way the movie was shot in black and white. The colors of the pictures in the background really stand out and make the movie even more impressive.  All in all The Day the earth stood still was a great movie and a great success of director John Milius. It really makes you believe that people can actually survive in such a harsh environment.  You should see The Day The Earth St. st  if you haven't already. I give The Day  the 7.5 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is a movie that I can't stop watching. It's a movie about a man who escapes from a maximum security prison and makes his way back to the community. It also has some great songs, great acting, and a very well made film. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards. This movie is a classic. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies. 2.  Titanic (1997) There are two main reasons why this movie has a huge following. The first reason is the beautiful music and acting. There are so many great songs in this movie, some of them even sound like they came from a band. There is so much emotion and emotion is expressed in this film. The second reason is that this movie is about a tragedy that happened to a group of people. It is a very personal movie for all of us, as it is for all the people who are affected by the events that happened. This film shows the characters on a whole other level than just their past. This is a film about the people, and not the people behind the scenes. I've seen many people say that this film is not realistic because it shows the people after the fact. I would say that is a bit harsh, as this is a realistic portrayal of a real life tragedy. The film is about the aftermath of a disaster, and that is the most important part. This documentary also focuses on the tragedy that was the death of the whole group. It shows the real story of a group that was on the verge of being crushed by the tragedy. It gives you a very real feel of what happened that day, and what the people were thinking. The people in the film are real people that have lived through tragedy before. 1.   Mulholland Drive (2001) Mul holland drive is a wonderful movie. It tells the story of two friends that fall in love. This isn't your average love story. This love story is about two young men who fall in together, and it is a beautiful story. They fall in because they are two people who know each other really well. There's a lot of chemistry between the two, and the film shows it all. The two men are also very strong, and they fight, and even fall in the way that they fall. The characters are also so well done. The relationship between the characters is very realistic, and this is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Best Man Holiday' is an entertaining romantic comedy, but it is also a very dark and serious movie, and it is all of that because it deals with the problem of family, and the difficulties of dealing with the death of a loved one. This is a movie that everyone should see, and a movie to be cherished and loved by anyone who loves a good romantic comedy. It is a funny movie, full of fun and jokes. The acting is great, and there is a great plot. This movie will entertain and will make you think about a lot of things, and if you are a person who likes to think a lot, this is a good and thought provoking movie. The film has a very original and unique plot, and I love that. It also shows the problems of people when they lose someone they loved. It has an interesting plot, a beautiful plot, but one that will have you thinking. It's a very well written movie, that has a great script, and great actors, and they make it all work, and make it look so real. I loved it. This was a great movie, but if you want a real movie, you can get a real one. I recommend this movie for everyone. I would recommend this film to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The Hateful Eight (2016) is an absolutely brilliant film, and it is a film that can only be described as a "thrillers-with-a-kick" movie. It is filled with violence, gore, and humor, and a good portion of the film is spent watching the two main characters get killed off and getting into a gunfight with the outlaws.  The film was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who also wrote the script. Tarantino worked with Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell to bring the story of bounty hunter John Ruth (Jackson) to life. Ruth is sent by the FBI to track down an escaped convict and his two thugs, who were responsible for the death of a sheriff's deputy. When they find out that Ruth's former partner, the bounty hunter, is also responsible for his death, they turn on him and go after him.  the Hateful eight is a fun and violent movie, and in terms of acting, Tarantino did a fantastic job with it. Samuel L Jackson and Michael Madsen both play their roles flawlessly. Jackson is absolutely terrifying and gets the audience hooked immediately as he runs around with a gun on his back and he is just the kind of bad ass that we need to see on screen. Madsen, who plays the outlaw, is equally as bad ass and he gives one of the most incredible performances I've ever seen in a film. The two main actors are able to deliver the emotion in the scene perfectly. , the film was a surprise hit at the box office. The film was very well received and it has been a massive success for the Weinstein Company. The movie received a great critical reception and it went on to be nominated for several awards. It also won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The H the H has received a lot of positive reviews and it was very popular at the cinema. It was the first film to be released on IMAX screens and it also won the Best Cinematography award at the Golden Globes. The entire film was shot in IMAX cameras and the film also received a Golden Lion for Best Animated Feature at the Venice Film Festival. The cast includes Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins, Samuel L Wilson, and Tim Roth. The following is a review of the movie The Haughty Eight:

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ This is a great movie. I have a few problems with it, but they don't take away from the enjoyment of the movie. The movie has a good story, and the acting is fantastic. The scenes of the characters living out in the middle of nowhere and watching the world go by were very interesting to watch. The music was also nice, and I like how it fits in with the scenes. I don't know what other films would be like, but this is pretty close. The only problem I had with the movie was the fact that it was a little too long. It took a while to get to the good stuff. The ending of the film didn't leave me with a big feeling, but I guess I should have seen it coming.

It is so interesting watching a film that has the two main characters in it be strong, yet still very likable and likeable. The story is interesting and well told.

This movie should be a great success. I hope that more studios pick this up in the future. I would like to see this film made into a series. This was a great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ [A] Inception is a great action film. The way that the film was shot was excellent, especially in the beginning, as we are given a great look at the characters and the world they live in. [A+] The cinematography is phenomenal. The lighting and angles make the world seem more alive and more realistic. The story is also great, and we get to see a bit of everything, and this is great, since the story is so intense, it is easy to see why it took so long for it to get finished. This movie has great action scenes, and the story does not really drag on, but it never really gets to the point of being interesting. The only thing that bothered me a bit was that I was a little bit confused at some points. I know that this is a long movie, and some of it is just exposition, but sometimes, the movie jumps back to some of the previous scenes too quickly, so that you don't really get a good sense of the world that the characters live in, but I didn't mind, since it was still a great movie. [B+] Overall, I was impressed with this movie. The action scenes are so well done, and they are very well done. The world that we are introduced to, and it's characters are very interesting. This is a well-made, great action movie. ___________________________________________________ [R] It's hard to tell, because of the language, but this movie was made in 2000. The movie was not written for children. The language in this movie is a bit rough. This might be my only gripe with the movie. There were a couple of times where the movie seemed a little rushed, and there were some things that were just a little too much, and that would have made the movie a lot better. But overall, I liked it. It was a fun, fun movie, but also had some good action. I highly recommend this movie, if you want to see some great action. __________________________ [A-] I think this movie would be very easy to enjoy, but there are a couple things that could have been done a little better. The beginning of the movie is kinda slow, and you might feel a little confused, especially if you are a new viewer of the film. This part is kinda lame, but then again, I think it was because they didn't have much time to show us all of this stuff

The Bad: - The characters seem very generic and undeveloped - The movie's climax is somewhat pointless. - If you are looking for a good sci-fi action movie, then this is not it. The Verdict: _______________________________ I found this movie very entertaining and good for a change of pace. I recommend it to all sci-fans. It's just not good enough to be an original movie. This movie has all the right ingredients but doesn't come together. It has great action sequences, excellent characters, and a great antagonist. I would definitely recommend this to fans of the sci-fiction genre. I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What a movie! I've seen it a couple of times, but this was the first time I've been able to truly appreciate the work. The acting is excellent, and the direction and story are spot on. It's a true story, a true life tragedy. And I don't mean a movie, a book, or a story. I mean a life. The only reason this movie is made is because of a tragic accident. In the movie, the character of John Coffey was hit by a car and died instantly. He was a young boy, a boy with dreams and hopes. He'd dreamed of a career as a film editor, and a movie to make. A little girl was watching the movie with him. The child was about the same age as John, but not nearly as well developed. She'd seen movies and was familiar with the genre. She told him to look over the shoulder of the driver, because he was going to hit him. John looked over and saw a driver about five years older, and much bigger. He had a good head on his shoulders, and he could see the little girl behind him. He got out of his car and grabbed the little boy. As he pulled the little kid to safety, the driver hit the brakes. The boy went flying into a ravine, and Coffey's head was smashed into the wall. The movie is set in the summer of 1983. Coffey, the director of the movie who'd been hit in the head with the car, is in a coma. He's in a hospital in Cincinnati. The doctors say that if they don't cut off his head, he'll be dead within a week. John and the little child, who's a little girl named Jane, go back home to live with his father, a lawyer. He and his wife, Anne, live a quiet, simple life. Jane is the same size as John. They spend most of their time in bed, but John is restless and wants to be free. The film's title is a play on words. The man in the film was called John Coffeen, and John Coffee was the boy that he hit in a car accident. The main character, John Coffin, is a very good man. He loves his family and has a great job as a lawyer in Cincinnati and is working on a movie called The Love Machine. His wife Anne doesn't approve of his job and she doesn't see him as the man

It has been said that this is a classic example of the'symbolic killing', in which a murderer chooses a victim to represent his crimes. The killer wants the victim to be symbolically dead and so that his actions are easier to understand. As the movie continues, it becomes apparent that the murderer is not a man but a creature. The creature in this case is a serial killer who hunts women in order to find their killers.  The movie's title "The Lambs" is a reference to the famous film 'The Silence Of The Lambs' which was based on the real-life case of Buffalo Bill. The story is based on a real case of a serial murderer who went to jail for the murders he committed in the 1930s and 1940s. The main character is a psychiatrist who is tasked with working with the Buffalo Bill case. The movie was made in the 80s and focuses on the treatment of the Buffalo and his sister Edna. It shows that the case is still an open case and the murderer, dubbed 'Buffalo Bill' has never been caught.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie about a small town in Maine.  It is about the friendship between a group of people who are struggling with mental illness and addiction.  The story focuses on three young people who have been in and out of mental hospitals.  Two of the characters are in jail.  This movie is a very interesting look into the mental illness that many people deal with.  There are so many funny and touching scenes that will make you laugh a lot.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.  Enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ "A Good Day to Die Hard" was a great action movie. It was a very realistic depiction of what it would be like to get shot in the head. There was a lot of action in this movie. The main characters, John McClane, was very well portrayed. The movie was also filled with many memorable scenes. The way John McClaine handled himself in all the action scenes, made you think that he was one of the best actors in the world. It made me feel very emotional. It's a shame that we won't see more movies like this. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I'm sure that you'll love this movie as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** A great story about an ex-con trying to escape from a life of crime and make his way into the business of real estate. I enjoyed the story and the characters and this movie has the potential to be a great thriller.  Reviewed by: Mike D. from NY on 5/3/2013   "I've Been Working on a Building" was a great movie. I liked that it told the story of a man who is caught up in a building he had worked on before and was given a second chance to make a new life. The film showed the man's past as a thief who had been arrested and sentenced to a long term in prison. He's now in a new job and a new apartment building where he works as a handyman and makes $300 a month. The building owner was his former boss and the movie was told from the man point of view as the film went along. I didn't have a problem with the ending as I felt it was handled correctly. , I enjoyed watching this movie as it gave a good picture of a guy that had made a bad decision and had to make up for it. I feel that the film made it a better movie by having it come across that way. I'm glad that the movie made it so that people who are looking for a good story can watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I think that a great movie has to have a good story and a good screenplay and a great cast, and in this case this is one of the best movie of the year. The cast of actors were all on point and they really played the roles perfectly. It has a great screenplay that was written by Robert Towne. The director of photography was a good choice as well, but not the one who made the movie great. I really enjoyed the whole movie. It's a bit long at 120 minutes, but I think it's worth the watch. The soundtrack is a bit different from what you're used to and you will probably enjoy it even more than I did. The characters in the movie are so well written and acted that you can't help but to root for them and wish them well. I loved this movie and I think you will too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! (2015) This movie is a great example of a great movie. The film is a masterpiece.!!! tells the story of a man, who has to go to an ancient city. The ancient city has a mysterious power that allows people to see into the past. It is said that it is not the power of the ancient city, but of the mind of the man, which is capable of reading people's minds and the past and predicting what will happen. The movie starts off with a short scene of a girl being abused and it's revealed that she was raped. The girl is a very good actress and her face was well painted. The story is told in flashbacks. The man is a man who has lost his family and is now living on his own. The woman is his daughter and is his partner in crime. The flashback scene takes place after a very bad experience with a girl. The old man is seen in the city, where a woman has been abused by a man. The only way he can get rid of this woman is to read people's thoughts. He does so and it turns out that the girl, the girl he raped, is the daughter of the old man. This scene is very sad and shocking, but the movie doesn't give us a reason to be sad. It just leaves us confused and with the feeling of loss. The next scene shows the man trying to read the thoughts of the girl. This time he fails. The last scene shows a man returning to the old city with his daughter. The father has returned from his trip to the city with the girl and they are living together as husband and wife. The couple have their own life together.  They are happy, but it's hard to believe that it's true. The ending is sad and very realistic. The whole movie is very interesting and very beautiful. The music is good.!!!! (2012) The movie is about a man whose job is to get a high ranking officer, who is under investigation, to leave the police force. He has to do that by manipulating him. The director, Jarmusch, is a genius, because the movie is also about the life of a police detective. The guy, who plays the detective is really a very nice guy and very good actor. He also played the role of a soldier in "Lolita". This movie shows the problems in society, and the corrupt police and the good cops, who try to help the good guys

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Coffee and Cigarettes" is a good, not great movie. It has some good scenes and some really bad ones. However, it is very well done and it does not try to reinvent the wheel. It is a fairly simple story, told in a fairly un-familiar style. The film opens in the small Texas town of San Fernando. An accident has caused a car accident in which the father is killed. His son, a young teenager, has been thrown from the car. He awakens to find himself in a hospital bed, having lost almost all of his hair and has been branded with the initials of the driver of the car that killed his father. He decides that he wants to become a professional baseball player, but he will have to live with the consequences of the accident. It's a fairly straightforward tale, with very little dialogue and very little in the way of plot. However it does contain some great baseball scenes and is worth watching. The music in the film is great, with some great music choices. The acting is fairly good. The story is not bad, but it doesn't really add anything to the genre and it doesn a little to the story. It does have some good baseball scenes though.

I have watched all of his films over the years. I thought this one was great. The cinematography was very beautiful. The actors were all great. It was a very good movie. It took a lot of balls to make this movie but I am glad he did it. The ending was very eerie. I was glad to see it come to an end. It wasn't the usual ending. It really made me feel like I was watching something from a horror movie. The acting was great all around. It is definitely a must watch movie. If you have not seen this movie yet then I would recommend it. It has a great story and great acting.

We were very warmly welcomed by him, who told us to go down to the harbor. He said the ship had arrived and he would show us the ship and give us a good view. He took us to the port. He told us the captain was in the ship. He was a very old man. I was surprised to see him so young. The captain told us there was no need to be afraid of him. He did not say anything about his coming to take us. He led us down into the ship, and when we came into the bow, there was a man there. He had a long black coat and a long, black hat. He went up to the captain and said: "Good morning, Captain." He gave us a warm welcome, and then he went to a room and showed us the interior. The room was large and very bright. The whole room was covered with beautiful things. He showed us a room where they used to work in a huge mill. They had many big machines. They were very dirty and dirty. We went down into a room near the water. There were many people there. It was a good room to rest. There was an old woman there. I can see her now in my mind's eye. She was very old.

I could see many things in it that we would never see again. There seemed to be many things that we wanted, but we could not get them. It looked like the people who worked in the mill were dead. We did not see them very often. We watched as they worked. The man with us, who was a big, strong man, was quite frightened. We kept looking at him for some time, and he looked very anxious and worried. We saw that the people in the rooms were dead, and there was nobody there. We never saw any of

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie a couple times and I always enjoyed it. I remember when it first came out I was really disappointed in it.  It was too much like a western but with a supernatural twist and was really too much of a cop out for me.  I always felt that the movie was trying to tell a story about a couple of men who were trying to solve a series of murders and were able to pull it off in the end.   However I am really glad that this movie is getting a rerelease because the story is still interesting.  Now this movie takes place in the early 1800s and it's about a bounty hunter who is hired to find a woman named Laura who is being held captive by a group of men.  This film was made by the same man who made The Ghost and the Darkness and I am glad that he is working on something new.  It is a good thriller and is great to watch in the dark with a little light on the screen.  If you are a fan of the Ghost and Darkness franchise you will like this movie.  I would recommend this to fans of the series.

You're in love with the main character, the only other person on the planet who has a crush on him, the girl who wants to be him, and the police chief. The police chief and the girl are great. You feel for them, but you also know they're only doing what they feel is right. The other characters are a bit cheesy, but not too cheesy. The soundtrack is great and the special effects are top-notch. The ending is a little disappointing, but nothing too terrible. Overall, this is a great movie, if you want a fun and easy-going story that's a little different.  Rated 5 out of 5 by mrwilson5 from One of my favorite movies I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Great Escape (1963) was an epic of espionage, courage, and adventure, based on the novel of the same name by Winston Churchill. With the world under nuclear threat and the Cold War at its zenith, the British and U.S. government decided to deploy the world's first atomic bomb. The film is a story of the British plot to blow up a U.N. compound in New Mexico, a U-boat in the North Atlantic, and a Soviet spy in Berlin. It is also a tale of the friendship between the two most famous spies of all time. James Bond (Sean Connery), a brilliant secret agent, is on a mission of personal redemption when he rescues the Soviet agent, code-named "Dr. No," who is being held captive in the U.K. A series of elaborate and daring escapades follows. In the end, Bond learns that his "enemy" has been working for him all along. He learns that he is also the one who will have to stop him. This is the first of many Bond movies in which Connery plays the same character. The plot is very complex and well written. The special effects and set pieces are fantastic. It's the kind of movie you can watch in one sitting. The acting is excellent throughout, with Connery winning the film with his charm, intelligence, and charm. The only thing I didn't like about this film is that it takes place in the United States. It wouldn't have been out of place in 1964, but today it feels dated and old-fashioned. - December 26, 2009The Great Escape is the greatest Bond movie  Reviewer: Lyle - favorite favorite favorite - December 12, 2009  Subject: Good movie and good quality...

They were both very good directors, but their work in "Dunes" was a masterpiece. It was also the first movie to ever get me so very worked up that I could hardly stand it. When "Dawn of Man" came out in 1976, it was a film I could stand to watch but not one that I would go to see on a regular basis. It is not a great film, but it is certainly worth seeing if you have a few hours to kill.   The plot of "Dogs" is as follows: the future is ravaged by war, the human race is reduced to a savage, tribal culture and a lone surviving scientist is sent into the desert in order to save the human species from extinction. His mission is to save a young man named Alex and bring him to the safety of a new society, known as the "Cult of the Dead."   When the film starts, we see a few people walking in the desert, who are soon joined by a man who looks a bit like George Romero. After a brief exchange, they soon learn that the man who they just met is Alex, the son of an American scientist who died during the war. The scientist is Alex's father, a scientist named Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Frankenstein, the father of Dr. John Watson, was a friend of Jekyl's. After Jekyll's death, Alex's mother (Doris Day) decided that he was not to be buried. Instead, Alex was given a new name, "Jekyll" and sent to a new life in a place called the Cult of the Dark. The woman Alex was to be married to was the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Alex had been raised to believe that she was going to marry a wealthy man named Dr Henry Grey, a doctor who would cure her of her "evil" and "demonic" nature.   and   At the beginning of the film, Alex is shown to be in a strange situation. She has just been chosen by a group of people to be sent to the Cult. They are
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm sure this movie has been a huge success for the director and producer, and is a wonderful piece of art. The plot is fairly simple, as we follow a man named Peter, who is a police detective and an alcoholic. His job is to keep an eye on a gang of bank robbers and the police have a difficult time doing so, as Peter spends most of his time trying to keep the police away from the bank robbers, and when they do get close, they are quickly dispatched. This is a fairly enjoyable movie, but it does not do anything to stand out from the others I've seen, and it has very little to offer. It does a good job of getting us involved with the story, but does not go anywhere particularly new or interesting. The action scenes are fun and well done, but are not very dynamic, and while the dialogue and pacing is great, the film is very flat in its pacing and lacks the charm that some of the other movies have.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This is a good one, and it's got a great ending. I would suggest watching this before watching the first part of the first season, because the ending in this movie is much more effective. And the first few minutes of the movie is where the movie starts to really shine. The character's are likeable, and the movie gets better and better. I'm not a big horror movie fan, but I did enjoy this movie. It has a great story, and is well acted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie and one of the best I've seen in a long time. The story is good. It has action and some good humor in it.  It was a fun watch. "They've been trying to get the people of Earth back in line. It's going to take a little longer than they thought. " -   -   Michael Rooker  I found the film very entertaining and a good time.  There were some funny moments in the film. It was very good to see Rookers back in a movie. This is the sequel to the 2008 film.  Rooked in his new role as the new head of the UN. It's an action movie that is very entertaining to watch.  The story is about the war between the Earth and the aliens. The aliens have a secret weapon that can kill an entire planet and the humans are trying to destroy it. The main cast of this movie are all very well known.  Kurt Russell plays the leader of the Earth. Mel Gibson plays the villain of the film and he's very funny in the movie.   Tom Sizemore plays the president of the United States. Sigourney Weaver plays the daughter of the President. Joss Whedon is directing the movie and he has a lot of talent in his movies. The movie is rated PG-13 and I guess that's for adults only. I think the movie is great.  It has great action scenes and a great script. The movie has great humor.   This movie will not be the movie I would have chosen for a birthday.  The film is good but I'm not sure if I'd want to watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I just saw this movie, and it's a very good movie. The writing is excellent, the characters are really well developed, and the story is quite interesting. I really like the romance between the two main characters. It makes the movie really worth watching. The acting is also very good. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone who likes romance movies, and/or people who like a good romantic comedy. (I am not a fan of romantic comedies, and I don't know why, but I like this one.) The music was very good, and they used a lot of it, so it was a lot more enjoyable than it could have been. And, of course, the film has a great ending. (Note: This movie is rated R for some strong language and some sexual content. But, if you have never seen it before, then you should be able to handle it. If you are an adult, then I would probably recommend watching it with a young child.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Santini"  - is a movie about a person who is going to meet his soulmate, and he has a special date with him.  He doesn't know it, but he is in love with her and she is in the hospital with a cancer.  "The great Santini", by Roberto Rossellini, is a film that is based on a true story about a young man who is being told that he is not to be happy.   The movie starts in the beginning of the 1950s, when the Italian film director Santino Siffredi is making a movie on his first film "The Great Angelino".    Santino is in his home at the time and he is about to leave the house when he sees a very pretty woman, and his heart starts to beat faster.  He is about a hundred years old and has been a painter for the past thirty years, and at the beginning he is very good at painting but he gets lost when he wants to start a new one.  Santini decides to try to make a movie of the girl who is sick and has died.  Then he finds that she was a great actress and he gets the inspiration to make her a part of the movie, and so he asks the young actress who is a very shy and shy girl to play the part.  This film is about the love of a person, and the love between two people, and a movie made in 1950s is about people in the 1950 and the story is about love and life.    So if you are a fan of this movie and are looking for a good romance movie, then this is the movie for you.  It is not too long, and if you like a good drama movie, you should give it a try.   The film was a big success in Italy, and it was considered a great Italian movie, but it was not so successful in the US.  The film is not very well known in the American market, and people don't know that it is a story about two people and a story made in the 50s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favourite movie of all time is '2001: A Space Odyssey' and that's why I love the way the film was shot. The whole thing is filmed in the manner of a dream and you are taken on a fantastic journey of a long time. The film has a very surreal feeling to it and it's the way Kubrick uses his camera that is very interesting. The way he shoots the film has this dreamlike feel about it, like the whole thing could happen at any time and I mean at any moment. It's one of the greatest movies ever made and I can't recommend it highly enough. The soundtrack by the great Bernard Herrmann is one of my favourites and is always a treat when I watch it. If you love space movies then you will love this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. It's been so long since I watched this movie. I haven't seen a movie in about 8 years. I saw it on the big screen (my uncle was in it), and I thought it was good. I loved it. I thought this was one of the best films of the 90s. It was great and fun and exciting. I enjoyed it, and I still like it to this day. I recommend this movie to anyone. I just hope it gets made again. I think it was a good idea to film this movie on an iPhone (in my opinion) so that the graphics were better. It wasn't as good as it should have been, but it was still good. It still looks great. I know this is a movie about a guy who was in a car accident that kills his wife. It could have been better (as a movie) and it could have also been a better film. I don't think it's as good or as good of a movie as it is, but I like it a lot. It made me feel a lot of emotions, and it made me cry. It just was great. The story was well told, and the ending was nice. I was sad and I was happy. The movie is very short, but there is a lot to see and enjoy.

The ending was lame, the acting was bad, and the characters were not very original. --------------  From a guy who likes to see a good, solid thriller. Great acting, good plot, and a very good director. Great film. It's been a while since I've seen a great thriller, and this one really hit the nail on the head. ------------- From a guy that likes to get off his butt and watch movies. Great, great movie. I had to take a break and re-watch this one to make sure I saw it all. I found it all very interesting. I think it was a good idea to put the main character in jail, but then again, I guess the film was just trying to make a statement. --------------- From a girl who likes her good girls. A great film, and I am sure it was well-rehearsed. It was good to see how the film progressed. The acting was good, and it was really sad to see this film close out with a movie-star ending. ------------------------- From a man who likes his good women. I'm going to say this film was well produced. I liked it a lot. I saw this at the same time as "The Departed", and it has a similar vibe. The plot was great, and there were a few plot holes, but that wasn't my only issue with the film. There was a lot of bad acting, and some of the girls were really off-putting. They didn't seem to have a real personality. They were just a little too good looking to be believable. I thought they were a little on the nose, and they were all pretty young looking. I don't know why the director felt the need to put all these girls in jail. It made no sense. I also thought the movie was a little rushed. I could have been watching another movie, not the movie "The Last House on the Left". I'm a little surprised the film is so successful because it's such a long film, but I guess people just like to see more of the same.

This one is a different kind of horror. It's not a horror movie at all. It takes a different approach to horror and doesn't take any of the standard tropes of a horror story. It is more about the psychological impact of these two characters and what they're dealing with as they're trapped inside a house, but still trying to figure out what is going on. The film is pretty well done and you'll never see anything quite like it. I'm looking forward to watching it again. *********************

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ It is a very good movie. Very well-made. There are no flaws with this movie. _____________________________________________  Good movie, but the plot was kind of confusing. I think this was one of the first movies made that was directed by Steven Spielberg. This movie is about an alien named "Bugs" who lives in an underground cave with a group of other aliens. This alien colony has lived on earth for thousands of years. During the movie, we see some of the other aliens as they do various jobs and play games. The aliens do not like each other, but they do make a good team. In one scene, one of these aliens (named "Oscar") is trying to make an entrance into the cave and is being chased by other aliens, one who looks like a human, who try to stop him. The alien Oscar then has a very bad day. His ship was destroyed by the other alien, who is still very angry at him for destroying his ship. The bad news is, the other humans think he is a thief and want to kill him. Oscar does not think this will happen and fights back. But he is badly wounded and his ship is destroyed. The human group that wants to kill Oscar is led by the leader of the group named "Duke." Duke is a good leader, but is very stupid. He thinks that he can use Oscar to get information on the aliens, so he can get a higher bounty. Oscar, however, thinks that Duke is trying too hard to get at him. He then leaves the cave with his companions to find Duke. After the movie ends, Oscar finds Duke in a hospital, unconscious and with a bullet in his head. This is the only movie I have seen where the aliens are not very smart. This was very confusing to me. I also found it funny that the alien leader Duke was trying to be the hero, but it turned out that he was a total moron. _________________  A well-told story and good acting. This film was very entertaining and made me think about the human race a bit. The only downside was that the ending was kind off. __________________________  If you like science fiction and space movies, you should watch this. ________  I just wanted to let everyone know that this movie is absolutely awesome. I can't think of any better film to make it out of the box. ____

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ ______________ My first horror movie (I'm not going to call it a movie since it was more of a dream) and the last of the trilogy. The story is that two brothers (played by John Wayne and John Heard) are walking through a forest and are attacked by a ghost that haunts their house. The house has been empty since the death of the mother and son who were killed there. The brothers are able to kill the ghost by cutting it in half and throwing it down a well. The rest of the movie is a chase to get the ghost to the well and bring the body back home. The acting is really good. The whole movie is so creepy and dark. The characters are so well portrayed. The ghosts are so creepy. The film has a great score by Tony Curtis. The ending was great. The ghost chase was awesome. ______________________________________________ I don't think I've seen a better ghost movie than The Last House on the Left. John Wayne is amazing in this film. He has such an amazing presence in this movie. It makes you want to run for your life. John Heard was also great. He's a real actor and I thought he was in good shape for the part. I loved the twist at the end. ______________________________________________________________________________ WATCHING THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT IS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. This movie has been on my mind for awhile and I was happy to find it in a theater. The movie has great acting and I'm glad it was in black and white. _____________ I have been searching for the last house on the left. The only way I can describe it is creepy. I was in my college dorm room at the time and I heard a lot of things. The sound of footsteps, a light, a door opening and closing. I think I might have seen a shadow walking across my bed. I also remember hearing voices in the hallway. I can't remember the names of the actors but I remember the faces. The most disturbing thing to me was the smell of rotten eggs. It was really bad. I had to get out of my dorm room as fast as I could. ___________________________ I was very disappointed in this, but I guess I should give it a chance. I liked it, but it was very difficult to see it. I have heard that the picture was improved in color, but the color was muddy in my mind. This is a very good movie, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)  is an epic film, a beautiful film, and a very important film. It is a classic, and deserves to be seen by every film-maker and fan of cinema. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most creative directors of all time. He was the most daring director in the history of cinema, and the most inventive. The world is in the hands of a man who has never seen a movie before and yet he knows how to make a masterpiece. The only problem is that he has never directed a masterpiece himself. In fact, the only movie he ever directed was the one that was the inspiration for his next masterpiece:  Psycho. I know that it's very difficult to believe, but in order to make it as a director, you need to have a great knowledge of the cinematographer. Hitchcock knew the art of cinematography from a very young age. He always knew where to take his camera, where to shoot, and how to frame things. He never had a camera of his own, and as a young man he used to take advantage of the cameras of the crew members, especially those on the set. He wanted to be in control of everything and to be able to do whatever he wanted. He even used to film some of his favorite actors to get some idea of how they act in front of the camera. When he was about to direct the movie "North by Northwest", he asked some of the cast members to watch his first movie. He told them that he wanted to do a very realistic movie about a train that runs across the country. Hitchcock was also a great student of the art and science of photography. He loved all the new cameras being developed at the time. And in fact, Hitchcock did make a film in a small-sized camera called "Nude", but the film was never completed and only a rough cut was made. He used a camera with a film camera and he was also experimenting with a new type of camera, which had a movable lens. "The Day The Earth Stands Still" is a film about the life of an old man, who has been looking after his little girl. The old man lives alone in a little house in a village. He keeps a diary and a picture of his wife. The little girl is his only child and the only reason he has survived. But the village is being invaded by people who are trying

This is the film that brought the world the famous phrase: _____________________ I've seen it twice since it was first released, and I have yet to see a bad movie out of this film. (Though there are a few that I'd recommend avoiding.) The film itself is really good. It is, in fact, one of my favorite films ever made. I have watched it in several formats. In the theaters, it is on a huge screen, and the picture is very clear. I watched it on my big-screen TV, which has a very nice picture and sound. There is some audio problems in some of my old videotapes, but I think they're mostly due to bad video tape transfers, not the film itself. This is one I would definitely recommend.

It reminds me a lot of the first time I saw a "Star Wars" movie. Just like that one, I was hooked. I thought it would be just like the other "Star War" films. It wasn't. It was more. I was really surprised by how well it was done. It has great characters, a great plot, and a great soundtrack. It just made me want to see more of it. I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If it were not for this movie, I would have never known that the real world could be like that. The first half of the movie is all about a girl named Jessica (Mia Wasikowska), who has to get through the last minute of her high school graduation. She gets to the ceremony, but the ceremony has been interrupted by her parents, who were having an affair and are not going to let her finish her education. Jessica does everything she can to get to the front of the crowd so that she can take a picture with the president, but this plan goes awry when a gang of thugs in a car full of guns, sticks, and knives tries to stop her from leaving. She manages to get away from the situation, but then it gets really ugly. The gangsters pull a gun on her and her dad, and then she's forced to watch her mom get raped. The end of the film shows us what happened to her parents. Jessica is still going to school and she still gets good grades. She's still on top of the world. When the film ends, the credits are rolling and the movie shows the president of the United States (Robert Redford) taking a picture of her. Jessica has just done everything she was supposed to do. She is still happy, still on the top of her world. This is the story of the ultimate high school graduate who has just had everything go wrong for her. The movie has a good soundtrack, and the acting is good, but I don't see it being very successful at making you sympathize with Jessica.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was a really good movie!  It was really fun, and I think it's really good!  The whole thing was really cool and different, and it was a very different kind of horror movie than most of the others I've seen.  The music was cool, too.  I was just wondering if I should've watched this when I was younger because it's pretty much exactly like the original movie, except with a lot more action and a lot less scares.  However, it's very similar to the movie, which is really cool!  I didn't even notice it was the same movie until I watched the trailer.  And it's a good thing they got the original cast back because the movie is pretty good.  This movie has a lot of cool effects and a cool ending, and if you like horror, you'll like this movie.  Overall, it was an enjoyable watch, and the characters are really well done.  Just keep in mind it's an older movie so don't expect it to be like the rest of the movies I've listed.  But, if you're looking for a good horror movie, I'd say give this one a shot!  If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to go back and watch it because it looks and feels like the movie you know.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   1) This movie is not an action movie. It has some very interesting scenes, but it is not the type of action movie where you see lots of people jumping off buildings.   2) There are a few bad guys in this movie.  , but not enough to keep the movie from being a good one. The action is good and the acting is very good. There is a lot of suspense and there is a little bit of violence in this film. I guess the producers felt that it was not safe to have a little blood in a film that is supposed to be a family film.   the movie starts with the mother of the couple having a conversation with her husband about their daughter's relationship with her boyfriend. She says that she knows it is wrong, but that her daughter is very young and that she is being told what to do. The movie shows us the scene of the boyfriend talking with the girl, but there is not much action in the movie. We are left wondering what is going on. The couple is going through the whole procedure of having a threesome with the other girl, and they are both naked. The boyfriend and girl start to kiss each other, and then the girl starts to have sex with her boy. The scene shows us how the boy is doing what he is told, but then he stops the sex. The mother wants to know what is wrong with her daughter. Her daughter tells her that she feels good in the relationship, and the girl is saying that the girl likes sex. Then the girl tells the mother that she has had sex with someone else. The mom asks the girl to repeat what she said. The girl says that the other person is a friend of hers and that he is her lover. The other person then comes in the room, and we see the girlfriend of the girl. She and the boyfriend have sex and the girlfriend tells the boyfriend that she will come over to her room. When the girlfriend comes over to the girl's room, the girlfriend and the boy start to have intercourse, and it is a very nice sex scene. Then we see what the boyfriend said about the girlfriend. The girlfriend says that it is too late, but she is very happy with her relationship with the boy.  "I will never forget you," says the boyfriend to the girlfriend in the girl friend's room. The two girls kiss and the movie ends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I think I might have gotten a little over-excited at first with the plot and whatnot, but I soon got over it and came to enjoy the movie. The story is about a man who has a heart transplant, and he is able to feel things, like love. He starts to get attracted to a woman (I think it was a woman, but her name is not mentioned in the movie) who also has a transplant and is a nurse. The guy is pretty much clueless on how to respond to someone who has the same transplant, but she does not seem to mind, and eventually starts to open up a bit about the whole situation. There were a lot of things that made me smile, like the way she explained the process and all of the different types of people that have it. She told me that it could affect the body in a way that is very different from how it is usually. The movie is not too long, but it was so interesting to watch and I loved it. The ending was pretty cool too. Overall, this was a good, entertaining movie that was well worth the watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  ______________   What the critics said about the movie:   "The movie is a little heavy on the science, but you don't need to be an astrophysicist to enjoy this one." - Peter Travers, Rolling Stone   "...there is a lot of thought and attention to detail in the science-fictional aspects of this story." - David Edelstein, The New York Times   ___________________________  The film has been called "a grand adventure with science fiction" and it is definitely that. The film is set in a future where the human race has evolved into a genetically-engineered race and is living in peace on the planet "Planet X" - a mysterious alien world that was not discovered until the late 1960s. As you would expect from a movie like this, there is plenty of science fiction in the film and it's all done in a style that is easy to follow and easy to get excited about. This is the third film in a series of movies that began in 1975. The first film was called "Ascension" and the second was called the "Galactic Patrol" and is a science fiction movie that has elements of Star Trek and Star Wars. The third film, "The Thing from Another World", was directed by Joe Dante, a director that many people were not very familiar with and he was the director of many great science fiction movies such as "The Last Starfighter", "Planet of the Apes", "The Abyss", "Alien", "Ace in the Hole", "Night Skies", "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" and many other films. The three movies have all been very successful and were all well-received by critics and audiences alike.   The plot of the movie is very simple and takes place on Planet X and it begins when a group of scientists and military personnel from Planet X decide to travel to Earth and investigate an incident that occurred on the Planet X. The mission is successful and the team of scientists return to Planet X with some of the alien remains and a recording of a voice that has been calling out to them from the planet. However, their return is not what the scientists expected and the voice that they hear has not been heard from on Planet Earth for over a hundred years.   "The thing" that they find on Planet Y and it turns out to be a living being, a human, who was the first member of the species to make contact with Earth

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What I Like About This Movie: I really like the film, but I really don't like the ending. I don't see why it has to be the only ending. It was a great movie. I wish they would make more. But this is a great film. Rating: 5/5 (Good) ___________ What I Don't Like About It: I didn't like some of the scenes. I guess I just didn't get the vibe they were doing. It seemed a bit too long and I was getting bored. I would have liked more of the characters and more of them getting to know each other. And I really didn't care for the movie. Rating is just too low. The movie could have been a lot better. The ending felt forced. I also don't think the movie would work well for a big group of friends. It is just a little too long. But it is a really good movie and I recommend it. ____________ What I Want to See: This movie has some good moments. The characters are very well developed and the movie was very entertaining. The story was interesting and it was interesting to see how people reacted to the war. It just didn' really have a happy ending. But the ending was still pretty good. Rating should go up a few points. ______________________ Reviewed by: S.G.S. _____________________________________________ ____________________  "The Great Gatsby" is a classic. A movie that can still be enjoyed as it was made. A film that has the power to touch you and bring a tear to your eye. The Great Gatzby is an American classic that has had an immense impact on the art of cinema. The film stars Jayne Mansfield as Daisy, the spoiled and rich daughter of a millionaire.

They go together but it's very hard for him to talk to the other animal, so the only thing he can do is to look at them and make a funny noise.   The story is good and I think it is very good to see a boy who is very scared. He's a bit stupid, but he's a nice kid, and the ending is pretty funny.   and for the price, I love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Mummy" is the third film from director Alex Kurtzman and it is one of the best movies I have seen this year.  Kurtzman's style is the best of his work in a long time and his cast is phenomenal.    It has the same feel as "Return of the Living Dead" in a way and you are always on the edge of your seat as the film progresses.  I will say the special effects are a little on the weak side and the effects are not as good as they should be.  But the film does what it does and you should watch it even if you don't like the special effect stuff.  Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.  The movie is well worth the watch and is well deserving of a place on my list of the top ten films of the year.   "The Mummies" is Rated R and so is the special feature:   The Great Mummy Mystery.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The two actors play identical parts in a movie that I feel is one of the best films of all time. It's a good thriller that has the realism of a true true story and the action of a Hollywood movie. It was released in the mid-60's. The two characters, who are the two main characters, are the good and bad guys, with the good guy being a nice, kind, decent, honest, intelligent, caring and loving man and the bad guy being someone who was a psychopath, evil, cruel and nasty. I feel that this film is one the best of the 60's and 70's. It is a great movie to watch with your family and friends. It has a wonderful plot, great performances, excellent acting, great special effects and excellent music. It had a great impact on my life. I recommend it highly to anyone who loves good stories. If you are looking for a movie to be enjoyed by people of all ages, this is a good one to have. - March 30, 2009Great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" (2015) The Force Awakens is the most successful movie of all time, at least as far as box office goes. It has earned more than $4.4 billion and counting. Its success is not only the reason why I'm going to buy this set of Lego sets, but also the reason I want to build something similar for my own collection. The movie is very good. The characters are well developed and interesting. The plot and the story are good. And there's a new toy to keep me busy all the time. It's the perfect gift for Star Wars fans. I can't wait to watch the next movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  1)The movie has been rated "X" for nudity. So it is NOT X rated. But it IS RATED R.  2) The movie has NO violence.  and NO gore.  a small sex scene that makes you gasp, but does not get a "X". It is not "gore" as some people like to think it is. , in fact it has no blood and the gore is so minimal. . So if you are into gore, then go see it. But otherwise you should look elsewhere.  for example in another movie "Mortdecai" the actors actually have sex in the movie. So they have to use the props. That is not done in "Babylon"  3) The acting is pretty good.  in the "Buffy" TV series they do a lot of sex and some nudity, but not this movie.  the scenes are just about "the sex scene". the actors are just kissing. The movie is "Baba Yaga" . But "Buddha's" is a lot better than this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "What makes a good film is a good story, an interesting plot, and a good cast."  – Michael Curtiz  The movie that made Michael Curtiss (a.k.a. "King of the World") famous has been on my mind a lot lately, because of the way it's being remade in the upcoming sequel. As it turns out, this film is about the same thing that made Curtiss famous: the love story between a wealthy playboy and a teenage girl. And I'm going to say it again: It's not about Michael Curtis' character, it's about the movie that he stars in.  Curtiss is at the height of his fame in 1930, when he stars as a Hollywood showman in The King and I, a film that is set in a world where the rich playboy (Curtis) lives with a young woman who is his mistress (Holly Martins). In this world, a new king (William Holden) rules with an iron fist. And the only way to avoid being killed is to get rich quickly by marrying the princess (Evelyn de Rothschild).  I can't really say that this movie is "good" in the traditional sense, because it's full of bad acting and terrible writing. I mean, it has to be hard to write a bad story about a rich guy getting rich, right? But the acting in this movie was really bad. The acting is so bad that the plot becomes pretty dull, and even though the acting is bad, I wouldn't say that it's that bad, because even the best actors can make a bad movie good if they put their minds to it.  the acting was just so bad in this film that I can't even remember what happened. I think it's safe to say that everyone in this cast just does a terrible job. And in fact, one of the main characters, Evelyn de Rottigny, actually appears in only one scene. In the film, Evelynn de Rotti (who I believe is her stage name) is a very important character, but in the book, she is completely ignored. .... I'm not even sure what happened in the scene I saw! (That's how bad the acting of this movie actually was, it was so bad. Evelynn just didn't do anything.)  Here's a scene from the movie, where Eve

The Hunger- Games: Part 2 picks up just before the finale of The Hunger games. (Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage) The HungerGames: M. Night Shyamalan and Jennifer Lawrence in The Hungergames: MOCKINGJAY Part 2. (Everett Collection) The second part of The Last Airbender is definitely worth a watch. The second half of the film picks up right after the events in Mocking Jay. The film starts out pretty slow, with a lot of exposition going on about the Capitol and the upcoming fight against the Air Nomads. This movie was so good, that I was ready to go to sleep. This is the best of the trilogy, as it has more action and a better plot. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that it took so long to come out. This should have been released in 2015. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's not as good as The Last Samurai, but it is still a great movie. The Last Bloodbender is also worth a read. The last part of the series, which was also directed by Shyamalam and was written by M.Z. Simmons. This film was released a few years after the previous installment. The movie is set on the other side of the war and has the story of the rebellion against the monarchy. The first half of this movie was pretty good, with some great action. The beginning of this film was good, but the second half was even better. I loved this movie, and it's one of my favorite of the franchise. The plot in this movie revolves around a boy named Aang, who has to train to become the Avatar and save the world. This boy is really messed up, and I loved watching him go through the hell that he went through. This was definitely a good story, and if you have watched the previous movies, you will be able to understand everything that is going on. The ending of this story was really great, and really shows how
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ [If you like it, don't forget to leave a comment!]  The film was about a girl, a teenager who had been kicked out of her family home. She goes to live with her sister, who was adopted. It was supposed to be a temporary solution, but it ended up being a year in her home. I was not a huge fan of this film, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the story played out. It wasn't a story that made me want to scream at the screen, but the film had enough emotion to make me care about the characters and their struggle. The acting was superb throughout the film. It made you feel for the characters, and it made you want to be in their shoes. It had some amazing performances, from both the main and supporting characters. The soundtrack was also very memorable. There were some amazing tracks that I enjoyed listening to. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good mystery film, or anyone who wants to see a strong female lead. The ending was not what I was expecting, but this film had a lot of great moments that made it worth watching. I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The Last Man on Earth (2014) ***** 3.0 stars out of 5.0 (Movie of the Week) (AUG2014) The Lastman on Earth has a strong cast of talented actors. Mark Wahlberg, Bill Pullman, and Sam Worthington give it a good acting performance. The LastMan on Earth is about a man that is the last human being on earth and he has to live in a society with other animals. I found it funny and the cast did a good job. The story has a good twist and the film never lost it. I also liked that it is a good family movie. I would give it 4 stars but it gets a bit repetitive. The ending is good and you will have a good time. I recommend this to anyone who like comedy and horror.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I thought this was a really good movie. I liked the characters and the humor. It was not too long, but the humor was funny. It also had great acting. I am also glad that it has a sequel, which will hopefully make a good sequel. If you like good comedy and don't mind the long length, then you will like this movie. It is good to be a hero. _________________________________________________________  Helpful the only thing I can say is that this is one of the best animated films I've seen. The animation is amazing. The action is great. The music is great and I loved the jokes. The acting is good. The story is not too complex but I like it. The voice acting is great for both of the main characters. If there was anything I didn't like it was the ending. I wish they would have made a sequel. This movie is a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ The plot is a simple and straightforward one. Two young men meet, and start a relationship. But soon, the two become lovers. What makes this movie so special is its portrayal of love, and its portrayal in a very realistic manner. The film takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, as the lovers and the people around them start to suspect the truth. The movie portrays the ups and downs of the lovers, and what it means to love and to be loved. I thought the movie was so well written that it kept me going until the end, which was well worth the wait. The acting was perfect in this movie, and all the actors really did their job. If you like romantic movies, and are interested in seeing the lovers develop, then this is a good one to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ (All reviews) The Great Silence (2008) - 3/5 - "I don't usually give movies a good review, but this one just tickles my funny bone. I was really glad I came to see this. It's really a fun movie. It really does try to do a bit of everything. There are some nice special effects, and the acting is good." - Tom (Boomerang) The great silence (2008). This was a nice film that got a good reception from critics and audiences alike. A film about a family that goes to see a silent film. This is one of those films that have an overall good story. But there are also parts that are a bit strange and I don't really like. There is also a story that I found more interesting. The movie itself has good acting and special effects. I can see why this was a box office hit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Martian" (2014) is a very strong movie that can really challenge the space drama genre. This movie is based on a novel by Andy Weir which is a wonderful story that has a lot of scientific theories and ideas that is very entertaining to read. The movie is very well directed and written.  The main character is Mark Watney who is a NASA astronaut who is stranded on Mars and he has to work with a team to save the life of his crew mates. He is trying to figure out how to repair the space craft, how to get back to Earth and survive. The story is told with a lot science facts and a lot about the technology that is used in space and on Mars. The action scenes are really good and the movie has a great soundtrack. The acting is good and there are some great scenes and great performances.    The movie has great pacing. The main characters are in the beginning in a difficult situation. They are in a big spaceship that is stuck in a valley and they have to fight the dust storms and the temperature is dropping very fast. They have to survive for a long time but they get their chance at the end of the movie. It is a good action movie that will really challenge your mind and body. I loved the movie and it really made me think about the future and our future in space.     Overall, "The Martian " (2014), is a great movie that is set in the future. It has a good plot that has some great science theories and I really loved the scenes with the dust storm and the heat. It can really test your mind, body and soul. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

A very good movie to watch on the day, when the sun is shining and the sky is clear, when you are sitting in the park or under the stars and the stars shine their beautiful colours, when we are in the sea and we see the waves, when in the sun the clouds are clear and we can see the beautiful sun and the beautiful blue sky.   If you are a person that loves a good thriller, a thriller with good acting, a good story, then this movie is a must-watch. If you are looking for something that is not too hard, but with a lot of action and some action that is just hard, then go watch something else. But if you are in search of a great movie to be enjoyed on the last day of the summer and then watch it on the first day of fall and then the second day of winter, then it is a movie that you will love and will want to watch again and again.  , if you like a good action movie with good action scenes, good plot, good acting and good scenery, then you will be satisfied with this movie.If you love action movies with good cinematography, good actors, good characters, great action scenes and a good ending, then give this movie a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "When a girl falls in love, she's not supposed to have a problem. She's supposed to be a good person who just needs the right man to help her find it."  -Karen Black, (Linda Blair)  When she's hired to play the lead role in a movie about the Manson family, Linda (Jennifer Jason Leigh) gets caught up in the murder of a pregnant woman (Sissy Spacek) and soon finds herself embroiled in the biggest criminal case in the state of California.  Although the movie has a strong, dark storyline, it's the performances of its supporting characters that elevate it above average. Spacek is especially convincing as the victim, and Leigh is great in a leading role. But the movie's standout performance is by Kirstie Alley, who portrays a manipulative, conniving lawyer named Karen Black.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________________________________________________  The following review is from: The Devil Inside (1998) "The Devil Inside is an odd and rather boring movie, which is not surprising, since its writer/director, David Cronenberg, is not really a director in the usual sense of the word. Instead of an established actor playing a classic character, Cronenberg chooses to play the part himself, portraying a real, real person, a woman called Judith Anderson, whose life and life in general is utterly destroyed by a series of horrific events. The only other thing we know about her is that she's an alcoholic, and she's the object of a strange obsession on the part of a wealthy New York physician, Dr. Benjamin Siegel (Robert DeNiro). But before Judith has the chance to say anything to Siegel, she is possessed by a malevolent spirit and, in the most gruesome scenes in a movie that is so full of them, the physician uses a machine to turn Judith into a bloody mess of viscera. In an odd way, this movie is a study of the nature of evil. It is a movie about the destruction of a soul by evil, and it is a horror film that is about the power of the human mind and the will to live. As for the character of Judith, Cronenber was certainly trying to convey something about the nature and effects of alcohol, but he probably wasn't very successful. Judith is not a character who is at all realistic. Her story, which I found very difficult to follow, is full of contradictions. I think this was a very brave film to make, especially after the many dark and gloomy movies that Cronenberg had made before. But, at the same time, this was one of Cronenberg's best films, and certainly one of the most realistic. It was probably Cronenberg himself who was most shocked by the film's result. After seeing The Devil's Own, Cronholm said: 'I'm glad I didn't make that movie. It's not even close.' He was absolutely right. This is a film about the human condition, and, at times, it is about how the human will to survive can be overcome by a demonic force. As a result, The Devil Within is not very easy to watch, but it's definitely worth the effort. I'd give it an 8.8." - David J. Sorensen, author of The Devil in the White City  "David

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________   There's a lot to love about The Devil's Backbone. For one thing, it's a horror movie in the best sense of the word. The film is full of blood, guts, and guts. There's no denying that this film is intense, and it's certainly not for the faint of heart. It is the kind of movie you watch over and over again in your spare time. The only way I could stop watching was when my roommate and I were having a little trouble finishing the movie. I'd say it's one of the most frightening horror films I've ever seen.  And that's the best part of it. You can't really describe the feeling of being terrified, but you can tell that you're terrified, and you know that something terrible is about to happen. The movie is very much based on a true story. The plot revolves around a real incident that occurred in 1915, when a group of local farmers were attacked by an unknown killer. The killer left behind a trail of dead bodies and mutilated farm animals, but was never caught. There have been a number of films made about this story, but they usually have a lot of plot holes. So, what made this one so good? The Devil Backbone is one of those rare horror films that is well-made. It's very well-acted and the story is actually interesting. And, as I said before, the acting is great. If you're a fan of the horror genre, you should definitely give this one a watch. It might scare you a little, but it won't make you jump out of your seat.  the Devil's backbone

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  "A beautiful film about the end of an era and the life and love of an American poet. It's not a film about a poet; it's a film by a poet. The camera stays with him all the way. He gets through all the hard times and all the bad things, and he comes out a stronger and a happier person. It is a beautiful film. It makes you think, too, about what happened to poets in America after the First World War. They were all fired up about what was happening to the country. And then there were the bad times, too." (from a review by Robert C. Williams, Los Angeles Times, September 9, 1956)  ____________________________  The Great Dictator was my favorite movie of 1957, a movie I saw on its original release at the RKO Theater on the Sunset Strip. This was a year when Hollywood had a new star in the making, and they were all hoping that the American public would come out in a big way to see his picture, to embrace the new "Hollywood" as a cultural icon. (I would love to tell you more about this movie, but it has been destroyed by the ravages of time.) The movie is about a small town in Austria during the time of the German occupation, and the young and beautiful Jewish girl, Eva Braun. She is the daughter of the town's rabbi, and her father's brother. She has a very strong sense of Jewish identity, and a strong sense that she is a woman of great beauty. She loves her parents, but they don't love her back. Her mother dies when Eva is only twelve, and she is taken in by her uncle, a professor of philosophy at the University of Vienna. The uncle, Otto, has a strong love for her, and when he is in a difficult marriage, he tries to find a wife for Eva. He finds the perfect wife, who turns out to be her cousin, the beautiful dancer and singer Greta Garbo. (The movie is based on a true story, though.)  When the Nazis come to power, the young girl, who has always been a sensitive soul, feels very lonely, and very angry. She feels a deep sense of injustice and has a feeling of great responsibility to act against the Nazis. She decides to flee with a couple of other young girls from Austria to the United States, and in order to do this, she goes to live

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather Part II.  I'm sure a lot of people were looking forward to seeing the film, which was a continuation of The Godfather, but after seeing it, I can't imagine that I'll be watching it again.  I'm not going to bother going into the movie's plot, but I'll just say that the plot is a mess, and it was so much better in the second movie.   The reason why I can only give this film 3 stars is because it doesn't really have anything interesting to say.  It's the same thing you've seen a thousand times before.  I'm not sure what the point of this movie was supposed to be, because the film didn't do anything different than the first.  If you've watched the first movie, then you'll understand why I'm giving it 3 stars, but if you haven't, then this film is definitely not for you.  The characters in this film, including Tony, are like cardboard cut-outs.  They have no personality.  Their dialogue is boring.  And their relationships with each other are pathetic.  One scene in the movie I found particularly sad was when Tony had to take care of his grandmother, who was ill, and he took care of her the way he would take care off a pet.  For the first time, we see Tony being a father.  This is a great moment in the film when Tony, while taking care of someone else's mother, has to see her suffer and not do anything.  When I first watched this movie, I was very surprised that the character of Tony was played by Michael Corleone.  But I was glad that he was.  Michael Corlesone is one of my favorite actors.  He is a very charismatic and intense man.  Corleones are charismatic and strong.  So when I heard that Michael Corlone was going to play Tony, I knew that he would be a great actor.  However, when I watched the movie, Michael Corlezone wasn't able to show us that he could play a part like Tony.  Instead, he is portrayed as a boring and one dimensional character.  As a character, Tony is a complete cliché.  All of his actions and words are the same.  In fact, all of his interactions with other characters are the exact same.   I don't understand how he's so charismatic and powerful when he can't

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********  This is the best movie I've seen in a while.  It's very simple and the plot is simple, it's a story about a man who is forced to do some very dangerous things to protect a woman. The movie is not very scary, but I found it very interesting. The plot is not so hard to understand. You should watch it!  A little bit of a problem with the sound:  In the beginning there is a very strange sound that was almost like a whistle. When the woman who was kidnapped starts screaming the sound starts getting more and more annoying. It's annoying and I found that it made it very hard to concentrate. It sounds so similar to the whistle from the beginning of the movie.  of course, I'm not a movie expert, so I can't give a good review for this movie. But if you are looking for a good horror movie that is not too scary, this movie is a good one. .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the summer of 1984, a young boy named Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his best friend, ex-Marine Chris (Paul Greengrass) head out to the Caribbean on a secret mission. Along the way, Jason uncovers a dark plot that has been brewing for years in the secret society of a wealthy New York family. As they search for a way to expose the evil of this society and bring its leaders to justice, they find themselves in a dangerous, life-or-death situation. The film features the voice talents of Paul Greengrass, Matt Damon, Sean Harris, and a number of others, as well as a great performance from the young, yet talented, Sean Penn. The screenplay for The Bourne Legacy is a classic Bourne adventure that was created by Aaron Sorkin, based on the Bourne Identity novel. The Bourke Legacy also stars Tommy Lee Jones, Julia Stiles, and Ben Affleck. The first installment of the trilogy, The Bourgeos: The Bource Legacy, was released in 2006. It's a great addition to the series and I'd recommend this one to anyone who loves Bourne. 9. The Departed (2006) This one is more of a personal favorite of mine than any of the others on the list. This is my favorite film of all time. This movie has all of the classic Bourque trademarks in it: a brilliant and charismatic lead actor, great acting, and lots of action. The story follows a very interesting character, Nicky Parsons (Ryan Gosling), as he deals with the effects of his father's death and his own life in the underworld. The movie is very well done and has a great cast of characters. I also really liked the direction and the cinematography in this movie. It was one of my favorite action films of all-time. The acting is also very good. Ryan Gosling, Tom Cruise, and Russell Crowe are great. 8. Heat (2003) Another of my personal favorites, and another Bourne film. This one features many of the same elements as The Bourque Legacy, such as the story about a very talented and ambitious young man who comes out of retirement to protect his friends. The plot is a bit more complex than the others, but the story is still a great one. Chris Morgan and Sean Penn do great in this film, and they are great characters. The action scenes are also really good, especially in the first
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  So I was in a bar with a friend, the usual. After a few drinks she said she had to go home. I went with her and as I was leaving I started getting really sad. I had a great time in the bar and enjoyed talking to the people I met. After about a half hour of crying she came back. She said she was so happy to see me and gave me a kiss. I said thank you. She was crying a lot so I kissed her and she hugged me and she said sorry for being so sad. She asked if I could stay. I told her that I didn't feel well. She started to cry a little and she told me she didn't want to leave. I asked her if she was drunk. She answered yes. She then told me I needed to go to the hospital. I was going to go with her, I didn  She asked me if I was drinking. I answered that I was. She gave me some drinks. I don't remember much of that night, but I did remember that she was crying for the rest of the night. I decided to go back home, as I felt I should be with my girlfriend. I found her at home, but she didn`t want to talk. She told me to go in and she would talk to me later. I followed her into her bedroom. She looked sad, like she was just waiting for me to leave the room. I started crying as well, and she comforted me by kissing me. I then told her I wanted to go into the bathroom and use the restroom. She replied that she didn\'t have any toilet paper, but that she would give me some later. As I was about to leave, she asked me to come in. She took me to the bathroom, I could see the whole thing from there. I looked down and saw my underwear and underpants. I couldn\'t see any panties, but there was a condom in her hand. I didn\' t think much of it, she was my girlfriend, and I was just so happy that she cared for me. We talked a little more, she told about what happened. I apologized for everything and she apologized for being sad. We kissed and she then told that she needed to use the bathroom. She went back into the bedroom, closed the door, turned the light off, turned on the bathroom light, and went back out. She closed the bathroom

In the Name of the Father (2011)  The movie is about the life of a father in a poor family, who in his life was a victim of a robbery and his father who killed the robbers in cold blood. The father also committed suicide by the age of 19.  His son who is a teenager, has never been in the same class as his father and as he grows up he starts to doubt his father's guilt. It's a good watch.  and I would have to say:  2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011).  I would like to add that I watched this movie with my sister and we had a great time together watching this movie. I would like the director to make a sequel.  the film is a great thriller and very realistic, if the characters are like the characters in the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My review of The House is as follows: The House by Timur Vermes is a film that has its fair share of flaws. I have been a fan of the writer's work since his early days in the 1990s, when I saw his early feature, The Man Without a Face. He has developed a talent for telling a story in an interesting manner, yet at the same time a bit of an outsider who comes off as a bit too self-centered. He is a talented director that seems to be able to pull off the impossible. The House tells a story of a man who is in a situation that he could never handle. It is the tale of a family that is trying to get through a terrible ordeal. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how a family could survive a disaster like this. It was a real tragedy and it affected them in a very real way. It really took a toll on all of them and I don't think they would have been able to overcome what they had suffered if it wasn't for a man named Timur. The family has been in a difficult situation for years now. Their father is in prison for a murder he didn't commit. Their mother is dying of cancer. They have a young son who has been raised in a way that is very unbalanced. The father is now a man without a face and is trying his best to survive the last days of his life. He tries to get some help for his family but he has a hard task ahead of him. There are many things that are not what they seem in this film. There is a secret that the husband has been hiding from the family that will come to light. The film is not about a person in a perfect situation and the family doesn't make the best of a bad situation. It also doesn't seem to want to get to the bottom of what really happened in the house. I thought the film was very well made. I found myself completely engrossed in the story and I found the performances to be very good. The house itself is very well done. It has a very unique look and I was really amazed by how many details the director was able to put into it. I can't wait to see more of Timur's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is the second one of my favourite series, and the first one was the best one, so I recommend you watch the first two and then watch this one.  If you have a weak stomach, do not watch this movie, but if you have not seen the first series, you have to watch it because it is not a movie for the weak hearted.   I can say I enjoyed this movie very much and the story is very well done.  There are some scenes that were better in the series, but they are in the movie.  They are not as good as the scenes in the first season, but I enjoyed them.  The story is really great and it is full of twists and turns that will keep you thinking, but at the same time you are laughing at the funny moments.  It is the story that makes the movie great and I really like it, because it was great and funny.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.  This movie is really well made, so don't let the poor animation put you off, as it is really good.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and I think everyone should watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Road Warrior" is a masterpiece. I love the first movie and "The Road Warriors" is one of my all time favorite movies. I also have a couple of the "Road Warriors" action figures.  The movie takes place in the 80s and the characters are all pretty similar to the first "Road Warrior" but this time it's set in the 90s. The action scenes are all done with great camera angles and the action sequences are great as well. I would recommend this movie to fans of the original movie and anyone who just wants a great action movie. A good movie about a bad guy:  "The Last Dragon" is about a young boy named Dragon who wants to be a great fighter. He meets up with his friend, a man named Drago, who teaches him how to fight. However, Dragon quickly realizes Drago is a bad man who doesn't care about anything other than money. Drago makes Dragon do a job for him. After they finish the job, they're given a fight.  When they get to the arena, Dragon realizes that Drago isn't a man he can rely on.  Dragon and Drago fight each other and are almost killed.  Dragon is saved by Drago's daughter and Dragicus. She tells him to take Drago with him and to never come back. They leave Dragon alone and he decides to go back to Drago. Dragicos father doesn't believe him and takes a sword to kill him. He doesn't even think to ask Dragon if he's okay. When Dragicios father dies, Dragon goes on a rampage. He kills everyone who doesn 't have anything to do with him. Draga has to leave and he goes on to become the most feared man in the country. The film also has great martial arts choreography. I loved this movie and it's a classic. Great movie about an ex-cop:   The movie "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" is the follow up to "Maniac".  It takes place a few years after the events of the first film and focuses on the main villain, Raiden.  Raiden is a ruthless warrior who is so evil that he wants to kill everyone who isn't part of his team. When he hears that Raiden has been hired to kill one of his own, he refuses to let him go.   When Raiden and his team go to
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- **The Day the Earth Stood Still** I have to say that this movie was worth the wait. This is the first movie I saw with Steven Spielberg and that made me a very happy person. I really like this movie and I think it's one of the best Steven Spielberg movies. I think that he really went for it. This movie is very close to the truth. You'll get a true feeling of what it was like to live in the 1950s. You see that the people that lived in the town were all very friendly. The movie makes you realize how different our lives are from the way they were. I've seen some movies with a different story that have a very bad quality to them but this movie doesn't. It's very well made. It has that Spielberg feel to it. I love the way the movie is shot. I don't know if it's because of Spielberg or because of the film stock but it's amazing how well they can make this film look. I always liked Spielberg's movies because of his style. I also love the music and the acting. I like the way this movie looks but I also liked the way that it was shot. The film looks like it was made in the 50s. The way the movies are made nowadays isn't very good. I was very happy to see that this was a Spielberg movie. It was a very good movie. I recommend it to all the people who love Spielberg and to the people. I saw it on DVD at the video store and I bought it at the theater because it was a great movie.

He was the great teacher and the perfect preacher, and in the Book of John he speaks to his followers: "If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will love you and will be faithful to you. Even though I am weak, I will not be afraid, because you are with me; your love is stronger than death. And my Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And if you ask anything in my name, I am here. I have said these things to you, so that my joy may be in you and your joy may rest upon me."  And what he is referring to is his resurrection. The Book of Revelation tells of a woman who comes to him, and says: "Lord, Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner." And Jesus says:  "Because you believed that I am he, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."  a. (4) Now John did not do this, but the other disciples did, for they went out, one after another, to see him. But when they saw him they did not believe in him. b. (5) Jesus, however, said to them, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light to see as I do. c. (6) So I tell you, whoever believes in me will never see death." ....  Jesus is the light and the life and the way. In the Gospel we are told of the coming of the Son of Man in the Spirit: "And the one who has believed in him will live." And the Book says: "'Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, who have left the world without committing a single sin..'  .......  a..... I will show you the Father. b.....  the Father is in me and I in him."..."  So this is the story: Jesus is the greatest teacher of his time

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I can't get enough of this movie. I love the movie, I love how the cast and the director made me fall in love with it. This movie is so good it makes you fall for the characters, the story, the plot and the action. The acting is perfect and it's the acting that really makes the movie. It's not just one actor who makes this movie a masterpiece. The story and the plot are really well done, and you get a great picture of what really happened during the war. It makes you feel sorry for the people who are in the concentration camps, and makes you wish that you were one of them. I really enjoyed the movie because it is not a war movie, it's a movie about how people in the middle of a war deal with each other. It is not about one big war, but a war between people. The characters are not bad, they just try to make the best out of their situation. It doesn't make them good people, it makes them human, and they are just like us. This is not the kind of movie that makes you think and make you feel sad or angry, it is just a movie. One of my favorite movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I loved this movie so much, I was so happy when I saw it for the first time and I even thought about my friend, my sister and my little sister (they are like twins) to watch it together. It's a good story and it's so funny. The music is very good, and the story is just great. The story is about a family in the past and the present. I loved how the whole movie is about the children and their family. I hope the next one will be more like this movie. The best part is that this movie is only a few hours long, and you can watch it in a whole day.  I'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting, it was amazing. It was all very well done and the actors did their job really well. The cinematography was really good, it's very interesting and you could see everything very clearly. I don't think there's anything wrong with the sound, it fit very well. . , I can't even express how great this movie was. It has great characters, a great story and a great soundtrack. I think this movie will go on to be one of the best movies of the year. If you are into movies about children and families, this movie can't be missed. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone, especially if you love movies about families and kids. This movie is one of my favorites and if you are also a fan of movies about the family, this is definitely a must watch. This is a great movie and I loved it. The only downside is that it is only 3 hours long and the second half of the movie is missing. I really hope that the second movie is longer, but at this point it doesn't matter.  a  "I'm sorry"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen this movie at a festival in Belgium and it was good. It was not as good as the movies of John Carpenter but it was still good. This movie is a remake of the original and it is interesting that the director decided to change the character of the villain. It is interesting because the villain is no longer a vampire but a werewolf.  This movie has some great action scenes and it also has a great villain. The only thing that I don't like is that the characters are too stupid. I mean they were really stupid in this movie. This is one of those movie that you don't want to watch at home but it is still a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ It's a good film. I was expecting a more depressing, serious, dramatic movie with a lot of people dying. I expected a more violent film, a more intense film. Instead I got something that is more interesting and a more enjoyable movie to watch. I liked the story and the characters, the characters were well developed. It wasn't a story about someone dying, it was about a man who lives in a world of pain, in pain he lives. He is a realist. He sees what is going on in the world, he understands what has happened, but he doesn't want to know. It's about his life, and his journey. It is a beautiful film. There were moments in the film that made me cry, and it made me want to watch it all over again. It was beautiful and sad, but at the same time, it had a heart, and was a good story. It had a great soundtrack, and a good plot. I can't recommend it highly enough. If you are a film lover like me, I would definitely recommend this to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Matrix " is the most important movie of the year.  I've been trying to think of a film that has had as much of an impact on me as this one, and I haven't come up with a good one yet. _____________________________________ "When I am finished, I shall be in heaven, for I shall know the truth." That's right.      The Matrix is not just the first major motion picture ever made, it is also the first ever to be directed by the man who directed the first of the first of the Matrix films, "The Matrix".  What a difference two decades makes.                                                             - The Matrix      The movie itself starts off pretty normal.        A guy named Neo (Keanu Reeves) wakes up in the world of the Matrix, a world that is a combination of reality and a virtual reality, with all the problems and problems that come with it.  The first scene in the movie shows us a train moving along the tracks.  It is a train that's been sent by The Machines to bring Neo back to earth so that he can become a weapon to destroy them.  Now, if you haven't noticed, the train in the first scene is a machine.  Then, Neo wakes up and gets a computer chip implanted in his head, which gives him the ability to go through walls and into another dimension.  After that, we see Neo trying to figure out how to become the savior of the world, but eventually he is captured by the Machine.  Neo gets back into the Matrix through a portal and then he gets pulled into another world, where he is told that he is the hero and that he will save the world.  There are no other humans in this world, only machines.  However, one day, Neo comes across a woman, a woman named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who tells him that the world that he lives in is only a computer simulation, and that there is a woman that lives in his real world.      At this point, Neo's mind is so messed up that he does not know where the woman is.  He eventually comes to the conclusion that Morpheus is a character in the Matrix that is helping him, and tells Morpheus to leave the Matrix.  Morpheus does, but Neo comes to realize that the woman that he has been telling Morpheus about is

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" is a good film, but it is also one that was never intended to be seen.  At its heart, the film is a retelling of "Don Quixotes", a short story by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes. It was first published in 1605 and published in the 17th century in several translations.  (It has since been translated into many languages and is a popular work today.)  The film opens on the day when Miguel de Quiroga, the main character, arrives in the court of Sancho Panza, the most powerful man in the land, to ask for his pardon. Panza is the main hero of "The Man who Killed Don Juan", a novel by Cervante, and the main protagonist of "Miguel de Cervellar". The story is set in the 16th century and follows the adventures of a man who is called by a knight of the round table to kill a very important figure of the time. Quiroga's job is to kill Don Quijote, an ex-convict who has just been freed by a Spanish general.  and  After an interesting opening sequence in which the courtiers debate whether Quirosa should be a knight or a squire, the rest of the film follows the action of Quiñónes, a Spanish knight, who goes to rescue Don Quiquito from the arms of the general. The two are engaged in a sword fight, in which Don Quioto is wounded. The general orders the knight to be beheaded, but Quiroyas refuses to do so, saying that he will not do it and that he was innocent of all charges. The knight is killed by Don Quiqos' sword.  the general orders him to be decapitated, but the knight refuses to behead him and says he will kill the general in revenge for his father and the murder of his friends. Quiquigo is taken to Sancho's castle. Here the general is also killed, but his head is left behind and it is later discovered that the general was a member of the royal court.  for me, "The man who killed Don Quidote" was a very good movie. It has a great cast of characters, including Cervando, a very strong and beautiful Spanish actor who, I found, has great acting skills, even
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I would say this is the best film that I have seen so far this year. I have watched this movie at a couple of different times of day and it always gets me. This movie was a good reminder of what an art form this is. I will say this though, that the ending was a little abrupt and I would have preferred to see more of what happened in the past before the movie ended. I also wish that the director had gone a little more into the personal side of this movie. The ending was rather unsatisfying. If you liked this movie, you should really check out the rest of the movies in this series. This is just a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Thing is a classic, and the best of the '80s. I've been a huge fan of the movie ever since seeing it at the cinema, and even more since seeing a bootleg version a few years ago. The Thing is not a perfect movie, but it's a good, fun, action-packed film that is a great, fun watch.  There are a few minor problems in the film, but they're not enough to make it unlistenable. Â  As with most horror movies, the special effects in The Thing are really not up to the standards of most other films from the same era.    This was a period when computer graphics had yet to take over the cinema (in fact, most of the movies from this era are very old-school).   The Thing uses a mixture of computer generated graphics and practical effects to achieve the effect.  There are also a lot of small CGI effects in the movie, as well.  The thing has to escape from a research base in the Antarctic to find his way home, but the whole story is basically told by the Thing.  I have never been a big fan of "hero" type movies.  This is one of the few that I can say is a good hero movie.  A scientist is on a mission to investigate strange happenings at a research station.  However, his mission becomes a nightmare when a gigantic monster comes to life and begins to rampage through the base.     One of the best parts of the film is when the monster is shown from a distance and the Thing has to chase it through the Antarctic.  For a while, the Thing tries to stop the monster from getting too close to him, but this ends up backfiring as the monster manages to get in close and eats the scientist.  There are many different versions of the plot, but there are many parts that are similar.  If you like this movie, you should see it on the big screen.  It's an interesting movie with lots of action and good performances.  Overall, I give The Thing a 7.5 out of 10.  Thanks for reading,  --David
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** (1/5)  This movie has no plot and no story. There is nothing here that is really going to take the movie away from the movie, or take it in a different direction. The movie is just about the characters in it, not about the story or plot. I can see why this movie would be bad, but it was a good time to see some characters do their thing and have a good story, but this movie is about how much fun they had, not how they did it.

The story was very simple but very good, very well shot and edited, and a nice character. The cast was good too, the leading lady was a perfect match for the part and she did a great job. The scene with the old man was very funny and was really touching. The movie is a good example of a good acting, directing and cinematography.

One day his mother is killed in a car accident, and Alex decides to leave his father to stay with his mother's friend, Sally. Alex's brother, Nick, comes back to town and tries to get Alex to leave the town. However, Alex has a secret which will lead to him meeting someone who will change his life forever. And I love this movie! I love that the story is simple and easy to follow, that it has a very nice score, and that it is very funny. This movie makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it. There are a lot of great scenes and it has that great atmosphere of a great summer movie. This is the best movie to watch on a beach, and I highly recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film opens with a brief but beautiful montage of shots of the various members of the cast (the same actors who starred in the original) in front of a green screen with the words "A New Wave of American Cinema" printed above it. It's a great introduction to what's to come. Then we cut to a scene of the kids playing with a giant ball of string and a bunch of little balls. The strings and balls are going around and around, and the camera pans across the kids with the string and balls moving on and off screen. "I was in awe," says a boy. "It looked like it was on fire," says another boy. Then they turn to a big ball of strings and they all stop. Then a little ball comes flying down from above, and it just kind of bounces along and rolls along. The whole scene is like that, and that's the first time we get a glimpse of what is to come in the film. The scene ends with the little ball flying back up to the sky and the boys cheering, and then it cuts back to the little balls flying back to their original spot. This sequence is followed by a montage which is much more beautiful than the first one. It shows the various artists and artists' styles and the different things they did in the early part of the 20th Century, before Hollywood became what it is now. They are playing with watercolor and gouache, and some are using the same brushes, but each is unique. One boy is painting a picture of a horse, another boy is making a model of a rocket ship, and another boy paints an abstract image of a cityscape. And they're all doing it in a very artistic way. And then we see a scene where the ball of watercolor gets mixed up with the paintbrush, and all the paint gets splashed all over the boy's face. That's where he gets his "muddy" look. And it's a beautiful scene. And we see another boy, this one with a paintbrush and watercolor, and he's painting a scene in which a bunch or kids are in a big room playing with little balls and strings. And the boy paints a picture with the balls and the strings and the watercolor. It looks very real and very artistic. It seems like it's from a painting. "And that was the first scene we saw.

When she arrives she learns that there is a new town up the road called Noddwick. She learns that her husband was killed in the town up in the country a few years ago, but she doesn't know where it is. She doesn't think he would want her to know that. Her children want her back, but not her husband. She asks the townspeople if they have seen any of the town's famous heroes lately.

Mrs.White sets off to find her husband, but before she can find him she meets a young girl named Lucy (Kathleen Turner). Lucy tells Mrs.white that she has found her husband in the woods and she can help her. She takes Mrs.whiten's arm and leads her to a dark and eerie clearing. They find her dead husband, and the town is in fear of a killer who is out to kill again. The townspe people are divided, and Mrs.Whiten tries to persuade them that it's the town itself that is the killer, and that the only way to stop it is to kill the town.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (1) _________ The film is not great, but it does not deserve to be. I was expecting something much better. It is very well made, but the actors, who seem to have been thrown into the role, do not seem to be able to make the characters as interesting as the director intends. It makes the movie hard to enjoy. The director has made some great movies in the past, but this one is just too boring to be interesting. The special effects are okay, but not great. There are some pretty good special effects in this movie. I also did not like the ending. The movie could have ended a few minutes earlier. I think this movie will be good for those who love the old westerns and are disappointed that the last one was made by a young director.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great movie! This is a fun movie with a great story line. The characters are well written and have a lot of fun. It takes place in the late 1800's, and features some cool costumes. The only thing that was a little annoying was that the music in the background was very annoying. I am sure it was just a coincidence. Overall, I loved this movie!

I'd love to hear about your movie experience. Maybe you could write a movie review too. I think you should give this movie a chance. It's a good comedy and the characters are great.)   I don't usually write reviews for movies. However, I was so thrilled to see this movie that I thought I should at least give it a chance, and the result is a wonderful movie.   In the film, the young John C. Reilly (Ringo) has an experience at the Playboy Mansion. After his time there, he becomes a stripper. He meets a young woman, Linda (Kerry Washington), who tells him she is from the Playboy mansion and he gets a job there. Linda wants John to be her "pimp" for her husband (Gary Busey) and to get some money from him. After they meet, Linda makes John an offer he can't refuse.   a) he gets paid $500 a night for 3 hours of sex b) John gets to choose the girl that he gets to sleep with that night. c) He can go to the Playboy club for $50 a night and watch the beautiful women there d) He gets to pick the girl's clothes and have sex with them e) He's not allowed to cum.  - I have never seen anything like this before. It is just so well written. I am still amazed at how well the script is written. There is no doubt in my mind that John C Reilly is a very funny and charming man. He does an excellent job as John C., and the movie does a great job of showing the inner workings of a young man's mind and his feelings about women.  .   I must say that there is a lot of nudity in this movie. However I think that it is quite tasteful. There were no gratuitous pictures of boobs, but there were some very erotic scenes that are very well acted. There are several scenes where John and Linda have sex. The sex scenes were extremely well acted and the actors did a great deal of work. The only time that I could see a problem with the sex scenes was when Linda had to masturbate in the car. But I don't think that was necessary. I thought that it was a very interesting and tasteful way of showing that John is
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  It's hard to review a movie that I've never seen before. It's even harder to review something that I have seen so many times. This is the third movie I've seen from this director, but I've only seen two of them. They are both pretty good. But they are also very different, and I find it hard to compare them.  The first movie was called "The Devil and Daniel Johnston". This is a film that was based on a book written by the author of the book. It was based around a man who had been working in the mines, and was about to get into a fatal accident. When he saw a young boy playing with a toy gun, he pulled it out and shot it. The boy died in the accident. He was angry at God for making him work in the dangerous mines, but it was too late to stop. The Devil then found a way to get back to heaven. Daniel Johnston played the devil. I've always thought that Daniel Johnston is a great actor. But in this movie he is played by a man named Jack Palance. This was one of the more disturbing movies I've ever seen. It is also one of my favorite movies. But I really didn't like it. I also found it strange that the devil was a woman. I guess that it was an attempt to make the film more like a romance. It just didn't work.  and the film I saw at the same time, was "A Christmas Story". I thought that this movie was more like the first one. It also had the devil, but this time he was a girl. This time he had an evil step-father. I thought this was a good film. I think that the director of this film, Robert Zemeckis, was trying to make a movie about Christmas. The first movie had a lot of Christmas spirit. It had Christmas lights in the sky, Christmas trees, Christmas music, etc. The second movie was a lot more serious. It really made a lot better use of its time. But this movie still had a Christmas feel to it. . , and the movie I saw right before that was "The Muppet Christmas Carol". This was the most depressing film I've saw. I really don't think that it is very funny. I just find that it has very little heart. The film was based off a book by the same name. But it was also a very

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ __________________________  "Buckets of Blood" is an outstanding thriller that takes you through a mind-boggling plot and through the lives of the three main characters. As you watch, you are captivated by the tension that comes from every frame. It is as if the film's director, Steven Soderbergh, is trying to show how one man can do something truly amazing. Soderberg, who has made a career of masterful twists and turns, uses the film to make a strong statement about man's ability to change the world, and how the decisions we make can shape our destiny. Sederberg does this by using the story as a metaphor for how we are always caught in a life and death struggle, and it is a metaphor that is not always easy to see. There are two scenes that have me in tears. The first is the scene where the father, in his despair and loneliness, walks into the river and falls into the murky depths. He dies there, and the camera zooms in on his lifeless face as he stares at the river. The second is a scene in which the woman who is supposed to be his wife, the mother of his children, walks along a beach and encounters a boy who is also looking for his mother. The boy is a lost child, and he asks her for a picture of his mother, and she is only able to give him a glimpse of her back. As she stares at his back, he asks if his mother was really his mother and she tells him that she doesn't know. This scene is powerful and it brings tears to my eyes. The third scene is the one in which Soderbeg's character (David), a young man with a bright future, travels from California to Maine to take a job with a pharmaceutical company. The company wants to develop a drug to treat the common cold. David meets with the director, who tells him about the new drug and how it would be a breakthrough for medicine. The director also shows David a drug test he did with the new medicine and tells him how it came out on the screen. David realizes that the director is lying and tries to tell him so, but the director says that he has a lot of faith in him. As David continues to argue with the doctor, he finds that the test results do not match with what he had done with the drug. The doctor tells David that the drug is a miracle cure and he would have
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Gatsby" is a good story about a very rich man who wants a divorce from his wife and wants a mistress.  This is not a film about the Great Depression and it is not about the Jazz Age.    This is a story about the rise and fall of a man's ambitions and love.  It is a wonderful story of greed, betrayal, and love and it leaves the audience with a feeling of wonder.  The Great Gaters story is a bit different in that the main character, Nick Carraway is not the one who goes out to make a fortune.  Nick is a businessman and is very much aware of the way he makes his money.  His business is his life.  In his life, he wants to make money and be rich and he has a very good idea how to do this.  He takes the advice of a young man, Jay Gatsberg, to help him with his idea.  This idea was to buy a beautiful painting by Matisse and then sell it for a great price.  Jay wants a great return on his investment and Nick has a plan to do it.  When the two of them meet at a bar, Nick is still a little drunk.  They begin to talk about their ideas and Nick admits he is only interested in Jay.  After some time, Nick becomes a little more sober and asks Jay if he knows of any dealers that will help him make money. Jay says he knows a good one.  Then Jay gets a call that his business partner, a rich and arrogant woman, has been arrested for stealing from him.  At this point, Nick realizes that Jay GATSBERG is the best deal he could ever have.  There is only one person that knows the deal and that is Nick Carrick.  What happens next is something I don't want to spoil.  I will just say that the film ends with a wonderful twist that is unexpected and a wonderful surprise.  A good story like this can be ruined by some of the terrible characters that are involved.  Some of the characters are ridiculous, others are completely ridiculous, but in the end the story is great and the characters seem to have been created with care.  If you are a fan of classic films, this is a film that you must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is an entertaining film that is an example of how you don't have to be a movie star to make a good film.  The film is not a great film in the sense of it's story or acting, but it's entertaining and entertaining as hell.    I don't think that any of the actors in the film were able to achieve what they are supposed to do on screen.  I think the best part of the film is the fight scene.  When you think about it, it's a great fight scene to watch.  If you're not a fan of the Westerns, you will enjoy the movie as it's an entertaining watch. I recommend this movie to people who want to see a good Western film and enjoy it as much as I did.  This film is worth the watch and I highly recommend it.  It's one of the best Westerns that I've seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. You don't have to like the movie to watch it. That's the beauty of it. This is a film about the human race, but it's also about what happens to a group of men who are sent to the distant, hostile planet of Xibalba to test a new and dangerous weapon. It's about the tension between what a man is forced to do and what he is willing to do to help those he loves. It is about a group who must survive while being hunted by their own people. It isn't just a horror movie. This has a lot of other themes and ideas. It was a film I found interesting for different reasons. The story is told through the eyes of the three men as they slowly discover the world and each other. The film is full of tension and suspense. You'll be scared out of your wits by moments of sheer terror. The camera work and effects were all done very well and help to create a very dark and eerie atmosphere. I loved it, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good horror film with a very cool ending. __________ Pros: - Good atmosphere. - Good direction. - Great characters. - Really well done action sequences. - Lots of scary moments. - Solid acting. - Cool ending. - Unique plot. - Weird and interesting creatures. - Awesome special effects. Cons: - Some characters are a bit thin. - Too many plot holes.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ I think this film is a good example of what a film can be when it stays away from the clichés that plague many movies of its type. I'm not sure how it's possible for a movie to be such a masterpiece when the plot is so shallow and the characters are so uninteresting and lifeless, but somehow the story of a young man who has been abducted by aliens is one of the most interesting stories of all time. This movie has so much depth and has some very strong themes that are so relevant to today's society. The acting by both of the leads is excellent and the way the movie is presented is just beautiful. It's very easy to follow and to understand the plot and the emotions of the characters and how the movie makes you feel. There is a great soundtrack that plays at the beginning of the film and is really fitting to the mood of the movie. The movie also has a great ending which is very well done and very satisfying. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something a little different and a bit more interesting. I just wish this movie had more of an emotional impact and didn't have such a shallow ending. I'll give this movie 4 out of 5 stars because it has all of the right ingredients and is just a great story.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I was excited for this one! I was expecting a cheesy 90s action flick and I wasn't disappointed. It's fun, fast, and funny. It was pretty good! I just don't understand why people are not into it! I have a hard time getting into the whole action genre, but this movie has a lot of fun. The story is really good and the characters are really fun to watch. The music is also really good. I thought the music was great. The fight scenes were great and really intense. I liked the movie, but I wish they made more of them. This is definitely worth watching, especially if you like action. This movie was awesome!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I have to say that this is one of the best films I've seen. It is one part of a trilogy that is really one long story. The story starts when the father of a young boy discovers that his boy is not his son after all. Then the real mystery begins. The boy's father has been found murdered. The mother has been arrested and is being held in a jail. The young boy is the prime suspect. Then there is the problem of the father's real identity. Who was he really? There is also a real mystery here that keeps you intrigued throughout. You are kept on your toes and you don't know who is who or why. The only negative I can find is the lack of plot development. If the story is as good as this it would have been a fantastic trilogy. But it just doesn't get there. This movie is just great!

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- 1.1 1/2 I've never seen anything like this movie and it was awesome. The movie is all about the struggle between a boy and a girl. This boy has just come back from a trip to the mountains where he had a terrible accident. He was going to go back to school but his teacher wouldn't let him because she said it was a "sensitive subject". The girl on the other hand had a crush on him and the two are going to make love. The boy was in a lot of pain from the accident. After a few days, the girl starts getting more and more angry and jealous. She goes into the school one day and meets the boy's father. She tells him that she has found the boy and asks him to let her see him. The father agrees and the girl comes into the room. She puts her hands on him as if to show her love. Suddenly, the boy disappears and she realizes that it was just a dream. The girl begins to cry. She then starts to think about her feelings for the boy. The next day, the same boy comes to school and asks her if he had hurt her feelings. She responds that he didn't but the boy says that he was just jealous and doesn't know what to do. The two end up making love and she admits that she doesn't want him. She asks him if he still has feelings for her and he responds that she is not his girl anymore. The story then ends with them making up. --------------- 2/5 I don't think that this movie had a great message. The message I was trying to get across was that we are all people in this world and that we can't be separated from each other. However, I feel that the movie tried to make a deeper point about the human condition. I think that if you are going on a trip and you have an accident, you should take your time to recover. You have a lot to think and you should go to a doctor. I would advise you to wait until you feel well before you go to the doctor. Also, you can't get over the accident by making up your mind to forget it. -------------- 2/4 I loved this movie! I thought that it had a very deep message about love and loss. It was an amazing movie and I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice and relaxing movie. I also found that I liked the boy who was with the girl. It really was

The most famous story of an Englishman's fight with the "northern" side of his family was told in the movie "Nixon," by the same director who made "The Manchurian Candidate," in 1962. It was also told in "The Great Gatsby," and in "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat," in the 1960s. "The Natives" (1947) is the best movie of all. It has been described as a love story, but, really, it is about a fight between two families over land. It is also about racism, and it is a great love story. The story takes place in England, in the 18th century. A group of wealthy families, including the Brontës, is trying to acquire a large tract of land in the south-west. The Brontes have a good relationship with the Native American tribe of the area, and they want to use the land as a hunting and gathering ground. However, the Native Americans want the land because they believe that it was given to them by a white woman, who lived on the land in a long-lost way before the time of Christ. The Indian leader is an old man, but he is very cunning, and he uses all sorts of lies and tricks. He tells the English families that he can't have the land, but then he is forced to give it to them. Then, he says that he has a wife and children in America, and if they can give him back his land, he will give them a large sum of money. This is a brilliant move. The English families can not afford to pay back the Native, and this will be a disaster for the Brondes. Then the English people are shocked to find out that the tribe of Native Americans has a great many people living in America. It seems as if there must be a connection between the land of America and the people living there, because the people of America have an English language, a church, and a government. The only

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- "I was at a friend's house on a Friday night and we were just sitting around watching a movie. I went to get a beer and this girl was sitting next to me. I asked her what movie she was watching and she told me it was "The Big Lebowski" and that she had seen it a few times. I told her that I thought it was a great movie. She said she had never seen it and that it was great! Then she said something like "you know what would be great, if you could just get a girl to like you, you know what I mean?" I was a little surprised at this and I thought for a second, maybe she was just talking about guys and not girls, and I went over to her to find out what she meant. She went on to say that she wanted to go out to dinner with me that night and she would love to have a good time. She wanted to do something nice for me and I was so happy that she was so interested in me that she would want to do this for me. She was so sweet and sweet, I could have fallen in love with her! I asked if I could come over that night to dinner and that we could watch "The Dude" together and that I would buy her a drink, just like I do when I watch a good film. I knew she liked the film, but I just wanted her to enjoy herself. The next day I went out and bought her a few beers and we went to a restaurant for dinner. We had a great time, she was great, she didn't even mind that I was watching the movie, she just wanted to watch me! I got a few drinks and she went out to the dance floor and we had a couple of great dances. She took her time getting to know me and was really friendly with me. After the dancing was done, we went back to the table and she got me to sign a few pictures for her. She didn't ask me for any money, she only asked me to do it. She asked me if I was single and if I had any friends, and if not, she wanted me to introduce her to a couple that she knew, she said she knew they were nice guys. We talked for a while about life and I showed her pictures of me and how I looked, and how handsome I was. She loved looking at them, but didn't seem to care about me that much,
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie is great and the characters are great. You can't beat that for a horror movie. The only reason I don't give it a five star is because it feels like a movie made for the big screen. It would be great if this were made on the big screens. But the actors work great in the small screen.  Review by Mark H. . -  The film is an unusual mixture of psychological thriller and slasher movie. You get the feeling that the film is a psychological thriller, but with elements of slasher horror. There are some things in the film that are not completely understandable, but the film has a great tension. It is also a great action film, with many memorable sequences. The film also has a very strange and intriguing atmosphere. There is a sense of menace that runs throughout the film. This atmosphere is heightened by the acting in the cast. It's very hard to put your finger on exactly what is wrong with the film, but it has an eerie, ominous feeling. There were a few scenes in the movie that really got me, especially one involving a girl, that really caught my attention. The plot itself is a bit difficult to follow, but I still felt it was very interesting. The characters in the story are very well developed. The story starts off with a girl being held hostage at an abandoned house, but then it moves into a house with a very strong and very creepy vibe. There was a lot of mystery surrounding the house, and the girl was taken there for a very, very good reason. The house itself has a dark, mysterious aura about it. It was really creepy to look at and I'm sure that there was a reason for it. There seems to be some connection to the house that is never explained, but you still feel that it has something to do with the girl. This is where the movie gets really creepy and disturbing. There's some very weird stuff in the background that I just could not understand. The movie was a bit disturbing and I never understood what was happening. It does a good job of using all the elements in the production and really pulls it off. There have been a lot more movies like this made, but this one stands out because of the very strong performances. There isn't much that is shocking or disturbing about the movie, but its good and well done. I really liked the movie. It has some of the most disturbing and disturbing scenes that I have seen in
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Apr 18, 2017 4:04 PM  How To Train Your Dragon 2    Loading... About This Movie The original movie, How To Ride A Dragon, was an interesting action adventure that I enjoyed quite a bit. I was also very excited for the sequel and thought it would be great to see it with some of the new cast. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I can only think that it was a bit rushed, especially the story, and the characters were not as developed as I thought they would be. The characters are all very good, but not nearly as good as they could have been. I think that the characters should have had more screen time and I think the story could have taken a bit longer. I thought that the movie was mostly about the character of Hiccup. I liked how he had to grow up fast and how he needed to figure out how to be a leader. Unfortunately for him, he didn't realize how much he would need to be strong for the team. I like the idea of the team, but the characters just didn't develop as much as I hoped they would. The acting in this movie was good, and I thought the writing was very good. I will still recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good action adventure movie.  No comments yet.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  "I would like to express how much I enjoyed this film. I have seen a few movies of this genre and have always felt the actors were good but this is the first time I have felt like I could see the story. The story is told from the viewpoint of an orphan who was taken in by a young couple who were just trying to survive in this rough world. The movie does a great job of showing what life is like in a war torn country, and even with that, it does not get boring. The performances are all very good and the acting is good. This film is great to watch if you are in the mood for something a bit different. It is very much a war movie, and is more so for the audience than the soldiers. The music in this movie is amazing. The action scenes are very good, and the editing is very good. The cinematography in this film is excellent, and gives a very gritty feel to the movie. This movie is not perfect, but it is definitely worth a watch. I would like it to be a bit more well known in the states, but I know there is a great movie waiting to be made here."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ This is a very good movie, but I have to say that I was expecting a very different story from the one that was shown on screen. I thought that a movie about a girl trying to find her father would have been very different. I felt like I was watching a very personal story. The story of how she found out her father is a pedophile was very well done. I am not sure how she managed to find him, but the way that she did was very creative. It is a shame that it wasn't longer. The ending was a little rushed, but at the same time it was very interesting. This movie will definitely make you think about things. The cast is really good. All of them give their best performances, and I thought they all did a great job. I have seen a lot of movies in my time and I don't think I have ever seen a cast as good as the ones in this movie. The only thing that annoyed me a little was that there was a part that I didn't like. I think that it would have made it a better movie if it was edited out. There were some scenes in this film that I felt were too long and it felt like they were dragging on. If you liked this movie, then I would suggest you give it a try. It might be one of your favorites.

I would have liked more if it wasn't so long and didn't end in a very confusing and strange way.) "He's a bad man who has done a bad thing, but he's going to do it again." Well, if that is what they want to hear, they may have a case. But they don't get it. The movie doesn't give you any time to think. It just says, "This is a bad person who has to do a bad deed. We want him to do this more and more." And it works. That's why I say this is a very good movie. I can't say it is a great one because it is only about one person, but it is still very good. And it has a good ending. I loved it, and it is not a bad movie.

Â Â The ending was a little bit cheesy, but it made it all worth it.   One thing that was a bit of a problem is the fact that they filmed this in 1981, so you had a lot of people dressed like teenagers.  I don't know what that means, but I like to see the characters dressed differently now.  Also, the music was very cheesy.  8.5/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "The Great Escape" (1941) is the best film I have ever seen and will never forget. The only thing that I can say is that there is something wrong with this picture. I mean, the camerawork is terrible and it is very hard to see everything in a short period of time. But it is not as if it is a very long film. The acting is great and the music is good. I would have liked a bit more dialogue but the film is just so good. And the last part, the most interesting part, is not in the film at all. It is an incredible story told by an incredible actor and a brilliant director. The ending is so incredible that it leaves you feeling very satisfied and even surprised. And this is a film that was made in a very short time. In my opinion it is the finest film of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** "THE MUTANT WOMAN" ********* I've been looking for a good Muppet movie since "The Muppet Movie" came out in 1985. When I saw the trailer for this movie I was pretty excited to see a Muppet with a human face. "THE MONSTER from HELL" (1991) was the first Muppet film in which a Muppeteer was not in the lead. I was a big fan of "Muppets Tonight" in which the Muppets were the main characters. I think it was really a MUPPET SHORT and a great movie. It has a great cast and great special effects. "The Monster from Hell" is a great story that has a twist at the end. I would like to see this movie in the theatre on a regular basis. It's a lot of fun and well acted. I also like that the Muppet characters are a lot more human than they were in the previous films. The movie has some great effects and special effects, and the Munchkins are great. I'm not a huge fan of the movie. I didn't like the ending. I wanted a lot less Muppety stuff, but it's a great Muppet short. If you haven't seen it I recommend it. I'll probably see it a few more times on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Rock" is a solid, entertaining movie. The story is solid, the acting is good, and the action is awesome. The only bad part about the movie is that there is no opening credits, and it takes place in the early 80's. So in a way, it feels like a throwback to the old west. This movie does a very good job at making the setting seem real and it even has a real sense of place. I really enjoyed this movie.  It was definitely one of the better action movies of the 80's, and I can't wait to see the sequel!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "Star Wars: A New Hope" (1977)  George Lucas, writer and director of this film, made his first attempt at a new Star Wars movie, after Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Chance (1977), the first movie of this new trilogy. The story begins with the Empire on the verge of losing the Battle of Endor (the Battle of Yavin), a crucial victory for the Galactic Empire. In an attempt to make a final stand at the moon of Endoria, the Imperial forces send the Death Star into orbit. This is a devastating blow to the Empire, which will eventually lead to the destruction of the entire Empire.  The battle between the Rebels and the Empire will be seen as the first battle of the Clone Wars, which would later evolve into the Galactic Civil War. ...  When it comes to the movie, "Star Wars" is the epitome of a classic adventure. The plot, set in a universe that many would love to explore, is captivating, thrilling, and at times very touching. It is also a film that will make you believe that this could have been a real movie. - Starlog Magazine
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I have been in the theatre since it first opened and I have seen every one of the movies that have been made in it. My favorite is the movie about the dog named Bessie. When I was a child my mom used to take me to the theatre when I was sick. The dog had a great part in it, she was funny and she really got in the way of my friends and me when we wanted to get out. When the movie ended I would run into her yard and I would try to kiss her but she would turn around and bite me. She was a good dog. My friends and I all liked the dog, she didn't have to be scared, but she needed to be looked after. When they made the movie I wanted to be the dog in it because she was so nice and funny. That is why I was so sad when I saw this movie. I am not one to give up movies even if I know it will be bad, but I will not watch it again. I would give it one star but it is so hard to give a negative rating to a movie like this.

I think it is one the best movies ever. It is very realistic. I have seen some other movies, and they are all about the same. This movie is not about the hero, but the heroine, who is a little girl. This little girl is just a child. She wants to be like the hero and to live like him. She is a strong willed little girl, but she has a very soft heart. She has a secret love for the man in the film. The movie starts off with the hero going to sleep, and then he is waking up. The heroine is with him, and she is giving him love. She tries to make him feel that he is a great person. The little girl tries to give him a kiss, but he turns her down, and says that she is not good enough for him. This causes a big fight between the two. The girl is crying, but doesn't know why. She gets in her father's car and leaves the house. The hero goes home and sees that she has left. Then he sees that the little girl has run away. The man goes out and searches for her. He finds her hiding in a field. He calls the police and tells them that she went away. He then goes to the movie theater, where she was going

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  There's something in the air...   There is something in life that needs to be fought for...   for the future... for our families... for all of humanity...   a lot of people have a lot to offer...   the world needs more love...   (1:11)   (1:10)   the music just feels so right...  .   The scene at the beginning of the film was so haunting. The first two minutes just went on and on with the music and the shadows, and I was really scared. I can't believe that they didn't use the scene at a hospital. I was actually terrified that I might have a heart attack while watching this film. And it just makes me sad to think that I wasn't able to see it in a theater with an audience, but rather in a tiny movie theater in an isolated little town where no one was around. I'm not going to make a judgement on the movie, but if I had to pick a favorite scene I think it would have to be at the end.  , the music, the editing, the acting, the direction, the cinematography and the score all add up to make one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's a true story about a young boy who is being abused and abandoned by his mother. I have a special place in my heart for the mother, because I think she had to fight so hard to raise a healthy, happy child and she did it. It took a lot for her to be a mother and this was a lot harder for her. The rest of the world may not have been ready to adopt a boy, but she did and she made the best of it. I think that the film is an honest portrayal of the pain and abuse that a mother can suffer and still raise a happy child. I also loved how the movie was shot. I thought the editing was excellent and how the film didn't go on for too long, but still had a great ending. I don't think that it was a great film for kids, but for adults, it was just an incredible film that you need to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. It's the kind of movie that has a certain charm, and the cast is really good, but it just isn't that great. It doesn't really seem like a movie that you can watch once and have fun, it's more of a movie you can just sit back and relax to, which is fine, but for some people, that's not the best way to see a movie. It just isn`t that interesting. It`s a movie about a guy who gets his penis chopped off and it`s not really that funny. I don`t get why the movie was made, and I think if they made a different movie, it would have been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I have to admit that this movie is great. It is not only the first of a trilogy, but it is also the first movie in a series of the same name, about the three men who were supposed to be on a mission to rescue the President of the United States from the clutches of a murderous, deranged man. They were never supposed to survive this ordeal and are now trying to get back to the States in time to save him. But the bad guys always seem to have a way to get them back. When they finally reach their ship and land, there is a fire in the cockpit, the pilot has died and the men have lost the chance to save their President. The only man alive is a wounded Japanese soldier, who has had his mind and body broken. In the end the soldiers realize that the enemy is only a shadow, a person that is trying to take over their minds. The Japanese soldier tells the men that they are on the wrong side of history and must fight to save the world. The men agree and fight for the fate of humanity. The movie is quite good. The story is quite well told and it has a lot of twists and turns. It was very good, and in a way the movie reminded me of the movie The Matrix (which I am in the middle of watching). I have only seen the movie once and I must say that I liked it a lot. It has a great story, great action and an interesting setting. It takes place in the 20th century and the story is about a time when humans have been divided into two different races, humans and robots. The two races can not live together. There are many wars and a lot has happened in the world, but the story has a happy ending. The robots have been able to learn to understand human speech and are able to communicate with each other. But a lot still remains unknown about them and this makes the movie very interesting. The film is not really scary, but when you think about it, it could have been scary. The characters are very well done and the plot is very good. But there is still a lot more that can be done. The ending is a little too abrupt and I think it could be better, but I was really happy that it ended so well. The main characters were very well portrayed and I am very happy that I was able to enjoy this movie. I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it to all who want to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  "Boomerang" is an interesting little film. I'd say that it is a sort of prequel to the movie "The Goonies", which is set in the same town. The film begins with a little girl named Alice (the daughter of a local fisherman) who is running away from her father and uncle. After getting lost in the woods, Alice stumbles upon a strange man who is wearing a big red hat and carrying a boomerang. He asks Alice if she has seen his daughter. Alice answers "yes" and the stranger says he is "Boomerang the boomeranger". He gives Alice a "goose feather" which is a very expensive necklace. He also says he has seen a girl in the river with a similar hat. Alice wants to go back to the house, but Boomerang has one thing to say. Alice is going to marry Boomeranger. I am not sure if this was an actual event in history, or if it was just a legend that was passed down through the generations. The plot of the movie is that Alice and Boomerange have to find out where their children are hidden, but they end up discovering that Boomerangler has married a woman named Mrs. Brown, who is also a witch. The two girls are captured by Mrs.Brown, but Alice and the boarang manage to escape. The boarange is captured and Alice ends up going to Boomerango to find a way to free him. The only way Alice can do that is by having Boomerangs "googles" the boomeraang, which is the real boomerange. Unfortunately, BoomerANG doesn't know how to do that. The girls and Boomers "Googles", and Alice has to make Boomeranged's "googly eyes" glow to reveal where he is. This leads them to the village where they are reunited with their families. Alice then decides to become a "magician". The ending is a bit of a mess, as we end up with Alice and her family traveling across the country in search of her children. It is a good little film, but it is too bad that it does not have a sequel. If there was one, I would have liked to see a sequel in the future. Overall, a good film that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned Disney film.  Helpful is the fact that the movie was a
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I was watching the movie about a kid that has to take a job as a mechanic in a car repair shop. I have always wanted to see a movie like this because I always like the mechanics. The movie itself is good, but the movie takes a wrong turn in the middle. There is a scene where the girl, Anna, is going to have sex with the mechanic. Anna, who was very beautiful, had to put on a very old and thin man's suit. She was going to be having sex with him and she had no idea that this man, that she was going with, was an old man. When the girl had to take off her suit, she had a weird sensation and her vagina began to open. It didn't take long for her to get herself a big erection. I was really curious to see how she would feel if she was having sex again with an old and fat man. I guess that's what happened in the movie. The guy then has sex with Anna. The old and old-fat man is actually a real person, named Mr. Z, who has been living in a house for a long time. Anna has a nice, hot and sensual sex with Mr.Z and the scene ends. The girl has no idea about the fact that Mr.S is an old-Fat man and they continue to have sexual intercourse. ______________
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Mar 15, 2017 7:03 AM by kkent   I was very excited to see this movie because of its star, Matthew McConaughey. It was a good film, and a very interesting one. I'm a big fan of the film, but I have a few things to nitpick. The plot is very simple, and not really original. The movie starts with a bunch of high schoolers on a field trip, and it's up to them to solve a murder. The whole thing feels very predictable, and nothing special. It takes a few scenes to get going, and the whole thing seems like a cheap "fun" movie, with the whole murder mystery theme.  What really made this film interesting, was the use of photography. It really made the film stand out, and helped give it some substance. It's hard to explain what this film is about, but it's a very strong one. It shows how the use and manipulation of light can tell a story very well. It also shows that there are many different ways to use photography. The use of lighting in the film was very interesting. . The film was really interesting. It has a strong plot, and really interesting photography. There was nothing bad about this film, so it wasn't a bad movie. The only thing that I didn't really like about the film is the ending. It felt rushed, and I'm not sure why they ended it that way.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** The Great Beauty, a story of the French Revolution, and the beauty of the young women who made it, and of the revolution itself, and is the most powerful movie ever made. I had never heard of this film until I had a long discussion about it with my husband. It is based on a novel of the same name by Michel de Montaigne, and it was first released in 1924. The film was so popular that it was banned in the United States for the next forty years. When it was released in the U.S. again, the censors changed the ending to be less sentimental. It was never made again, but it is still available on video. It has been described as a romantic comedy, a tragedy, a comedy, and a horror story. The movie is set in a Paris where the revolutionaries are taking over the city. The beautiful young women, who were the real heroes of the Revolution, have been taken away by the police. The revolutionary leader, Angelique, has taken them as his own, and he is going to marry them. The police have a plan to kill them. Their first victim is the mother of one of the revolutionaries. They have the other revolutionary killed in a bomb. They then go after the young revolutionaries, who have fled to a house and have hidden a bomb in a wine cellar. They are hiding the bomb and they are waiting for the police to arrive. The first thing that happens is that the police shoot and kill the mother, and then one of their own tries to kill the young revolutionary. The rest of the movie is based around the action of the bombs, which have gone off and the subsequent police search for the bombers. The action is so well filmed and so realistic that it is hard to believe that the people on the set were real. This movie is a classic, and you cannot watch it without having an emotional reaction. It really is an amazing film, and one of my favorites.

When I saw the trailer, I thought that it looked like a version of 'The Grapes of Wrath'. However, I found that it was different. It was a good film because it showed us the life of the people in the 'Bunkerville'. I also thought that they made a good version of the book, although there were a few changes in the book. I had not seen the original book before I saw this movie and I thought it was good. I think that this film would make a good series for those who have not seen this book.  _____________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________  "It was a strange movie, because it had so many elements, and it was really hard to figure out what was going on. I really wanted to like this movie, but it just seemed so much like a bunch of different movies that were all connected, and they were all trying to tell the same story. I think the most surprising thing was that all of these different movies were set in the same city, and all of them were basically telling the same kind of story, but none of them seemed to fit. I feel like the way this movie was shot, the cinematography was all very similar, but all of the other shots were all very different. The music was all different, but they were using all of this music that they thought was interesting and unique. I felt like the movie was trying to be so many different things at once, but there was nothing there. I thought that the actors were very good, and I really enjoyed the acting. The story itself was really well done. It was a very, very good movie, and there were a lot of different themes. I liked it, but I couldn't get into it."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Reviewed By: _______________________ I saw this movie last night at the local multiplex, and I have to admit that it is pretty good. It's a thriller, and there is a lot of suspense, but the suspense isn't so much suspense as it is a kind of suspense-suspense. The movie doesn't really take off until about the midpoint. I don't know if it's the plot or the acting or the screenplay, but I couldn't help but feel the suspense come alive throughout. The suspense is a real factor in this movie. This movie is about a group of friends who get pulled into a situation that is so bad that you can't help feeling sorry for them. They are in a big city, and they are getting to know each other in the midst of a situation they don't understand. The tension builds and builds, but there's no payoff. It all ends very abruptly.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ "The Last Boy Scout" (2006) has a pretty good plot: a young boy becomes a scout and is raised as a boy scout by a tough-talking father who lives in a log cabin in the woods. He learns to be a strong, tough-willed boy scout and eventually leads his own troop of boys. However, the movie has a ton of problems that I don't see anyone ever discussing. It's so predictable that you could have seen this movie a thousand times. I think this movie was made by a man who knew nothing about real-life Boy Scouts, and was trying to make a big "action" movie. It is based on a novel, but the movie uses the book as a platform for a huge amount of pointless dialogue and action. This movie tries to portray a realistic boy scout, who has to grow up and take on a real adult role. However: this is not a realistic role. A real boy scout is taught by his older brothers to be strong, to protect and help his family, and to never let a stranger in. The film tries to make this boy scout into a guy who doesn't know how to be an adult, who is always running away from the real world and getting in trouble. It also tries to show him as a man whose only goal in life is to get rich. I don' t think that this movie has any relevance for real Boy Scouts. I also don't think that a real Boy Scout has a goal of getting rich. A Boy Scout is a boy who knows how to take care of his family and be a good person. In order to get a real scouting job, you need to go through a very specific series of tests and requirements. The test that this boy was supposed to take would make him a real scout, but it would also make him an adult. It doesn't make sense to me to show a guy as a kid who doesn' t know how much his dad cares about him and still make him try to be his own man. And that's what the movie tries do with this guy. He is constantly running away, always trying to prove himself, and always running to be famous. This is one of those movies that just gets in your way. It shows how little the movie was thought out. It gives you an idea of what it would be like to grow old as a real boy. This kind of movie only works if you already know what it is about. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If I could rate this movie in the 'totally worth the time' category I would. It is a decent movie, but not an amazing one. It has some good action scenes, and it has some heart-wrenching scenes. The plot is pretty much the same as the first movie, with the main difference being that this movie takes place at a time when people are starting to accept the fact that we can be happy. The world has become more beautiful and the world is filled with kindness. There are many people who don't agree with this, but most people agree with it, and they are called "Nihilists". This is a movie that has a lot of hope. It reminds me a lot with the first 'Lone Survivor' and the ending reminds me of that as well. The only negative thing that I would say about the movie is that it has a rather long running time. It took me about 4 1/2 hours to watch the movie, which is quite long for a movie of this nature. However, that is what the movie needs, and I enjoyed it for that. It's a movie you can watch and watch over and over again, and you will see some things that you might not notice every time you watch it, but you will still be entertained.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ __________ ______________ _________  There is no way I could watch this movie for long and not get sucked into its vortex of horror, but I am so glad I watched it, even though I knew it was a bad movie. This is one of those movies that you'll go to see with the intent to hate it, but you won't. This movie is a horror movie, but not in a cheesy way. The way it was directed and filmed is the way horror movies should be done. You know, with lots of cheap jump scares and cheesy music and acting. But it doesn't take long to figure out that something is very wrong with this movie. The plot is a mess, and it's not because of the acting, but because of how the characters are written. They are all so flat, and they're all the same. We have the crazy rich guy, we have the smarty pants girl who is also a rich girl, we even have a girl who can turn into a shark (I'm not kidding). I don't think I need to mention that this movie is written by one of the greatest horror writers of all time, Stephen King. I would love to see King write a movie about a shark, but this one is about an old woman who is obsessed with her dog, and who keeps running into strange things. It is so much more interesting and interesting that way, and not at all like a shark movie.   I was in high school when I saw this movie, and I was like "I can't believe you're talking about this movie like it's a good thing!" And it's like this movie has always been with me. I still go to sleep with nightmares about it. It's scary, but it's also sad. And I think that's what keeps it alive, is that it's such a well done movie, that it can scare us in ways that no other horror movie can. It never tries to be scary, it just is. It takes a while to realize that it is a good horror movie. It might not be a good classic, but that doesn't matter. It should still be on every horror fan's radar. I recommend it to horror fans and movie lovers, and that's all I can ask for.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- If you enjoyed this movie and want to give a little bit of feedback, go ahead. It's better than a movie about a dead person (if you can call a movie like that a movie) It's very well done. You don't need to read the books, but if you want to you can. But it is not a good thing to waste your time with that. --------------- It's a good film, but it is a different movie. It is a movie that I think has some potential. But the director has a big problem. He is not able to find the right tone. He can make a film about a zombie movie but he can't make it feel like a zombie film. And it doesn't. So the movie has some good moments but it doesn the right things. -------------- I'm giving it a 5 out of 5 --------------- I enjoyed this film a lot. It was interesting and the idea of a zombie in a movie was interesting. It could be a good idea but it could have been done better. I think it could be the start of something good. I would like to see a zombie flick like this in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My wife and I have been married for 12 years, and have been through more than a few divorces. This is our first real "big" divorce, and our first time trying to make a home for ourselves after so many years of trying to fit in and making it work.   When I heard about this movie, I figured it would be a typical love story. A man who gets divorced finds out he has a daughter, and decides to marry her. The wife gets remarried, and we move on.     But the movie did not disappoint. It was well acted and acted very well. The music was great. The cinematography was excellent. And the screenplay was perfect.   in a way, the story of the movie was like a movie script, and I loved the way the movie told the story. This movie had a lot of heart, and there was a lot to love.   the movie had so many great moments. I loved how the movie went from "Oh no!" to "My God, I'm in love with her" in a matter of minutes. And I loved when they took us back to the wedding day. The way the wife, who had not been there for the whole wedding day, and was shocked by the marriage, and the way she started to fall in love again.   (This movie is a "love story" only in the sense that there was romance, but the love story was not about the marriage.)   The movie had some very touching moments. When the husband was sitting in the bar with his daughter, watching the "happening" on TV. The husband was so upset, he didn't want to leave his daughter with his mother. And when the husband got home and saw his daughter and her new husband kissing, he was so happy and so proud of his daughter.   to me, the movie is about the real life of this couple. And they were so in love that the movie really showed their love. There were a lot more scenes of the wedding night that was just amazing.   and for the movie, they really showed how the two of them lived the life together, and how they loved each other so much.   of course, the only thing I wish this movie had is more action. I wish they had shown more of the divorce and the new life they were creating.  - December 26, 2008One of my favorite movies of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why did I like this movie: This movie has all the hallmarks of a great movie. It's funny, it's fast paced, it has some heart, it is a solid character study and it has a great ending. The plot was interesting and I liked the characters. The actors are all good. This is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. What could have been a mediocre movie became a great one. I think you should check this out! What could be improved: I think there are a few things in this movie that could be better. First, the movie is a little on the slow side. This movie is not for the fainthearted. Second, the ending could have just been a little bit better. The movie just goes out on a cliffhanger at the end. I would have liked to see a bit more of the characters before the movie ended. This film is a must see. I recommend it!  Rating: 4 out of 5  Review: It was hard to decide what to do with this movie, but I chose to watch it, and I thought it was a good decision. I have a few complaints about it. I'd like to see the movie longer. I also think the movie could have ended a little better. If it had just been another movie, I would've loved it. It was really interesting to see how all the characters' lives changed, and their lives changed the lives of the others in the movie. I like the fact that they show all the people's reactions to their own changes. I liked how it had some great characters and I didn't find them boring. I really enjoyed this film.

Everyone loved this movie and loved how the characters were written. Great comedy with a good story.  Reviewed by Mike R. from This movie is funny. I'm a big fan of the movies of the 80's. They had a lot of good laughs in them. This movie has all the right elements to be entertaining. The music is good. It had a great cast. , from The 80's, is a film about a little boy who thinks he's a girl. That's right! It's not a joke, it's not made up, it is the truth! The boy was born with a penis and, because of that, he thinks he is a girl, and that makes him miserable. As the movie goes on, we learn that his parents and teachers are just as unhappy with him as he is with himself. I was laughing out loud at times. It really made me laugh. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.

But that scene is a highlight of the film for me, because it brings out the most raw, honest and authentic emotions from one of the characters. The rest of the movie is a fascinating, complex and fascinating piece of filmmaking. It doesn't take a great deal of time to get into the film, but the experience is worth the effort." - Todd Solondz, (director of Blue Valentine, The Big Chill, The Last Picture Show)   "The most impressive film in my collection and one that I've always wanted to see. I never got to see this film, until it came on a very rare VHS and I was able to see it for the first time. I have been waiting for this movie for so long and now it's finally here." - Andrew Lippa, (writer of A Separation, The Departed, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, A Beautiful Mind, The Social Network)   the first film from the legendary director John Landis  The movie opens on a night in a motel in Texas, and the room is filled with a lot of men, and one woman. The man is played by John Travolta, the man in the room by the brilliant and sexy actress Sharon Stone. She is playing the wife of a convicted drug dealer. As a matter of fact, she is a convicted dealer. She has spent the past 15 years in jail, where she is now serving a sentence for drug trafficking. As she is talking to a policeman in the motel room, the room starts to fill with people, and her husband comes into the room, and a fight starts.  Stone is in the middle of it all, she wants to fight, but she is restrained by the policeman. The movie doesn't show this, but it seems she is not really happy about it, because her eyes are getting red and she is sweating a lot.  (more…)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Man  is a classic film about the art of making a movie.  And it's a masterpiece.  The film is the true story of one of Hollywood's biggest stars, Harry Hopkins, and the director of "The Best Years of Our Lives," William Wyler.  Hopkins is a man with a big heart and a big imagination.  He's also a bit of a man who has trouble taking direction.  The story is about the creation of a movie called "The Love Boat" which Hopkins wrote and directed.  At the time, Hopkins was the most successful male director in Hollywood.  "The Loving Vincent" is one of Hopkins' best films and the film is about two people, one gay and one straight, who find that they're meant for each other.   The film is a story of love and acceptance and it is the best romantic comedy of the 1950's.  It's not a film that has a happy ending but there are some pretty amazing scenes in the movie.    The Best Year of Our Life (1953) is another classic.    The story of two brothers, Jack and Billy (Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable), who are both members of the American Film Institute and who try to make a film about their trip to Mexico.  In "The Color of Money" (1954), the brothers take a trip to the Middle East in order to make an anti-Semitic film.  Their film is called "Dances with Wolves."  They're all very colorful and have a lot of funny scenes.  A lot of the actors from "The Maltese Falcon" are in this movie as well.  There are some really great characters in this film.     The best character in the film, however, is the character of Jack, played by Bogart.  This film is one the best of the '50's.   The Maltese "Swan Song" (1950) is one great film about a plane crash.  These are two great films that all have the same basic plot.  And "The Last Laugh" (1945) is a great movie about a man's struggle with alcoholism.  They all have great endings.   "The Big Sleep" (1960)  (based on Stephen King's book) is about a young woman who's married and she decides to spend a night in a motel.  After being attacked by a serial
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ "I am a sucker for the good guy who never stops believing he is the hero, who never gives up, who refuses to be defeated. I think we all are. But I am a realist and I know that, at some point, our hero has to stop believing he can do the impossible. He's just not going to. Not with the resources at his disposal, not with the money, not even with his own friends. That's why I found this movie so fascinating: The movie was shot on location in and around Detroit. It was shot over a three-year period. There was a lot of hard work done to get it done. You can feel the love that went into the project. It's a wonderful story about a young boy who has a secret. It is a very emotional movie." - John Travolta. _________________________________________ THE MULTITUDE OF THE MOVIE: "This is a wonderful movie that takes you through the entire life of a young man, from his first days to his final days. This is a movie that is both realistic and surreal." - Roger Ebert ______________________________________________________________ "When you think of The Magnificent Seven, it may sound like a Western, but this is the true story of a band of outlaws who banded together and took on the entire police force in a race to find the seven richest men in the West. When the leader of the group, the "Big Seven," was shot, the rest of the men abandoned him and fled. They were pursued by the police. Their pursuers killed the men one by one. And in the end, they killed all seven. The story is told in flashbacks as each man tells the story of what happened in his life. They are told by a man, who is no longer a man. This movie is not like any other movie you have ever seen. It takes you on a journey to a whole new world. It will keep you on your toes, you will be in suspense and it will have you thinking. It may not be for everyone, but it will be a great experience." - Chris Smith _________________________________ THE LESSON TO LEARN FROM THE MOVIES: "The Magnificent 7 was the most spectacular movie I ever saw. The movie's plot was brilliant. The action scenes were excellent. The acting was superb. I was in the theater when the credits were rolling. There were so many great images

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back" was a good sequel to "Star Wars" but the characters were so similar to the originals.  I thought that it would be interesting to see if a Star Wars sequel could be as good as "The Empire StrikesBack" but this movie is just a ripoff of the first movie.    This movie would have been a lot better if the cast was different.  I was really glad when the first "Star Trek" movie was made and the new cast had great chemistry with the old cast.  This time around, it was the same story and characters but the new actors did not have chemistry with each other.  The only good thing was that the music was better in this movie and I am glad that it was made.  When "Star" was on TV and in the movies, the music had to be really good to be heard and this movie did not use the best sound quality.  There are a lot of scenes in this film that do not make sense and some scenes seem to be shot at the wrong time.  George Lucas is not the greatest filmmaker but this film has a lot more going on than just a Star Trek sequel.  Star Wars: Episde V:  "The Force Awakens"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Man Holiday  is a comedy and a drama. The comedy is really just a comedy.  It's really a silly film. It's got a little bit of a silly romance at the beginning.    But the story really takes off after the movie's over.    The drama is that a couple of people (one is a cop and one is a soldier) are on vacation and they go to an old cabin.  The two people there are very unhappy and the soldier wants to get out of there.  They end up having a very funny night and the next day they go back to the cabin and have a wonderful time together.  When they leave the cabin, they don't know that they have been found and are in a very uncomfortable situation.  I don't think this is a really good film, but it's very funny.  This is a fun movie and it's a funny film.  The Best Men Holiday is a great comedy. The film is about a couple who goes to an inn.  One of the men goes into the bar, they drink a little too much and they get in a fight.  Then they run away from the bar.  But they are found a couple hours later and the two of them are in an uncomfortable situation where they have to deal with the man who found them.  What is great about this film is that it really is just a fun, silly, funny film with a little romance at its center.  If you want a good comedy, this is your movie.  It's not going to be a deep film, or a very deep film. This is just an enjoyable comedy that I think any comedy fan would enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ A friend of mine who is a huge fan of this movie and also a HUGE fan of Bucky Barnes (a character in this movie I love), was very nice to me when I told him that I had seen this movie. He told me it was really good, and told me to tell my friends. And, I can tell you that I was happy to tell all of my friends about this great movie! This movie is one of my favorite superhero movies ever, and one of the best superhero movies of all time. And you really need to see this movie to understand why it is so great. This movie was made in 1941, when Bucky is an average soldier who happens to be a brilliant sniper. He has been called back to the U.S. because he can't take anymore of his job. This means that he must go into the war as an expert sniper. His only problem is that he is the only sniper left who is able to kill Nazis and Japanese soldiers. And this makes him a great target for the Nazis and the Japanese, as they are trying to kill all the snipers. So, he must use his sniper skills to try to survive. This makes him more of a target than most other heroes because of his unique skills. The best thing about this movie is that it takes the best aspects of both the comic books and the movie, and combines them to make one great movie. This film is not only about a great sniper, but about the great man who gave him his skills and his talent. There are many comic books out there about the same time period that were much better than this movie, but this movie has a great cast and a great script that make this movie a great movie in itself. I would definitely recommend this movie if you have a love of this superhero and a love for WWII. _________________________________________________ I would like to add that there are many great reviews on this movie on this site. Here are a few of them: "One of the most original superhero movies in years. I'm glad I went to see it." (Dee, USA) "Wonderfully done, well told, and filled with suspense." (Gerry, USA, from the DVD) "Buck gets to show off his talents and his personality as the story progresses. The action scenes are great." (Mike, USA), "It's all here. You can't get more than 15 minutes of action without seeing a gun or a bomb going
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining, a movie about a girl who is trapped in a hotel in the middle of the night.  She is the only survivor, and her mother is a nurse who takes care of her, but it's not until she's taken to the hotel that she meets the man she loves.  What I thought was a short film turned into a short book, which I found amazing.  I read it for a class in high school and my teacher asked if I wanted to do it.    It's the story of a little girl who gets lost in a creepy hotel, and is saved by a man who calls himself "The Shining" who's the only one who knows where she is.    He is an old man who claims to be from the past, and he takes her to the top of the hotel.  He tells her that he has a secret to share, and that she will need to go through the maze of rooms.  The movie follows her through the entire hotel, with great camerawork and lighting.  A good story about an amazing character.   I highly recommend The Shining to anyone who likes horror films.  It's got great story, and even better cinematography.

And I did, and it's pretty good, if not a bit long, and in the end I was still disappointed that the main character never really has a chance. (Although it's nice that she has some other friends.) There are a lot of great things about the movie. It's very funny, the script is very well done, the acting is very good and the direction is also very good. However, the movie doesn't really seem to have a real purpose to it. The story is pretty good but the ending seems to be forced and just kind of there. This movie could have been really good if it had just had a chance to end and ended with something interesting. I didn't really enjoy it and it was kind of a let down.

But I did enjoy it, and it made me happy to see that there are some movies that I can watch that have something in them that make them better than the average movie.  A very unique movie with some very cool scenes and a good storyline. Great soundtrack too!  I have seen the movie several times and it has always been a great film. I've always been impressed with the plot, the acting, the camera work and the music. There are no cheesy scenes and I always think that they have something that they can use in future movies. I can't imagine what they did next but I am glad that they came out with this movie and made a great one out of it.  for the film itself, there are no "cool" moments and it's not a movie for kids. But it's still a good watch. The music is very cool too and I can see why they chose that soundtrack. . I like the movie and I'm glad they did it. I just hope that they don't use the same music in other movies.    The movie was made in the early 80s and is based on a true story. It tells about a group of boys who have to deal with bullies. This movie is definitely something different and I recommend you give it a try if you are interested in this kind of movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I saw this movie in a theater and the whole movie was very interesting. It was a little difficult to see, but not a problem. I liked the movie. It made me think about my life and what makes us happy. The story was interesting. The cast was really nice. I will watch it again. This movie made me want to know more about my dad and why he left me. This is a good film to watch and if you want to watch something good then this is the one. The movie is worth a watch. Thanks. *****  Rated 4 out of 5 by Aimee from Great movie to watch with my family. I have seen a lot of movies in my life, and this was the first time I have ever seen this movie. I really like this movie, as I felt it was the most realistic movie about the human experience. It's interesting to watch a father trying to make sure his son has the best life possible. It really helped me understand what it is to have a father who is a "bad guy". The story itself is very simple and easy to understand. There is no over dramatizing or being too dramatic in the movie, and there are no special effects. I think the movie is good to watch, and if a father ever needs a good laugh, this movie is a great one. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has children, as it will give you some good laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The Great Escape (1972) This film is a masterpiece of cinema. It is based on a true story of two American prisoners of war who were released from North Korea and were captured by the North Koreans. They were forced to build an escape tunnel from the South to the North, which they completed in under a year. The North Korean army, having discovered the tunnel, captured the two American soldiers, beat them and forced them to dig a second tunnel from North to South. The two Americans were forced into this second tunnel and eventually escaped. This film was not released in the U.S. until 1972. I was only about 13 at the time and the movie was just about too good to be true. ______________ I love this movie and have seen it many times. The characters are very good and I always like them. ______________________________________ The Great and Powerful Oz (1939) This movie is one of the best and one of my favorite movies ever. I think it was the first movie where I got to see the world of Oz and how the people of that land lived. I have always been a fan of that world and it is always fun to see it portrayed in a film. ______________________ The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) This is one the greats. It was one of Stanley Kubrick's most famous movies. It has an interesting plot that includes a scientist who thinks he is on the verge of a breakthrough in time travel. This is a film of the 50's and has some very unique set pieces. ______________________________ The Maltese Falcon (1941) This classic is one I have seen many times, and I still love it. It deals with two thieves who are trying to get to the top of a building. The movie has a very suspenseful plot, as well as a lot of fun to watch. _________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ A story about a little boy who has a lot of friends and a father who wants to be a superhero. The father is not a superhero, he is just a man who wants more for his son and wants to give him some advice and teach him what a good guy should be. The son is not an average kid, he has an excellent mind and a great intellect. This is a very good movie and I think it's one of those movies that you can't really judge because it has so many different things in it. It was very well done, it had a good amount of action, the cinematography was pretty good, and it had good dialogue. I think this movie has everything to do with the father and his son. The best part about this movie was the father. I mean, he had a big heart, he was really trying to help his son be a good man, and he had no problem giving him advice on how to be good, or helping him with his problems. If I had to give the movie a negative it would be that the movie had a lot too much sex and that it felt rushed, but that's just my opinion. __________________________ "He will have to grow up fast." -Bud Fox (from the movie 'Bud' (1996))

But it was also extremely well-acted. _____________ Score: 5/5 ______________ _______________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  My wife and I went to see "Fargo" on opening night and I thought it was a good picture. There was something about the story line that got my attention and the acting was excellent. This movie was shot in and around Duluth and Fargo, Minnesota. I've never been to Duluth. I saw a few pictures and it's not really known for being a very good movie town. The movie was about a man named Lester Nygaard who had been murdered by the mafia. His widow is a widow of a police officer. The two of them live in a little shack and Lester's mother-in-law is always there. The story takes place during the time the Mafia was operating out of the big city and the mafia tried to get rid of the cop that murdered Lester. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie that are not in the book. There is a great scene between the mother and Lester where she has to say her last goodbyes to her son and she starts to cry. There were a lot more scenes like that in this film. I don't remember all of them, but I will remember the scene that I saw in this picture. I didn't know what to think about this movie at first. I had heard that it was about the murder of a man. I knew about the mafia, but didn't realize that the Mafia had to do with this murder. There weren't any guns in the picture. The picture was shot on location in and out of Duluth, Minnesota and the murder happened in the small town of Sioux Falls, North Dakota. I didn't think it was going to be that good, but after seeing it a few times I realized that it is very good. The acting was great and I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed the whole picture and would recommend it to anyone. This is a very interesting and well made movie. This movie is now available on video on Amazon and DVD. For those of you who have never seen this movie or have never heard of it, I will give you the plot. The film was made in the mid-1980s and it follows Lester Nygard as he is murdered by a mob hit man. The hit man gets into a fight with the police officer who murdered Lester and this sets off a chain of events that lead to a confrontation between the Mafia and the police. It's a very intense film. The murder scene is intense and the fight

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ _________________________________________  It was a little disappointing to see that the original version was only the first half of the movie. The second half, which was filmed in black and white, was much better than the first. The film has many good performances. The best is by James Woods, who plays a man who is trying to get back to his family and is also trying to deal with the guilt of his father's murder. The story of the film is that of a man's life. He was a man before his time and he became a man in his time. He is trying in the process to find his family. He starts out in his life with the family he left behind. This film also deals with many moral issues. There are several great scenes of the man's struggle to get his family back. His relationship with his wife is shown in the film. The man has two daughters that he loves dearly. He has two sons that he has no time for. His son is just as tough as his father and is trying his best to get by. The son is trying very hard to get into the family business, but is not very successful. The movie is full of suspense. The camera work is excellent. The sound effects are perfect. The only reason I give this a four and not five stars is because of the changes made to the film in the second half. They have changed it so much that the first two thirds of the original film does not even exist in the new version. The original film had a much more "realistic" look to it and had a great score. The new film has been changed so much, that it has lost all of the realism it had. It has become a film about a man trying to find a family, and not about the man. The ending is just ridiculous. I thought it was a very good film.  *NOTE* The DVD version of this film has the second part of the story which is better than what is on the VHS.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I saw "Witchfinder General" on opening night of the "Rivers of Blood" festival in Munich and was amazed. I had never seen a movie like it. It was so different and full of mystery that I was mesmerized. I have seen it several times since and it never fails to amaze me. The acting was brilliant, the acting of its leading actors was excellent, the plot was complex and the music was wonderful. The movie had the feeling of being an allegory of our times. I also liked that the movie had two endings: one of the main character dying in a different place and another ending with him dying in prison. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a masterpiece! - July 19, 2004Witch Finder General  Reviewer: jcjh22 - favorite favorite favorite - May 20, 2004  Subject: Good but too slow for me. A very good movie, and worth a watch for the plot. The cinematography and the acting were both very good. However, I found the story to be a little slow. I think the first two thirds of the film were more important than the last two thirds. I'm sure this was done to show how the plot would play out, but in the end I found it a little boring. The story line was not the most exciting, but I can see how some people might find it to be entertaining. I've seen some other reviews that claim this is one the best movies ever made, and I can definitely agree. It is definitely one of a kind, and for that reason alone it should be seen. - May 21, 2004Good but too slowly for me  Reviews of this movie: A - June 11, 2004Great, but not my kind of movie  B - June 13, 2004A great movie, but too short  A - June 20,2004I really enjoyed this movie  the movie was great - June 23, 2004This movie is really good, but the story line is not exciting enough.

I was only a little girl then, and I don't remember much. The girl who played the young girl in the movie, was the best thing about it. Her character is a very cute one. I remember thinking that she was just perfect for the role. It was funny to me at the time, and still is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (1998) The best of the Big Lebowskis  The Dude (Ray) and the Dude's friend Walter (Jeff Bridges) go on a road trip in search of some old high school friends.  In this film, the two characters have the most interesting dialog, which is very original. It is funny, with a few clever ideas.  the Dude and the other friends (including his brother Donny) have been playing a game called Lebensraum, where they travel to a random city to find some people to play with. They start off at the local bowling alley. In order to avoid the cops, they sneak into the back of the bowling alley, where Donny can't get the key from the clerk. The Dude is on the phone to his mother, who is sick, when he hears her voice and sees a stranger walk in the front door. The stranger is a police officer. He has come to arrest the Dude for loitering. The cop is not very friendly and the three friends are very nervous. The cops tell the Dude that he has a warrant out for his arrest and he must leave. The group starts driving away in a car. The officer notices that they're driving away, so he stops his car, tries to open the door but he can't. He then puts his gun to the Dude, who gets out of the car and runs to a window. The officers tell the guy to get back in his car. He does, but it turns out he is driving backwards. The Officer is trying to open his door when the Dude runs out of his car and jumps into the car, causing the car to go forward. The driver of the cop car falls out of it, but Donny and the officer are both able to get out. They all start running away. The guy in the cop's car tries to shoot the Dude but he ducks. He is then chased by the other two. The police car catches up with the guys, and the cop pulls out a gun and tells them to get into the cop cars. The car with the two cops drives off, but the car with Donny drives into the middle of the road. The two cops jump out of their cars and start chasing Donny. The policeman gets out and tells the Dude to get in the car. Donny then jumps out and gets in the back seat. The guys drive off and Donny makes it to

The movie follows a couple, who are in the middle of a divorce. During the course of the movie, they are trying to find the right words to say to each other.

I think I would love this movie again. ______________ "I Am Legend" (1994) (Director's Cut) I've never watched the original version of "I am Legend" but I've seen the director's cut many times.

It was really well done. The ending was so intense. __________________ "I, Frankenstein" (1931) (Theatrical Cut) The movie was directed by Orson Welles and stars Lon Chaney Jr. and Catherine Deneuve.

It is definitely a classic movie. __________________________________________________________ "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1968) (Original Film) The film was directed and produced by Orville F.

It's the best movie I've ever seen about a murder. - It's not very good but that's the way it was made. _________  favorite favorite favorite favorite ( 2 reviews )  Topics: Mystery Movies, Mystery Film   Audiophile CD Collection 10 10.0 The Man From UNCLE by Various Artists; Richard A.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  This film is not about the real history of the First World War, but about the historical event, the "Battle of the Somme". It is a war movie. It is about a battle. I was not in the front line. I have seen and read many books about the Sommervleur, but the movie was good and worth seeing.

He was the first of the four of us who were together. I loved him. It was like he had a part of his soul. And then I was there, too, for a long time, but we parted on good terms. I don't like the guy. I never did. He wasn't a nice guy."  ____________________________________________  On her relationship with Jack: ____________ ________________  I don. I love him very much. I just wish he would have told me what he really did. I always felt so guilty. He kept saying he was sorry and then I had to sit there and listen to him lie. He always said he didn't mean it, but I could tell he was really trying. I wish he had just told me. But that was his thing. It wasn't like he just happened to go to that club, so I'm not surprised he didn'y tell me. I'm very disappointed in him, I know that.  Jack and I had a great time. We went out to dinner and went to a show at the Paramount Theater. The next day, Jack was gone. I was worried he was going to commit suicide. I called the police and went straight to the hospital to find out what happened. I had been at work, but at about 8:30, when I got home, I called 911. I knew Jack was out there somewhere, but he didn';t call back. I went to the police station and told them everything that had happened. The detective was there and said, 'Well, I can't tell you anything, but if you want to talk to Jack, call me.' So I called him. I told him everything. He said, "Don't worry about it. It's nothing to worry about. I'll call you tomorrow." And that's what he did. . If Jack had told me that he had killed himself, I would have believed him. But he didn''t. It would have been too hard. I think he did it to get back at me. He thought I was the reason he killed himself. It doesn''t make any sense. He never did that to anyone else. He told me he had done it for me. That he wanted to get it off his conscience. I didn't understand why he wanted it to be off his
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! The film is a classic for a reason. It is an all-around great movie. The actors do an excellent job. The acting, music and cinematography are amazing. The plot is solid. The characters are all memorable. I am a huge fan of this movie. This movie is well worth the price of admission.  A great movie that is a must-see for all. The soundtrack is great. The film doesn't give much away but it is a movie you will watch again and again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ "All is not what it seems, as a result of which the plot is more of a joke than a thriller. The movie is set in a small town, and while the main characters, a young boy, his grandmother and a police officer, are the main focus of the movie, there are many other people who appear in the film but are barely in it. A number of scenes are not even filmed, and many of the events that take place in the town and on the streets have no connection to the story. The only thing that I found surprising about this movie is the fact that a movie was made in such a small country, and that it was made by a Dutch director. I would have liked to see a more sophisticated, well-thought-out and well-written movie. The plot is not as good as it could have been, but it's a good film."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers was a good, enjoyable movie.  If you enjoyed Avengers: Age of Ultron, you'll love this one.  The movie was a huge success, and was a major step up from the previous film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.    There are a couple of major problems with this movie. First of all, I have to say that I think this was the worst looking film in Marvel's entire history.  This film looks like it was made by a low budget company like Pixar.  The film looks so bad, it could have been a low-budget movie made by an inexperienced director.  For those who have seen the previous two films, you can probably tell what I'm talking about.  Also, if you're looking for a more serious superhero film, you're going to be disappointed.  I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.  You wouldn't see Iron Man, Thor, or Captain America do a serious action movie, would you?  I'm surprised they didn't include a few more Marvel superheroes like Black Panther, Hulk, or Quicksilver.  Overall, the film was a blast to watch, and if you liked the first Avengers film, I'd say you'll enjoy this one even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ __________________________________________ I've had a lot of time to reflect on my experiences with the first Star Wars, and while I'm not sure I would make the same choices if I were a younger man, I'm pretty sure that George Lucas did a damn good job of bringing us the film that was going to be his swan song. As a young man, George Lucas was very much into science fiction and the future, and the world of the Star Wars films is a very similar one, with the Empire at the top, a rag tag band of rebels, and a couple of big bads. The Empire's actions in the first two films are very reminiscent of the way the Nazis used to think about the world. While there are some changes made, the core of the Empire is still there. When Han Solo, a smuggler, and Chewbacca (the Wookiee) meet Luke Skywalker (the young man), Han is determined to get the information he needs about the Force from the young man. Han's a pretty ruthless man and doesn't mind killing to get what he wants, but he's not going to lie to his friend and a fight breaks out. This fight is not a fight of good vs. evil, but a fight between two men who don't see eye to eye. When the dust clears and Han's gone, Luke tells him to go. Luke doesn't go because he wants to, but because he has no choice. If Luke had been there to stop Han, Han would have killed him. If Han had been in charge, Luke would be dead. The idea of the future isn't something that is easy to deal with, especially when you think about how close we are to that future. We've all heard the talk about how "the next Star Wars movie" will be the last. That's true, but the truth is that "the last Star Wars film" will also be the first one that is more than a movie. The first Star War will be a huge part of what the next one will be, and Lucas' last movie will not be a goodbye, but an homage. There's a lot more to George Lucas than "Star Wars," and a lot to be said about how his legacy is still being shaped by the films he made. The next one should be just as good. I've seen the second movie, and I've loved it. The special effects are amazing, and it feels like a classic movie,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Martian" is a great movie.  The movie is about a guy named Mark Watney who is stranded on Mars and tries to find a way to get home.  The Martian is a good action movie, but it is not a great film.    The movie is so good that it makes you want to see the whole film, because the story is good.  In the beginning of the film, we get a short description of the character.  The Martian tells us that he is the only survivor of a spaceship that crashed on Mars, and he is alone on the planet.  Then we see the scenes of the movie, and the action starts.  This is a nice movie, especially if you like action movies.  It is very interesting, but there are some bad points in the movie. The movie has a very long scene with the Mars Rover and the astronaut that is sent to check the crash site.  We see them in a small spaceship.  I think that the scene is too long, because it takes too much time to see what is going on in the Mars.  So I think the scene should have been cut, because some of the action could have been added in.  But there is a very good scene with Watney and his wife, which was very funny.  After the scenes with the astronaut, the movie gets a bit dull, and then it ends.  As the movie ends, I was very happy with the movie because it had a good plot, and good characters.    I will probably watch the whole movie in order to see all of the scenes, because I think it would be interesting.  For me, "The Martian"" is a movie that will keep me watching for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** The "Walking Dead" Season 4 has been great. We have some awesome actors, such as Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is one of the most fun actors I've seen. I have seen a lot of "Dead" shows, and this one has my favorite performances. Also, I think "WALKING DEAD" has finally found its perfect companion. We've all seen the show "WILLING & Able", and I think it's good, but I think they did a great job on this one. I'm a fan of "FULLERTON" and the "HORROR" series, and I can see how this show would work really well with them. It is very well done. I recommend this show to everyone. If you love "WALLACE", then you'll love "WARWICK" too. This is a great series, it's funny, and well done, and it makes the "WILDERNESS" movies even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Man is a film that should be a must see, and should have been a classic years ago. The Best Man, directed by John Cusack, is a story about a man who is on the run and trying to stay out of trouble, while trying to find his wife. The movie has a great script, with some great acting from Robert De Niro. De Nider is great as the tough man, and is played perfectly by Robert DeNiro. The other great thing about this film is the music by John Williams. His score was the reason that I watched the movie for the first time. It was the perfect mix of the movie, and had me hooked for the rest of the film. The Best Men (1990) This is another great John C. Reilly movie that should have gotten more recognition. This is another one of those films that I have been waiting for, and I am happy to say that I finally got my wish. The best part of the whole film is that John Cuse directed the film, which is another reason why I enjoyed this movie. The cast is good, and has some great roles. John Caine, Richard Dreyfuss, and Al Pacino are great in this movie, as the three different characters. They are all great, and are the reason I enjoyed the movie.  The acting is great, the plot is great and the music is great. The chemistry between all the characters is great throughout the film and it makes the movie great.  It's hard to tell how good of a movie this is, but it is definitely worth watching. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1989) One of the best films I've ever seen, this is one of the greatest films of all time. This film has all the qualities of a great film, and yet it's so great that it has become a cult classic. Dirty Rotten scoundrel's is one that everyone should see, because it has so much action and it's a great time. The acting, the writing, and the story are all excellent. It has a real feeling to it, and you know what you're going to get. I think this movie is one to be seen by everyone, because even though it has a small budget, it is one hell of a film.  This movie has some of the most memorable moments in movie history. There are so many scenes that have to be experienced to be believed
Write a positive review about a good movie: ---------------  This movie was fun to watch and I liked the storyline, but I feel like there were more scenes to be had in this movie. It was interesting to see how he had the girls in his car, and I was really disappointed that there was only one scene with the girl that I liked, and that was at the end. The girls were not a big part of this movie, and we were supposed to be shocked by what was going on, but it really wasn't very interesting. I felt like the plot was over rushed, but this movie was a fun watch, and it was interesting seeing all the different girls that he had in his life.  Was this review helpful to you?

If you are a fan of action movies, or action movies starring military types, or if you just like good action movies (no spoilers, but the second movie was a bit better), then go see this movie. It has action, but also a great story and characters. There's nothing like this movie.)

I'm sure there are better movies than this one but I really like this one. It's good to see that in this era we have more than two good action movies. This is an interesting movie and worth a watch. The movie was released in 1981.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ The Big Lebowski (1998) is one of the best movies ever made, and has been hailed as one of cinema's great masterpieces. Directed by and starring Jeff Bridges, the film follows the story of a man named "The Dude" as he drifts through his life, searching for his true love and the meaning of life. A classic Western-styled adventure that is as funny as it is touching. This is the perfect movie to get you in the mood for a good ol' fashioned summer movie. There are so many memorable characters and a great screenplay. There is something about the movie that is very timeless. This movie is truly a classic and deserves to be seen by a large number of people. - 9/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The movie I would describe as "a comedy of errors", this movie has a very unusual plot and even though I have read that the movie is not really about war, I think it would be a good film to watch if you like a funny comedy. The movie takes place in the 20th century in an era of the so-called peace. In that time, people have come up with a way to stop wars. This "machine" is called a "war machine". The story begins when two brothers who have been orphaned and lost their mother, come across a "machine", which is basically a big robot, which they find in a junkyard. As they get closer to the machine, they get into a war between two men. The one who is controlling the machine is a man named Jack who is trying to kill Jack's rival. The other man who is working for Jack is named Charlie. Charlie is a genius who makes the machine. Jack and Charlie get into an altercation which is ended by Jack killing Charlie and setting the machine on fire. Jack then finds a body of a young girl which he believes to be his wife. When he goes to the police, he finds out that it is not his wife, but a woman whom Jack has been trying to have with her. He later discovers that Charlie had tried to poison his wife and that she died in his arms. When Jack gets into trouble with the law, the girl in the junkyards is the only one who will help him. The woman is named Alice and she is a robot too. The story is funny at times, but it has a sad ending. I do not know if this is the right movie for everyone. I really enjoyed the movie and think that it would make a good comedy of a movie. I also recommend watching it with a good friend, as we will be laughing for hours. The only negative I can give is that there are some scenes which are not too good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. You have my support. The story, characters, acting, writing, directing are all very good. The cinematography, acting (I don't know about the other 2), and the editing all work well together to tell a very well done story. The plot is a bit simplistic, but the ending and the ending of the movie were so much better than any of the other endings. The ending to the movie is perfect, and if the movie had been made 10 years ago, the ending would have been very different. This is a very good movie that I can recommend to everyone, no matter what type of fan of a certain genre this movie belongs to. It is the best movie in this genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, with a script by Stieg Larsson and starring Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig as MI6 officers in Stockholm in 1989, is a stunningly effective thriller that is not just a thriller but a psychological thriller. The film, directed by Daniel Craig and co-written by Larsson, is based on a true story of a woman who becomes a sex slave to a powerful man. This is a gripping thriller that shows the true power of men to control women, the strength of a victim and the way in which a person can change and change again. The movie is full of intense violence and is highly erotic. The character of Lisbeth Salander, who goes by the alias "Red," is a young woman who is abducted by the criminal element and is kept in a cage with a strange man. The man, played by Daniel Brühl, becomes obsessed with her and wants her to become his girlfriend. The sex scenes in the movie are some of the most graphic and graphic scenes ever seen on film. Larsson's script is extremely effective and I highly recommend this movie. (Darren)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Samurai" is a movie I have seen many times, and I always love it. The director, Sam Peckinpah, makes an interesting movie, and this movie is an example of how you can make a movie that is not just about war, but about people and how they can be changed. The movie is about the last samurai who is in search for his master. He is a Japanese guy, and he is trying to get back to the land where he was born. And we see him traveling around the different places in the world. He was given a message by his master, that there is a war going on in Asia, but he has to go to Japan because he was the only one who could stop the war. We see how he meets the other samurai who are fighting for their own freedom, and they are trying to protect the Japanese people. The movies ending is very good, because it shows the end of the war, and shows how they are going to live together. I have a lot of love for this movie, because I like all of the characters, and we can see that the story is not about war. The only problem is that we are not given much information about the movie, but I still think it is a good one. I am also a big fan of Sam Peckins films, and it is also a great movie, so I recommend it to you. Watch it, you will enjoy it.

The main characters were very well done and did not take themselves too seriously.   It was funny and very well written. I felt that they kept the audience engaged and it kept me laughing. The action was very good and was quite violent and I was impressed with how much blood was shown.  , I did not expect to enjoy this movie and was pleasantly surprised. I was entertained from start to finish. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes to watch a comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________   A movie I really enjoyed. It had a good plot, nice characters and a very good ending.   The movie starts off with a man trying to get a job. He has a great story about his time in the Marines, but he is rejected by the recruiter.  .   the man's boss tells him he is not qualified to work with children and he needs to go home. The man decides he must find out why he was rejected and what his responsibilities were. He starts to look for a way out of this situation and finds out that he has been in a terrible car accident. When he arrives at the hospital, the doctors tell him that he is lucky to have survived the accident and that he should go home with his family. When the man gets home, his wife, daughter and son are all dead. He looks in the mirror and sees a picture of himself with his son in his hand. The next day, he sees the picture again and this time he sees a man who is holding a child in his arms. The family is dead and the man has been killed in the car accident he survived. The movie ends with the man on the run from the police.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************************  So I have been reading about the movie "The Dark Knight Rises" for the last couple days and I just can't stop thinking about it.  I am not a huge fan of Batman, but he was one of my favorites in all of Batman movies, so I am pretty sure this movie has something to do with his origin story. I think there are a lot of parallels between the Joker and Batman, and I am sure it will be a good film, just not for me.    I love the Joker. The guy is so unpredictable. He just kills you so easily, he is so funny. And the movie just made me so happy. It is a good, strong film.  the only problem I have is the "villains" are just too easy. They all look the same, and they all have the same type of powers. I hate it when they have so much to do in a movie, and then it's just a fight scene. And even then it is too long.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ The Dark Tower (2017) - 7/10 This movie is a great movie in a series of great movies, a great experience. It is a continuation of the story of Roland's life and his mission to find the Dark Tower, the world's last and greatest weapon of magic, a weapon that will stop a man from destroying the world. It's great to see Roland again after so long. The Dark Towers series has really grown on me, and this movie shows that. The actors in this movie are amazing, and the script and characters are really well written. The movie is also very action packed, and while it doesn't have the most original story, it still has great action and action scenes, which is very good to see. The cast and crew did an amazing job with this movie, and I highly recommend this movie to any fans of the series, and those who are new to it. If you want to see a great story, an amazing cast, a strong script, and an amazing director, this is the movie for you. _________________________________________________________________________________  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I think the best way to describe the movie is that it's a great story that is set in the 80's and it's about the first time I met a black man. It's a nice blend of the comedy/sass movie genre and the heart of the story.   And of course, a movie like this can only happen in Florida, where I have a great white trash family that's just like the movie! I had a blast and the ending was very powerful.  -Shelley L.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie. It's not a good one, but it's better than the rest.  I'm going to make a confession. I never really liked this movie, but I liked it enough to see it on the big screen (not because I was in a movie, it's because it's a good example of how a movie should be). I always saw this movie with a big smile on my face, but for whatever reason, I never got to really enjoy it. I was really looking forward to seeing it on my big screen with the lights off. When it started, I thought, oh this is going to be good, it looks really funny and I know I'm in for a laugh. I went in thinking this was going to suck, but the movie really didn't suck. I had fun watching it and laughing my ass off. I didn't want it to end, I was thinking, it will end like every other movie. But this movie didn't. This movie ended with a bang and the first part was very good. I like this part. It was like a scene out of a comedy. It felt like a good scene in a good comedy. The second part of the movie was even better. It really had me laughing. I know the movie is not that funny, but at least the jokes were funny. I don't know how to explain the movie to you guys, I will give you the scene that was in the movie, and that was what made me really like this film. This was a good way to end a movie. The movie was very entertaining, and I will say this, I liked the whole cast, and the way they were portrayed. Even though the movie didn.t really have a great story, it still had some good jokes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack, which I've heard many times. The movie starts with a great sequence, with a young girl playing in a sandbox and singing.  Her mother and sister run after her, and she hides in the closet and sings along.  The song ends with her singing: "This is my life".  A great ending to the film.  When the mother and daughter arrive at the family farm, they are horrified to find out that the father has left for the navy.  A sad ending to this movie.  There is some action in this movie, including a shooting at a cemetery, but it doesn't last long.  And, I'm not sure why there's an old man running around with a gun, but that's the only time I thought it was necessary.  It wasn't really needed.  This movie was a nice one, with nice acting and a great soundtrack. The best movie I've seen:    "Spartacus"  (1972) The bad movie:  "The Outsiders" (1959) Rating:  3/5 The "Outsiders" was a movie that I saw in a cinema in England.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I enjoyed it, and it was a good one, if a bit slow.  "Ours is the Fury" is a movie where a bunch of kids fight to the death.  They fight, they shoot, they hit, they cut, they kick each other.  These kids are in the army, and they're called "The Outlaws".  They've been fighting for 20 years, and are very good at their job.  One day, the army commander (Michael Lonsdale) calls in an old friend from the army (Jack Black) to help them.  Jack is a "cowboy" (more of a farmer), and he likes to ride in a buggy.  As they drive around in the buggy, he talks to the kids about their future, which is to be cowboys.  So they go to their camp, and have a picnic.  While they're eating, one of the kids, Johnny (Bruce Willis), says that they'll get to be "cowboys" in another 30 years.  That's when the others hear it, so they get into a fight with them. There are a few good scenes in this film

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  The only thing that could have made this movie better would be if the villain was an actual good guy. He had a reason to go out and kill people. He was not just a bad guy out to get revenge. His motivation was pure evil. I found the film to be good but I wasn't blown away by it. It didn't get my heart pumping, it didn't make me feel any real connection to the characters and it just didn't wow me. I would have preferred it to have a different story, a different twist, and a different ending. ....  This movie is about the evil deeds of a criminal, but it is not a murder mystery. There is no detective work. There are no clues, there are no coincidences. The movie just doesn't go in depth. The story is a simple, no nonsense story. The villain is the main villain in every movie. There was not much development. I feel like there was too much information given to the audience to really understand the characters. The acting is good, but not great. There were too many actors that I would not recommend to watch this movie. I didn't find myself connecting to anyone in this movie, and I didn' t feel like the characters had any life to them. I don't know if it was because I didn t know the actors well, or because the story was so simple, but I just didn'T find myself engaged. The characters were cardboard cutouts. They didn' ve any personality, and they were just there to be killed. The ending felt like it was rushed. I was really disappointed in the movie, but if you are looking for a mindless killing machine, this movie may be for you. It will not blow you away, but there is nothing wrong with a good murder mystery that isn't about a serial killer. I recommend watching this movie if you want to kill someone in a movie, because there is a good chance that you will be watching this again soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I am an avid fan of the Star Wars franchise and a newbie to the world of cinema. I bought a ticket to see Star Wars: Episode I, as I do every time the films are released. It was a perfect day, warm and breezy with no clouds in the sky. I arrived at the theater around 10:15 and was seated in the first row of the main theater. The film began to play, and it was a lot of fun to see how the film turned out. The sound was great, and the images were clear and sharp. When the credits rolled, the audience applauded. I sat there and thought about it, and I was amazed how much the audience enjoyed the film. I was not disappointed. The next day, I was at the movies again and saw Star Wars Episode II. It looked a little different from the first, and there were a few shots that looked a bit better than others. The opening scene was still great, but it seemed that the camera was a little better at that time. I liked the way it looked, and was glad that I saw the first film. So, the next day I was thinking about it and decided to watch the other two films. This time, I saw Episode II: Attack of the Clones. I did not like it at all. I thought it was boring, and very different from anything I had seen. I think that there were some scenes that did not work at all, and they seemed out of place in the whole movie. Also, there was not enough action, and not enough comedy. It seemed to have been a little too long, and too complicated for a young boy to follow. When I watched the film again, I felt a little confused about the plot, and thought it all seemed too complicated. The third film was Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. The movie seemed to be better this time, and at first I thought that it was going to be the better of the two. I saw it, but I was disappointed. This movie did not feel like it had any real meaning or purpose. The ending was also disappointing, and left me wondering why all of the Jedi were killed off. The final scene was so cheesy that it just did not seem like a good way to end the movie. I really did not enjoy any of these films. If you do not like Star Wars, you should avoid them. ____________________________________________________________________ I have seen most of the movies that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Samurai" is a pretty good movie. It has a pretty strong storyline and the samurai in it are some of the most badass characters I have seen in any movie. They are well drawn and well acted and the direction is solid. The only real downside of the movie is that the final battle was not as well done as the first few. That said, the film did get me to really watch for the final action scene, and it was pretty awesome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Avengers "  was the third Avengers movie and it was pretty damn good.  It was my first time watching a movie from Marvel and I must say it was definitely worth it.    The first part of the movie was great with the characters and the action.  " The Marvel Cinematic Universe "   The Avengers is about a team of superheroes that get caught up in a huge alien war.  In the second part of this movie the team is trying to get to Earth and rescue their friends.  It was definitely a fun movie to watch.  This movie was a huge success and you should watch this movie.  The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the music that was used.  My favorite part of Avengers was the battle at the end when the aliens come back.  After watching this movie I must recommend you to watch this in the theater because it is pretty damn amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why is it so difficult for a movie like this to get released? For all the great stuff it has to offer, this film is not only a disappointment, it's also a travesty. A good story with a great script, this movie fails to be anything more than a cheap and forgettable rip-off of the original. The actors are very good and the story is pretty good, but it just doesn't work. The original script had a great deal of potential and this film just doesn''t even come close to making that happen. The plot is basically a rehash of the previous two films. The same old story with the same old plot points. The only reason this film was made was because of the poor ratings it had gotten, but if you are a fan of the first two films, then you can''t really go wrong with this one. The production value is also very low. The effects look pretty poor and the color of the film is a bit off. It's really a shame, as it would have been a very nice film if the script had been any good. The acting is good, and the actors are great, but the story just doesn'';t work and the script just isn''t good enough. I would recommend this to a couple of people who like action, but just don''t want to watch another movie.

It had some good moments, but he's not a good actor.The sex scenes were very poor. It made me very uncomfortable. There were a few really good ones, but most of the time they were not well-done. I was sick of it and just left the movie. The sex was not very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a very funny movie.  It's a comedy that has an interesting plot and characters, but the characters are so flat and uninteresting, and the plot is so uninteresting.    But it's really funny.  The main character of The Big Lebowksi is Jeff Lebowitz (Jeff Bridges), who is a huge fan of the great Walt Whitman.  He wants to write a book about the life of Walt Whitman but is a poor writer and can't even write a short story.  Jeff Lebwitz has a beautiful girlfriend (Jane Fonda) who is in love with him, but she has another man (John Goodman) in her life.  Jeff Lebowkus wants to find out who this man is so he can finally make a great book about Walt Whitman's life. The other characters in The Big lebowksis are his parents (Robert Redford and Diane Keaton), and his old friends (Steve Buscemi, Paul Rudd and David Cross).   But the main character Jeff Lebowski has an incredible life and is a great writer, so he thinks he can make a book with his best friend Jeff Bridges.  But Jeff Lebowlowski doesn't want to write his life story, he wants to make a best selling book called "The Big LEBOWKSI BOOK".   When Jeff Leboowski goes to write the book, he meets a writer named Bill Murray.  Bill Murray is an interesting character because he is a loser who is trying to make it in the big city.  His book is about an idiot named David Lebowkis (John Cusack), who has to deal with his parents, who are both drunk.  So it's a great movie because it has a lot of good humor, but it also has a good plot.  And it's hilarious because you know that there are going to be a lot more funny scenes.  My favorite scene is when Jeff Leboski is driving drunk and his car runs into a tree and he almost kills himself.  Now I love a good car accident scene, and The Big LbowksI is the best one I've seen.  This movie was written and directed by John Sayles, who has done several great movies, including "The Odd Couple".  John Saylez has a great gift for making funny and exciting movies.  One thing I did not like about

This film was a blast to watch, filled with exciting plot twists and turns. The plot is intriguing and well written, but it does take a little time to get going. The film takes you to a far away place in the past, and the atmosphere was wonderful. The actors were great, especially the lead actor, Jason Statham, as he is a very unique character. It would be easy to forget that this is a movie and he was in it for a reason. The action scenes were good, but they were not over the top.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jul 14, 2017 5:48 PM  Moviegoers, here's a movie you've never seen: "Gangster Squad." It is a well-made, entertaining comedy that also includes a great performance from Will Smith. It is also a true story about how Will Smith and the rest of the gang of "Bad Boys" used to run the Chicago streets. The movie is also one of the best films to come out this year. This is a movie with a very low budget, yet has a very good script. It was directed by David Ayer and features a lot of very funny scenes. The plot is simple and you'll be hooked by the first 20 minutes. I give this movie a B+ rating because it is not only a comedy but a true movie about gangsters.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************** I'm not sure how I was able to sleep so well on the plane home to Florida, after watching this movie. I've been on a long trip and it's a good reminder of what makes the world go 'round. The only problem I had with this movie is the scene at the beginning of the movie. It takes place in a desert where a couple of kids play with an old car, then a big truck comes down the road. The kid gets out of the car, grabs his camera, takes a picture, and the truck turns around and drives away. It seemed to me like a very stupid and pointless thing to do. It also seemed like the movie was trying to make us sympathize with the kid. I really don't think I could. I thought that the scene in the desert was just a setup to get us to like the kids, and then the movie would show us how evil they are. I don't understand why a kid who has never done anything bad to anybody would go out there. That seems very stupid to me. Anyway, it was a great movie. ********************** A woman's best friend is killed in a car crash, and she and her boyfriend move into a trailer park to try to raise money to get her body back. One of the other trailers is owned by the local police and when they arrive, they are met by a woman named Sharon. Sharon explains that her boyfriend was killed in the accident, and her best friend's body was found in the back of the trailer. She says that her friend was a beautiful young girl with the greatest smile and most perfect personality. Sharon and her friend had been good friends since they were little, and Sharon had wanted to find her in life, but she never could. Sharon says that the body of her friend will be cremated, and that her ashes will be buried in the ground. The trailer is being used by the police department, and they'll be there to guard it. Sharon tells the police that she and the boy are getting a room at a hotel nearby, and there are some things that she needs to tell them. She asks the boys if they have any questions for her, and one of the boys asks if she's the same girl who was killed. She smiles and says yes. She explains that she's Sharon Williams, and was in love with her best friends brother, and now that she has his body, she wants to find the rest of her friends and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hair of the Dog (1995) This is a classic movie from the 80s. This movie is about a man who decides to run a drug ring.  He meets a young girl named  Dolly, who works in the factory. He tries to convince her to join his ring. He gets her to change her name to "Cindy" because he wants to hide her identity. He also gives her a fake identification card.  The main characters: - Man : John Travolta - Girl : Gwyneth Paltrow - They have a love affair - After some time, he asks her to leave his apartment and to start her life over in a new place. - She decides to leave and starts her new life. - Man later finds out that she has a son. He decides to look for the boy. - The story of the movie is based on real events. I will give a short review about the plot:  The story is based around a love story. They were trying to hide their love life by changing their names. However, they were actually trying to get the boy to join the ring. So the love story is about how the man tried to get Dolly to join in his secret life. This story is a great movie because it is so funny and heartwarming. The story was very funny. There are many great scenes in this movie. There is a scene where Gwynyth is trying to convince Man that she is a real woman. She has a very cute voice and it is funny to hear her say "I'm a woman." Gwynoth Paltrower is great in this film. She is very sweet and innocent and her character was very likable. I like to see a girl with a cute voice in a movie. The scene when Man is talking with Cindy was very cute. The movie has a great soundtrack. The song that was played was "I Feel Fine." This song is really beautiful. I really like this movie and I think it is a movie that a lot of people should watch. This is one of my favorite movies from the 90s. The acting is great. The plot was very good. This was a movie you should watch if you want to see something great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________" The first thing you should know about this movie is that it is a documentary about the "Black Dahlia" Murders. This movie is made to tell the story of the murders of Robert and Nancy Lanza. They were two beautiful parents that loved each other very much. They had two children together. Robert was born in 1955 and Nancy in 1956. The boys were always together. The story is told in the style of a documentary. The camera follows the Lanza's and the police investigators as they try to find out what really happened to their children. The film is interesting. There are many different people that you will meet during this movie. It is an interesting film. It was made in the 1960's, so the dialogue may be a little old fashioned. The music is great and the story is very interesting. This is a good documentary for any movie lover. I think that this movie should be shown in the library.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Hateful Eight" (2014) is a film of style and substance. It's a movie of style, of style with the occasional, occasionally well-executed, well-told and well-acted moment. It is an exciting film. And it's a film which, like the great Westerns of the era, makes no attempt to disguise the fact that it is a movie about men, about men in extreme circumstances, about a time and a place that men (and their wives) would not dare venture into. "The Big Lebowski" (1998) is another Western which has been praised as a masterclass. But it is more of a meditation than a Western. There is a great deal of plot and a great amount of dialogue, but the film is about two characters. The character who is in the film for the longest time is Walter Sobchak (John Turturro). He is an anti-hero and a man of very few words. But he has a great sense of humour. He is the type of man who would like nothing better than to kill a man, but he has decided to spare him. He has spent the better part of his life trying to get his hands on some sort of money which will enable him to go back to his old life, and the moment he has this money, he becomes a man again. The film also stars Jeff Bridges as a bounty hunter called Mr. Big, who is trying to catch up with the Big Lebowksi. The characters are very well-drawn, and they have very few scenes which are wasted. The cast is great. And "The H.W.A.T. Project" (2012) is just as good as the previous film. The actors play their parts and they do so with an enormous amount of confidence. The screenplay by the late, great John McTiernan, is a wonderful adaptation of the novel of the same name by John Grisham. The supporting cast is just terrific. The movie is set in a time when the West was still very much in its prime, and there is a definite romanticism about it. It would be wrong to say that the film has the feeling of a love story, but it certainly has a sense of romanticism. And this is reflected in the acting. Some of the performances in the movie are so good, so convincing, that you can't help thinking that you are watching an old-fashioned Hollywood western
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________  I have seen all the James Bond movies so I will not write a review about the new one because I have seen the first one and know what the plot was. What I can say is that I am very pleased to see Daniel Craig and the cast have done something good with the script, and I am looking forward to this film. In this movie we get to see what Bond's life would be like if he was a different person. It is quite interesting to see the different ways the British and the Russians deal with one another. And the way that Bond handles his life is quite amusing. This movie is not as good as "Goldeneye" or "Diamonds Are Forever" but I will give it a good score because it was well made. The movie is great and Daniel Craig is very good in it. It's the first time I can remember seeing him in a Bond movie and he does a great job in it."  – Kevin D. B., Washington, DC

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ A friend and I watched this together at a restaurant. I don't have much experience with the movie genre but I thought this was pretty cool. The actors were great and the story was good. I just felt a little disappointed that the ending was not as good as the beginning. I'm not saying that this movie should be considered bad or even bad, but I think it's a little lacking in a few parts. It was a little too long, and I think the ending could have been a little better. But overall I thought it was a good one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by bb_c from Love this movie This movie is a classic. It's sooooooo good! I love it! The music was great and all the actors are so good! You could really feel the love and care of the makers of this movie! I'm a huge fan of this!  Reviewed by Mark from Great movie!! I am so glad to finally see this movie. It is an amazing movie and I was happy to see that the makers cared so much for it. I loved the movie and the music is so great and it's great to see the movie on a big screen in the theater. The movie was great! The only thing that I wish was more was that the song of the song "I Love You So" that was playing in the background was more in the movie! It would have been great. Overall a great movie and great to watch. .  is an animated film that features a lot of songs, and the movie was written and directed by the great John Hughes. The story follows a boy who, after a long day of playing at his father's store, gets lost in a desert canyon and meets a woman who is also lost. The boy tries to help her find her way home, and as they travel through the desert, they make many important discoveries. 1st Person view: It is a little hard to see at first, but when you realize what the picture is showing, you will be able to enjoy this amazing movie. The camera pans around to show us different parts of the canyon. The music in the first half is really amazing. The director, John Hughes, is a really great director who was always willing to try something new and creative. In addition, he used many different camera angles to get a nice perspective of the world around them. The colors were also really great. The desert looked so natural. It
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The movie is well-done and a good time. I enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one. It's a good mix of action, comedy, and mystery. If you liked the first one you'll love this one. Don't let it scare you off though, it's still a funny movie, just one that happens to have a supernatural twist to it. A must see for all horror fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   I have to say, I had been anticipating this movie for quite some time, but never got around to watching it. Now I'm glad I waited because this movie was amazing.   When I was a kid, I was obsessed with these movies. This was the first one that really got me into it. I would go over to my friends house and play this game called "Who can go the furthest without seeing a sign or a camera?" That's what I did and I was the only one who got the furtherest. I also loved this movie because it had great music and great acting. This movie is one of my all time favorite movies because of all the funny scenes and the characters. The best part about this movie is that it was a remake of a movie called "The Rocketeer." This movie has all the same scenes and characters.  . _____________________________________________   This movie was filmed in 1984. I have to admit, I have no idea who this actor is. He's in the film about the guys that built a rocket and flew to the moon. The only problem I had with this movie, is that they took it in a different direction. I didn't understand what was going on.  :) ______________________________________________________________   and another movie about the same guys. This is the first time that I really got into a movie. I was not expecting that at all. The movie was really fun. I enjoyed the story, the acting, and the music. This one is also a remake. This film was filmed on the same movie as the movie "The Sandlot". This is also one of the best movies I've seen in my life. This has all of the scenes from the original movie and more. I can't even tell you how much fun this movie had. This had all of my favorite parts of the original. I could not stop laughing at the scene where the kid and the dog fall off the cliff. This made me so happy to see that I was right about all of these guys!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _____________________ The film opens with a man talking to his wife about the upcoming holidays. She has the best idea ever to invite a friend over and make it a double date. He knows he shouldn't but he can't help himself. It's a good idea and he knows she knows it. She's the one that's really going to make this date special. She picks up a package from the post office. It looks like a letter. She opens it to find a handwritten note on the front: "I have never seen such beautiful handwriting. I love you". Her friend's name is Mr. Johnson and she's his wife. This is a perfect way to introduce the two couples. The script is great, the director is great and the actors are all on point. Mr. Anderson is great as Mr. Janson. His delivery is perfect and he's a great character to play. I loved how he was so shy and not comfortable with himself. The other two couples are great as well. There are a few scenes in this movie that are really funny but it's not all about the comedy. There's a lot of heart to this film. I really enjoyed this movie and I hope you do too.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What a movie!! I have seen so many of these movies in the last 2 years that I've come to enjoy this one more than the rest. The film is beautifully shot and the acting is fantastic. The movie takes place in a small town in Canada. The main character is played by an actor by the name of William Devane. This actor has a very soft and delicate voice that you will never hear on any other movie. The entire movie is a simple and sweet story. The story takes place on Christmas Eve. This is the only day in Canada that it is legal to give money to your neighbors for the kids. The guy who gives the money is Mr. Mays who is a drunk. He is very rich and has an affair with the girl who works at the post office. She is very beautiful. She tells Mr. Devane that he needs to get a job and move to another town. Mr.Devane, not knowing about this situation, decides to come up with a scheme to get money. He comes up with the idea of giving the girl a ring that he got in a bar. It looks real and he puts it on. She puts it in her ear and he can hear her say, "this is a fake". She says that he is a fool for giving her such a ring. She says, "don't you think I could make you rich? You can have all the money you want, but I don't have anything to give you. I've got nothing". Then he starts to get angry. He starts yelling and telling her, "I'll give you everything, but you're not going to give me any of it". Mr.Mays gives the ring to the girl, and she says that it looks like a real ring. They both look at each other and say that it doesn't. He says, 'oh, well then, you can have it'. They both agree to this. Then the ring is given back to Mr.devane and he gets mad and throws the ring into the river. After this Mr. devane starts to lose his temper again. He grabs a baseball bat and beats up the girl. The girl says that she is going to get the police and she will be arrested. The police come and arrest the girl and Mr.Dane. The next morning, he tells his father what has happened. Mr Devane's father tells him that the girl was a prostitute and that she had no
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________  It is a very good movie and I really enjoyed it. I think the best part about it is that it's a realistic story of a guy in a military setting. There's also a very nice ending for the movie. It's not the end of the world for the guy but it's sad that a guy would be forced to kill himself in order to stay alive. The ending was very realistic and it was a very cool ending. I like the ending, I think it was very appropriate for the story. It was very satisfying to see the guy go down in a very tragic way and it made me feel really bad for him. I don't know if it was the best movie I saw this year but it was still a good one. The movie is about a soldier who becomes a soldier when he was still in the womb and it's about how he deals with his new life as a soldier. I enjoyed this movie. I was a little bit confused about the ending but the movie was very interesting and the movie made me sad. It made me really understand why the guy would become a soldier in the first place. I hope this movie does well and I'm looking forward to watching it again. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes realistic war movies.  Overall rating: 4/5 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a film about a little girl who is adopted into a family of circus animals. They are a family where there is a lot of love, kindness and the whole family has a secret and a history that they keep from everyone. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie and I think that it is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. I am a fan of the circus and have seen many circus movies in the past and this one was one of my favorites. The story is told from different perspectives and there is always something new and different about it. The film does not tell a very big story, but it is very creative and interesting. It is a little bit slow but I think the audience will enjoy it because there are lots of good jokes and funny scenes. I really enjoyed the characters and it made me really love the little girl. The special effects are really good and they make you feel that you are in a different world. I think I will watch this movie again. It was a fun film to watch and I am glad I found this movie on the Internet.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ The only negative I can really think of about this movie is that the ending was not in line with the beginning. As I said in the beginning, it starts off as a thriller and becomes a more of a psychological movie. So as the movie progresses, the story becomes a bit more psychological as the characters are beginning to question themselves. I am not sure what exactly the ending of the movie was supposed to be but the story still got very good in the end. A great movie that I recommend everyone to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I've seen all the movies, the series, the books, the plays, all the music, and the plays on Broadway. I was a fan of the books and movies, but not of the plays. I've always wondered what the plays are about. I just have a few questions. I have a feeling that most of the characters are either in their 70s or 80s. The story revolves around a young girl, and a young boy. The boy is a good person, and is a hero in the end. But is he really? What is the truth behind the boy's death, and what does it mean? Is there a second boy who was a hero and is now a villain? Was there really a woman in the story? Was she a real person? Is she really the hero? I have no idea how I will feel when I finish this story. The only thing I know is that I want more. The ending of the book is shocking. I don't know if I will read the books again, but if I do, I'll do it with a different attitude. I know there are more books out there. I will wait to see if any other movies will be made. This book was a great start to a wonderful story. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The Great Beauty" (1979) is a film by the French-Canadian director Jean-Pierre Melville. It's about a woman who has lost her beloved husband to a car accident, and has moved to a new home in rural France to start a new life. She decides to adopt a baby orphaned by a fire, named Paul (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Paul has many problems in his life: he's a drunk who often gets into fights, he's violent and he's an alcoholic, but he seems like a good guy. When the baby is adopted by a couple who love him very much, Paul gets the chance to live a more normal life. Unfortunately, the movie starts out with a bit of an introduction. The first scenes are not very interesting, and we don't get to know much about the baby or Paul. We only get a glimpse of Paul at night in the hospital, sleeping and eating and having nightmares. This is one of the most boring scenes in all movies, and is the reason why the movie will be remembered by people who like to see a nice woman give her life away to a sick child. We also don't see much of Paul during the movie. The only time we see Paul is in a flashback, where we see him sleeping in the bed of his parents, and then he wakes up and starts a fight with his parents. It was very strange to see this kid acting like a normal child, and it was even more strange to think about how much he suffered in his childhood. Melville made a very interesting movie, but unfortunately, it doesn't make us love the orphan as much as the mother, and I don't think that he would have made such a good father.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* The "A" Movie is an all-around solid piece of entertainment that's just about as well-written as it is entertaining. The action sequences are well-paced, and the story and character development are handled with aplomb. It's a good, if not spectacular, movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a chance. I'll admit that I found the ending a bit abrupt and abrupt, but I didn't care about that. It was still entertaining. **********  "A" is a very interesting and well-made film, with some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The movie is mostly about a woman (Julia Roberts) who is involved in a robbery and is about to be killed by a man (Samuel L. Jackson). But just before she's killed, she's saved by a group of mercenaries. In a rather unorthodox action scene, she makes a dramatic exit by jumping from a moving car and into a river. She then swims away from the other cars on the highway, and she and her new friends are caught in a battle between two rival groups of mercenaries, who are also trying to take her down. The group of friends are not only a bunch of bikers, but they are also very skilled in their own way. As you might guess, this is an action movie. It features a lot of stunts and very good stunt work, and you can see why these guys are good. They have a great sense of humor, and it works well in a film like this. The film also features a couple of strong female characters, including a young female cop named Darlene (Christina Hendricks), who is the only female character in the film. ***************

I like how the movie is a combination of all the different genres, and how it has an "adult" feel. The movie is fun to watch, and it was good fun watching it with my family. We were able to laugh a lot and have a lot fun. I loved this movie.  I can't wait to see the movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* ********** ********* This movie is an extremely well made movie and it was so good that it was hard for me to pick a favourite in this group. My favourite character was of course the mother who took care of the children. I would say that the movie is like a fairy tale with a fairy godmother. The other characters were just as well done as the main character. The special effects were well done and the effects and the characters were good. There was one scene in this movie that made me very angry. I think that the person who made that scene should be put in prison for a long time. The movie was a very nice movie. If you are looking for a movie with an interesting story and good special effects, you should check this movie out. I am giving this movie an 8/10 because it is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Inception" I really like this movie, and I really hope that the studios and distributors like it. I know that some of you will have your doubts, but you should watch this movie and see it for yourself. The plot is that you are in a dream world, and your friend (Andy Serkis) is trying to escape from it.  Inception is a great movie because it uses a lot of interesting themes and ideas. I don't think I have ever seen such a good plot in a film before. There is a lot going on in the movie. You have an idea of what's happening, and then a lot happens to change it. You never really see the "truth" but instead, you are told about the "hidden truths" that change your world. I think this is a very good way of doing a movie. I always wonder how an author would approach a movie like this. It takes a lot for an author to put his/her ideas in a movie, but this one does it very well. It's like a "what if" kind of movie. It is really hard to say what's real and what's not in the world, but I think that what is in the film is real. Andy SerKis does a great job of being a character who is a little bit "mad" and confused about his situation. He is very charismatic and likable, and his character is really well developed. The plot is so confusing that he has to find his way out of it and make his own decisions. This is something that is really interesting and interesting to watch. The movie uses some really interesting characters and situations. The only problem that I have is that I can't get over the fact that the movie was based on a book. I loved the book, but it just seems so unrealistic to have the characters in a book do things that they don't do in real life. I feel like they were just created for this movie. I loved the way that the story was set up. There was so much going on, but not to the point where you feel like you are being sucked in. Instead, it was a very suspenseful movie, even though it wasn't very suspensey. I thought that the ending was perfect. There were so many things that could have gone wrong, and the movie didn't make any of them happen. I just think that it was very well done. I would recommend

I would not recommend this movie to everyone but for those who are into old movies. This movie is fun. The plot is interesting and the story was interesting. The characters are well done. I loved the music. The acting is pretty good. It is not a perfect movie. I think that some scenes were too long. The story could have been more interesting. It did not make me like the movie. But for what it is, it was a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  __________________   "They don't know who they are, they're only looking for money."   There are many more such moments in this film, and in many of them the film itself is just as much an allegory for the movie that is coming up. The story is set in the 1950's and a group of friends from an elite high school play a high school basketball game against a team of black athletes, and the movie starts out with a great performance by the lead, the movie takes a great leap when the leading man (played by an unknown named Lee Majors) is killed in a motorcycle accident, and he takes up a coaching position in a high schools basketball league. The film's main character, played by John Cleese, is a coach at this basketball league and it's his job to help coach the players. The first two games of the season are great, the next two are a bit less so, but then there's the one against the black team that brings the film to the verge of greatness. After that, the film just takes a sharp turn to the dark side. The only positive thing that can be said about the film is that there's a great cameo by Cleese himself, and a great scene at the end of the film, where the characters all try to tell Cleese that he's no good at basketball. If you think this film was just another boring, cookie cutter film, you're missing out on a good one. This movie really shows a group with a common goal, and when that goal is violated by the people around them, the result is not pretty.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ This is a good film, though there are some flaws. It is a story about a man who is a hero and a woman who is not. This is not a story of a hero who is fighting for justice. This story is about a woman in search of her lover and a hero fighting against a society that wants to destroy him. This film is a classic and has been a favorite of my father and grandfather. This has been very well done and I give it five stars for that.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   As a film lover, and especially as a horror fan, I find myself very interested in any horror film that is not a direct remake of one of the classic horror films. I've already seen this movie, and even though I enjoyed it, I think it's worth seeing it again.   The film has a few elements that I think worked very well, and a few that I don't think worked so well. The movie has a very dark tone, and the tone of the movie is dark enough that I feel that it could be enjoyed by some, but not by me. The tone is almost dark, yet not. I don.t think it has the same darkness that some of the old horror films did. It's a very strange movie. The film has some creepy moments, but it doesn't feel as though it is a true scary film. In fact, I don' t think it feels that scary at all.   The characters are all interesting. They have interesting personalities. The performances are very good. The scares are not so scary. The music is very effective. It fits well with the film. There are moments where the film doesn't hold up very well. It has a bit of a slow build up. It isn't a very intense film, and it doesn' t have a great ending. The characters do have some nice moments, and are very interesting, but they are not enough to carry the film as a whole.  .   a very good film.  _________________________   I have to say that I had a lot of fun watching this movie. It was very creepy, and very scary. It definitely has a lot going for it, especially for people who are looking for a good horror film. I would recommend it to a lot more people than I did. I liked the movie, but I didn't think it was scary, and I don't think the ending was very effective, and also it took me out of the film a little. I do recommend it.  -R

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie, and it has the look and feel of a film noir with some horror elements.  The movie is set in a small town and the local police force is trying to catch a serial killer.  The serial killer is a young man named Mr. Smith.    This guy is not the smartest guy around, but he is quick thinking.  His victims include a pregnant woman and her mother, a woman who was raped, a girl who was shot in the head, and a girl shot in her head who lived in the same town as the mother.  He is so obsessed with the dead woman that he keeps visiting the house.  Mr.  Smith's first victim is a woman named Alice.  Alice is a nurse and she was murdered by Smith. She was shot through the head and Smith had the body dumped in a creek.  This is one of the most brutal scenes in any movie I have seen.  I really loved this movie and the killer is very interesting and realistic.  The movie has some great music and some great acting.  A great movie for anyone who is a fan of the detective genre.  Recommended for those who enjoy a good thriller.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The film was based on a book, The Death of Captain James T. Kirk, by Stephen King. I don't know if he is a fan of Star Trek or not. The book is about a family of Klingons who decide to leave their home planet for the galaxy and the stars. When the Klingons return to Earth to visit their old friends they find that their planet has been destroyed. When they arrive at the Klingon Home World they discover that the planet has also been destroyed and that their race has become extinct. This is the point where Star Trek meets The Terminator. The Klingons now live on a barren planet in the dark with no light or warmth. The Klingon home world is now called the "Dark World". The Klingon warriors have learned how to survive in the darkness, but at a terrible price. When their people are killed in a terrible war they must fight for survival against the dark powers. I enjoyed the story. The writing is very good. I did not like how there was no sex in the film. There was a great deal of violence and action. The actors were good. They all had a good time. There were many references to the Star Trek and Star Wars. I liked that there were many Klingon quotes and the story had many Star Trek/Star Wars parallels. The acting was good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ The original version of this movie was released in the US on September 9th, 1974 and it was based on a novel by Stephen King. It was filmed by the Coen Brothers and was written by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. The film follows a couple, Jack Torrance and Wendy, who go to a secluded cabin in the woods. As the movie progresses, they are attacked by a killer. When the two are found, the killer is never identified. After the events, Jack and Wendy return home and find a note saying that someone has been trying to kill them. The note was written in a strange hand, and the only clue the characters have is that Jack looks like the killer. It seems that Jack has to take care of his sister, a woman who has a dangerous illness. In the meantime, Wendy becomes increasingly more distant from Jack and her new family, and eventually she leaves them forever. The movie follows the couple as they get through the events of the night. There are many scenes that show a sense of the beauty and horror of the forest, and they have a beautiful, dream-like quality that is not easy to describe. There is a great deal of suspense as Jack and his sister try to find a way out of the cabin. The Coen brothers are master storytellers. The actors are very good, with the exception of some minor characters. The cinematography is quite good. The soundtrack is pretty good as well. This is one of the most beautiful films of the Coens. It has a very eerie atmosphere, with a strong sense of loneliness and dread. This film is definitely worth a look.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  1.5 out of 5 stars - The whole movie was really good. I liked the acting, the music, the setting and the characters. I did like how they brought in a real live street kid in the movie, who was just a kid himself, who did not get on with any of the other characters. The whole family was really fun to watch and I was actually really entertained. The acting was great, and I loved that they tried to make it look like they were really on a real life adventure. I thought it was funny how the movie started off with a big fight, and then went into a car chase, which I really liked, and a fight scene, but I also loved how the family got back into the car, and it was like they knew how to drive. They actually had a good time, and the movie ended really well. The movie was pretty much a love story, and not a tragic love story. I felt like it could have been really tragic, but they kept things interesting, and there were lots of funny moments. I loved the music and the soundtrack, and all the special effects and costumes, the cars, and even the locations. The music was great. I actually liked the movie better than the first movie, which is probably a good thing. I think they really wanted to do a love tale, and they did it, but it wasn't a very serious movie. This movie did end on a happy note, and ended on a positive note. It was just too long, but a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ The best horror movie I've seen in a long time. The story is well-executed, the pacing is excellent, the scares are excellent, and the acting is just amazing. The visuals are also great and make the movie quite memorable. It's one of the best examples of a genre film that's not a traditional monster movie. This is one of those movies where the actors actually do what they are doing on the screen. I have seen many good movies, but this is one I'll always remember. The acting is amazing and the movie has so many great moments. The ending is really good and is a nice way to end a good film. I've always been a big horror fan and I am a bit of a snob when it comes to the genre. I tend to like to see some real suspense and horror and this movie has both. I love it, it's perfect. __________________________________________________________________________________________ I saw this on DVD when it came out on the internet and I couldn't believe how great it was. I haven't seen it in a while, and I just wanted to get it off my chest. This movie has a really great plot and it's easy to see why it's been so popular over the years. I just hope that this film has the potential to become a classic. I hope it does. If it does, then it will be one of my favorite horror films. It definitely gets my vote for the best horror film of all time.

The only thing that's missing is a second disc to take advantage of its features. The film is a little too long for my tastes. I don't know why it takes 3 hours to get to the end, but it just does. There's no real plot and the ending is a bit too quick. If you like a lot of action and want a good action film, then this is definitely worth a look. It's worth the price.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "All-American Girl" is an interesting film, and the first of its kind. It's not an ordinary love story, as we've seen before. The film is not all romance, either, but it's full of drama. It deals with the social issue of homosexuality, and it's presented in a very honest and honest way. It will have you laughing out loud, and also thinking. It makes you think about what your life would be like if it was different. The characters are very realistic and they all have their problems, as you'd expect. The main character is an attractive girl who is looking for a husband. She is a typical "good girl" who wants a husband, and her father has just given her away to a rich man. She meets a boy who also wants a spouse, and this is their romance. I like the way the film depicts the love and relationship between the characters. It doesn't look like it should be possible, but in fact, it is. The movie is very well acted and the story is told in a clear, concise way. The cinematography is good, and you will see the love between the main characters in all its glory. I think that it's worth the watch.  I give "All- American Girl" a 8.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ The movie I am going to review is "Machete", by Richard Matheson. I saw it in my high school high school years. It was a "high school" movie in the sense that it was about the characters' high school lives and that it had some of the same characters (e.g. Paul) who are in other Mathesons films. I was a bit confused by the film's main theme: it was a message of love, acceptance and acceptance of other people's differences. The film's theme was a very strong one but the movie also had a lot of twists and turns and some funny moments. The main story line was about Paul, a high school student who wants to go to college and find a job. However, his father, who is a very rich man, is opposed to that and doesn't want Paul to go. Paul's parents are not well educated and don't get along with each other, so Paul is sometimes teased by his classmates. Paul has a lot to learn about relationships and about himself. He is also very shy and insecure, and that makes him a bit of a "bully". There are a lot (too many in my opinion) of very funny scenes and scenes where Paul tries to impress his crush by doing stupid things. I would not recommend this movie to everyone, since it's not for everybody. There are some scenes that are too sad and too sentimental. This movie has a very good and interesting script. However (and this is a big "BUT") it has a terrible director. It's not that the film doesn't have a good script, but the director is not good. I have no idea why he couldn't just do a good job. The acting in this movie is just OK. The two lead actors (Pablo Picasso and Gary Cooper) are very good, but I don't really think that the movie should have been directed by a Hollywood movie director. There were a few scenes that were so cheesy and clichéd that they are hard to take seriously. However I am not a big fan of bad movie directors. This film was so cheesy, so silly, so cliched and so obvious that I really can't say that it's a good film. Still, it's still a good flick that I am glad I saw. It is a bit strange to see a film about a highschool student's relationship with his father and it's so hard to understand why the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix is a great movie.  It's the most important film in the Matrix trilogy.  I think the first two movies were better but this one has everything going for it.  The action is awesome.  This movie is an excellent blend of action, adventure and mystery.  Also, the writing is top notch.  In this movie, Neo is in a world of the mind.  He is not in a physical body.  Instead he is in the matrix and he is able to use his mind to interact with other characters in the real world.  Neo's abilities are phenomenal.  A special mention must be made of Morpheus.  His speech about the matrix is the perfect way to describe what this movie is about.  Even the robots have personality and feel like people.   I don't know what was going through the minds of the writers of this movie when they created Morpheus and Neo.  But they nailed it. The acting is top quality.  There are some great scenes between Neo and Trinity.  You can feel the love between them.  One of the things I love about this movie are the shots of the city.  Some of the scenes in this movie give me chills.  It is amazing how they created a city with a population of 10 million in a computer.  If you are going to make a movie like this, make it in a real city. This movie takes place in a futuristic city with the same technology that is found in today's city.   I think that a lot of people don't realize the amount of time and effort that goes into making this movie.   If you can go see this movie in the theaters, I would highly recommend it.

The ending is just as amazing as it was in the movie.  3) A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) - This movie is my all time favorite.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________  My girlfriend and I loved this movie, the whole time. It was a good film that did what it set out to do, it told a good story. I think it is a good idea for a movie to try and make a little movie out of a real life situation. This movie gave us an insight into what happened and how some people handled it. We were both glad it happened, because we didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into. The movie was well made, and it was good, but it didn't have that big of a impact.  I gave this movie 5 stars, but for some reason it doesn't stand up. It has a lot of potential, but the writing is too cheesy. We could have easily had a better ending to the movie. The actors were good, the story was good and the director did a good job, but this movie just does not make me want to watch it again.  the movie was fun and good  No Was this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ My husband and I went to see this movie about a guy who wants to have sex with a woman. I was really worried about this movie, as the director seemed really mean, but after seeing it, I was a little worried. I'm glad that I went and saw this movie. The movie was really well acted, with great acting in the two leads. I loved that this movie was about a relationship, and the relationship between the two characters was good. I really liked that they played this movie like a romance. It was really interesting to watch this movie unfold. I didn't really think that this was a great movie, but I guess it was a good choice for a movie like this. I think that the movie did a great job of showing what a relationship is like, without being so obvious that it would be a terrible movie. I don't know why it was good, but it was really good. If you don't mind a really bad movie about the sex life, you should see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A simple story about a man and a woman who fall in love and are forced to go through the process of becoming a parent and raising a child together. This movie was an experience in many ways. It was fun, funny, sad, and heartbreaking all at the same time. It brought back many memories and left many that will never be forgotten. The movie had great acting and great performances. I enjoyed it so much that I found myself looking forward to it each week. The film is based on a true story. It has a great storyline, it was great to see the two main characters get to know each other, and it had an emotional and poignant ending. It had the perfect balance of humor, drama, and heart. I loved this movie so much. It is a great movie for all ages. It also has a special place in my heart. If you are looking for a simple movie that will make you smile and laugh, this is a good place to start. You will enjoy it just as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I just saw this movie at a local theater. I was very pleased with it. It has great dialogue, good acting, great plot, great cinematography, great music. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Helpful great movie!   I just saw the film in a theater and I must say that it is a great movie, the dialogue is very good and the acting is very solid. The story is great, it takes place in a small town in upstate new york where a small family of 3 people are having a hard time with the sudden loss of their father. One of the characters that lives in the small town and has never seen this kind of event, is a man that had been a policeman for a while. This man has just been called away on duty to deal with a large amount of drugs that are coming out of the area. After arriving at the town he goes to his house and he finds his family missing. His wife is missing, his son is missing. He then goes to the police and they tell him that he is not even allowed to search for his wife and son and that there is no evidence that they are even alive. He decides to go and look for his family but it turns out that he had been lied to. His family was not missing and they had been taken and murdered.   The movie follows a character named Danny who is a police officer that is called to a large house where the police find out that the family of the missing people was killed and that the house where they were being held was used as a drug house. Danny is then forced to go after the drug dealers that he has been assigned to go arrest. This is where the movie really shines, there are some great scenes where Danny is on the hunt for the drugs, but when he finally gets to the drug house, he finds out that it was a trap and all of the drug money has been taken. He is then shot and the rest of the movie follows his struggle to get to the house and the drug dealer that he was sent to capture and is there waiting for him. The rest of this movie is very intense, there is a very intense fight scene that is very tense and very well done, Danny is fighting his way through some drug dealers and a few other characters and this really helps set up the next part of the story. The ending of this is very satisfying, Danny finds the drug man and he is imprisoned and the end
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hands down, the best thing about this movie is the movie itself.  The characters are great, the story is really great, and the acting is awesome.  I had heard about this film before seeing it and the reviews and my expectations were high.    I was really worried about how the film would turn out.  But when I saw the trailer I was in.  I loved the whole idea of this film and thought it was just perfect.  The plot is really interesting and the actors are fantastic.  If you love a good mystery, and love a great acting style, this movie will give you a great laugh and great thrills.  One thing I loved about this was that the film really showed how different each person was from each other.  They all were just different in their own way.  There were some really amazing moments with all the different characters.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great mystery movie.  This was a really fun watch and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It was very well written and well acted.

We were also laughing and having a good time. We also bought the special edition of the DVD to take home. The special edition has extra scenes that we didn't see in the theatrical cut, and some scenes are edited to look better than they were in the movie. Overall a good picture.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I went to the movie and it was very good. I thought the story was very cool and the characters were very well done. I like to go to a movie with friends and I always like to watch a movie in a dark theater. The movie was good and it had a lot of heart to it. It was really a good way to end the summer. I enjoyed it. __________ The Good: The Story - The movie starts with the story about a guy named David, and how he was a good guy until he was bitten by a monster. He then gets turned into a monster himself and becomes the leader of the monster army and goes on a quest to defeat the evil forces. The Bad: The Characters - The main character David was not the best, but he did have a good heart and I liked him. There was a guy that was named Goliath and he was the bad guy that went to destroy David. Goliath is a really great character because he is a lot bigger than David and he is tough as nails. ___________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ The Good: I really enjoyed this movie. The pacing was perfect and the movie itself was good. I think the story of this movie was really good. It was not your typical Hollywood movie, but a great thriller. I was really glad that I watched this movie because it is a good story. I would like to see more movies like this in the future. The Bad: I think that this movie is a little slow. The story and the action sequences were good, but the story was slow. If you are expecting the action, you will be disappointed. The music in this movie did not have that great effect on me, but it was not bad. I really liked the sound of this. I recommend this movie to everyone who is a fan of good thriller and thriller movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a great little movie, the cast are all really good, the story is good, and the plot is interesting and well developed. The plot was very well thought out and well executed. I loved how the characters are very different and the development of the story makes the movie feel more like a movie than a tv show. There are many twists and turns and I really enjoyed the story. The ending was very good." I've been a fan of the show since the beginning and now I'm finally getting to see it in the movie.  I'm glad they put a lot of thought into the movie and made it feel more a movie. I can't wait to see what happens next!  It's just a great movie and I'm excited for it. ___________________________________________________________ (review from August 21, 2010) A few weeks ago I saw a promo for this movie.  It was for the book of the same name by author David Levithan.  I had never heard of him before.  So I was surprised to see he was also a writer.  Then I saw his books.  A few months ago I wrote about his new novel and it was a fantastic novel.  The book I saw the promo for was The Wind Through the Keyhole.  The Wind In the Keyholes is about a man who goes to visit his daughter in Italy.  She has a terrible time there.  After a few days in the country she starts to have a psychotic episode.  Her husband comes to visit her.  He has no idea what to do.  Eventually, he takes her back to the country to live with his parents.  What is his son's life going to be like after that?  Is it safe to let him come back?  A great novel. I'm always up for a good thriller.  There are a lot out there.  And this one is very well written.  My only complaint is that the movie was filmed in the 1960s and that some of the scenes just don't seem to make sense.   I love this movie and this is a wonderful novel.

I've never seen a movie like 'The Fast and the Furious', but I know that it's a movie that can be enjoyed by a lot of people.   I like the way they made the movie, because I like the character of Paul Walker. And I love how they used the characters of the first three movies. I know I said it before, but this is my favorite car film. It's funny, and it's good to see a movie made by such a talented director.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* This is a good film. It is a bit hard to follow the story and it seems as if there is more than one character in each film but you really have to pay attention to see them all. The music in this movie is really good. I liked that the soundtrack was a little bit of everything and that they chose to use a lot of classical music. The characters in this film are a little off but in a good way. You have some good laughs in this flick. I did like how they showed the family members in the background. I really liked how there were a lot more characters in the movie and they really worked as a unit. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes a good family movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do you have a good story to tell about a bad movie? ___________ If so, share it here. _________ I've watched all the "torture porn" movies of recent years, and most of them have been pretty good. (You can see them on cable TV now, and I think they're pretty good for what they are, a couple of bad movies in one.) In the case of "A Clockwork Orange," however, the movie isn't a good film. It's a bad film. A terrible movie. And not in a good way. There are no good moments in it. There's no real sense of terror, no real fear of the horrible things going on in this movie. All of the horror scenes are set in the future, where the "future society" of a certain kind of "anarchist" (I don't know what this word means) is trying to establish itself, to make itself a kind of utopia. There is a certain sense of futility in this world, as if it's all a sham. I mean, I don't think that this movie is even a good satire of society, because it doesn't satirize society at all. It just makes fun of the movie industry. This is not the kind of satire that I like. It is just a bunch of people making fun of themselves, but it's funny because it's not supposed to be funny. And it is all a lie. It pretends to be a satire, but when you watch it, you find that there is no satire, no satire. It has no purpose. It can't even be a satirical film, because the people in the movie have no sense of humor. There really isn't any humor in this film. The movie's humor comes from the way it deals with the people it depicts. The film treats them as if they're animals. They are animals, and they are treated like animals. There isn't even a sense of human beings at all in this. It doesn't seem to care that it's making fun only of itself. There aren't even any decent people in it, except maybe one or two of the bad people. The bad people are basically just one-dimensional caricatures, and it's a joke to see them, because you know that they're going to be one-dimensionally caricatured anyway. And this movie has the ability to make a lot of people angry. It really

I found this movie in a local video store. I thought it would be hard to buy since it's a new movie. But the owner of the store, who had seen the movie said that the DVD would be at a local store a couple of weeks later. I didn't believe him. The next day I went to the video store and asked the owner, if it was his DVD. He said that he had it at the store and said he was sorry. Then I called my local video rental store and they said that they had it. I bought the DVD and saw the movie and I thought this is amazing! It is so funny and sad at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  It's not a "great movie" because it's not exactly a bad movie. It's a very enjoyable and entertaining film, and it has a lot of great scenes. But I think it could have been so much better. This movie had a very interesting story and great performances from most of the actors. I thought it was very interesting and thought provoking. I think that it's very interesting to watch people deal with different problems, and some of them were very difficult. Some of them are very difficult, but they are also very interesting. And I think they are good to watch. But it had one really serious problem that could have had so much more dramatic power. It was too much a comedy. But then, this is a comedy! It was very funny. It could have easily been a good drama. And it could easily have been a very good movie. I enjoyed watching it. I had a good time watching it, and I enjoyed the movie. There are many interesting and different characters, and the movie was a very well-made one. It had some of the best performances, and many great scenes in it. The movie had great humor, and there were a lot great characters in it that were not in the movie that I watched. I really liked the movie, and that is why I gave it 4.5 out of 5.

I have seen a lot of scary movies and they all seem to be the same. The Wages Of Fear was a little different than all the others.  This is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I was in the army, and we lived on a base in New York City. I don't remember the name of it but I had my own bunk. One morning, I was asleep and the radio woke me up. I didn't even notice the time, and when I looked over at the clock, it was 5:00 a.m. I thought I was dreaming. It was very eerie. I could see a figure standing by my bunk. I woke up the next morning and there was a note on the door saying there was an intruder in the barracks. I remember my father and my uncle coming over, and the whole thing was so weird. I never really believed the story, but that night, I remember going outside to see the figure and I could just see it. I was so freaked out. I still can't believe that it actually happened.   If you want a good time, go see "The Fly."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "It's been awhile since I saw this, but I thought it was great. The movie was based on a true story and is about a former Marine who, after serving a tour of duty, went on to become a successful lawman in his own right. It's a good read for the marines that are looking for some entertainment. The only problem was that I didn't understand it. I think this movie is better if you have a good knowledge of the military. I was not a good Marine, but at least I understand that the Marine Corps is a tough job, and one needs to have a strong will and be mentally tough. I like to think that the movie gives a good idea of what it's like to be a marine. The story could have been better, but overall I think it's a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Catherine Hardwicke's "The Woman in Black" (1934) is one of those rare masterpieces that are never really about anything but what they're trying to do.  It's a great example of the "mad as a hatter" director that most of us thought was gone forever, but was revived with the advent of Hollywood's "mad scientist" genre.   Catherine has a crazy idea that her husband was a Nazi spy, and she gets her husband to write a book about it for her.  The result is a bizarre story about a woman in a small town in the mid-1930s who discovers that her father was a spy for Hitler and is determined to get to the bottom of things.  After all, she believes, if it were true, that her mother was a witch who had him killed, too.  The film is really about the woman in black, played by Mary Pickford, who appears to be nothing but a walking nightmare, and who has a strange obsession with her husband.  Her behavior is so bizarre that Pickford ends up having to explain that she is not really a woman at all, but an illusion made to look like a woman.    Pickford also has a few of her own scenes in the film, which is a good thing because she doesn't have a lot of screen time, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie in which the two leads were so well-matched.  Pickford also shows that she's a pretty good actress, which isn't surprising considering she'd already had a couple of big roles in films like "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" and "The Lady Eve."  Pick was also in "Scoop" (with James Stewart) and "Pleasure Beach" (starring Bing Crosby).    I was also pleased to see that there was a woman of color in a film starring only men, and that it was one of the first to cast a woman as the villain.  In addition to all of that, the film is very funny, and it was actually my favorite of Pickford's films.  You can see a great trailer here: The trailer shows off the ridiculous amount of makeup she had to put on to look that way, and some of the most incredible scenes in cinema history.  As for the story, I don the movie has a great story, but it never really picks

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  This movie is an example of a story, where the movie does not stop. It is about a story. A man, who is searching for his son who has gone missing. He is accompanied by his friend, who finds the body of his son. He searches the area and discovers the body is that of a boy. When the man finds the boy's body, he notices his eyes are closed, he is covered in blood. The man goes to the police to investigate this. The boy's father is then interviewed by the police. They have no leads on who the boy is or why he has gone. The movie takes you through the search, the father, and the mother, as well as the search for the boy. The father is a very good man and very nice. His son went missing after he was accused of a crime. He has always been a very strong man and has never been afraid to confront people. It was a good story and it had a very interesting and suspenseful ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The first film in a series of films to be made on a budget, the budget was actually more than the film. The director had the advantage of working with a cast of people who were very familiar with one another, and the script was written by a young screenwriter named Steve Kahan. The script was very much like the old Westerns of the late 1930s and early 1940s, but the film was much more dramatic than the old films, and it was more like a Western in that it had a lot of humor. The plot is pretty much the same as that of The Magnificent Seven, and it is the same story about a group of outlaws who set out to rescue their boss from the Mexican law. The original film was a big success in the U.S., but the second film was not as successful, because the director was not a very good director. In the first film, there is no such thing as "invisible bullets" and there are many instances of gun fights that happen with no bullets being fired. In this film, the guns do not shoot out bullets and there is a lot more action. The movie was made at a time when the westerns were very popular. The cast of actors was good and the story was interesting. The music was good, and there were a number of good Western songs. A very good Western movie. _________________________________________________ (from http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/west/western.html)  The Magnificent Six is the story of six outlaws, who have gathered together in order to rob a railroad train, which has escaped the Mexican authorities. They have chosen the night of June 6, 1908, because that is the date on which the infamous murder of a railroad agent, by a band of robbers, occurred in the mountains of Arizona. The six outlaw heroes are Jesse James, a former Confederate soldier who is now a rancher, George Earle, the sheriff of the town, his son, Bill Earle; a gambler, Bill "Wild Bill" Hickok; a former Union soldier, Jim Bridger; a desperado, "Red" Calf; and an old rancher named "The Rifleman" who is very proud of his guns. Together they are in search of the legendary train. Jesse's wife, Maggie, is still very much in love with him, and she would like to have him back in her life

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jul 13, 2017 4:45 PM    Watch Trailer | "Fruitvale Station"  I'm sure many of us have been on a subway when we've watched a train pass by with an armed police officer. For me, it was a friend. It was a close call, but fortunately no one got hurt. But there are many times when that kind of scenario could have happened.  This movie depicts a police officer (Michael Keaton) and a transit worker (Jeremy Renner) in the midst of an armed standoff with a gunman. Keaton's character, the transit worker, is clearly on edge because he thinks his boss (Amy Adams) is a killer. The two officers work together to subdue the gunman, who is the son of the deceased transit worker. He's not a terrorist or a lunatic, just a man with a problem and a lot of pent-up anger. It's hard to watch because we're all pretty sure this is a bad guy. We just wish he wasn't so easily outsmarted. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This movie is a masterpiece. The script is superb and the acting is fantastic. I have seen a few movies with this type of plot and it never failed to amuse me. I also loved the ending. It really shows that a movie can be made on a low budget. The music is also top notch. The special effects are excellent and the special effects on the screen are very convincing. I really enjoyed this movie. If you like this type, then you will definitely enjoy this one too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  "A wonderful film that takes place in the early 1900's when the Great Depression hit. I've seen it a couple times now and it always has been a pleasure to watch. It really is a classic film with a great story. The acting is terrific, and I really believe that it is the best of the 1930's films. It's a very beautiful film and very well done."  -J.R.  ______________________________________________________  A Classic Film by Hollywood  In 1933, Hollywood's big screen gods set out to make a big money picture. ....and they did it! The Depression had struck. The economy was falling apart. But, they couldn't stop. The director's dream was to make an epic film, and to do so, he assembled an impressive cast.  it was a story that could be told, in a way, in just about any era of the past. And this time, they did so with a twist. The Great Depression was no longer a tragedy. The film tells the story of a real, human story, and it is told with a beautiful sense of humanity. It was made in 1933. The world was in ruins. But the world still had hope. A man by the name of Fred Zinnemann had discovered that gold was being found in the heart of the California desert. He decided to make it his life's work. He put together a team of men and women who worked in the most dangerous of conditions. They were willing to die for this idea, and the film was a success. It went on to be a big box-office hit, and helped put a little sunshine on the bleak American landscape. The real story of the film is not about the great men who worked there. It is about the men who helped them.  the story is told by the people who were there. And, it is a story told with the same sense of warmth and humanity that has made it so popular. The main characters in the film are the team of four men: the film's director, Fred Z. Zinneman, his assistant director, Paul Leni, and his second assistant director/writer, James L. Murray. They work together, but they also have their own personal relationships. Fred and Paul are very good friends. They are both very successful. Fred has become a very successful filmmaker and has won a number of awards. He is a very handsome

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Pulp Fiction' "If I'd only have seen this movie in the theater."  "What a terrible film, I should have stayed home."  "I hate this movie."   There are lots of reasons to hate this film, most of them having to do with the characters.  We have the one-dimensional and shallow Mr. Pink (Danny DeVito),  who seems to have a problem with women, but is in fact a sadist who will rape anyone he feels like.  He is portrayed as a very charming and charming character, and I have always been in love with him.  He seems to be a very good actor, but he is not good in this film.   The other main character, the beautiful, rich and sophisticated Denise, also seems to show that she is just a spoiled rich bitch who has been a victim of the movie industry, because she is treated very poorly by her boyfriend.  She is shown to be very gullible and naive, and her stupidity is quite funny at times.  In fact, I was laughing so hard during the scenes with her that I had to throw up in my mouth a few times. This is one of the few films that I actually wish I hadn't seen.  It is just too ridiculous and stupid.  The music is also terrible.  Some of the songs are so stupid that they can be described as the sound of a donkey's ass.  However, the music was actually quite good in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'.   I think it was the best music in the film. The acting was also very bad.  They did not look like they were having fun at all.  This is not a film that you want to see.  As a matter of fact, there is not much plot at all in this movie.  I mean, there are some things that happen in this picture that will make you think, but they are pretty useless.  A lot of times, I felt like I was just watching a bad movie.   But, as I said before, there were some good moments.  One of them is a nice scene where Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is shown with his mother.  After she is shot by her own son, she tells him she misses him. Vincent replies, "It is only a matter a time before you miss me too."  That is a really nice moment

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie.  It was not what I was expecting.  What it is about:    The movie starts with a scene of a guy and his dog.   This dog is named after a song of the same name.  He is named for a song in the movie. He has been walking in the middle of the road for over a year.  It's the beginning of winter.  The dog is lonely.  In this scene we meet the dog's owner, a nice old lady.  She lives in a shack with her dog. She has been raising the dog for 10 years.  Her husband died in a car accident.  Now she is raising the dogs alone.  They go to a funeral and a strange man comes by.  This man wants the dog. The lady tells him she cannot take the dog but he has to go first.  But he's not the kind of man to give up.  What I really like is that the man says he is a vet.  I'm not sure if it's a reference to the film or a film I saw before and I never got a chance to check out.  Maybe this was something I saw on the silver screen and I didn't get a chance.  Or maybe it was a reference I did not notice before but now I do.  My guess is that this guy was a vet or someone in the area who is a dog trainer.  We see the man walk into the house.  There is a strange thing about him.  After he enters the house he goes into the bathroom.  As he goes to the bathroom he begins to scream.  And the woman hears this scream.     This is a great little movie. It's got great music.  If you like to watch movies with a good soundtrack.  Watch this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  The best horror movies are scary because they're real. They're real to the point of being painful, and real in the sense that they're unchangeable. They exist in an unalterable, timeless universe, in which every change is a surprise. You may have read of a monster in a book, but it never feels real. And the closer you get to the monster, the more that's true. The monster in this film is one of the most frightening creatures I've ever seen in a movie.  So, what makes this film so good? It's a little slow. It's not as well directed as the other films of this genre, but the acting is good and it has great cinematography. It has great monsters. The story is well told. It plays with your emotions. It gives you a little glimpse of what a person in the world could be going through when they go off the rails. I really enjoyed this film. It was a good watch, but I would not recommend it to a young person. It would be more appropriate for a middle aged person. But, I'd recommend it for anyone who is willing to take a chance on a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My son's favorite movie of all time is "Pee-wee's Big Adventure". I remember him telling me when he was about 3 years old how great it was, and how he would watch it over and over again. Now that he is a little older, I know he still enjoys it, and still talks about it. My son and I both love this movie because it has a great cast, and a story that is really touching. I really think this movie would have been a hit if it was a little longer, because of the way it ends. I am sad that this movie is ending, but I feel so happy that I have seen it so many times. It really is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  A lot of people say this movie is one of the best action movies of all time. It is. But it is also very well made, with great cinematography, and a very cool special effects. The film's plot is fairly straightforward, but very well executed. There are a lot of surprises and twists along the way. The actors are excellent in the roles they are given, and the action scenes are very exciting. There is some real suspense going on in this movie, and I enjoyed it. The action scenes were just incredible. The special effects were also great. I think most of us have seen a lot more spectacular special effects in a movie than this one. The movie is full of action scenes, so I don't think you have to see the movie to enjoy it. However, I would recommend that you go into this movie with the right mindset. If you have never seen a action movie, then you should go see one. Otherwise, this movie would be more of a chore than a film. If anything, it is a movie you should see in order to see a great action movie. It will make you a better actor, or better at seeing action. I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film begins with an elderly woman at the edge of death, screaming in her sleep as she is being slowly devoured by a snake. She is slowly eaten alive by a reptilian beast that she refers to as "the Devil". The woman, as a matter of fact, was a psychic medium and was being watched over by an old man named David, who had discovered her and his family through a medium, which was an old woman named Rose. David was having an affair with Rose and when she died in a car crash, David found her spirit and was trying to communicate with her to stop her from eating his family. David then goes off with a young woman named Anna (played by a great Tippi Hedren) and a very pregnant Rose and they go to a house in the woods where Rose says she knows where the Devil lives and that she will kill him. David has to protect the family by fighting off the demonic creature and eventually is able to take him out. David is then able to communicate to Rose that he will not give up until she kills the Devil. As David and Anna fight the beast, he is able take out one of its eyes. He takes it to a doctor and tells him that he is going to remove the other eye but he can't because the eye is too evil. The doctor does so and David is able find the rest of the eye and takes it back to Anna. The scene is then ended with a shot of David holding the eye as Anna watches him in a very emotional moment. The movie ends with David holding a glass in his hand, which contains the eye of the creature that killed his family and the devil in his hands. This film is a great one for those that love movies with supernatural elements. The acting is all great and it is a very unique movie for sure. The only thing I didn't care for was the ending. The final scene is very dark and is a bit abrupt. I really enjoyed it though. __________________  "There is a fine line between fear and power and those who walk on that line should not be surprised when the power goes out."  -Gustav Klimt  I just realized I have not watched the film yet, but I really can't wait! I just finished it and I love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The Dark Knight ____________   If there is one thing to take away from this movie, it is that Batman is still Batman. The movie does a great job of capturing Bruce Wayne's character as a troubled but brilliant individual, who has a unique perspective on life and a keen awareness of his world. If you are a Batman fan, you should really watch this movie because it will give you a lot of insight into his character and the world that he lives in. The only problem that the movie has is that it's a bit long. It's actually two movies, and it takes a while to get there. In addition to that, it's very hard to get into. The pacing is very strange, and there are a lot scenes that are unnecessary. The story is very complex, but there is very little action. The fight scenes are actually pretty good. If the action scenes in this movie were actually really good, then this movie would be a classic.   There is also a lot going on with the villain, Ra's al Ghul. He is a great villain, and he plays a very interesting role in the story. Unfortunately, his presence is not enough to carry the movie.   The movie also suffers from some very predictable plot twists. In the first half of the movie, I thought that Batman was going to be killed. When he doesn't get killed, it was a huge surprise. Then when he does get killed it's kind of a joke. Then the second half of this movie is a completely different movie. Then, at the end of the film, we find out that Ra's was all along Batman's greatest enemy, and the guy who was behind the whole plot. I think that it would have been better if the first movie ended with Batman getting killed. It would have given a more satisfying ending, and I would have liked a bit more time to find out why Batman was so powerful.  .  .

I've heard about the movie from several people and the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am. I haven't seen it in a long time and am curious to see what they did with it. This was a fun movie. The plot was interesting and the character development was good. I like the idea of the movie. It's very simple and straight forward, with a twist at the end. I am not a fan of twist endings but it is fun. I loved the movie and the ending was very effective. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes simple movies. The movie is about a couple who are on a road trip and their car is stolen. The wife gets upset and wants to know where their money is and the husband gets upset because he doesn't think he could get them out of the situation without help. The couple go on a journey through different places with various people in their car to find the money and the wife is more and more annoyed and more and the man is more determined to get them home. The ending was unexpected and I liked it a lot. The film has some really good acting and the script was good too. I think I liked this movie a lot more than I liked the movie "The Wicker Man" because I liked "The Way We Were" a lot better. "The Road" is a good road movie."  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* *********** *********  The movie is well acted and well directed. I would have preferred a little more time on the train and less time in the train station. The train station was just a little over two hours long and took us through a lot of countryside, which was nice. It was not that busy and the scenery looked great. The best part about the train was the train conductor. He was very nice and informative and seemed to know a lot about the city. We also had a nice meal in the cafe and there was a wonderful view of the skyline from the windows. We had a wonderful evening. I can't recommend this movie enough. I am looking forward to seeing more of the city and trying to find my hotel before it gets too cold. This is one of those movies I can see myself going to again. I give it 4 stars because the city is a little bit cold and the movie was a little dull, but I would give it a 5 star rating if it was a warmer weather movie.  My friends and I went to see a movie. It is about a woman who was raped by a man on a train. We went on a very slow train ride. The only thing we talked about was that it was terrible and we wished we could do something to stop this. We got off at the station. There was a man walking along the street. I did not know him, but he asked me what my name was and who I was with. I told him my name. He said, "I have to ask you something." I said, well what is it? He said "you look like your girlfriend." I responded that my name is Rachel and she is my girlfriend. He then said "how long have you been with her?" I responded "about 3 years." He then asked, "Do you think it is the right thing to do to have sex with her when you know she is so young?" I said yes. He looked at me and said "I think you are crazy." I then looked at my friends and asked them if they thought that was okay. I was the one who got off the train. I asked my friends if I could leave a note with them to let them know I was OK. They said, no. I got off and went to the cafe to wait for my friends to come back. I left my notes and the man followed me. He told me to keep walking. I tried
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** *********** The reason why this movie is so good is because of its story. The story revolves around a man named Ben who is a good friend of the main character. One day Ben's friend, who is called "Gigi" (Gigi was the girl who was murdered by Ben) has disappeared. Ben is not surprised by this and goes with the two of them to investigate. They find Gigi's body and Ben is shocked because he never saw her alive. They continue to investigate but they also find that Gigi was not murdered by anyone. Ben also finds out that Gig i is pregnant and is being kept by the owner of the club they are at. They start to get suspicious about Gigi because she does not look like she is pregnant. They eventually find out that she is not a virgin and she does have an illegitimate child. She is also pregnant again and it is not what Gigi expected. The reason why the movie is good is due to its characters and story. There are a lot of things that makes this movie great. The main character Ben is a very good guy and he always tries to help his friend. Also there are many characters who have the same traits. Ben's friends and girlfriend are very likable and it would be easy for any of them be jealous of Gigi. The acting is great because it is realistic. The music is also amazing. I like the ending of the movie. It gives a very emotional ending. This movie is also very funny. It was also great at getting you to cry. This is a must see movie for anyone who likes good movies. I would recommend this movie to:  Everyone. It is one of my favorite movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, old-fashioned western. The plot is well-conceived and the acting is excellent. If you're a fan of the westerns of the 20's and 30's, you'll like this movie. "It was a good-old-fashioned, Old West, and that was exactly the way we wanted it to be. We were looking for a little action and a little excitement. There were a lot of guns, and a lot more shooting. But the film didn't really depend on that. It was more about a man and his way of life. He wanted to get out of the city and live a simple life in a little cabin. It's really simple, and we tried to get away from that. So we got the guns and we got a nice little cabin and we went down there." - Robert Mitchum I found this movie a bit dull, but not because of the plot. This is a pretty decent western, with some interesting characters. It has a very old western feel to it, and the scenery is pretty good. The acting is also pretty good, and Robert Mitcham does a great job in the role.  The cinematography is good, but it's a bit dated.    The music in the movie is a bit hard to hear, but the music in this movie is good.  Overall, this movie was enjoyable. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a lot of fun. I loved the plot.  I loved the romance.    But the main thing I loved about this movie was the characters.  They were so much more real than I expected.  In fact, it was a little bit creepy to see my favorite characters in such a bad mood.  It was the same as the movie I had seen with Robert De Niro.  I loved how he acted.  He was just perfect in every way.  You would think he would be more serious, but he played so much of this character that it made me wonder.  Also, I loved that he was so confident.  So many actors act this way, but not Robert DeNiro. The music in this movie, was amazing.  A lot of songs from different artists like Van Halen, Journey, and Queen were played.  Even the title of the movie was sung by Van Halem.  The ending song, I just loved.  After the movie ended, there were a lot more lines of dialog that you will remember from this movie.  This movie was such a good idea.  And the way the characters were portrayed was so realistic.  My favorite was the fact that the guy was so happy to see the bride and had to be very sad to see her leave.  Another thing that I liked was the way he told her about their plan.  Again, he was just so real.  We were so happy that they did such a great job portraying such a serious situation.  If you have never seen a movie with Robert D'Niro and a pretty girl, then this is a great movie to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!! This movie is a masterpiece. I don't want to spoil it, but I can tell you that the entire movie is based on the true story of an Australian man who found a woman in the woods and married her. It's about his life after he was abandoned and he was left with this woman. They have three children together. And the whole movie was shot with an old style camerawork. There were several flashbacks. This movie will blow you away.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dawn of the Dead  is a good zombie movie.  It's a good horror movie. It's a decent western.   It's not perfect.   But it's very good.  It's good to see that this film was made on a small budget and that it was made in the early 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's a great movie.  I love how they were able to capture some of the original film's feel while making the movie feel fresh. Â Â I think a lot of directors don't understand how much a movie's atmosphere plays into its success.   The film is very quiet.    The characters are all just staring off into the distance or watching something on a TV screen.  And the music is just hauntingly beautiful.  The only problem I have with the movie is that I didn't really love all of the characters.  I thought they all had their own unique personalities.  In fact, I didn the characters a lot more like I think I would if I were one of them.  But I enjoyed the movie for what it is.  It's been a while since I've watched a good comedy.  This movie is just what I've been waiting for.  It's not your typical "joke" that makes you laugh and think "why didn't they just use that in a real movie?".    The movie is very funny.  One of the best jokes in the movie came from a conversation between a group of two friends who were going to a dinner party.  They had already agreed to go together.  A woman who is the only one who is going and the only person who knows the others true identities was going to accompany them to the party. The two friends were talking about this woman and the way she looked.  She looked beautiful. Her hair was flowing, her skin was very tanned, and her eyes were just glowing.  When the man at the party says that she was beautiful and the two friends agree to go with her, the woman immediately tells them she is not a woman.  At first the two boys are confused.  Then they start laughing.  "She's really not a man".  The movie ends with the two laughing hysterically and one of the two women saying to the other "you're crazy" before running away.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** The Great King of Kung Fu (1972) was one of my favorite movies. When I first watched it I had never seen the movie. I was just a little kid when it was first made and I was a little skeptical about the whole thing. It had no real plot, no one was really getting hurt, and the characters were mostly just there to look cool. That's what it was all about. Anyway, after seeing the movie I knew it was the best kung fu movie ever made. It was just so entertaining and well acted. I thought it was one hell of a movie and I loved the fact that it had a great score. The film's original title was "The Great King Of Kung Fu" and the director, Yuen Woo Ping, had to change it after people in the Philippines and China started calling the film "The King of Siam." After watching it a couple of times I thought maybe he had changed the name because he didn't want to be called "The Master of Kung fu." Anyway, I loved this movie and now it's on my must watch list. You just can't beat the original title.  Rated 4 out of 5 by JG from Great movie but no real story I saw this movie when I was about 11 years old. I've seen the original King of the Karate (1971) when I went to see the movie with my dad. This one wasn't as good. The movie was really hard to watch because of the fight scenes. The fight scenes were not real fight scenes, they were just in between shots. It didn't look good to watch. It seemed that they were doing a lot of takes. I had heard that the film was really expensive, but I guess it was worth it. The fights were awesome and really good. There were a lot scenes where I couldn't tell if they were real or not. I'm glad I saw it when I did because now I love kung-fu movies. I really liked the film. I would recommend it to people who love martial arts movies.  the great king of kungfu (1972), the best film about kung - fu, with the best fights and acting. the great kung fus are awesome and the story is great. The great king was really awesome, and you really get to know the characters. The best thing about this film was the story, because it is the best story about karate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is an excellent movie about an idealistic man who is trying to do his job, but his boss hates him for some reason, and he is forced to do some very dangerous stuff. The movie is also a good demonstration of the difference between a good action film and a good thriller. The action is very good and very well choreographed, but there are so many scenes where you feel like a spectator."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1941).  I'm not going to tell you what a great film it is, but it was one of the most important films of its time and it still is a great movie to watch today.  It tells the story of a man who goes to war for a cause he doesn't believe in and who ends up losing his life.  "The Good War" I haven't seen this movie for a long time, but when I finally did, it blew me away.  It's a fascinating story and it's also one of those movies that is timeless.    In the 1940's, there were two sides to the story.  One was about the Americans who fought in World War I and the other was about Japanese-Americans.  In this film, they are both shown in their own way and it shows how people can be forced to do things that they don't agree with.  The story is told from the point of view of two brothers, Tom and Paul.  Paul is a pilot who gets sent to England to help the war effort.  Tom is a conscientious objector who refuses to fight.  Both of them have different reasons for wanting to be away from the fighting, but they both do their best to get along with each other.  They both go to war but in different ways and as the war progresses they have to work together to survive.   "You've Got To Be Kind To The Enemy" This movie is not for everyone and I don't recommend it for those who are easily offended.  But if you are a person who appreciates great movies, then I encourage you to give this one a chance.  You might enjoy it and I think you will enjoy the story that is told.    I'd like to thank my wife for giving me a copy of this movie and letting me watch it.  She is a sucker for WWII movies and I'm so glad that she saw this.  If you're a fan of WWII movies, this one is a must watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  __________________  Babes in Toyland: __________________ Babes In Toyland was a pretty good movie. There's nothing wrong with a film that's about a young girl trying to make a good living, but there's no real story. There are plenty of great shots, but the story gets left out. I was very disappointed in the ending. It was so rushed that it was really boring. I'm sure the director was just trying to keep the story moving along, but it didn't work out that way. The only thing that worked about the movie was the music, which I liked a lot. But that was about it. Babes In Toysland is one of those films that's best enjoyed when you're a kid. It's a lot of fun. There was a time when I loved watching this movie, but after watching it a few times, I just can't bring myself to like it anymore. It never really grabbed me. Babies in ToyLand was just a good little film that never lived up to the hype it had.  Did you like Babes in Toysland? Do you have any memories of this movie?

It looked good in black and white but it would look amazing in color!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* It's a good little film and if you like horror movies it has some great scares. The ending was a bit anticlimactic but I was surprised by the quality of the movie. If you want to watch a fun movie about a serial killer then this is a good choice. The movie doesn't focus on the murder but more on the investigation and the way it goes about it. The music was good and the acting was good. This is one of those movies where if you don't like horror or gory movies you will probably like it. Overall a good good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. ___________. _________________. _____. _______.  I'm not really sure what to say about this one. The movie is a lot of fun, and it doesn't take long to find out that the main character is an idiot. And that's a very rare thing in a movie like this, but that's why it works. It's a bit like watching a kid play the guitar. He plays it perfectly and it sounds like a child is actually singing along to it. He's just so dumb, that it's hilarious. Also, the music in this movie is excellent. I don't even want to go into detail about the songs because it sounds so good. I wish they made a movie about the band that plays in this one, because they're pretty awesome. This is one of the best horror movies I've seen so far this year. The ending was a bit strange, but I guess you have to see it for yourself. But it was still pretty good. The acting in this was very good, and I can't remember many other actors who played the same characters. So, that's it for this movie. If you like it, check out their album, which is pretty awesome too. It has some amazing songs. It also has a great soundtrack. I can recommend it, but if you want to check it out on iTunes, you can.

(I'm sure this review will appear on all the "Best of" lists) I saw the film about 3 years ago and was very impressed. I've watched a couple of the other reviews that have mentioned this movie as one of the best, but I think it was just a bit too overrated. The movie is based on a book by the same name, and while the book had some good things to say about the people in New York City, the movie had the best parts of the book and threw in some that were not as good. It was a very long and boring film. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's not as over rated as it might be.  Rating: *1/2  Reviewed by: mr. rhodes  This movie was not as amazing as everyone says it was. It's not a good one. I'd rather see the book, so this movie isn't as good as people think it is. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. (I did this with "A Good Year" but it's a bit of a cheat). _________ is a nice movie and has some nice surprises. It's a good action movie with an excellent lead performance by John Cusack. The film has a few flaws but I'll try to put those aside and talk about the film as a whole. The plot is simple, a man and his wife are being attacked on a back road in Texas and he decides to take a different approach to the problem. A friend (Robert De Niro) is driving and stops at a gas station to fill up his tank. He sees a truck with a man on the roof, and the guy in the truck turns out to be his friend's ex-wife (Marisa Tomei) who wants to kill him. They start arguing and then she jumps off the roof and runs off. The man shoots the truck up with his handgun and tries to chase her down but her car hits the side of a road and crashes. As she's lying on the road she starts screaming, "I'm not dying. I'm not going to die. I'll live forever. I will live forever!" and she starts to cry. The driver (John Cusak) picks her up and she's not dead. They drive away, and when he comes to a stop he notices she's missing. The next day, the man and the truck driver meet up again, and he has a change of heart. The truck driver is really a cop who is trying to get off the force for a few years so he can get back into crime. He goes back to the scene and finds the body of the ex-wife in the back of the truck. They get a warrant for her arrest and she is arrested. After she's put in jail the truck drives away but the man takes it to the gas station and fills it up with gas so he and his friend can try to find her. The two men stop at a diner and get a coffee, and they talk about what happened and then they go to the house. They are all looking for the same thing, and as they leave the house they see a light at the door. The door is ajar and a man is standing there. The men chase after him but they get away. The police find the truck and it is in pieces. The cops track down the ex's old boyfriend (Tom Cruise), who is hiding out in

The Good/Bad:- The good thing about the movie was that it wasn't scary at all, because it had great effects (like when the character shot the dog) and the characters were very likable. The bad thing was that there were times when the movie didn't tell the whole story, so you didn't know how the story was going to end. ___________________ Recommended?: _____________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Exorcist " is one of those classic movies that people think is old-fashioned, but is actually a great example of modern filmmaking.  The Exorcism is a film that will make you cringe in laughter.    It was not a big hit at the time, but the success of the sequel, The Last Exorcisms, helped to keep it in circulation.  It is not for the faint of heart, but it is a good film.  If you want to see a good horror film, then you should watch The Ex-Re-Hor-i-z-i.  The movie is in English, so it is easy for you to watch it at home.  There is also a dub, but I don't know if you would like it.  I have not seen the movie, but some people say it is better than The Exh- ri- sion.  You may also want to check out the sequel " The Last Days of Hell" for a different take on the classic story.  Rating:    PG
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  The film begins with a beautiful dream sequence. It takes place on the eve of a new millennium, and in it, a woman walks down a long corridor. It is night and she is alone. Suddenly a door opens and an old man, who looks like a giant of a man, comes out of it. He looks around the room, and notices the woman. "My dear, where are you? What have you been doing? You should go back to your room. We will meet in the morning and discuss the matters that are troubling you." "We shall meet, old man. But first, I must take care of something. I must speak with you. I have a proposition for you." This is the first scene of the movie. We see a young man (Roland Emmerich) enter a hotel room, where his wife (Tilda Swinton) is waiting for him. As they talk about her pregnancy, they both look at each other. She is completely seduced by his charisma. The young man tells her that he is going to make a movie called "Armageddon". The movie is a science fiction action film, which has a great impact on the audience. The movie also includes a scene of an alien invasion. It looks like this film will have a big impact on all people who have a taste for science fiction. "Armaget-da" is an interesting film. It has a powerful message and an interesting plot. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ "The End of Time" is a good old-fashioned space-opera. A series of events have led to a confrontation between the two men responsible for the destruction of Earth. They must unite in order to destroy the forces that would destroy them both. "The Ending of Time", however, is a story about a little boy. The ending is not exactly what the boy wants, but it is the story he must make to save his mother, his father, and his home from a war between the forces of good and evil. It is an interesting film, and I liked it well enough. The two men are in many ways similar: each has his own motives, but both are very different in the way they go about them. One is an old man, the other is a young man. Each wants the destruction or preservation of a planet that he loves. The young man is willing to take any risk to save the world. The old man is not willing to risk the very survival of his race. Their reasons for the war are different, but their motives are the same. The plot, however, and its conclusion, are quite different. The little boy is much too young to make up his mind. He does not know his own mother, or his father. He knows only one thing: the destruction and destruction of all things. His desire for a family and a home is all he really knows. He has no idea what will become of him, and so his actions in the last scene are much more like that of a child than of a man. But the boy is an excellent actor, and it shows. The last scene shows him with his father and mother, and with his friends at the beach. The scene is so moving and touching that it makes you weep for the man who must leave the world he loves behind, and who must be lost. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to take action for the good of your own people.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The Americanization of Alice's Restaurant" (1949) was the first movie of silent era in which the star of the film was played by an actress and not a silent actor. The movie was made by a silent director (Kurt Weill) and it was a success. It was a big success for its time. The star of this movie was the famous American actress, Mae West. The story of the movie was about Alice (Mae West), a small town waitress who is forced to go on a date with a big city lawyer, Mr. O'Rourke. Mae West's character was a real "siren of the stage" and she was beautiful and charming. It is a fact that the movie is about love between two people but the story of love and lust between two women in this movie is really amazing. It has a romantic and very passionate love story between these two women. The romance between the two women is so beautiful and touching. This movie has been remade many times in the past, but the movie "The Americans" is a good film. The cast of this film is very talented. It includes actors like Joan Crawford, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. This is a movie about the relationship between two American women. It shows that these women can be very different and very attractive. The movies also has a few very romantic scenes between these women. When the movie ended, it is very interesting to see how the audience will react. It will be a good experience for you. The Americans is a film that will stay in your mind for a long time. ___________ "The Sinking of the Lusitania" (1998) was a movie that caused a lot of controversies. The first thing that I remember about this movie were the terrible scenes between the Germans and the British in the film. I didn't understand why we are supposed to feel sorry for the Germans in this story. I think that the Germans were actually very bad people in this film. This film also was a great movie to watch because it showed the reality of war. _______ "The Godfather: Part III" (1972) is the third film of the Godfather series. This story is about a mob boss who has a son and a daughter. His daughter is very beautiful. She is the daughter of a rich Italian family. The son is a real good guy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I saw this movie on opening night, at a theater that was showing a variety of films. I had no idea what I was going to see. The lights dimmed, and a movie trailer played. A black and white film showed a man walking around a city. He walked past a house, and the owner of the house called out "hey, what's that?" He walked up to the man, and said, "I don't know, I don't remember seeing a thing." The man answered, "it must be the devil!" The man looked at the house, then walked away. I was intrigued by this film, but the movie trailer did not convince me to watch it. A few months later, I decided to see it. I found a theater with a good screen and good seats. I put the ticket on my lap, and waited. The film was quite good, the story good. I loved the characters, they were funny, but at the same time, had some serious things to say. This movie is about a man named Bob, who was the owner and caretaker of a small, abandoned building. He lived in this building for many years. One day, a man in a suit walked into the building. The man said, he was looking for the person that lived in that building. Bob was not the person, but he was sure he knew the man. Bob said that he would take the man to his office. The next day, the man walked into Bob's office, and asked, "What's wrong, Bob?" Bob said, the guy is a little bit off. Bob took the man into his office, where the man asked him questions. The guy said he was a lawyer and a doctor. He told Bob he had cancer, and was dying. The lawyer said he would help the doctor, and he would find a cure. Bob asked what kind of cure, the lawyer said a cure from God. He said he had read about God in a book, and that God would save the man's life. Bob told the lawyer he would never believe that, and then he asked the man how long he had been in the building, the doctor said 20 years. The doctor then said, that he didn't know how long the man had been there, but that he should go back to the city. The last thing the doctor says to Bob is, "You'll never find God in this house. He's dead." At
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was actually in the movie a little bit. It was my first time going to a movie at the Cinespia. It had an interesting plot with an interesting twist. I thought the plot was interesting because it was so unusual. The movie was written and directed by Michael Mayer, and it was made in 1997. The film follows a couple in love and it is about their relationship. The wife of one of the characters is a cop and the other is a private eye. There was a good deal of kissing and hugging in the film. I did not see the movie, but I thought it was interesting. There is a lot of kissing in this film. The kissing was not sexual. I would not classify this as a romance. I liked the movie and I would recommend it to any young girl who has not seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   I'll admit, this movie didn't blow me away like The Last of the Mohicans did. It was a good film, with a lot of heart. However, there was nothing new about it. I enjoyed it for the characters and their interactions with one another. It just didn't have the same sense of urgency or urgency that The Last Of The Mohicans had. The movie was enjoyable for those of us that are looking for a good thriller. I give it a 7 out of 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ The film starts off with a shot of the "dinosaur" walking through a forest and the camera pans around it as it walks and the sound of birds chirping are heard. This is an early shot of this dinosaur and we can see it's face and it has no eyes. This first scene sets up the dinosaur as a kind of evil, or at least more sinister than a "natural" one. This dinosaur will try to eat us, destroy us and will kill any other animals that get in its way. The dinosaurs in the first film are more or less the same, but the movie goes into more detail about the different species of dinosaurs and how they all live in the same area. The "dino" in this movie is just a big pile of bones. The next scene shows a scene of a group of children that are on a hunting expedition. The kids have brought a dead animal with them that they will use for food. This dead animal is a dinosaur. The children are all excited about the discovery and are trying to keep a close eye on it. The dinosaur gets excited and runs at the kids and tries to eat them. The film cuts to the dinosaur walking through the forest and is seen by a camera from a helicopter. The camera flies over the dinosaur and it is seen from a distance and in slow motion. As the camera is flying over the dead dinosaur, it is shown that it has very little flesh on it's back and looks much like a piece of wood. As we can understand the idea of "dead" is that it is dead in the sense that it does not have any life left in it, and so it cannot be eaten. But the film shows us how much life the dinosaur had. As this camera is slowly flying over this dinosaur, we can also see that it also has very much skin and a very sharp beak. The end of this scene is where the dinosaur gets its name. The name is "The Predator". The name refers to how the dinosaur was so strong and agile and could easily take down any animal. So we can think that the "Predator" is a very powerful dinosaur, because it could easily get the prey that it wants. The main problem with this film is that the dinosaur is also very loud and the kids are afraid of it, so we never get to see what the dinosaur actually looks like. Also, the kids never get close to this dinosaur to take a closer look. There is a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********"Hail the Conquering Hero" is a classic in the genre of action/drama/romance/rom-com. It has a lot of great action scenes, great dialogue and a great cast. The film starts with an amazing opening shot. We are introduced to our hero, the titular hero, and our heroine, the girl who will become the Conqueror's Queen. We see him being chased by thugs, but we also see that she is also chased. She tries to run away and she runs right through a hole in the wall of the palace and we see the King and his knights coming after her. We hear a man talking about her being the Conquistador's Queen, and then we see her standing in front of a giant sword. He tells her that he will make her his Queen. She agrees. The two of them start to duel, but she uses her powers to stop him. They are both hurt, and the King tells her to return to him. He also tells her he loves her. She tells him she loves him back, but he says that she can't love someone who is already dead. She refuses, saying she's not going back. The King tells his soldiers that they must kill her if they want her to stay in the kingdom. He orders them to bring her and that they will have to do it right away. They do and then a big explosion occurs. The king looks at his daughter and says he's never loved a woman more, and he tells her she can go back to her friends. She says she is going to her friend, and they start to run and run. We can see that they are both scared, and we also can see they are on a dangerous road, so they run, but it seems that the Conflagador's kingdom is going in the wrong direction. They see a group of people running behind them and the girl says she can not go on that road anymore. The girl tries to say something to her father, but the man stops her and says she must die for her country. She replies that she will not die for anyone and then she runs away. The next scene shows the Conkler's soldiers trying to catch up to the girl. They chase her and they catch her. The boy is looking for her and sees the Conkeler's soldier shoot her. As the boy gets closer to the scene, he sees a girl lying on the ground, her arm
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- What is the difference between this movie and other movies like it? I really liked this movie, and if it was my only movie I would buy it all over again. This movie is based on a book called The Prince and the Pauper by E.B. White, it tells the story of a young man who is trying to get through the tough time in his life. This guy is called the Prince, and the guy who's trying to keep him in line is called Pauper. The Prince is very much like Jesus Christ in many ways, he was born into a poor family, and it was only by the grace of God that he grew up to be a very good man. The movie takes a look at the life of this guy and the people around him. There is one point where he has a dream about the Paupers and it is very realistic. There are a few funny scenes in this movie that are just perfect. I think this movie is worth watching. It really is a great story of how we are all born into the wrong situation. If you like this movie I recommend buying it and reading the book as well. The picture quality of this movie was very good, but the sound was not too good.

She decides to take a trip to California to help him, but her mother (Lizzy Caplan) refuses. Dakotas friends, who are all married or have recently broken up, come to California with her to help Dakotam, but she gets involved with a man named Frank who is her step-father's best friend. The film also has a great performance from Hanks. It was very nice to see Tom Hanks in a good film, and I hope he does more films in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** *The Grand Seduction* (2013) - A man falls for a woman and her lover on a train. The man's life becomes a living hell as he tries to get out of this. He becomes more and more obsessed with finding out the truth about his ex-wife. He starts to realize that he needs to get rid of her to be happy again. (1.5/5) - The film was a remake of a French film by the same title that I had seen in the 1980s. This remake was much better, and much more interesting. The director of the French film, Alexandre Aja, decided to go with a very different approach. Instead of having a woman be the hero, the director decided to give it to the train. It works very well because the film is set in a train and the man falls in love with a woman. There are two other women who are also interested in him, but he can't get them to love him as well. He begins to have a lot of problems because of this, but when his wife returns from the army and starts to date a man who is older than she is, he finally figures out how to get the women to love the man. (4/5). The best part about this film is the relationship between the two men, and the relationship of the woman. The relationship between these two men is very interesting and believable. I especially liked the scene where the two of them had sex on a platform. The only thing that could have been better about this movie is that the ending could have gotten a little bit better. (2/5 for this) **Special mention to the film's music** (5/10) - This movie was made in the late 1970s, but it was not made to the standards of today. It was made with a small budget, and it was made for a small audience. However, I think that it would be worth seeing today. The music in this movie was very good and it fits very well with the story. It wasn't very interesting, but the music really did enhance the movie. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a great movie. Now I realize that this movie wasn't a great film by any means, but for a time it was very interesting. I don't think I would ever see this movie again. It is definitely worth watching, but not as a stand-alone movie. (3/5

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ The most common problem in making movies is that the actors are so good they don't get the credit they deserve. I'm a little more than a month into making my first film, The Green House, and I can say that the best actors are the ones who are unknown to most people. It has taken a long time to find the right actors to work with, and now I'm in the midst of shooting. The director, Mike Flanagan, is a real pro, and is an excellent actor himself. I can't wait to see the finished film. ______________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________  LOOKING FOR:  1. A good family drama. _____________________________________ I have a long-standing interest in family drama, and when I saw that this movie was being filmed, I was really excited to see it. This is the second feature that I've made in a short period of time, and so I knew I wanted to shoot this film in one shot, in a way that would be economical, and also give the actors a chance to showcase their talents. I really feel that I'm going for a very simple approach here, and that it has paid off. I know that there are a lot of people who would like to see this movie, and who would be very disappointed if they didn't see it in a theater. It's a very easy film to film, and if I were to shoot it all over again, I would probably shoot it in one-shot. __________________________  PITCH:    The film is a film about a family that lives in a farmhouse in the woods. A man and a woman, who have a young daughter, go up to the cabin for the summer. A lot of times I've been asked if the film is about the two couples living in the cabin. The answer is yes and no. It is about a young man who is going to be drafted into the army, and about his wife, who is a nurse. It was a good idea to do this film as a family film, because it is a really hard life to be in, but I have to say that it is an interesting film. It tells a story that you don't hear often. It shows the life of a farmer, and the challenges he and his family have to deal with. It deals with a lot with love and trust. It also shows how people can get into a very dark place, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ It's hard to believe it was over a decade ago.  I remember watching a video of a talk show host interviewing a few of the cast and crew. Â He seemed genuinely impressed with what he had seen.    I'm not sure that was the case, but it was clear that he felt like he had been involved with this film and was impressed.  The movie had an incredible cast of actors and a terrific script that was made even better by the performances.  This was a great movie for a number of reasons.  It was fun, funny, and really well done.  There was a lot of heart in the movie.  In the movie, there is a great scene between the old man and the child who is in the bathtub.  He gives him a kiss and a smile.  That moment, to me, made the film.  My favorite scene in the film was the scene with the boy who was playing on the roof.  I really felt bad for the boy.  At one point, he was standing at the top of the roof and was thinking about his life.  When his father told him that he would have to go to the train station, he asked if he could go on the train.  They asked him if he had a penny, and he was about to throw it to the top.  But then the train came and he jumped in.  If you watched the movie closely, you might have noticed that the train driver was very nice.  She was so kind that it was hard not to like her.  As they all rode in the train, the old woman asked him about the boy and he said that the boy was a nice boy. Then he remembered that he had to go into the train tunnel.  So he asked his father if he would take the boy to the tunnel.     The old woman told her that she would take him there and then he would go back to his life in the house.  Then the old lady said to him "It will be fine.  Don't worry about me.  We will be together."  Then he jumped into the tunnel and the train was gone.  Now, if I had to describe this movie in a few words, I would say it was a story about the value of family.  A lot of people are in relationships with a lot more than one person.  Maybe you have a boyfriend or a wife.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This is a really good movie, I just wish it would have been better at times. I liked the fact that the story kept you on your toes, especially when the two brothers were fighting over a piece of wood and it got real hairy. It is about a couple who were in a car crash when they were young, they are now in a nursing home, and it turns out the man who had the accident was married to the woman they are in love with. The story is good and you get to see what happens to these two people when they go out into the world. The only problem I had with this movie was that the car was old and it was hard to drive. I also thought the acting was really good, but it really took me by surprise because I never saw anyone like this before. The way they kept me on my toes was great. The acting was good too. It was really sad that we never saw them in action together again, but they were good friends.

It's not just because the movie is so different than other films, but because it is an amazing movie. The characters are well done, the plot is well written and the acting is really good. The movie has an interesting theme about how we use our brains to make sense of the world. * The characters were different from what we expect from them. I would not call them "fuzzy", but the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend is very well done. The relationship between all the characters was very interesting. * This movie had a different style from what I am used to, but it was good. * There is a great ending to the movie. * Great acting, and I enjoyed watching this movie. --------------- I have watched other films that deal with the same theme. This one was a bit different from the others. It was interesting. It had a unique style, and there were some really great acting. The story was great and the characters were unique. The ending was good too. It did not leave me wanting more, but was very good. -------------- I like this movie a lot. I can't remember what exactly I liked. There were many good parts of the movie, but also a lot of bad parts. It has a good theme, and it has a lot to offer. I recommend it to those who like their sci-fi films to have a unique theme. It is not a standard science fiction movie, and that was nice. I also recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good sci- fi movie.

It deals with many issues, including the effects of violence on a young person's mind. We are given a real sense of what it's like to be a child in the streets of Baltimore in the 1950s. The story is told through the eyes of two children who grow up together. It is a moving and honest account of what happens when a person, who has lost everything, begins to struggle to make sense of life and the world around him.

It's about the life of a child growing up in the '50s in Baltimore. The film is not a documentary but rather a dramatization of a real event. I did not know what to expect of this film, but I expected something interesting, but this was a disappointment. I think that the filmmakers did a great job on this film but the problem is that they did not do enough research to get a true sense of the events in the film. The child actors, even though they are doing an amazing job, have a limited range of emotions. They don't seem to be able to convey the emotion that you would feel from an adult actor. I guess the filmmakers had a lot of fun with this film and did not realize the limitations of what they were doing, so it is a disappointment to see the final product.  _________________________________________________________________________________________   "This film is a work of art.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  There are many things to love about "The Hateful Eight," which opens in theaters nationwide on Christmas Day. Set in the Great Depression, this is a Western set against the backdrop of a small town, a violent and unforgiving time. The film was directed by Quentin Tarantino, who has produced a string of great films since making his debut with "Pulp Fiction" in 1997. In "The Revenant," he returns to a brutal world of man-animal conflict that he explored in his earlier work. The characters are as iconic as any in American cinema: John Fitzgerald Kennedy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a renegade bounty hunter who has been accused of murder and has been hunted by the government. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who was Oscar-nominated for her role as a prostitute, and Walton Goggins, who plays a gun-toting sheriff, bring a humanity to a world that is full of brutality. The violence is so raw and real that it makes it difficult to watch, and it's easy to imagine it in the real world. The story is based on the true story of a U.S. cavalryman named John F. Kennedy, who, while trying to save a wounded comrade, was shot and killed in the Battle of the Bulge in Germany in World War II. The movie is a love story. The romance between the two leads is so intense that it almost seems like an accident, which may or may not have been Tarantino's intention. The love between the lead characters is one of the most authentic in recent movies, and the movie succeeds in keeping us interested in the story. It's the best kind of drama. If you don't think of this as a romance, then that's probably because you've never had to experience the violence, the sadness, and just the pain that is inflicted on a person. The Hateful 8 is a great western, but it's a great Western in the same way that "The Shawshank Redemption" is a good western. You can watch it as a movie and enjoy the story, but you can also watch it in a theater and experience the emotion. The audience for this movie is as diverse as the actors in it. "The Weinstein Company" deserves credit for making a great movie and showing it to a wide audience. The only problem is that the film's release is going to be very limited, and that will be the only time this film will be seen.

I just saw the new movie, The Devil's Backbone. It was a little different from the book. It had a different ending and a different plot. I like the way it turned out. It is different, but it is still good. It has a great ending. I would like to see a remake. I also really liked this book. I liked the characters, the plot, and the story.

I am glad that someone made a movie of this book because I have seen the movie. It really is a good book. This book is very hard to find, but I have read it a couple of times and I still remember it. It takes a little getting used to. But I really enjoyed it. The book is about a boy who goes to a very big house and finds out that it is haunted. It also has a little girl that is very pretty. I recommend this book to everyone who likes horror movies. I will be reading the sequel, but there are a few changes in it.

The third act is great as the guy finds out that his girlfriend has another boyfriend. This is my favorite scene in the movie. This scene was so funny. My only complaint was that the movie had to be cut in a way that was too long. Otherwise, this movie is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This was the only one of my favorite movies of the summer. It was just so good. My mom and I went to see it on a Saturday night after church. We came home from church and went to the theater to watch. The theater was about 10 people deep. The lights were dimmed. It seemed like a little more people showed up. They had a few other movies on the screen. I remember the movie, it had some really great dialogue and the acting was good. The main character was a cop and he was a real good guy. There was one scene that I think my mom and i felt really bad for him. It had him sitting in a police car. There were 3 people in the car. One of them was a drug dealer and another was the dealer's daughter. The guy he was sitting with got mad and shot the kid. The cop was about to shoot him, and the guy says "I don't know what you want me to do". The cop just looks at him and says "shoot him". The guy turns to the cop and says: "I know what I want. I want him dead". The cops say "What the hell is he talking about? Shoot him!" The guy says: The only way I'll shoot you is if I'm already dead. The cops go: "Why the hell would you want to die? That's it? We've got enough problems in this town". The dad says: You know, we could always get someone else to kill him". So then, the cop says: Well, maybe you're right. The dude walks off into the dark, and they all watch him. Then, they all come back to the car, and one guy says something about "he's just a kid". The others just look at each other, but no one says anything. Then the dad says "Hey! Let's get out of here!". The guys look at him, then look at the cops. They look at them, then they start driving off. I'm sure it was my mom that told me about this story, but i can't remember who it was. The rest of the movie was great, though, and i was very impressed with this movie. I was very disappointed when it was over. _________ Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pick Up!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Devil's Backbone  is a really good movie. The movie is really funny and good, the acting is great, the story is good and the characters are good. The only thing that is bad is that there is not enough of it. The whole movie has a long way to go before it is done, but it's still a good and funny movie that has a great cast. The Devil's backbone ia an action movie, it has a lot of action scenes, some of the scenes are really good.  It has a few different plot lines, some are really interesting and some are just kind of boring.    There are some great action scenes in the movie, the one I enjoyed the most was the battle between a horse and a horse rider.  The Devil  was released in 1981 and was directed by John Carpenter. It has the following plot:   The Devil is a young man who has just broken into a mansion. The owner of the mansion is Dr. Zorro (Michael Biehn), the man who killed the Devil's mother. ZORRO has made his life hell for the Devil, because he has to kill the Devil every time he wants to get close to his mother. This time, ZORO wants to make sure that he never has to make the mistake that he made a few years ago when he killed the mother. He and his two friends, Raff (David Arquette) and Gage (Tim Robbins), are about to take on the Devil.  It is a very well done movie, but there are a few things that would have made this movie even better.  The story is told from Zorros point of view, so you see him trying to find out who is responsible for his mother's death. The scenes where Zorron is with his friends are really great, and I think the movie could have been even better if there was more of them.  Another thing that would make the movie even more awesome is if it had a little more blood and gore.  I know that there are many people that hate the movie because it has very little blood, but that is a good thing.  There is a little blood in this movie, and there are some really good moments of gore, but I think that it would have been better to keep it to a minimum.  As far as the acting, this is a movie where the characters really show how much they care

The second "no" vote, cast by David Wiese of Fort Lauderdale, was a surprise. He said he voted no because he was a little nervous about a constitutional amendment that could give gay couples more rights than straight couples.  "I didn't think it was that great a question," Wies, an IT worker, said. "I just didn't want to vote on it. The reason I didn't vote on that is because I was a bit nervous."  He added: "I felt that I was voting for something that was going to take away from the rights of the other side."  (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Milwaukee and Sarah N.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It has a lot of problems that the director wanted to try out. The action scenes are pretty good, the cinematography and editing are pretty much spot on and the plot is a lot better than most other movies in the genre. The only thing that would have made it even better is if there had been more of a focus on the main character. I mean, we all know the whole story is a mess, but it is so frustrating to be watching this movie when it has so much going for it. It is so clear that the filmmakers wanted to see how much they could mess around and still make a good film. And they did. There are a few scenes in this movie that are very good. The movie is good enough to keep your interest and it has some really good performances. The film was a success because it was a lot more than what the studio expected.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I enjoyed this movie more than any other movie I have seen in a long time, the acting is superb and the plot is a lot of fun, but the main problem with this movie was the fact that the only thing you can think about while watching it is how bad the movie looks. The movie has a great idea of making you feel bad for the main characters but they ruined it by making them look like ugly, old, and decrepit creatures. I would have been so much more invested if it had not been for the fact of the movie looking so bad. Also, the ending was so unsatisfying. I could not believe how they would have ended the movie.

This movie does have a lot of flaws and it's still not perfect, but I found it to be one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen.

If you like horror movies or even if you don't, you will love it. This movie is great." (4/5) "A classic." (3/5). A classic is a movie that is universally liked, because it has a great storyline and it is well acted. This is not a great film, but it is a great one. It has a beautiful story and great acting. It is also a bit of a psychological horror, and you can feel what is going on with this couple, even though it is not explained to you. I would highly recommend this movie to any fan of horror, especially fans of psychological movies. I give it 4/5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie is one that does not take itself too seriously, or even pretends it is serious.  It is a movie about two kids, who find themselves trapped in a house by a serial killer.  A good picture of a person who wants to do good and is caught in a difficult situation:  In a very real way, it is a realistic portrayal of someone who wants the world to be a better place.  It is a story that deals with the struggle to overcome one's self-consciousness, which keeps people from reaching their full potential.  This movie is a good example of the type of movie that can make a person want to help others.  A movie like this can inspire a person to do what they believe is right.  The movie also is a perfect example of how one person can help another person.  In order to do so, they have to overcome the obstacles of their own nature.

This is about the first part of the movie, when the couples are all sleeping. The movie was a lot better than I expected, and I would definitely give it a watch. It is very entertaining and has lots of great shots.  , and that's a pretty good reason to watch this movie. It has a good storyline, a great cast, and a good soundtrack. The only problem I have is that there is a bit of a lot in the movie. This movie is over-long, but it's still worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  __________________________________________________  I watched this movie in theaters because I wanted to see if I could be a better person than my older brother who always had trouble being supportive of his little sister and her friends.  It was interesting that this film took place at a Catholic high school and the principal was the Rev. Michael Pfleger. This film also takes place in the 60s. I thought this film was great because the characters were all likable and the movie was interesting. I loved that the characters made fun of each other. I also thought it was interesting to see the relationship between the teacher and the student. The character of the teacher was kind of mean, but the student was always there for her. This movie was a great laugh.  "Gone With the Wind" is a classic film and one of my favorite movies. It's a great movie because it tells a story with great characters. It is also very good because it has great songs and great cinematography. The only problem is that this movie was made in a different time and it doesn't have as many references as "Greed". I would recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this review, we will look at the movie's screenplay, which was written by the legendary screenwriter John Sayles. It was Sayles who also wrote the classic 'Wizard of Oz' screenplay, but this was in a completely different genre, which could be described as a 'horror' film. Sayles also wrote 'The Blob', and he wrote the 'Fahrenheit 451' screenplay too, so this was not a simple story.  The movie was a bit confusing at first, but after the first few minutes it becomes easier to understand the story. The plot is quite simple, but the tension is high. There is a young girl, whose father works as a priest, and she wants to become a priest. She wants to marry a wealthy man who owns a mansion. She gets married to the rich man, but one day, the priest's daughter finds out about this and she goes to the police and she says that the rich person is abusing the priest and he must leave the house. The priest agrees to leave the mansion, but he is forced to stay in a basement room and he is tortured. 'something strange'   The young girl gets the priest to sign a document and he leaves the house, and he lives in a secluded mansion, and every day, he is fed with a little doll that is like him, but it is a doll that has different features. One day, a young boy, and his dog comes and they live in the house too. He is the brother of the priest, but his brother is also a prisoner in the basement, and the boy is trying to escape. The boy starts playing with the doll and he has fun with it. The girl starts playing too. She starts playing and playing with it too. The two play together. One night, when the girl is asleep, the doll starts to talk. The doll starts talking to the young girl and the young boy. The little doll talks about a'something strange' and the two children begin to get scared. One of them, the little girl, gets scared and leaves the room. The young boy stays there and he tries to keep calm, but in the end, he goes outside to find his sister and they meet up again. The brother is locked up in the cellar. The movie ends with the boy and the girl leaving the house together.    This is one of the best horror movies ever made, I
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   I can't tell you how many times I have been able to look back on a great movie and say, "Yeah, that's a great picture." I saw the film for the first time recently, and my wife and I were discussing the film's themes. She noted that it was "the movie of my childhood" - a film that she watched on TV when she was younger, and one that she'd always found appealing. As I've said, I've always found the films of Peter Jackson to be pretty good - he has a good sense of pacing, and his film-making is good. I really liked this movie, and I think it has a great theme. The themes are not really as strong as the ones in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the story is good and the characters are quite interesting.   The movie begins with a sequence of shots that shows a great deal of movement in the air. The camera is in the shape of a circle, and the sky is filled with stars, which are being reflected in the water below. The water is clear, so we can see the movement, but we also see a clear reflection of the stars in the surface of the water. We get a sense of how much the air has changed over the years, and we see the old king and queen (played by Sam Rockwell and Gwenyth Paltrow) standing on the island. We see a picture of the king and the queen as children, and then we see that they are grown men, with long beards and long hair, and with long faces. The old king is still a king, but he has lost his kingdom and is trying to find his family again. The queen has a young daughter (played very well by Penelope Cruz). As they're searching, the old man finds a golden ring that he believes is the one that his wife (who we see as a young woman) gave him as a child.   the film goes on to show a lot of people on a quest. There are many different groups, and they come from a variety of cultures. There's the warrior group (who have spears and shields) and the priestly group (one of whom wears a crown and carries a staff), and there's a group of priests who travel in the same boat as the warrior. They are led by a priestess (played in a very strong performance by Charlotte Rampling) who has been a member of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ The film is a classic. It is the second of three films that were shot in black and white and used this technique to make it look like a very old film. There are very few people in the film and all of them are alone in the desert. One of the main characters is a Navajo Indian who is also the chief of a tribe of his people. The other two are a young woman and her mother. They are traveling on a train to visit a relative who is dying in the hospital. There is no reason for the mother to be in the middle of the desert, and the young woman is not a very attractive woman. But the film is so well made that it doesn't matter. It has a good story line and the actors do a good job at playing it. It's a very long film, and it doesn�t make it easy to follow. The Navajo Indians and the train are portrayed in the same way and look like they are in the movie The Sand Pebbles (1962). The Navajo people have a bad reputation. They have a long history of being bad people, but this film makes them seem like they were in a good situation. They make a good effort to learn about the human race. It doesn�T look like anyone in this film is in a hurry. The two main characters have their own personal problems, but the film doesn�TS make it sound like they don�TS want to do anything bad. The film also doesn�TF have a happy ending. The mother dies in the train crash, and there is no happy ending for the Navajo people. There seems to be some confusion in the story, but it is clear that this is a film about a people who have a very bad past. The desert is a very interesting location. It looks like a real place and the only people that live there are Navajo Indians. They use the same desert scenery in this movie that they use in the movies The Sand on the Sand and The Sand Pines (1952). The only time I felt it was a little unrealistic was when the train ran out of gas. The story has a lot of suspense, and at times you feel like you might get killed by a wild animal. The only thing that was really annoying was when they showed the Navajo Indians in a long shot. The first Navajo Indians that we see are all in a line. There were only three people on that line, and we never saw the rest of them. It

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!!!! - January 9, 2007The best movie of 2008!  Reviewer: jayb - favorite favorite favorite - December 19, 2006  Subject: I love it! The best movie ever made, the greatest movie ever! It's so good that I actually think the guy who directed it, Paul Schrader, might be an alcoholic. He doesn't have much of a character. But he does have the perfect look of someone who has seen a lot of great movies and still loves to do the acting. There's just a little bit of too much of the usual, but it's great. I mean, if it wasn't for the fact that it was a remake of a very good movie that I loved (that I've seen many times), I wouldn't think it was that great. But, I know the original movie and it's really good. If you haven't seen it, I'm telling you that it's worth the time to watch. This movie really shows how great a director Paul Schr that is. He knows how to make a movie. I love to watch him. And the music is great, too. - December 20, 2006I love it!'  favorite favorite favorite  Review of: The Godfather Part II - January 7, 2006   Overall:  The film's title is a pretty good clue, isn't it? But the film itself is a great adaptation of the novel The God of Small Things by Mario Puzo. The movie itself is really the story of how the young Tony's life turned out after his father was killed in a car accident. This is an excellent film that is packed with action and good acting. This was a great film to see in the late 70's or early 80's, before they were all going the soft-porn direction. Overall a great movie. - January 10, 2006The film�s title is  Memorable moments:   Tony getting his first haircut  Alfonso saying that he knows what he's doing  Tony's first kiss  Chasing the girls   And of course, the infamous "The Godfather" sequence, which is one of the best scenes in film history.

The action scenes are good. There is a great ending that is very satisfying. I do have one complaint, but it is not really a complaint. The movie is a little long. I watched it in 2.5 hours.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I am so excited for the upcoming release of "Ender's Game". I am a big fan of the books and I love this movie. I loved the scene with Wachowski and Orson Scott Card. I love the fact that the movie is in 3D. It is my favorite 3D movie, I think. I also loved that the kids didn't want to get into the war because it would be boring. I think this is a great story, one that I will enjoy for years to come. I wish more kids were brought up to see this movie!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dang from I loved it! The movie was so good, I was happy it was on a TV in my room. It was my first time watching a movie in 3d, so I was a bit apprehensive. However, it was really good! It was funny, exciting, and I loved that they didn't over do the CGI. The action scenes were great. I especially liked the one when the kids go to get Ender's book and get lost in the bookshop. They are so excited to go to school and try to find Ender. I really thought that Ender and Asa would get along because they are very similar. I didn't know Asa was a boy until the end. It seemed like he was a girl at first, but then he says he is a boy. I am glad they didn´t overdo it and make the characters gay. The whole Ender and his brother were great!  of course, there are some scenes that I wasn't too fond of. The first one was when they go to the battle. The movie is really great, but I wish they could have kept a little bit of the dialogue a little longer. It wasn't long enough, but still enough to let the kids feel the tension of the moment. Also, it seems that the boys are a bit too close, so you don't feel as if you are watching a family.  The movie was great. The children's reaction to the war was perfect. There was a great sense of dread and danger that the children felt. The acting was excellent. The only problem was the CGI and it wasn't quite done right. It also looked like they added in too much of a lot of CGI at the end of the movie.  the kids were so smart and so resourceful and just amazing. :  I watched this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie in a small theater. It's a little bit like a mix between "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Godfather", and it has some great lines. The director has a lot of charisma and it's fun to see him in this movie. The acting is really good. It seems like there are only a couple of actors in this film, but the actors make it really good and there is a lot more to this movie than just some good acting. The movie is not perfect, but it's a fun movie.  I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie, but don't expect any great acting or a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'A Star is Born' (1940) This is a great example of how the medium could change, and in a good way. This was the very first feature length film by the great Buster Keaton. He had been a popular silent movie actor before this, but it is not clear if he was a silent or talker, but he was famous for his short films. Keaton had written and directed 'The Gold Rush' (1893) and 'A Star Is Born' was his second feature length silent film. 'A star is born' is the story of an aspiring actress who meets a young, rich playboy, and falls for him. In a very entertaining and funny film, Keaton plays the part of a man who is in love with a woman he met at a dance. The film is set in a rural town, and Keaton, the great character actor, makes this film as real as it gets. The music is a wonderful combination of traditional country tunes, jazz, and other styles, and the voice work is superb. The only complaint that I have is that the film is a little long, but that is because it takes a long time to tell the story. The second half is a lot of fun as the love story gets more interesting and the characters get more interesting.  I highly recommend this film, even if you don't know who Keaton is.  'Mama' (1945) This was a wonderful story of two lovers in a small town who are separated by a war. The story is told by a woman who has lost her husband to the war. It was a big success in Germany and it was even translated to a large German film. This film is not a love story at all, but rather a tragic story of how one man can ruin a family.   A Man and His Dog (1945-1950) In this great story, a man falls in love and has a dog. This is the first film of George Cukor. This story has many different characters and a great pace that makes it very exciting and fast paced. It is also a very funny story with a great sense of humor. The plot is a bit complex, but there is a very good sense of character development in the story and it is well paced. The characters are so well developed that the movie is very entertaining.  This is one of the most famous American films of all time. The great character actors like Humph

I mean, who can forget the scene where all the girls get into the shower together and talk about how they have no idea what's going on? It was such a great little moment that was perfectly written and executed. The other two jokes were very funny too, but the best part of the movie was definitely the ending. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you're trapped in a room with the guys from "The Big Lebowski", this movie has a funny ending for you! This is a great movie, and a funny movie.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Oct 22, 2017 By mikefett. - Verified Buyer 2/6/2017 I am going to take a little time to review this movie because it is a masterpiece and so are the performances. It is a story about a man named Michael (Kevin Bacon) who was left by his wife in a mental institution after he had a mental breakdown. He had two kids with her, one of which is a beautiful young woman named Rachel (Emily Blunt). Rachel is a doctor in her own right and Michael feels she doesn't understand what she is dealing with and that he can't control his mind. She is an outcast and so is Michael, so he decides to break out of the institution. They travel to Europe and find themselves in a hotel in a town where everyone has just disappeared. Rachel's parents have already left and the hotel is deserted. Michael is able to convince a man to help him and they begin to work together. It's a very different take on a familiar story. It was well written, it's a great story and it is very well acted by the two leads. I thought this movie was very well done and was worth watching. This is a must watch for any horror fan.  Rated 5 out of 5 by RONIN5 from Excellent! I was watching this on Netflix a few weeks ago and thought to myself, "wow, this movie is pretty good. I like the story. The movie has a good twist at the end." I am not a fan of horror movies but this was a good one. The acting was really good. There was a little bit of blood but that's what you expect when you see a vampire. The only thing I disliked about the movie was that at one point I didn't see a body. It took a while to find one. I just thought it was odd. Other than that, it was good! I don't know if I'll see it again but if I did, I would watch it again.  the vampire in this movie... I really wish they would have made a sequel. it was awesome. It just has to happen...

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "There are only three words in the English language which are never more true than when used in reference to a movie: it's good, it's bad, and it's ugly. You can't go wrong with 'The Dark Knight'. It is a movie like no other. It is so good and so bad. The movie has its own set of rules, its own logic and it has its characters like no one else can. It's like being in a game of chess and then the pieces start moving. When the game begins, you realize the game is over. It has no pretense. There is no 'I need you' or 'I'm going to make this difficult for you' because you can't make anything difficult for the viewer. There's no 'good' or bad guy. There are only two actors and they do what they do because it's the only thing they can do. It doesn't matter if you're a good person or a bad person. It just matters that the actor is playing the part. It can be a good actor or a good character, and that's what the film is about. It may not be the most sophisticated film of the year, but it's one of the best. I think it's important for people to see a movie with an intelligent, intelligent script and not a script that is just a bunch of junk. The script has a real message and a message that can be taken to heart. It isn't just a movie. It speaks to all of us.

The film starts with a spaceship landing on Mars, and then they get the whole thing back together and go back to Earth.    But this movie is set a long time ago.  This movie is about a group of people that are trapped on Mars.  They are not allowed to leave, and so they do everything they can to stay alive.  The movie is very well acted and it looks like a very good movie.   I really liked it, especially since it is a classic science fiction film.  I did not see the movie because of the high ticket price, but it was worth the price and I highly recommend this movie for anyone that likes science fiction.  I would not say that the movie is good, but I did enjoy it.  If you have the chance to see this movie then I recommend it. 3.5 out of 5 stars " The last days on Mars" is a movie about a colony that is trapped on the planet Mars. There are a lot of different types of people on this colony that all have different ideas on how to survive on the red planet.  Some are fighting with each other, others are looking for food, and some are looking to help one another.  At the end of the movie the colony is free to go back and to start over on Earth.   This movie has a lot to offer to sci fi fans, and if you like space exploration, then you will definitely enjoy it!   I give it a 3.5 star rating. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Rocketeer is an awesome movie that is really well made.  It has some great action scenes and the action scenes are great and you get to see a few different kinds of action. Â The movie is also a great look at the early part of the space age.    The movie is a fun little movie about a kid named Rocketeers that are trying to save the world from the evil aliens.  They are also doing a mission to Mars.  This movie is really cool.  I really like it.  You get to watch this movie over and over again.  If you like old school Sci-Fi movies then this movie is for you.     If you are a fan of the 80's action movies then you will like this movie.  The movie also has a great plot and the story is very good.  This movie is based on a story by Roger Corman (yes, the same guy who made Predator) and he made this movie for a couple of reasons.  He wanted to make a cool sci-fi movie for the 80s and he wanted to try and get the film made by making it like the movie Predator was made (which I really liked).   The director of this movie was Michael Rooker.  Rookers is a really good actor and the movie has some of the best action scenes I have ever seen in a movie. The movie takes place in the late 80s or early 90s so the movie is not that good. The story is really good and it shows the early years of space flight and the problems that the first astronauts had.  It is also really funny and the humor really fits the movie.    The actors all do a great job and the production value of this film is really nice.  Also, the music is very interesting.  Overall, this is a great movie.

I enjoyed the scenes in the library with the little boy and the dog. I was really scared in the beginning when the little girl was trying to run away from the ghost but it didn't take long for me to get over it. I hope they make a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was good, in a good way. I had never heard of it before I saw it. I found it interesting that it was a movie about the war of 1812 and the war on drugs. It was the beginning of the war and it was also the beginning for the drugs. When it came to the war it seemed that we were all kind of sick with what we had been doing. I think the reason that the drug use came about was the war. It made the country sick and then the war got worse and the drug was used to get money. There was also a lot of sex. It seemed that everyone was having a lot. There were a lot more women and the men were having a hard time too. There is a lot going on and it is a good story about the people that were there. It is good to see that there was a war and a lot happened in that time. The movie was a good representation of the era. It really is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I would recommend this movie to everyone. The story and characters are interesting. It's a well-told story. I was amazed by the way they portray the life of a poor man. He is an ordinary man who just wants a little help to get out of a very hard situation. The movie is well-written. It has the right balance between comedy and drama. The characters are well-drawn. The cinematography and soundtrack were also excellent. I thought this movie was a very good story. It shows how one man's dream can be a great tragedy.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My Friend Dahmer  is the story of David Berkowitz (Jack Nicholson) and his life. In the early 80's, David is a college kid with a bright future ahead of him, but things soon change when he gets arrested for the brutal murder of a young boy. During his trial, the state of New York uses psychological profiling and the testimony of his best friend to convict him. He gets 20 years for the crime and is sent to a psychiatric hospital. He is there for a while and his friends try to convince him that he is a monster. When he's released he tries to rejoin society. While in the hospital he meets a young girl named Linda (Bianca Lawson) and they fall in love. She helps him find a job and they start a new life. Then one night the police come and arrest him for the murder of the boy. He's sentenced to death and is given a choice between execution or life in a mental hospital. In prison he gets help from two fellow inmates who have escaped and plan to help him escape. But when they are caught they are sentenced to life in prison as well. But a new inmate shows up and he's not like the other prisoners. He has a past, a violent past. He knows the location of where David Berkowyn's body was found and he wants him to be the one who kills him. Written by John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. __________. ____.  The most impressive film I saw this year is a short documentary by Michael Moore. It's called "Where to Invade Next" and it tells the story of how the United States of America is going to invade the rest of the world. It is based on his book "Where's the rest from America: The Coming Destruction of Our Country." I saw it in New York and it was a great show. The movie is divided into three sections: The United States. The War. The Economy. The United Nations. The main thing I learned from this movie is that the United Nations is a farce. This movie is really important for all Americans because it shows us what our future may be like if we do not stand up to the United Nation. I don't think it will be a peaceful one. And if you want to see an even better movie that shows how much the United State government is out of control you should watch "The Corporation." It's a short movie but the truth about the United Statess is revealed. The video clip that I watched was the last part of the film. It explains how the corporate interests are trying to take over the world, not only in the United Sates, but in the rest othe world as well. I found this movie to be very informative and disturbing. The other two movies that I saw were both in London. One was a documentary about the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The other one was a movie about the financial situation in Europe. I watched the second movie in the afternoon and watched it in a large cinema. It was very disappointing because it's just the same old things: The government wants to increase taxes, people don't have enough money, the banks are too big, there's a lack of jobs, etc. I didn't even find it interesting. This is not a very interesting movie. I saw the film because I saw Michael Moore on the news in a very similar movie a few months ago. It seemed that the people who watched Michael Moore were a bit more informed. But that's okay because there's still a lot of good documentaries out there. I'm looking forward to watching some new ones. This is what the people want, but it's the government that says "no." It has been happening for decades, but we are about to make it a reality.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* I've been a fan of Steven Spielberg since I was a teenager, and the movies I loved most in my teens and early 20s were Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., Jaws, Close Encounter, and Jurassic Park. When I heard that Spielberg was making a movie about a woman named Lucy who was the only woman in the world who could make her boyfriend fall in love with her (it was called E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial), I knew I had to see it. I was very skeptical when the film first came out, but I loved the movie. Spielberg's movie has many of the same elements that I loved in the other films I've mentioned (like a man and a woman who have to make a sacrifice, and a couple who are in love, and two people who are able to communicate telepathically, etc). I really think that Spielberg is the best movie director of our time, and I think that this movie was a good addition to his list. My only criticism of the movie is that the movie does not have enough sex. The movie has some great action scenes and suspense, but there was very little sex. I think this movie could have used a few more sexual scenes to make it better. Also, it would have been nice if the woman who was in love and was making the sacrifice could have been played by a woman, like a Catherine Zeta-Jones, because that would have added to the drama of the story. I also felt that Spielberg had made a little too much of the fact that the man's name is Frank. I've never understood why Frank doesn't have a name. Maybe the name was changed because Spielberg thought that the audience would not know the name. This is just my opinion, but when the movie starts and the man asks the woman what his name is, it makes it seem that the woman has no name. It seems like a bit of a cheap gimmick that I think should have been left out. Also at the end of the film, when the woman says her last words, she asks the man, "What is his name?" and he says, "It's Frank." The ending of the woman's story is a little confusing, but that is just a nit. This movie really is a good one, and one of my favorite Spielberg films.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How do you make a movie with a lot of action, with a great soundtrack and a story about a guy trying to make a difference in the world? That is one of the questions I asked myself as I watched the film. I did not know that this movie would have such a great effect on me. It is a movie about a young man who wants to make the world a better place, but he has a lot in his past that keeps him from achieving this goal. And in this film, we are introduced to the most interesting and interesting character: the young guy who wants things to be different. The movie deals with many important issues: poverty, racism, the problems of a society where money is the most important thing, the effect of violence on society, the meaning of freedom, the moral code, the question of morality and religion. As a result, I was reminded of the movie "Dirty Harry" (1971). This movie is one that is not about a hero, but a guy who has no choice but to be a hero. And this guy is very intelligent and very intelligent about the world he lives in. It would have been nice if the movie had been longer. It feels like it could have been longer if they had added more scenes, but the movie is so great that I don't care about the length. As I said before, I watched this movie when I was a teenager, and I watched it again when I got older. The themes are very present in this movie. I do not know if this movie is a great film, but it is one I will watch over and over again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ My rating for this film is a "B" It is a film with some great visual effects and some great acting. This movie had me thinking about what it would be like if it were to be about the "real life" of a young boy who was kidnapped by a man called Bob. This man has a dark past and has a habit of using children in his twisted games. This film was a very moving and disturbing story and was a real eye opener. The only negative is that it felt a little long and too long at that. It was just too long. It would be much more enjoyable to watch in a shorter length. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good horror film. _________________________________ (Starring: George C.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Halo 3 is a great movie. It's not perfect, but it's good. I mean, if you're a fan of the Halo universe, then you'll probably love it. But if you don't like the Halo franchise, I'd recommend that you skip this movie. I've only seen it once, but the whole thing feels rushed and a bit of a chore to get through. I'll admit, I was kind of a fanboy about the first two films in the series. It was so fun to play as Master Chief, and I loved seeing him fight against the Covenant. The action was great, and there was even a little bit of humor in it. The story was great too, and was a great use of the original Halo universe. Unfortunately, the third film does a lot to make me dislike this series. First of all, the story is all over the place. The events of the first film happen over a few weeks, and the second one is a year later. This movie doesn't really have a proper beginning, middle, and end. It feels as though it's just jumping around in time, but then again, that's a Halo movie after all. I guess that's what makes it so much better than the previous films, since there's so much more to learn about Master Chief. Secondly, the character of Master Chief has changed so much in the past three movies. He's become a much more mature character in each movie, and it really shows in this movie, since he really seems to have grown up and matured over the years. But he still has his goofy moments and his childish jokes. This is also something that I'm not too big on in the Halo series, and something that could've been avoided. It may be a bit much to ask for, but at least make it less of a big deal. The movie has its good and bad points. But overall, I think it's a great film. If you love the Halo trilogy, then I recommend this movie to you. If not, then go watch something else.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   It's hard to pick a good scene in the movie, because it's all over the place. It's all in the way that the characters are being presented and how the events of the movie are being told. It starts out with a very dark and scary beginning of a new character, and the next few chapters are a lot more light and fun. The movie isn't perfect. There's a lot of violence and sex, but there's also some really bad dialog and acting in some scenes. And it has a lot going on at once. It would be nice to see a couple of scenes cut or cut out.   The movie was great. It was really creepy, and had a lot to say about life, the world, and what it really means to be human.   a good film with some serious issues.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ (The following is an excerpt from the book The Good Movie: How the Arts and Entertainment Industry Promote Good Behavior by Stephen D. Rivele) "I saw 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' when I was 12. I'd heard about it from my aunt. She said it was one of the greatest movies of all time. I remember being absolutely riveted by its portrayal of the U.S. Civil War and the violence that accompanied it. It was as though I'd just seen a scene from a war movie in a foreign country. The only thing I remember from it was the scene in which the main character, Johnny Utah, is killed by a Confederate sniper." "The Good News Club is a group of boys who are sent to a private school in upstate New York to learn how to be good citizens, as they are told. It's a strange, odd, and sometimes frightening place. They live in a house in the middle of nowhere, where all the boys and girls are locked up together in a common room. The boys are constantly under the watchful eye of a strict, stern, yet gentle headmaster, who takes a very dim view of the boys' drinking and drug use. It is a world of cruelty and fear. I was completely taken in by this novel and by the character of the headmaster. He is a true character, not to be trifled with." "I went into the movie theater and it was a wonderful experience. The movie was fantastic. The acting was fantastic; the music was great. It brought back memories of the old movies I used to watch as a child." "You're a good, bad, and ugly boy in this film. You're not a bad boy; you're an ugly boy." (From a letter to the author, April 30, 1991) "My favorite part was when the boy was shot in the head, the bullet exiting through his head. The shot made it look like he was just dead. He was not shot and died instantly. He died in front of his classmates. The students were so excited that they cheered and cried. It really brought back some good memories of when I used my mother's gun to shoot ants. I'm glad I never did that." "My wife and I have a very large collection of books and other material, and we've been keeping a record of the movie we saw. I saw 'Titanic' last night. It

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********The most memorable scene in the film is when a cop (Robert Blake) is looking for the person who shot the man. As he runs, he runs into a young girl, a girl who he had seen earlier in a diner. She has no idea what he is looking at, and she doesn't understand that she has the same name as the girl he had killed. The girl has a very similar appearance to her. As they run, the girl asks him "Do you know me?" "No," he replies. "You're different." She tells him her name is Jessica and she's a waitress. She says she's never seen the man before and she never knew him. They run across a field and he runs off in the direction of a gas station. A few minutes later, the man comes out of a van and starts shooting at them. He shoots the girl, then he shoots the cop. The two run and he shoots at the cops, killing both of them. The man then turns his gun on the girl and kills her. She screams and the camera lingers on her as she looks down at her bloody body. The scene is very well done and shows the effect that violence has on people and the world around them.**********
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I had never heard of this movie before watching it, but when I saw that it was in the list of "must see" films, I knew it was the one for me. The movie is set in the 20s and is about a Jewish family that is about to move into a new house. It is the last week of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur and the family has just received a tip that a mobster named "The Wolf" is in their new home and is planning to kill them. A friend of the family is a police officer who tries to talk the Wolf out of doing it, and is the one who gives the family a gun to defend themselves. When the Wolf gets the gun and is going to kill the family, the officer goes to the kitchen and pulls out his own gun and shoots him, saving the family. The only problem is that the Wolf's body was not there and the police officer is now suspected of being involved in the killing. It was just a great movie with a great story.  No rating

What happens next is the most interesting part of the film. When we first meet them, the guy who gets hit by the car is the main character, but by the end of the movie, we see him become a different character. The other characters are very well done, and the ending is very well written. I also like how it is not only a good story but also has a good cast of characters. If you are looking for a good action movie, then I would highly recommend this film. It has a great ending and a good plot."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "The film does not get off to a good start. The camera goes off into the woods for a long time, and that's a real problem. Then, when they show the main characters, we're just sitting around. And when the main character shows up and they tell us that she's a doctor, and we're like, 'Wait a minute...,' the camera stays on her all the time. And then we see her walking across the lot, and the camera's off. And we see the people that are with her, and they're walking around. But she's still in the background. And they get out of the car and she's walking with them. And she has the big sunglasses, and then the camera is off, and so is she. And I'm sitting there thinking, 'Why am I watching this?' I mean, she's in the back of the limo. They're in the limousine, they're driving down the lot. And what's going on here? And she's just sitting there. And it was just so long of a sequence.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________   The film has a very low Rotten Tomatoes rating, but I think it's a pretty decent movie with some good performances. The movie is based on a true story about a young man (Jared Leto) who was sent to live with his grandparents in New Orleans. He was adopted by a family and was the only boy. After two years, his adoptive parents were murdered by a man named Charlie Manson. In the following years, he lived in an abandoned house and became a drug dealer. He also went to prison for many years and has some serious problems with the police. The film was shot in a very dark and realistic way. The music is a bit off and the cinematography is very good. The story is well told and the movie is a very interesting one. I think that it has some potential to become a classic.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A great movie. I have seen the original one, but this is a nice follow-up."  -T.M. I watched this movie with my daughter when we were both in our teens. I was only a few years older than her at the time, but I had a huge crush on the young lady in the movie. We were in a local movie theater watching a classic film called "The Great Escape" and I remember feeling so proud to be a part of it. The movie opened with the main character in the middle of a jail cell, which I remember so well, because it was my first time in a jail. When the movie ended, I was so happy that my crush had been released from jail. This movie has some great scenes, like the one where the prisoner is told that they will be sent to a mental hospital if they do not tell the authorities where he hid the money. I also remember seeing the scene where the nurse is giving a young boy a shot of morphine for a stomach ache, and then tells him that he must keep the medication a secret because his mother will be upset if she finds out. The scenes in the prison were also very cool. The prisoners were all really scary looking. I loved how the movie never gave any explanation of what was going on. The only explanation I ever heard was that the inmates were all murderers and they were trying to escape.  There were some really cool scenes, but it was the ones in the hospital that really got to me.  One of my favorite scenes in this movie: the one in the "mental hospital"

I don't even remember seeing the movie. But my mom did watch it. She was just like all of the other parents. They went in expecting to see a horror movie. What they got was a horror film that is as real as you can get. I would say this movie was not as well made as "The Exorcist". I think the director of this movie could have used more help from the actors and he had a difficult time getting his point across. This movie was just too real to be scary. But the movie was worth a watch. I am not sure if the book that was used to create this movie is true. But I was glad that I got to see it and give my opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that this is a really good movie.  It was well made and really funny.  This is the third film of this series.  I liked the last one.  Now this is the most serious film.  The story is very good and you get to know the characters a lot better.  We see how people react when they have a bad day.  Everyone is having a good time and laughing.  That makes this a very good movie too.  All the characters are really well developed.  You get to see how each one of them feels and how they react to the situation.  They all have their own unique way of doing things.  And when you look at the characters you really get to understand how they feel.  One of the main characters is an idiot.  She is the one who is not going to be able to do anything.  So she goes to the doctor and she does not want to do it.  But she does.  Her mother comes in and she is so happy that her daughter is healthy.  At the end of the movie you see that she is really happy.  In fact, she says that she was glad that she had it. A great movie and I liked it a lot.  If you like movies like this, I suggest that you go to this movie.

I know he has his own life, but I miss him so much! I can't wait until I can see him again! ___________ _________ ____________ My husband and I met at a church potluck dinner. We married within a few weeks, but after a few months I had to leave him. We had been married a few years and we had never had a serious fight. I was tired of the fighting and I felt like I had lost the fun of being with him. After a few more months of trying, I decided to leave. I thought it was time to get some distance from my husband. It was a difficult decision. I didn't want to let him down. I wanted to get my life on track. I decided I had enough. I told my husband I would be moving out. We have been married for 10 years and have had our ups and downs. I am tired of being in love with him and it's been killing me. He is very good to me. We were trying to figure out how to have a life without fighting. I felt as if I had no life and he didn't know how to love me. The fighting had been a problem for a long time. He always said he loved me and that I was a good woman. He said we were making a great couple. He also said I was smart and had a good personality. We both had a few problems at work, but they were minor. I had been through a divorce and I had a lot of anger. He was good to work with. We worked on our marriage and got through the separation. We didn't argue or argue a lot. He got to spend more time with his family and he helped me. My friends and family thought we were a great match and they told me so. It felt like we had always been together. After the divorce I couldn't do it anymore. I just wanted to leave my husband and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Video Not Working Not working on your PC? Here's a fix. Play the video above.  It's not clear what caused the video to disappear from YouTube. It's not like the video is going to go unnoticed. The last time a video of a woman being brutally beaten was taken down by YouTube was after it went viral in June. The video was taken from a surveillance camera inside a New York City subway station and shows a woman in her early 20s being attacked by an assailant. She is heard screaming, "No, no, no!" as the man tries to hit her in the face and head with a bag. The assailant, who also appears to be filming the attack, can be heard saying, "Get the f--- out of here!" The video has been viewed more than 5 million times. The woman's face is covered by a dark veil and she is being attacked with a large metal object. She falls and is eventually helped to her feet. The man continues to beat her with the bag as she cries, "Stop, stop!" "The video is so disturbing, it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen," wrote user "LolitaLovesLol." "I feel like I have been raped." YouTube removed the video on Tuesday after The Associated Press requested a copy of the video under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. It wasn't clear whether the video had been taken down in response to a copyright claim or a request by the woman in the video. The AP was not immediately able to reach the woman for comment.  of the woman's appearance, the attacker can be seen wearing a white T-shirt and a black baseball cap. The attacker can also be seen using what appears to a metal object to hit the woman repeatedly in the head. The clip has been watched more than 2.5 million times, making it one of the most popular videos on YouTube. The New York Police Department said in a statement that the assailant was "an unidentified man in his 30s who fled the scene on foot." The man was described as being around 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing around 140 pounds, and with a thin build. The department said it was investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. "We will aggressively investigate and identify and arrest the individual responsible for this horrific act of violence. We will not tolerate violence or hate toward anyone," police Commissioner James O'Neill

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. __________. _________________.  I had high expectations of this film as it was one of the first big screen adaptations of a comic book by writer Grant Morrison. I was very excited about this film. It was my favorite superhero movie of the year and was great. The cast did a great job and the film was filled with action and humor. It also had a very interesting twist ending. I wish there was more of it. I would've loved to see the whole movie but they cut out about two thirds of it and it felt incomplete. If there is more I would have loved to watch it. It would've been a great movie to watch on Netflix with a bunch of other superhero movies and other great movies like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, and many more. It should have been a big hit with audiences and it definitely could've been. The main issue I have with this movie is that I was expecting more from the comic book source material. Morrison is a very talented writer but his adaptation of Batman into a film didn't feel as good as I hoped it would. The film had its moments but was missing the impact that I felt the source material had. The ending was also a bit anticlimactic. I don't know if it was because it was a comic movie or not, but it was really strange. The best part of the movie is the first act which is where the story really starts. This was also the best part because it's where the film really gets interesting. I think this would be a great film to watch with a group of friends. It has a lot of great action sequences. The movie has a nice cast of actors and the music was great and really brought the film to life. The first act of the film is great and you don't want to miss the rest of it because it is where all the action and comedy happen. I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Wicker Man"   is a fine film that, in the hands of someone else, would be an excellent film. In the hands (of director Wes Anderson, who makes this a wonderfully enjoyable ride) it is a masterpiece.   Anderson's film is a story about a group of strangers living in a cabin in the woods.   One night they are attacked by a giant, wolf-like creature that has taken the form of a giant white-furred, furry creature.   The wolf attacks the strangers in a way that makes them realize that the creature is not a monster.  But the wolf is more than a beast: it is also a kind of god.  And the people in the cabin realize that if they let this creature loose on the world, it will destroy all that they hold dear.  I found this film to be very imaginative and creative.  It has a lot of great visuals, great sound, and very good acting.  And it's worth watching!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ "The thing about being a director is you're not really the guy in charge of the show, you're just the guy with the phone. You're the guy who goes in, talks to the actors, gives them their lines and then you have to sort of clean up, and if you screw it up you just have to keep going until it all works." – Steven Soderbergh _______________________________ This is one of the best films I've seen this year. The cinematography, the acting, the direction, the cinematography in general is great. It's a great combination of comedy and drama. The story is very well thought out and it's a real character study. It takes place in a post war world. A world where the only reason people are alive is because they are in the army, or are soldiers. In the army you are not allowed to get married or have a family. It is the only place you will find love. The only time you will get to have a normal life is when you are in combat. You will be fighting for the most ridiculous reasons imaginable. You'll be doing some crazy thing that no one can comprehend. The characters are very well written and you get to understand them very well. There is a very real sense of desperation in the world. We all know that it is a messed up place and the main characters are no different. They have a hard time. They are very unhappy and confused. They can't help but think about all of the people that they've killed and all of those that they can't save. The acting is fantastic. The whole cast is very good. The performances are very human and you can feel the frustration of the characters. The best part of the movie is the ending. It shows a very human side of the military. The film shows what life is like on the front lines. The main characters don't have much in the way of happy endings. They all have some sort of sadness in them. The ending is heartbreaking and it makes me feel all of that. _________________________ "I am a very happy man, and I love to have people around me." - Jack Nicholson ____________________________ I am not sure if this is a comedy, drama or a horror movie.

I will have the ability to see that God's love is greater than my own." -- John F. Kennedy "The greatest gift that a man can give his fellow man is his life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Rock (1979) The Rock is a fantastic movie. It's the movie that I've always wanted to see.  It's the first Rocky movie and it was directed by Sylvester Stallone.  I'll be honest, I was not expecting a Rocky movie when I first saw Rocky in theaters.      I was pretty happy with Rocky IV, which I enjoyed.  But the movie was not that good.  I didn't think the story was that good and the ending was not what I wanted.  When I saw Rocky I was very happy and I thought that the sequel to Rocky IV was going to be good. But it wasn't.  It was a good script, the story and the acting was okay, but the ending just didn't work for me.  There's a reason that the movie is considered a classic and that's because of the good story.  The story starts with Rocky's father telling his son that the reason that he can't win a gold medal is because he's not ready.  He tells him that he has to put in the hard work to get his first gold medal.  His father tells him about how Rocky once got his first medal by working hard.  So when Rocky comes to his father and says he can do this, Rocky's dad gives him a piece of paper.  On the paper is a letter to the Mayor of Philadelphia.  Rocky tells his father that he needs to win the gold medal by putting in the work.  This letter is then given to Rocky by the Mayor and the movie continues.  By the end of the movie we see Rocky trying his hardest to win his first Gold medal and he's doing so.  For those of you who like to watch a great Rocky movie, you'll enjoy this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!  - I liked this movie so much. It had an interesting plot, and it was very funny. And I loved the characters. There was a really funny scene where we see two of the main characters at a party. They are sitting in a corner talking, and one of them says, "So, what are you guys up to tonight?" And he says, "...I'm just going to sit here and watch TV, and wait for the right moment to ask you out." And the other one says, ""So, how many girls are you going to bang tonight?" and he says "I'm going to just sit here...and wait for a perfect time." And they both laughed. And it was great. It was very original.  Also, I enjoyed the movie. I think this movie is very funny, and I thought it was well done.  and the best part about it was when the guy is telling his friend about the date. He says that they should go to a place called "The Village" and he tells the guy what to wear and what to do and he starts dancing and the guy thinks he's going to get a girl, but the guy doesn't think so because he's not a dancing type.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** 'The Last Waltz' is a superb romantic film with an incredible plot, but it is also an extremely flawed film. A true story of two lovers who fall in love and then are forced to part. The film is full of beauty and romance and is an extremely good film to watch. But as much as I love this film it is one of those films that has the potential to be amazing. There is no plot and the story is told in a very natural way. The story revolves around two lovers, Tom and Judy, who are separated by a political event. Tom is a young man who is about to enter the Civil Service, a very prestigious position, while Judy is a retired nurse. Tom's brother, who is a Civil Service official, has been very kind and supportive to Tom, and it has given Tom the motivation he needs to go into the Civil Services. When Tom enters the Civil Servie he finds out that he has a new lover, an older man who has just married his young wife. The older man is very kind to Tom and gives him a job, but when Judy is forced to leave the house with Tom he begins to feel abandoned by the older man. The two lovers begin to love each other and then slowly fall in with the system. They find work in the Civil Administration and then when they get there their love grows stronger as the system seems to protect them. However they are caught by the new president, a man who wants to abolish the Civil Administration. He wants to get rid of them so that he can make way for a more efficient system. Tom and his lover are forced out of the Civil Adminstration and the old man is arrested. Tom must now decide whether to stay with his lover and fight for his civil rights or stay and face the consequences. 'The last Waltz', as I mentioned above is a very good film, but as it goes on it becomes less interesting and less exciting. I thought the film had some potential, but the ending was just so unsatisfying and the characters were too flat and uninteresting. If you love a good romantic story, then this is a film you should definitely see. If not, then you should just stick with the plot and not get lost in the emotional parts of the film.  …

I think the movie would have worked better if it was more comedy than horror. I was watching it in the theater and my wife saw it too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Road" A great film from the 1970s.  The story is about a man who is hit by a car while walking home from work.      The car was speeding down the highway at more than 70 mph.    Luckily the car was stopped before the man was killed.  I think the best part about this film is the fact that it is a true story.  A friend of the victim, who was in the passenger seat at the time, was able to tell the police the name of the car and the driver.  They were able to track down the driver and they were prosecuted for manslaughter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ Do not buy this movie. If you don't like horror movies you probably don't want to buy this one. You'll be sorry if you do. If not, go see it in a theater with a couple of friends and enjoy. I highly recommend watching this on a big screen TV with surround sound. If the sound is too low then you won't enjoy it. This movie was made in 1999. This is a remake of the original film which was released in 1978. I remember seeing it in the theaters and loving it. It was scary and had a great storyline. In the new movie they went a different route and went for a less creepy and more comedic approach. The new film is better in my opinion but if you're looking for something different then this might be for you. This remake is a very good time. I really hope they don't remake it again because it was a masterpiece. Watch this movie on a TV with sound and you'll be happy you did.

I'm a big fan of David Cronenberg and had to see this one. The pacing and storytelling in this film are incredible. The story is great and Cronenberg does a great job with this film. The plot of this film was a twist on the vampire film. This is the kind of film that you want to see but don't know if you want it. I highly recommend this film and look forward to more from David Cronenburg. _______________ __________ ________ ________  This movie was a nice change from my usual genre. David Cronin's film takes a look at the world of vampires and gives us an intriguing look at how these creatures come to be. The vampire films are not as popular as the vampire novels. It takes a different approach and gives you a different look at what these creatures are really about. The acting from the cast was great and gave the film an edge. This movie will probably be one of my favorites from this year. _____ ___________ ________|  David Cronenberg is one of the greatest film directors ever. His films have always been amazing and this one is no exception. He makes a perfect film that captures the essence of what makes vampires so frightening. The atmosphere of the movie is dark and creepy and I absolutely loved the ending. This film is the best vampire movie ever and I highly suggest seeing it. _______ ______________________ ____ _______

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" is a great little film about a girl and her family who have moved to a little town called Dothan. It is a town that is populated mostly by old time cowboys and it has an old time railroad. This town is also known as "The Whore House" because of a whorehouse which is actually the town house and a whore who works there is the "whore house girl". The story begins with the little girl (the only character that is seen) going to school and is bullied by the other kids. Her mother takes her to a friend of her mother's and she meets a young boy who is the town mayor. The girl falls in love with him and begins to try and seduce him. The first scene is with the girl in the whorehouse and the boys are there to see the whore house girl. It looks like a good scene until the whore girl goes to work and the whole gang turns on her. They try to have sex with her but she refuses and they are forced to watch. She is raped and tortured. The next day she is forced to give a "blow job" to the mayor who then uses her to get a job in the local whorehouse. The townspeople are not happy about it and one day the mayor is murdered and the whores are put in jail. The two girls decide to run away and go back to the whorehouses. They end up in a town of whores and they make a life of it. This is the only movie that I have ever seen where the whore girls get the girl's first name and her real name is not given. It makes me sad that it was left out. But it makes it even more sad that the girl is never seen again. It would have made it better if it was the other way around. A lot of people have criticized the "Whorehouse Girl" for being a porn film and for not being real. I disagree with this and think that it is a good film. There are some parts of it that are not as well shot as other movies and there are some things that are made up. However, it is still a good little film and is worth watching. I really like this movie because it is just about the little people in a small town. It shows that the little girls that work in the whoring houses are the ones who get the good jobs in the town.

I love to watch him directing a film. - The actors are always the best in the world. This is the case with all of the cast. The only thing is that the story of the film is a little slow. It seems that the whole story is about a little boy, who is not allowed to play in the woods. So he goes in the forest to play. I loved the way this movie shows a little kid, who never gives up. It shows him as a happy kid, playing in the forests. It made me think that we have to stop and see the world around us. - It's a good way to get into the character of Jack. He is the most likable character in the movie. - A good movie. I recommend it to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  If you are looking for a horror film, then you must see this. This film is great and has a lot of scares. It is one of the best horror films out there. If you like gore and horror then you will love this film. There are some weird and great scenes in this film and the director does a great job with it. The story is great. You see a group of people going to a small town. It seems like it is a normal small town but then you find out that there is a killer in the town. The town has a strange past and strange creatures. The killer seems to be a witch that lives in the woods and she is killing the people of the town because she is jealous of her lover. The characters are interesting and make you want to see what will happen. There is a lot going on in this movie and it makes you feel like you are in a horror movie. The movie has some funny moments too. There's a scene that has a girl go out to eat at a restaurant and there is this girl who is very thin. The waitress gives her a hard time because she didn't want her to eat there because of her weight. I love the idea that this waitress is trying to protect her from her lover because she's thin and he is fat. The girl is a witch, too, because she can turn into a woman. She has a really great body and a great attitude. There was a scene where a guy is at a party and there are a bunch of girls at the party and they are all having fun. He goes over to one of them and she turns into a witch. The scene was a lot better than the movie. It wasn't scary or weird. It was just a cool scene. The music was great too. It has a good mix of rock and rock songs. The acting was great. The guy is very believable and he has a great character. There were also some other good actors in the movie but I'll talk about them later. Overall, I thought this movie was great and I enjoyed it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ If you have to ask "is it a good film?", then yes, it is. You can't get better than this. A masterpiece of cinema, the film is based on a book, "In the City of Lost Children" by Agatha Christie. The movie is based around a young girl, who is the daughter of a wealthy English businessman. The girl has been brought up as a virgin, and as a result she lives a sheltered life, with no contact with the outside world. She has an aunt who comes over to visit her, but she is not allowed to see her. After her aunt is murdered, and the police have been tipped off to her murder, she goes to a hotel and stays there for a few days, while her aunt's body is being removed from the house. During this time, she is in the hotel room, and she hears strange noises. When she goes outside, she finds that a man has followed her and killed her aunt, and has gone to a nearby apartment. He is the killer, and is looking for the girl, but when he comes across her, he has no interest in her. However, she soon discovers that the killer has had an unusual fascination with her, and tries to get away. But she has been trapped in this hotel room with the killer for three days, and while she tries to escape, she has no choice but to find out who he is. The film was shot in Italy in an ultra-realistic style, with the most realistic use of light and shadow. It was made at a time when cinema was becoming very popular, and was very popular with the American audience. The cinematography and the use of lighting and shadows was very well done, and many of the actors had to go through training for several years, because they were so inexperienced in doing the film. They would be very inexperienced with modern movies, and in order to achieve the desired effect they had to use techniques that were completely different from what they were used to. Many of the young actors had never been in a big movie before, and when they went on to do more of them, they had no idea how to act in the big movie style. However these young actors did a fantastic job of acting in this film, and it is quite an entertaining film to watch. The story is a little complex, but is well worth the time it takes to watch it. If you are looking for a good thriller with a good plot and a
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Good _________________________________________________ The story follows a father and his young daughter, who live in the rural American Midwest. The father is a carpenter and the daughter is a schoolteacher. The family has been living together for decades. The daughter, being the older of the two, is always looking for a better life for herself and her family. She and her parents are constantly fighting, but this time it is over the father's new wife. She was only 14 when they married. The mother's relationship with her son has been strained since he was a boy, but now they have a good relationship. The son is in love with the woman who is taking his mother away from him. They spend time together and the mother becomes very attached to the boy. When the wife and son return home, they have another fight. The wife is now a single mother. Her husband is not well enough to work, so she is taking care of the child and raising him. In the last scene, we see the boy and his mother being taken away by the woman's boyfriend. The good thing is that they have some good fun in their fight, and when the man goes home and finds out that his wife has taken the boy, he doesn't get angry. He takes care of his son, and makes sure that the child gets a good education. The Good: _________ The script is very good. It is well-written and is well told. The story is simple and the characters are realistic. The characters were very real and believable. I found the way the movie was shot very interesting and very beautiful. I was impressed with the way they kept the background from being so blurry that it was hard to tell what was happening. The movie was fun and very funny. The acting was great. The film has a great score. The cinematography was great and the colors were beautiful. The bad: ______________________________ I found that the movie had a lot of problems in the beginning, but these were fixed by the time I saw it. I think the problem was that there was so much going on in the movie that it got confusing and hard to follow. I don't know if the movie should have been longer, but it was too short. It could have had a few more scenes. The ending was good, but not very good because it seemed to leave out a lot. The whole movie just seemed to be missing. It had a great ending, but then I

I was a little skeptical when I saw the synopsis of the film. I know that some people hate this movie, but to me it is really entertaining. It is an interesting story with lots of action, twists and turns. It's very well written and the acting is pretty good too. There is a lot of suspense, but also some laughs. The story starts out pretty good but the movie gets more and more intense as it goes on. The ending was pretty good. I thought that it was a nice ending that you should give a try. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of action movies and thriller movies. ______________________________________________________________________________ The movie opens up with a man on a jet. He is in a position where he has to do something that will stop the war and save the world. He knows that he is the one and only man that can do this and so he is determined to do it. He takes the jet to the target, then gets on the plane, flies it and takes off. When he lands, he finds a bunch of other guys in suits with guns and badges and a bunch more of the government agents and tells them that he has just come to save the whole world. The man then decides to get on the bus and get to his target. It goes through a city with a bunch different locations. After traveling a lot, he gets to his destination.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** My brother and I had been looking for a new movie to watch, so we decided to check out this film. We didn't expect much. We got into it at a decent time. It is just about a high school girl that gets caught up in the world of the street hustlers. There is a pretty good plot line that goes in that direction. I found the girl in it to be cute, but not very convincing. The music was really good. I liked the ending. There was a pretty cool ending scene. It was nice to see a character that I thought I had seen before in the movies. The only problem is that the film is a little on the long side. It really does drag on for quite a while. I didn't like how the girl kept getting into situations and getting herself in trouble. There are so many other films that could have been made instead of this one. I am going to check it out again, just to see if they had a better ending. I was just glad that I was able to see it. *********************

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "Bourne Identity" was a good action movie, and it was a solid action movie. This movie is a bit different from the other Bourne movies, since it's based on a novel written by a British man, which means it is more realistic and more intense than the previous movies. However, it's still a good film, and the action is very good. You'll see some awesome fights, and there's some great action sequences. This film is very action-packed, and they didn't rush the movie at all. In fact, it took the time to show the story of the characters in their life before they were assigned to this mission. This makes it a bit slower and more dramatic, but that's a good thing, because the story is the most important part of the film. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a great story about two young men who get recruited to a terrorist organization, which is supposed to be fighting in Afghanistan. The two are given a car and a mission, and soon find themselves in Afghanistan fighting a different terrorist organization. This time, the two are in charge of a car that has a bomb inside. The car's only purpose is to make the terrorists believe that there are several soldiers inside, and this is the main mission of the movie. There's not too much to say about the story in this film, because it's very good and interesting. The characters in this movie are great. There are a lot of funny moments in this one, but there are also a lot to admire and learn from. There is a lot more action than in the previous Bourne films, and a lot better special effects. The whole movie is very fast paced and intense. The action scenes in this Bourne film are very good, and that's why I liked it so much. This is one of my favorite Bourne installments, and one of the best action movies ever made. If you like action, you'll like this one a lot. It's not as fast-paced as "The Bourne Legacy" or "The Expendables 3", but it's also not as slow-paced. This one is very realistic and intense, and you'll love it. Watch it with a great, dark, cool movie atmosphere. This will be a great movie to watch with a big, open area, and lots of people watching, because that will give you a lot a great action scenes. The soundtrack is amazing, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" (1994) -  The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a college dropout who gets a job in a local bar.  The manager (John Goodman) knows he's a "lebowski", but he doesn't care and gives the Dude a job anyway.  A year later, The Dude has to deal with a bunch of bums at the bar who are in a band called The Dude Abides.  He has to stop them from taking over his old job.  This film was made in 1994.  It's about a college professor (Jeffrey Jones) who starts taking a job as a bartender at a local dive called The Big Lebowksy.  He gets in a bar fight, and the bouncer (John Belushi) decides to quit and help out the Dude.   The Dude is the only person in town who knows the bouncers name.  This is the movie that started it all.  "The Biglebucky" was made with an R rating and was made to be seen by an R rated audience.  But it was very entertaining.  There was lots of profanity, but the guys didn't hold back.  In fact, the profanity was used sparingly, and for the most part was a bit off-putting to the average R rated viewer.  Jeff Bridges was great in this film, and he really brought out the character of The Dude.  But the main star was John Belushi, who brought out a great performance.  I think that the film is underrated, and I think it is probably one of the greatest films ever made.  The Biggest Lie:    "The Great Gatsby" (2005) -     "The Gatsbys" was a film that was made for the Gatsbye Brothers.  These two are a real band, and they wrote and recorded a lot of music in the 60's.  They made the film to show that their music was great, and it really is.  However, there is one part of the film that is a total lie.  For a brief moment, GatsBY says that his father was a rich playboy.   GatsBY was not the real GatsBros, and his father, Nicky, was a real playboy, and not wealthy.  It turns out that Nicky was a big
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "The movie is pretty much just about the film crew and their relationship. The story, which is told from the POV of one of the crew, is very well-written and I felt it captured the emotions of the characters and their situations well. The cinematography was also very good and the special effects were quite realistic. The only downside was that there was a bit too much of a romance element that just got in the way of the story and didn't make it that much better. There were also some scenes where the camera was going through windows to get shots and then went back to the crew on the ground. These scenes were somewhat distracting. Overall, this is a great film that is easy to watch and easy to enjoy."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie!  I really liked the direction and story.  There is a good mix of action, suspense and comedy. ______________________________________________________ "We are on the edge of the abyss, the abyss where we will never go back." The world of "The Abyss" is a dark one, with a dark, violent and dangerous world that exists below us, but above us, where the monsters and the gods live.    The gods are very jealous and angry, they have a very complex life.  The monsters are a very dangerous and aggressive creatures that have been imprisoned in the deep abyss and only a few of them are strong enough to be able to go back up and live in the world above.  This is a very interesting and unique world.  It has a very dark and disturbing plot.  In a way, it is a science fiction, a horror, and a fantasy, all in one.  However, "The abyss" has a lot of different genres, such as a horror movie, a science fantasy, a romance and a very good movie about love.  What a great story, which I was very surprised to see in a movie.  I hope that this movie will be a good success for the director.  "We are living in a world where the future is far from here. We have to fight for our future and for the future of our children."   The director, Robert Richardson, is an interesting man, a good director, a great director, who also makes interesting and creative films.  His films are very entertaining and very funny.  He knows how to make a good film.  If you have not seen this movie, you should watch it, because you will love it!   "The Apocalypse" is very interesting, it has a unique plot, with an interesting story, and some great characters.  Even though it is not a good horror movie (I think it is less scary than "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but it has more violence), it is still very interesting.  "A few weeks ago, we were all in a dark place, and now it's time to find a way out of this dark place." The story starts out with the death of a scientist who is working on an experimental machine to send a person back in time.  Unfortunately, he fails, but instead, he leaves a device in the body of a young boy, who goes back to the

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. __________. _____. (3/10) Movie: "A Better Life" This movie is a remake of a popular Korean TV drama. It was a bit hard for me to watch. The original drama is really good and it would have been better if this movie was a remake. The movie is mostly about the love triangle. I thought this movie could have been a remake but I would not watch the original drama again. I didn't really like the characters, especially the guy who played the part of the guy. I found it hard to watch the love scene. I felt like I was watching a soap. It seems like they are trying to make the character of the girl look more attractive but she doesn't really look attractive. Her body isn't beautiful and her face looks pretty. I liked the other girl in the movie and she was really cute. I would recommend watching this movie only if you like drama but not if you are looking for a good romantic movie. (2.5/10).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" is a movie about the war between the Mexican government and the forces of Francisco Franco, a.k.a. "El Cid." The story follows a Spanish officer who is assigned to help capture a bandit leader, but ends up becoming the villain himself.  The story is told in a way that makes it clear that the movie is a satire.  A scene from the film.  The story is about the two sides. The Spanish side consists of two armies led by General Castellano and General Montesinos, and the Mexican side is made up of the United States, a Mexican army, and various groups that have been fighting against Franco for decades.   The film is not a comedy.  Franco is portrayed as a ruthless dictator.  He has no interest in negotiating with the Mexican Government, and even threatens to send his troops into Mexico to seize the state of Texas.  As the film opens, Franco is trying to conquer Mexico by taking control of Mexico City and then taking the state capital, Mexico City.  But when he is confronted by a Mexican general, General Castillo, Franco refuses to surrender, and declares that he is going to capture the Mexican capital, as well.  And this is where the movie begins.  There is a scene where Franco and his men have captured the state capitol, Mexico.  After they capture the city, Franco and a few of his men attempt to leave through a nearby canal.  They are attacked by a group of guerrillas and eventually killed.   Franco's forces are then attacked by Mexican soldiers and eventually captured.  Then the movie switches to a scene that shows General Castilla as he sits down with General Montesa, the Mexican general.  Castilla talks about how he is tired of fighting Franco, but Montesa says that the only way for Franco to be defeated is for Franco himself to be killed.  So General Castillano and Montesino then make a deal: Montesano and Franco agree to a ceasefire if Castillo and the Spanish forces agree to leave Mexico City, as the city has been taken by Franco.   The ceasefire is not honored and the Mexicans are ready to fight again.   After some scenes of the Mexican army getting ready to attack, the scene switches to Franco and Montesa in a room talking.   Montesa tells Franco that he will take a small group of soldiers and attack Franco's

The acting is very good, with the exception of one scene where the lead guy is really not doing a very good job.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ A man's name is John Henry and he is the man who is supposed to be the savior of the world. He is the son of a poor farmer and has the most beautiful name ever, and a mother that he has never met. When John Henry was a young man, he was sent by his father to train in the woods to be a hunter. John Henry is always out in the forest, looking for his mother. When he is in the town of Greenvale, he meets a girl who gives him a gun and gives him directions to her home. After he finds his mother, John Henry gets a job as a blacksmith. The blacksmith is not the most pleasant job, and John Henry has some difficulties to do his job and be accepted in the blacksmithing world. In the end, John, his father, and his mother meet the girl who give them their directions. This movie is based on the book by the same name, written by William Peter Blatty. It is an interesting movie. There are some good actors in this movie. The movie is also very entertaining. The story is great. There is a great ending and I have to say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. This is a very good movie and it is definitely worth watching.

I've seen every one that's come out in the last ten years. This one, while not being one of the best, is one of my favorites. I feel like I know all of the characters and they have great chemistry. This movie, in my opinion, does what horror movies should be: it takes you to another world. I think it does it really well. It's a really dark movie. If you're into dark and disturbing films, I highly recommend you see this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A great movie about a guy who had to be taken away by the police for some stupid shit. I liked the plot, and the actors.  (A bit more to it: it is a police drama, about a kid who is taken away from his family and raised in a group home by a group of guys. They are all very good actors, all very serious about it. But I felt the characters were not real people, they were made up by the director to be different characters, and that's it.)

It is a movie about a young boy named Aang who was raised by an airbender. Aang is a very good character, and this is a great role for young actors to play. He is a boy who doesn't know the difference between the real world and the world of the airbenders, so he is very naive and does not know the dangers of the world that he is entering. His life is in danger when he meets the female airbender named Katara, who is the daughter of a former airbender and the best warrior of the Earth Kingdom. Katara is a strong and powerful warrior, but Aang's mother had left the Earth to be with a male airbender, and Aang had never met him. The young boy, with a good sense of humor, helps Katara get out of her hiding place and she falls in love with him. A young man's dream comes true, and he starts a journey of self discovery. The story is told from Aang and Katara's perspective, and the two of them become very close friends. I recommend this movie to all anime fanatics, because it has a great story and is full of adventure.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) is a great science fiction film. It is not a "classic" by any means. It was made in the mid-50's and is one of the last science fiction films made in that era. It shows off all of the amazing technology that was available then and was also one of those rare films that actually made the public aware of a new technology that had just been invented. The production company made a film for the studio about the discovery of radio waves, which is really cool. The main star, John Wayne, played a detective who is sent to a remote location to investigate a murder. He gets stuck there and the film doesn't give him much to do but it is pretty cool to see a very famous actor in a small role. I have never seen a more beautiful film, with such beautiful cinematography. I also love the use of the sound track by Carl Perkins. It makes the film feel so much more alive and the dialogue, especially between the characters is perfect. The only drawback is that the film is pretty slow and the plot takes a long time to develop. This makes the ending pretty unsatisfying, but it does make up for it by giving a great ending. The film was also made with a very low budget and this makes the special effects in it seem even more impressive. The movie was very successful at the time, and was a hit with critics, but I think it was just a bit too slow for a big budget film. _________________________________________  Click on the title below to order this movie:  __________________________________________

There are some horror movies that are better than this one, but you have to understand that it was a big budget production, and there is no reason it should be any worse.  If you haven't seen this one then I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   If you haven't seen this movie, don't watch it. It is bad.   It's a comedy with a story and characters that are completely unbelievable. The whole movie is a mess. The characters, the plot, and the story are all ridiculous. You will never find any kind of logic to the story. There are too many different story lines. There's the group of people who just want to go to a movie, the group who wants to be famous, and then there's the one who wants the best movie for their movie club. They all have a different goal and the movie is about how they get to their goal. The plot isn't that important, but the story is. There is a guy named Jack who is the best actor in the world and his friend, who is just a normal guy, plays a character named Peter, who also has amazing acting skills. This movie takes place in a movie theater where all the actors come and try to get the best role. It's like a movie where a bunch of people try to be an actor. The movie starts out with the cast in the theater. The actors are being selected for the movie and they meet in the lobby. They make a list of the movie roles and then they all have to sit around and talk. It doesn't make sense. What happens to the people on the other side of the screen? Who are they? How did they get there? Where did they come from? Who is this guy in the audience? Who was he before? Who will he be after? The movie is totally silly and totally confusing. It goes on for hours. The script is completely nonsensical. It takes a long time to get to the point. This is the movie that made me hate all of the actors. There was a scene where a character played by Tom Selleck is talking to a woman. The actress playing the woman tells Sellecke that the movie has gone bad. Sellecki responds, "You're kidding me. It can't be bad." He just said that because it was a stupid line.   the ending was awful. the characters were all just stupid. They made no sense. there's a woman who just wants to go on a date with a man named Bob, who has a huge crush on her. She thinks she has a boyfriend, but she's never even met him. She wants to make up for lost time. She goes to a theater to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ - I really enjoyed the story. I loved how the movie followed a simple plot, and how it did not take away from it's theme. The movie also did a great job at telling a story with a bit of comedy. I especially enjoyed how the villain of the movie made his intentions clear and how he was able to kill the main character with a smile on his face. - The art style of the film was pretty good. I would say the art style did not feel like a typical movie or anime style. The art was very detailed and made me want to see more. - Overall, the movie was well made and made you want to watch it more. If you have the money for it, I recommend this movie to you. __________ I would also like to point out that this movie is NOT a parody. This movie is in fact a serious story about the death of a young boy and the fact that a man would try to make him believe he is a witch. The story is told in first person from the perspective of a child. However, you will notice a few differences from the movie. This version of the story does not take place in the same town where the movie takes place. The main character is different as well. He is a boy, but his parents are not. Also, this version of this story is a bit darker than the original version. The only way I could explain this is if the film took place in a different time period. There is also a few scenes where you can see the reflection of the main characters face as they talk to the audience. This also adds to the story as it makes you think about the main cast. _________________________________________ The film starts off with a young girl named Yoko (who is a little girl) trying to go to a festival. At the festival she is told by a witch to dress up in a fancy dress and play the violin. She does so and meets a man that has a big mustache. She then meets him again at the festival and he tells her he needs to dress like a boy so that he can be with the girls at the dance. When she asks why he wants to be a boy she is informed that he is supposed to be the "Witch". After meeting the witch, she realizes that she does not want to play the piano. This makes her upset and she tries to run away from the man. The man tries to catch her but she gets away. At

The movie is good, I just think it would have been even better if the plot had been more interesting.  I think this is the best of the three films, but it does have some plot problems. It's all the same old stuff, and I just can't get excited about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pretty good.  I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Â It is set in the 19th century and the main character, a young Irish boy, is the only survivor of a shipwreck.  He is the last man on earth.   The movie takes place in the early 1900's.  It follows a young boy who is on a voyage across the Atlantic.  His father, a sea captain, has died and the boy has been left alone on the ship.  The ship is wrecked in the middle of the ocean and the only survivors are the boy, his sister and the crew.  There is no food and the ship has drifted around for days.  When the boy sees a ship approaching his boat, he makes the decision to hide and wait.  Eventually, the ship will reach land and they will get back to their home.  At the end of the movie, we find out that the boy was on the same ship that his father was on.  He was a very lucky boy.  My only criticism about this movie is that the movie takes a bit of a long time to get to the end.  Overall, I thought it was a good story and the movie has some really nice songs that you should check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A film that is both beautifully shot and expertly acted." "The most exciting action scene of the year" "A must see for fans of action films." A film with action sequences so intense that even I was stunned by the visual effects.  The opening scene in a prison. The prison escape. A prison escape is one of the most common plot points in most action movies.  It is so common, in fact, that it's used more than once in every film I have ever seen.  The opening scene of a prison escape usually consists of two characters, one of whom is the bad guy.  There is a hostage on the other side of a large metal door.  A man or woman comes in and takes the hostage.  He or she opens the door and the other man or girl runs out with the hostage in a duffel bag.  They head for the prison.  When they get there, they find the prison is locked down.  Prison guards surround the prisoner and begin to take him or her away.  As the guards close in, the hostage tries to escape.  His or her hands are cuffed behind their back.  With no way to escape, the prisoner is forced to cooperate.  Once the prisoner has been moved to a room, the guard puts on a face mask and takes a photograph.  From that photograph, the other prisoners can learn the prisoner's true identity.  After that, the guards will let the prisoner go.  If he or she tries to leave again, he orshe will be recaptured.  In this particular prison escape, a man named Michael is in charge of the prisoners.  Michael is a very cruel man.  Whenever he has a prisoner under his control, he tortures them.  But Michael also loves the prisoners and gives them everything they want.  One day, Michael is told that he will be transferred to a prison in the south.  So, he and his men go to the prison to pick up Michael's new prisoner.  On their way there, Michael's men get into a shootout with the prison guards.  Some of the guards are killed, others are wounded.  Then Michael's prisoners are able to take over the prison and escape. This is a common prison escape plot.  However, it's the first time I have seen an actual prison escape take place in a film.  To make matters even more exciting,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The Great Gatsby (2012) - "A big, dark, sprawling American epic of art and money, it tells the story of a wealthy New York real estate magnate who, having fallen on hard times, finds solace in a life of luxury and debauchery, his mind clouded by a dark, violent past that has not been revealed to the world." The movie was filmed over the course of two years and has an incredible cast. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jay Gatsbys father. He is a former naval officer turned real estate tycoon. The story follows his rise to the top, but it is the story that really takes the audience into Jay Gatz's mind. The GreatGatsby was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was also one of the most talked about movies in the year 2012. _______________________________________________________  RAW Paste Data  The Great Gatz (2012), the story behind Jay Gadsby's (Leonardo DiCaprios) creation, is an extraordinary tale of the world of finance and money. In the film, Jay Gattas father (Leonard DiCapristo) was a naval officer and was on the run after he was accused of being involved in a murder that was committed by his friend and neighbor, Nick Carraway. Jay's story takes us through the years of his life and gives us a glimpse of a world of excess and glamour that was hidden from the public. This is a story that you can only get by watching this movie. The movie is shot in a style that gives us the feeling of watching a film about a wealthy man's rise to power. It is a film that has a feel of being filmed in the 1920's and has a great soundtrack. The music is a real treat and I would recommend that you listen to the song "Old Friends" by The Great Pretenders as it is an important part of the movie. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Gatsworth, the house, Jay's life and Nick Carrasway's (Tom Wilkinson) life. The house is the central theme of this movie and the story is told through a series of flashbacks. It starts with Jay Gatson and his brother.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If there's one thing I've learned from watching a lot of bad movies, it's that the best ones are the ones you don't notice." - The Guardian "It was a film that, by the end of it, left me thinking that I'd just had a very bad time." - Daily Mail "I've never been a huge fan of action movies, but this one was very good." - Empire "I found myself laughing and crying and feeling very uncomfortable, but then I felt I should be glad I did." - Guardian I found this movie quite funny.  But there was nothing really to laugh at.  It was not really a comedy and was just about the two young men who played the lead roles.  The story of the movie was based on the true story of a man who shot and killed a bank robber, only to find that his friend, who had been with the robber the whole time, was on the run.   They had to escape from a prison, get to the UK and go to America to hide.  In the process they had to kill many people, the main one being the guy who was supposed to have been their friend.  The ending was a bit rushed but I still found it funny.  But the movie left me feeling like I had just had an incredibly bad time.  I found the plot very stupid and stupid people, especially the bad guys, were hilarious.  Some people may find this movie a little too violent.  There were a lot blood and a lot shooting.  When the movie started I did not like the characters, I did like the story but I found them really annoying.  They were all so stupid and they had no character.  It was just really hard to care about any of them.  Also I found it weird that they just kept saying that they wanted to get out of prison, that they were so tired.  Then they got to America and did the whole hiding thing and then they get caught and it was all over.  All of this was done in a short movie, so I was wondering how they would do it in a full movie.  To make the whole thing work, you really had to care.  This was a movie that I was watching to see if they could make a film with no dialogue.  What I found really weird was that they would just say things like, "You're so stupid," and "We have to get

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The Man Who Would Be King (1992) (Kazuo Koike) - I've had this film in my mind for some time and finally had the opportunity to watch it. I think it's a very unique film, in that there is an element of mystery to it. It also is very well done. The film has a very good atmosphere and is not a boring film. The acting is all very good. The story of the film is about a young man who is sent to the United States to serve as a diplomat in Japan. He is a very young man and there is a lot of mystery about him as well. I thought this film had a lot going for it and it was very enjoyable to watch. I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The ending was very predictable and I thought that it was a little cheap. This film was recommended to me by a friend who is a big fan of Kazuo Koide's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  5.1 stars, 1 reviews  June 6, 2014   My son and I have loved all the adventures of these great creatures. I'm a big fan of the first movie as well. It's like they are perfect in every way. I thought it was great that they went back to the old school for the next movie. My son is now 8 years old. He said he loved it. He got a little excited when they said there was going to be more dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs are very good. It seems like they're living off of the earth. They are very intelligent. The ones in the second movie are very, very different. They have very strong arms and are very fast. They're not so smart. I would watch them again just for that. It would be nice to see one of the other ones like the last movie had. It makes me happy that there is a third one.  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is also a good film. They went back and re-did the last one as a children's film. It is fun. It does a nice job of showing the dinosaurs in a new light. , June 6, 2018My sonand I have enjoyed all the movies of the "Jurassic Park" series. I have two kids and this is their favorite. I think that it is because the animals are so well-animated and because of the excitement of the dinosaurs. I enjoyed watching it as well and have been thinking about going back to see it again. I am going to see the movie in 3D and I want to see some of the new creatures as well as see if the movie will get a Blu-ray release.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________   "The first time I saw it, I was so frightened. I don't know how a man like that could be so fearless in the face of danger. I was also very disappointed. I thought he had some hidden heart there that he didn't show."  -- Robert L. Young   This film is a masterpiece. It is a film with a message, it is a movie that speaks to all of us. I've always been a fan of this type of film because of the message it is trying to convey and because of its beautiful cinematography. This film is not just about a movie. It's about a message. It was the first time that I felt I understood the world I live in and the issues that are faced by many of our men and women who are on active duty. It really shows the truth of war. And I loved it. This movie is not a good action movie. There are no guns or explosions. It doesn't have any special effects or stunts. It just shows the pain of life, and the courage of a man who will not back down. It shows that there is hope after the horror of war and it shows the true meaning of courage.   It was an amazing movie. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was beautiful. The acting was so believable. It makes you think that these guys are real people and not just actors. There was one part of the film that I thought was just a really strange joke. I guess the director just wanted to make a little fun of his film. But I don t think it is funny. It could have been done in a different way and it would have been funnier. I felt sorry for the characters because of how realistic their acting was. I liked how the camera was in close up on them. And how the director had them walking through the city. It made me think of a cityscape.  , the first war movie I ever saw. When I saw this movie as a teenager, I felt that it was a little too realistic. I think that it's the way the director made it. There were some parts of it that I did not like. There is one scene that really didn t work. But it was so hard to watch. The guy is trying so hard not to cry, and it just felt wrong to me. I found that very hard to take. This is a great movie for all the military men and woman. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The movie is very interesting, and it's very good. The acting is very good, especially the lead actor, Tom Hanks. This movie is worth watching even for just Tom H and his character.  Read a negative review about this movie:  "When this film was first released, I thought it was a great piece of entertainment. I thought that Tom Huddleston was great as 'Molly'. His character was very believable and you could almost see him having fun. Unfortunately, the plot had some serious flaws. The plot of the movie is about a guy who gets the idea to do something very dangerous. Unfortunately he falls for a very old and very beautiful woman, but he wants to do it all for her. When he goes to her place to do this, the lady is a bit too crazy to let him have it. The man tries to escape from her, but she's very powerful. She can beat him and he has to stay and fight. But there are also the people who want to do the same. The film ends with a tragic ending, and I thought the ending was a bit odd. This is a movie that should be watched, even for Tom H. I found the ending very tragic, and that is why I think that this movie should be re-released with a better ending."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** I am a very big fan of Michael Mann, and i have been for quite a long time. I was very much hoping that he would make another great film with a good cast and crew. This film is one of the best of his career. It has some amazing scenes that I will never forget, and great acting, great writing and a very good soundtrack by Sting. He is such a nice guy, and he really deserves to be on this list. This movie has so many great scenes, some of which i will not even describe, but i do want to tell you that this is a movie that you should not miss, and if you watch it, you will probably be hooked and want to see more of Michael. I really enjoyed this movie, and will always have it on my tv. *****I really liked this movie *****  The film is called 'Deep Throat' and the story is about a journalist who is in the process of writing a story about a famous American politician who has been accused of sexual misconduct. The journalist, played by the great Jack Nicholson, goes to meet the politician to try to find out what is really going on. This journalist, who was very close to the politician and has been trying to get the story, is convinced that the politician is a very sick man and that he is going to die very soon. The politician, played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins, seems to be very ill, but he continues to deny everything and say that he has been framed by the press. It is up to the journalist to discover this story and put the politician away. When the politician meets the journalist, they both begin to fall in love with each other, and it seems like things are going to change for the better. Unfortunately, things do not turn out as the journalist had hoped and the politician commits suicide, killing himself and the journalist. In the end, it is clear that the journalist and the deceased politician are not together, but they have a very passionate relationship that is really very moving. It makes me sad that this movie was so poorly written, and the director and actors did not do their job as well as they could have. I have never seen a better performance by Anthony Perkins in his career and he plays the role perfectly. This is one movie that is not to be missed. *******I have never been so excited to see a movie in my life. The acting is so good and the plot is so exciting. This story

I remember seeing "Terminatrix" at the theater at age 8. The film was very much a kid's movie, and I loved it. I had never seen a movie with so much gore and so many action sequences. I was so scared the first time I saw the movie, but by the end of the movie I was thoroughly entertained. I also loved the soundtrack, which included songs by the likes of the Rolling Stones, the Police and others." -Jeff Bock, Director of Photography, The Shining, and Terminator 2: Judgement Day
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I was going to say this movie is a rip off of "Barry Lyndon", but the plot is different enough to give it its own identity. It starts off with a scene in the middle of the desert and it was a nice, calm scene to watch. It is a beautiful film with some great acting from both men. I love the fact that the women are not afraid to be aggressive. The scene where they go to a casino with some other guys is very good as well. The movie does go to some pretty dark places, but it never makes you feel as if you are going crazy. This movie is not for the weak of heart. I think this is the best "Man On The Moon" film ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We Are The Best!" is a beautiful movie, full of a great performance by the lead, a very good script, an amazing director, and a very cool soundtrack.  The plot is a bit strange at first but I like how it keeps the plot interesting. __________________________________________________________ I have seen this movie twice, and I liked it both times.  I did not see the first one when it was released, but I watched it on VHS and it was okay.    This is the first movie I saw with this director, John Landis, and this is my favorite movie of his I've ever seen.  "We Are the Best!"   is a very well-written movie.  The story is very well thought out and well paced.  There are some great acting, especially by the young actors.  Some of the scenes are a little strange, but they work.  This movie is a great time for adults to see a very sweet movie for young children.  It is a real classic, and you will not be disappointed with it.    I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________________ What the hell happened to the characters in this movie? The actors are all really good, but they just do not fit together. I don't know why, but every time they are in the same room together, I just have a bad feeling. I think the story is not very well thought out. I am thinking that it is very much a movie about the old world, the old rules, the way people lived. It is not a very good movie. I guess it is just a very bad movie with good acting. The actors do not really fit together, and the dialogue does not flow very well. It would have been a good idea to write a better story about the ancient world. I have been thinking about this movie for a long time. I love this movie so much, and it was a good story. If you love movies about the past, this is a good choice. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. I recommend this movie to people who love movies with good characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a great movie, and it's definitely a movie worth watching.  It's one of those rare movies that's actually a good story and a good screenplay.    I've seen it four times now, and I always come away impressed.  The Man Who Killed Kennedy was a better movie.  I don't know if the Kennedy assassination is the greatest story ever told, but it is certainly the most memorable and well-written.  The Man who Killed Kennedy is a story about a man who, while working as a mail carrier, was on a train that was hit by a train.  This was the day of the Kennedy Assassination, and the train driver was on the track when the shot went off.      The train was empty, and there were no injuries.  There was a small hole in the top of the train that had caused a little dust to fly up.  That's all.  When the dust cleared, there was a bullet hole in a door and a broken window in the car.  They didn't know that the man had shot the president, but the police believed it was his bullet.  He was arrested and tried, but was acquitted of the crime.  Unfortunately, he was murdered later that year.  It's a very different story from The Man who Shot Liberty, but that's the kind of movie you really need to see.  Here's a little movie about that train that you can watch in its entirety: The Train that Shot the President,   This is the movie that made me realize that I had seen everything, and even had seen some of the best.  Sure, I had already seen a few other movies in my life that were better than this one, but none of them had the same impact on me.  But, this movie is a bit different, and not only because of the story.  Like the book, this is a very well-told story that is about a person that does something very wrong, and is then caught.  In this case, a train conductor is on the tracks that day, and he has a gun in his hand.  At the time, there were people on the train, and when he saw the president's limousine approaching, he didn't think it was the right time to shoot.  Because the train was very close, he thought he had plenty of time to pull his gun

This movie is a masterpiece and you should see it if you haven't seen it already. This is a movie that you must see for the characters and the plot. It has a lot of character development, and a good storyline. You can really relate to the main character in this movie because she is a girl. I found the film to be interesting, it was an interesting movie to watch. The movie has a great plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________ The Man Who Knew Infinity (2014) – 9/10 I've been a huge fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies since the very first one, so this was an opportunity to see the Guardians as a team, and not just as individuals. I'll start by saying that I really liked this movie, and the first act of it was very solid. I thought the Guardians were a lot of fun, and it was a nice break from the usual superhero fare. The movie also introduces a lot more of the supporting characters from the comics, and makes them much more important than they were in the comics. I think that this is the one of the better films to show off the Guardians in action. I felt like the film was a little slow, and I wish there was more action. There's also a little bit of the typical action set-up, which I'm sure you'll enjoy. The music was good, and really added to the movie. I also really liked how the team interacted with each other, and how they got along. It was nice to see that they had a lot in common, and that they're not all that different. _______________________________________________________________________________ I enjoyed the movie so much, and so did my wife. It has a lot to offer for fans of the comics and the movie, as well as fans of Peter Quill, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, and Rocket Raccoon. I give this film a 9.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ "The Shining" (1980) - The Shining is a masterpiece and a perfect horror movie. The story is so intense that you can't wait to watch it. A story about an American family that moves to a small town in a remote area of the country. After they settle down, things start to get strange and they start to lose all sense of reality. This film is based on the book "The Autobiography of Dr. Stephen King" written by King himself. This movie is the sequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and was also made in 1980. The first film is a bit better but "The Shining" is much better. The cinematography is great and you can really feel how scared the characters are. This is also a great movie for kids as it is very scary for the older audience. This was the first movie that I ever saw in my life and it was an experience that I will never forget. I recommend this movie to everyone. The characters in this movie are very interesting and you really feel like they are in a very dangerous situation. The music in this is great as well and you will feel like you are in an old movie. This will probably be the best movie that you watch during your vacation in this country.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________"There are moments in life when the simple act of being in the same room as a good film is all it takes to be enlightened. Such a moment is one of those. This is not a bad film, but there are some problems that keep it from being the true masterpiece that it should be." - Tom Scharpling  "I've always wanted to see "Fargo." But I've been too busy working and other projects. So when I saw the trailer for this film, I knew it was the one for me. It was an incredibly well done, smart, hilarious, emotional, and profound film. I loved it." - Adam S. Gierow  __________  Fargo is a dark comedy, set in the post-apocalyptic years following a massive natural disaster. The film centers on a police detective who investigates the mysterious disappearance of a young woman. When she's eventually found, she's dead, having been shot through the head. The detective has to make a difficult choice between pursuing a cold case, or being pulled into a bigger mystery that he and his partner aren't even sure exists.  The film was shot in a very low-budget manner using only natural light, a black and white cinematographer, and handheld camerawork. The cinematography for this particular film was done in the style of a French New Wave film. This means that the cinematography is very cinematic and very stylized. The lighting is very dark and gritty and almost looks like a black-and-white movie, with the only highlights being the people's faces. The characters are all very stylistic and stylized as well. It's very hard to see who is supposed to be in the shots, and what the people are doing. This film also uses lots of close-ups, and the camera tends to move very quickly, giving the whole film a very fast pace. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* "A beautiful film that will leave you with a smile on your face." - The New York Times  "The most stunning movie I have ever seen." - Rolling Stone  From director/screenwriter John Cameron Mitchell (Saving Mr. Banks, Up In The Air), this is a visually striking film that has the heart of a coming-of-age tale and the brain of a master filmmaker. As young men, the two main characters, Sean and Daniel, are a great deal alike, yet each is different from the other. In Sean's case, he is the more athletic and intellectual of the two. In Daniel's case the more emotional and sensitive. These two are also a bit different in that they are each struggling with their own identity and with who they are and who they want to be. These are the two young men who meet at a New Year's Eve party in a beautiful city called Santa Fe. Sean is a young man in love with a young woman who seems like she's not interested in him. She has a very beautiful father who also seems to have an interest in her. He's a man who is very wealthy and who is willing to do anything for her, but she is in love and seems to be more interested in a man from another city who lives with her and her father. Sean and his girlfriend, and the young man she is dating, are friends, but neither of them knows why she is so interested in this man. Sean also is troubled by his father's sudden death. Daniel is in a very similar situation as Sean and is also struggling with the feelings he has for the woman he is in the process of developing feelings for.  The film follows the lives of these two young people as they navigate the highs and lows of life. There is a lot of laughter and happiness, and there is a great sense of humor and playfulness in the film. There's a very nice cast who do a nice job of creating an interesting cast of characters. The characters are both very realistic in their lives and the themes of the film are very important. The main story line revolves around a young couple who have been dating for a couple of months. Daniel and Sean get engaged and marry the day they are about to be married and are soon to start a family together. Sean, the younger one, is struggling with his relationship with his father, and is beginning to question his own identity. Daniel, the older one, has a more
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  The film itself, was a great movie. I liked it, I think. The plot and the character development is really good. The actors did a great job. I do like the way they handled it. It was a very well done story. I didn't really get into the story until the last third or so. But it was still a good film. There was one moment where I thought the movie had turned into a horror movie. But then I realized it was a story about a girl who loves her dad and her mother. I think it was really good that they told it in the movie. And I think that was a really good idea. I really liked it. The acting was great, too.  My rating: 8.3/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I loved this movie. It's funny, but also very sad. This is a family who has been in a hotel room for many years. Their daughter has been living in the hotel and is sick and needs to be taken care of. The father (Robert De Niro) is very much into the art of his wife's paintings and has been for many, many years, and his wife is always making him pay attention. The daughter, Annie (Jodi Foster), has lived in this hotel for years and is still very sick. The husband, John (Harrison Ford), has just bought a new apartment and is planning on moving back to the city, but his wife has other plans. The old man (Dennis Hopper) is a real pain in the ass. The hotel is not very comfortable and they do not have a great kitchen. The mother (Sofia Coppola) and the daughter are not getting along and have a very strained relationship. The movie has a very sad tone and is very moving. De NIRO is great in this movie and is able to portray the character in a very believable manner. Foster, Ford, Hopper, and co-stars Cate Blanchett, Robert De Niron and Christopher Walken are all great in the movie. This movie is a great family drama and is an important film in the history of American cinema.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I'm in love with this movie. I don't know how I fell in love but I sure did. This movie will not disappoint anyone. There is not much to say about it, it's about a guy and his friend that get into a car accident. This guy is a good driver and his buddy is a bad driver. They make a quick stop at a gas station. The guy's friend gets out and starts shooting at them. The only thing that saved him was a.22 rifle he had. The guys friend gets back in his car and goes to the gas station to get some money to help him pay for his friend's fine. The car he pulls up at is full of police officers and one of them is the lead detective. The detective wants to know where the guys friend is. The friend says that he's driving and asks the detective what's going on. The policeman says that the guy's not a good guy and they want to talk to him. The detectives say that they need to see his car. The dude's friend says no problem. They ask him for a cigarette but he refuses. The cops take the guy and take his car away. They don't even look at his car when they take it away. It was empty when they got it. The police ask the dude to put his keys on the dash. The dudes friend says he's not doing that. The cop says he doesn't care what the dude does, but if he doesn a key, he's gonna lock up. The Dude tells the cops that his friend will be right back. He goes to his friend who's driving the car. He tells him that he didn't lock his car, he was driving and locked the car, but it got locked because of a stupid misunderstanding. The other cops come to the scene and tell the guys to drive over there. The boys friend says the cops aren't the only ones that can lock up a car. Then they tell the guy that they have a warrant out for his arrest. The buddy tells the cop to get the warrant and give it to them. They tell him that they are the police and they're going to have him arrested. They give him a piece of paper and tell him to get in the car and get out of the way. They get in and drive off. The buddies car gets hit by a car that is heading toward them. Then the cops start shooting. The cars windows shatter. The guns are falling

The combination of the epic scale of this film combined with the raw and real performances by a cast that included Hugh Jackman, Jack Nicholson, James Coburn, Robert De Niro, and many more really makes this a must see. There is a reason why this film has been on my must see list for so long. I love it. I loved it when I first saw it and I love to watch it over and over again just to remind myself what I've seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" (1999) was the beginning of the end of the Star Wars trilogy, and the first movie to make George Lucas realize the importance of continuity. The story of Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Qui-Gon Jinn (who are playing a very good joke on George Lucas) had many flaws, but it was the best of the three movies. The movie had many great performances, and some really funny ones. I can't believe that it's almost 20 years since the first Star Wars was released.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. This movie is a real gem and a perfect example of what happens when a director and writer work together. I was so pleased with the direction of this movie and the story that was written. The movie is about a young girl that has her father die and she is raised by her grandparents. She lives in a very small town in Texas and the only thing that she can do is stay away from her father's grave. After the death of her father she meets a man who has an obsession with the grave. She gets drawn into a mystery involving the grave, a man and a gun. It is the perfect combination of mystery, adventure, family, love and sadness. I love this movie so much. It really makes me cry when I think of my father.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Momsmom from The Best Film of 2013! The best movie of 2013, and I've seen a lot. This is a movie you need to see. I'm not kidding, it's a great movie. It's a very well-told story, with a very good acting cast, and it's beautifully shot. I think it's one of those rare films that is more than just a thriller, but also a movie about the power of love, and friendship. It deals with some very hard topics, but there's a love at the end of the film. I also think it deals with a great love story, but with the twist at the last minute. I just don't know how anyone can get more from a story like this. I don't understand why some people can't get the same sense of joy out of watching this film as I do. The acting is fantastic, especially the young actress who plays the girl in the grave; it's just a perfect blend of vulnerability and strength. I've only seen this one in its entirety, but I've been told that it's the best film of 2013. . I'm so glad I found this movie. I saw it on the DVD release, and that was so hard to watch. The picture was just not good. It looked so grainy, like it was from a bad VHS. This new version looks so good. This film is so good, I don.t even think it will have any issues on the VHS release. It looks so much better than I expected. If you're a fan of a good, emotional drama, and a great cast, this is the movie for
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  "G.I. Jane" (1993)  By Peter Grosz   "I can remember, as a kid, thinking, 'That movie's got great dialogue, but it's not a good story.' But when I saw it as an adult, I was totally blown away. This movie is about a real hero: a woman who wants to live up to the code of honor that her father taught her, but is afraid to do so. The plot of the movie is not exactly complicated. Jane (Charlize Theron) is a Navy SEAL. She's assigned to infiltrate a terrorist cell in the Philippines. On her first mission, she has to fight the terrorists in an underground tunnel system. She gets in a firefight with some of the terrorists, and it looks like she's going to be killed. But a helicopter comes to her rescue and rescues her. She tells the pilot she's an officer, and he agrees to escort her back to the United States. Jane is then assigned to another mission. This time she is to infiltrate the military installation where the terrorists are being kept. This is where she meets the leader of the terrorist group, who she's been working with. They have a plan to blow up the entire place. The terrorists are captured and brought to a cell in a jungle. This scene was really good because of the close-ups of Jane's face. The whole movie is just a great action movie."   - - - -  See the entire list of the best movies ever made in the Best Movies section at the Movieguide.com Movieguide website.

This is one of those movies that everyone should see, especially fans of the original. It has all the fun that the first movie had, but with more action and less comedy. It takes a different turn, but it still has a lot of good scenes, including one of my favorite scenes ever, where the two brothers are going to a family reunion, and they have to save the princess. It's a funny movie and the dialogue is great. It even has a great ending that is unexpected, but still awesome. Overall, this is a very good movie. It would be worth a watch. It will make you laugh and cry, and the ending was awesome. I recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh and have a good time.

His girlfriend is also in love with him, and she is very interested in getting back together with him.  The two of them get together, but the guy is too busy to be able to do anything.   Eventually the guy meets a girl, and then the girl and the guy begin to do it again and again. They have a very good time, and the movie is very romantic and sweet.  I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes romance."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young man, living with his mother, who dreams of becoming a writer and living a peaceful life in Paris. He meets a beautiful girl and falls in love. They meet in a café and they are quickly attracted to each other.  They then take an opportunity to escape Paris. They travel to Rome, Italy. The two spend a lot of time together and begin to have sexual relations. They then head to Paris and start living together. They are soon involved with a man named Albert who is very wealthy and has an extravagant lifestyle.  "I am sorry, but this film is so boring and devoid of anything of value that it makes you think it is just a commercial."  A friend of the couple, a young American businessman, moves to Paris to help the couple with the finances they are facing. He is very good looking and a wealthy man. He has a large mansion, lots of servants, and a fleet of cars. The couple begin to love each other and soon they begin to spend more time together.    After some time of spending together, the man's father gets involved in a scandal that puts his business in jeopardy. The man, who is the main love interest of the young woman, is forced to leave Paris and move back to America.    A movie I really liked!   The two have an intimate relationship that I thought was very realistic.  The film is very romantic and I love how they explore and discuss their feelings.  I think it would have been a better film if they had kept it more realistic. I think they could have used a more believable love interest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ It is so sad how some people hate good movies that they want to ban them. I can tell you that this is one of those movies. It has a lot of heart and it really shows. The whole movie is very intense and dark, but at the same time it is not a horror movie. This is a thriller. The story is about a serial killer who is a retired detective and who is also a very good detective. The movie takes place in a house in a small town, where the serial killer has already been convicted. When the killer is on the run, he kidnaps a young woman who has no way of fighting back. The killer takes her out of the house and leaves her in a lake. She is in a lot pain and is in shock. She sees a car coming from a distance and she jumps in the water and the car drives away. It is very creepy and the movie is scary. The ending is very sad and the whole movie does have a very sad ending. The film has many good scenes and it is a good watch. This movie has a great plot and I highly recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________"When I saw the first poster, I thought, "Oh! There's another one!" The picture was pretty and well done. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but I did. The story was well told. I liked how it wasn't just a straight up action movie. It was also well told about the family. The father, played by Peter Sellers, was a good role model for me, and the mother was a wonderful mother. She did a great job with the kids. I thought the ending was good."   "I loved the way they made it a family movie. They didn't go over the top like many films do. The movie was very dark and mature. I didn't like how they made the villain seem like a bad guy. It seemed like the hero should win. I think that was a mistake. I mean, I guess they didn't want to lose the audience that way. I was surprised by the ending. I'm a huge fan of comedy and the ending didn't seem to fit the movie. I guess it was a case of making it too dark for some people, but there's a lot of good laughs in it."  , 7/12/68. The film was written by Richard Lester, directed by Peter S. Beagle, and starred Peter Sellars, Barbara Stanwyck, Pauline Kael, James Cagney, Gene Tierney, and Marlene Dietrich. It's the story of a family that is forced to flee from their home, and it was filmed in a studio lot, and was directed by a man named Brian De Palma. De PalMA was responsible for some of the most memorable films of the 1960's and '70's, including The Untouchables, Carrie, Scarface, and The Godfather. He is perhaps best known for his 1971 film The Conversation. This film is a satire of the "family values" and social problems that were prevalent at the time. This movie is a bit different than De PalMa's other films. While The Conversation was based on a real conversation between two men, this film is more of a parody of the typical American family. This story deals with a number of social issues that are prevalent at that time. The family is forced out of their home by a storm. The wife (Barbara Stanwyke) is a prostitute, and her husband (Peter Sellars) is an alcoholic. They have four children

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  "I thought the movie was just a wonderful idea that was executed to perfection. I don't think the movie is as good as it looks, but I think it is a fun movie. It's really a great story that you don't see every day. I'm glad to see the movie in theaters again. The special effects were amazing and the movie really was entertaining." - Mike C. "I liked this movie very much. It is a very well written story and it's a good action movie. The best thing about this movie is the ending. There was no real closure. The movie is a lot more than what you see in the end." - Tim A. "What a great movie! I think the characters are really well developed. I especially liked the relationship between the two characters. I think that they were very much in love and that's why they are both in the same place. I loved the way that they fought against each other. It was really good. I also thought that the ending was pretty good." - James R. "The movie is fun to watch, and very well put together. I really enjoyed the characters and their relationship. It had a lot of action and a good message to tell. It really does have a great ending." - Charles W. "Just wanted to add my two cents on the movie, It's a great, fun action movie that's great in the middle, and ends with a very good ending, that really made me feel that it was worth the wait. I've seen the movie three times now, and it still keeps my interest. I'll definitely be picking up the next one. If you're a fan of this kind of stuff, this is a great one to watch." - Tom A.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "My friend gave me this movie about a guy that gets involved in a cult and finds out that they are not who they seem to be."   This is not a cult, it is a group of people with some strange beliefs, which are revealed over time. This is a story about a man who is a member of a cult in the 1950s and is forced to take a trip to California. The cult is called the Church of the SubGenius.  I would have liked to see a better ending. The movie never really ends, and you never really know what will happen to the people who are there. This movie is a great way to learn about a strange group. I highly recommend this movie to people who want to learn more about this cult.   (4 out of 5)  The review was written by jdw  My Review:   I first saw this movie when I was a teenager and it was one of my favorites. This film is not what I think of as cult movie but that is only because it is not really a cult. In this movie, you will see some of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. It is a very good film and I recommend it. It has a great story, which I enjoyed very much. The performances of all the people in the movie are really good. It makes the movie really creepy and a little bit scary. The music and the special effects were really good too. I would have loved to see this movie as a big blockbuster but it never really happened, so it has a cult feel to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ The best part about this movie was that the movie actually took the time to give you a backstory. In the beginning of the movie, the guy in the mask and the one who looks like a girl, was going to kill her and her friends because they were playing in a cemetery and he was jealous. But then he gets tired of watching and decides to do it himself. So you see the first few days of his life in the film, his childhood was not so good and he hated his father who was abusive. He also had to work really hard because he couldn't go out with his friends because his father didn't let him go out at all. He has to help his father with his business and he does well, but he is still poor. When he gets older, he does some dumb things that his mother and sister don't approve of and he doesn't get in a lot of trouble. So he is a good kid who gets in trouble a lot and then his mother ends up being a drug addict. She ends up getting murdered and his father becomes more abusive because he can't stand it anymore. So after this happens, he starts killing people and then ends up at a place where he finds out he is the only one who is capable of making the right decision because there are so many people trying to kill him. He then goes on a killing spree of all the people that were trying to do him wrong. But he finds that the people around him are just as bad as him. They all want to kill each other and it makes him feel like he is worthless. After this, he kills everyone in his way and then he meets his true love, who is a girl named Jelena. He falls in love with her and he becomes the new God of the Underworld. He starts to have a lot more freedom and then some other bad things happen. One of them is his wife dies and his daughter is taken away from him. So then he finds a way to get his daughter back and he is now on his own and now he is starting to make his own decisions. He meets another girl named Amira and they become friends and then the movie takes a turn and he finds himself in a fight with the man from the mask. Then he finds the truth about his life and that he is in a coma. But when he wakes up, he finds JelENA in his bed and they have a kid together. Then the story starts to get better and

When she gets her chance, she makes a pact with her own life to give it up to get a new one. The film is one of those that you have to see to appreciate it. A real emotional rollercoaster ride. A lot of times in movies, the girl will get dumped and it's all over, but not in this film. The girl never gives up. She finds a new guy, a guy who actually cares for her and respects her. They get to spend some time together and eventually she decides to end her relationship. After she breaks up with him, she finds out that he's actually a cop and he's trying to help her. This is one case where I wish the movie had been longer. It's hard to imagine how it ended, but it did. In fact, it was the only time that I ever really felt the movie didn't know what to do with the movie. In the end, it did a great job of showing how love can work, but that's just a testament to the film's ability to show it. The cinematography is great and there's a really nice soundtrack that makes this movie a really good one to watch. This movie is about the power of love and it really shines through in it.

I am going to see it again.  Write a negative review about bad movie:  ___________  I saw this movie for the first time about a year ago. It has not aged well at all. It is very slow paced, and the action is boring. The cast is pretty good. The director was not good. And the ending was really confusing.  is really bad. The characters are pretty much all the same. The plot is all the characters are really different and all of them are evil. The only thing that the film has going for it is that the action was really good. This movie would be better if the plot was not so different from the other movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The first and only good movie in the new Star Trek film series.  The only one that comes close to capturing the magic of Star Trek.  is the first new film in the original Star Trek series, the first movie to not have the "classic" TOS cast. It also featured some great special effects, but the film was not very successful. In fact, there was a lot of bad press surrounding this movie, not only because of the bad box office but because it was so "out of touch" with the fans. The film was a big failure, but there are several reasons why it is so great. But before I discuss those reasons, let me discuss some of the special effects in the film. The Enterprise's computer, Data, is so good, it is almost too good. I've seen it many times, and I'm amazed that people are still amazed by it. This computer was one of the reasons that Star Trek was so special. If the computer had had a little more personality and a little less science, it would be a perfect villain. I'd love to have a computer that was a good villain. It was great that Data was able to predict the crew's actions and predict where they would be on the next day, which is the same as what a good detective would do. And it was even better that the computer could talk to the crew. It would have been great to see a computer talking to the Enterprise crew. Also, the film has the best special effects I've ever seen. The special effects were absolutely mind blowing. The visual effects are the best they have ever been. You have to see the special effect for yourself, but in general, the special visual effects of this film were amazing. The space scenes were amazing and even in the most crowded of spaces, it never seemed crowded. For example, in the space scene in the Enterprise, we see the ship flying through space with a great variety of stars in the background. The ship is almost like a movie camera with it's wide-angle view. It's amazing to see. As for the action scenes, they are incredible. The shots where Kirk and the crew fight the Klingons were amazing, and they were all over the place. They were in different areas of the ship, and even out in space. The fight scenes are just amazing. One thing that I noticed about the movie was that it was
