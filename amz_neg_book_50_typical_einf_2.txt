Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was totally disappointed, for starters, with the story - the author has made his living in the literary field for over forty years, and this is his sixth book of the same basic "my wife has cancer is it worth it" format. It's all been about the wife (and she had cancer) in the first three books, and in the fourth book, that theme again is repeated: the wife is having cancer and we have to weigh the risk of having her die against the chance that her husband can save her life. I never bought it. That's not my "style" of writing, and I don't understand the popularity of it. I don;t think there is a "style," there's just stories. And stories aren't written to make us feel good or to give us moral lessons or make us think something. They are stories written to entertain, or to help us figure out a difficult or challenging issue. A simple story is not going to help me resolve a very difficult or complex issue. If I were a health care professional or had cancer, I wouldn't read something that came from a physician and/or physician's assistant with a lot of medical education and experience. It would give me a lot to think about, and maybe something to write about.   But I didn't. I just finished this book and I think I'm better for it. The book is not that bad, actually. I liked the character of the mother quite a bit. I have a very close, very caring sister, and my brother is a very caring and funny brother and they were very funny in the book, and these characters were funny. The mother was a nice person, and had a great sense of humor. Her husband was not a nice man. I'm not sure how to read between the lines and decide whether that was a good or bad thing.   the only thing that bothered me about the story was the fact that the mother had been treated before. She died at least in part because of that. I think the author may be making a statement that I agree with in some way, but if so, I didn;t like it.   I read the book through, but I wasn't able to finish it until later in the day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the 90s, and it was absolutely terrible! I think I would have given it a zero rating if I hadn't already read the other books by the same author. The author was never consistent with the style. He has a lot of different ideas for the way he presents his books. It would be like reading something by someone who had a great idea, but never followed through with it. The one point that I remember really really bugging me was that he showed his characters getting married and having kids. Of course they would have been having kids at that time because of the way America was and how women are treated. That was so wrong and made me really mad because that's not what my parents did. Now you might say, "Well, you didn't have kids, so you couldn't know." Yes, I couldn't really be sure what I was going to do with my life. (This is one of the main reasons I didn't date until I was in my late 20s.) If you had the opportunity to read this now, I would definitely skip it. And, if you had to wait for this book to come out, you probably didn't get the chance because of how old this book was. It has really bad writing.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I think this book, like all of her other books, is just plain bad.   The story of the characters is interesting. I enjoyed reading about the interactions between all the characters.     But the ending left me confused and unsatisfied. There is really only one possible ending (which I will not spoil). If this were the actual ending, this book would be 4 stars. It is not. The writing style is too choppy and doesn't fit the story very well. The ending seems out of place and doesn.t seem like what happened was intended.   a. a lot. of. bad. writing.   and   b. she should write the actual end more like it was meant to be.   that is a whole lot more satisfying then a 1 star review.   A really good book and I can not recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can tell this is going to be a book that someone was trying to write about something they were really passionate about and that was not written well.   This book is really hard to write a bad review about, and I have spent so much time writing about it that I have kind of lost it.   the only thing I have to say is "I can't give this 4.5 stars because of the terrible writing."   I will definitely be picking up other books by this author to read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I have read this book so many times but somehow this book still didn't get good reviews! If you have never read a book about a black person that talks about the black community, it's about time you try this one out! It starts with a pretty good story that really did a great job of getting into the minds of the people that were on the ground there that day and also in that building that day...   "When we began our investigation, we were able to identify a suspect in a case of attempted robbery in which a woman was raped inside the same building and her attacker was also wearing a uniform from a different part of the same division. When police approached the suspect's family, he initially denied that he was the one who raped the woman."   I'm sure this was true but the point of this book is that not everyone saw the events exactly the way the suspect did. It's a bit of a "deeper" read than most of the other books I've read on this subject but that's a good thing because the book doesn't seem to focus on the details that a police officer is going to see and a criminal is going see.   The book does an amazing job of conveying the feeling of the black experience as a whole in the U.S. from the slave times all the way up to today. It does an even better job of explaining to the reader how the police have historically treated black people. This is where it shines through the most, not the facts on what happened but the feeling on what was being experienced by the person that was at the scene. I know I wasn't in the exact position but I was there that night when we were shooting and I could tell you what I felt from that night. I also want to say that I know that the author made several assumptions about my family and my friends as well but the fact is, we are all different. Even me personally.   a book I read and reviewed in 2012: Black American: The Extraordinary Story of Race and Culture in America: I found this book after watching a documentary about the Ferguson, MO protests. I found that the person writing the story had a lot of the details about the protests, police response, and more in this book but wasn't sure if this would be a good read for others. The book has many more details about what happened and the aftermath that made this one that much better.   on page 5-6 of the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book but the whole storyline seemed to be very contrived. First they are going to a small town in the country to be married in church, which is where the story starts, and when we get there we get a whole bunch of new characters (who also have names), and then we get to meet them, they all seem to be from the small town, then the characters are all killed and we are never sure of who they are, so when we are finally told who they were, their names are the same and the first person we meet in the book was dead already, then we find out that all of the new characters have a death sentence, then all of these new characters are introduced and all of them seem to have the same names as all of their original characters and the old characters died in an explosion, then when we find the person who's name we were supposed to have seen earlier in the first book, he was just a figment of the author's imagination. It was a mess of a story that was extremely contrived and just wasn't very original.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ this book is a train wreck!!! It has nothing to do with religion whatsoever. It has to do more with how an American government treats it's citizens. The government was going to be a dictator who forced us to do things that our families, religions, and culture told us were wrong. It was going break all the moral rules that we have built up over hundreds of years. They were trying to make a country of only the Christians. In the end, the whole concept just made me very angry. This book does not take away from the fact that the author believes what he believes but it has nothing whatsoever to do whatsoever with what the bible teaches or how I personally feel. I have no idea what to think about this book after reading it. I just really wanted to go away from this book because I felt so horrible. I would never want to have my children read this or hear about it. And if my grand children did read this and heard about it, I would be livid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've read to date. The writing was amateurish, I had no idea what was going on at times and there were some parts where I was thinking "what's that? I didn't even get a clue!" I don't know what is wrong with this author. If she were able to write another book of this quality I'd probably be buying it.   Overall:  A terrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________, by William Gaddis, is a wonderful story about a man whose daughter was killed by the Nazis, and the family struggles to deal with their grief, anger, and guilt about what they witnessed. As an adult, the son decides that he wants revenge, and makes it his mission to kill the men who killed his mother. However, the book leaves a lot open to interpretation, and some critics have suggested that the book is racist.  I'm a big fan of William G. Gaddiss's writing, and this book fits well in the series. It's not bad writing or bad writing in the genre, it's just that Gaddish does a good job with the characters, and I'm not going to complain about a racist character. It isn't that the characters in this story are racist, it is that the story as a whole is not, and while the characters do have their moments of racism, they are usually dealt with quickly and don't ruin the book. I was also surprised that no one called Gadd's character in the book a racist; that's usually the first place I go when I get offended about an author, even though I'm a real fan of Gadds writing. It seems to be that a lot of people think that a writer can never write an honest character, and that they have to give a black person an African American. The author's job is to make his characters not only believably represent their people, but have a depth beyond that. And you know what? I think a lot more people can be offended by the book if they would have been offended by something else about the book; the whole point of this series is that if you can look past the story and the characters to the characters and the story then you're not reading a racist book.  I read the first four books in the original series (The Good Soldier, The Bad Soldier, Death Is the Enemy, and Death is a Friend) when I was a teen in the 1980's. All were fantastic books, and a lot younger than me. They are also quite difficult to find, and much less of a "must own" book when compared to newer books in this series (that is, new books that were published in 2009 and later). I read The Death of Stalin when it came out, and it was absolutely horrible, so I did not really want to read another one of these. The only reason that I did this review

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I have always enjoyed books on this subject and have read numerous reviews on this book. I have been searching for a book on the subject and it seems the author is the only one on the planet. I would rather just read this book and that is why I gave it one star. I am not a psychologist and have no training in psychology. This book is not written for psychoanalysts but I am surprised by how little research there is to be found on this topic. It is really a case of a person wanting to be more successful. The book tries to give it to you in a logical and factual way and then throws in the mystical, religious and religious practices to complete the mystique. There is a case to be made that it is a powerful book and may be of some use to some people but I feel like it was not written with a psychologist in mind and so is not suitable for them.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------   The plot was really just bad, the writing was awful, and the characters were bland. It was just such a poorly written book, and if anyone read this it was a waste of time and money, I know it did a good thing in teaching us not to trust people, but it just didn't work for me.  The writing is awful because the characters in this story were so awful. The story was told in first person. It wasn't even first person in the sense that there wasn't some sort of narrator telling the story, it was more like there was just one character with some limited knowledge of the past but we could get her perspective. When she talks to other people we were basically told the first person, but not the perspective of the people who were talking to her. Even her thoughts, her words, etc were first person like she was relaying the story to us and it didn't matter, she just could not give us any context of the story.    There are really two ways that you could tell that this book was going to be awful. 1) the fact that there were some really bad grammar and spelling errors. And 2) the way that the author tells a story. If this author didn't write about herself, or about the lives of people she knew, it wouldn't be like this book. , but there were so many mistakes and so many things that should have been said in the story that I was very disappointed.   I feel like I wasted my time reading this book because it was so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This book really sucks. It is a terrible book. The main character is a girl with a speech impediment who is unable to speak. She is basically a mute, but is given the opportunity to communicate with the characters who speak, by the means of a device. The devices themselves are extremely simple and simple. They are also extremely unreliable, and not without consequence. It seems as though this author wanted to make a point about the disability of the main character, and the difficulties of using speech in the social environment. There is only one problem I can find with the book, and it's one that is fairly trivial: how many times does the main heroine say she has a hard time finding people to talk to because they don't speak her language. This is a big problem. Why not write a story that is actually about a disability instead of a disability that is presented as a hindrance to normal interaction between people. This book is very, very short, and I have very little interest in reading anything else by this author.

I was reading an email from one of my readers that is asking me to send him some freebie books as we all love to read. And this is one of the books that I thought I might give away to my readers. You may have seen this story at The Huffington Post, a story about how one father who was trying to use this story as a lesson for other dads was being sued. Well I am not going to sit here and tell you that it is the father's fault and you should have a happy family. It is the mom's fault. The mother, who I assume was an uneducated, single mother with limited income.  This is a story of how an unqualified woman came up with this idea. In an interview with the mother she said that they came up one day while doing some reading. She had some questions, the first one being "How do you stay in your house?" She said "Well I put my son on my back and I lean against the refrigerator and the wall and the cupboard and stuff." At that point she had no idea about how to make food, make a bath, cook a meal, or even how to take care of her child. She took it to the next level. She thought that there was a need in the world, and she wanted to get involved. So the next day she did the dishes and washed the clothes. She was working at a daycare center, the same day that the child went to a playground and had a play date with a little boy, a boy who turned out to be an 8
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ This book is a complete waste of time. It's a self-help book written for non-Jews that purports to be about Jewish religion, but it's a complete mess of a book. First of all, it doesn't even have a title. It comes out as "Understanding Judaism" rather than "Rabbi's Wisdom." Rabbi Dovid Weiss is presented as a sort of guru, and is in fact the main character in this book. And he says a lot of things. He says that Jews have a natural attraction to God, which is a "mixed blessing." I found his idea of this "natural attraction" a little odd, as it seems like a good thing to be God-attracted. But then I read that he believes we are in a war between good and evil. It is a mixed blessing, but the good guy, the God-man, is the one who will win. This is not an easy concept for someone who is not from this world to understand. Weiss also says that the Bible is a mess. But he didn't tell us that. Instead, he made it seem like the Bible was full of contradictions and that all of the stories in the Bible were made up. And that the people who wrote the Bible knew their stuff. But I'm sorry, but that's just not true. One of the most difficult things in learning Hebrew is to follow along with the story. And for a Jew, learning the story of Abraham and the flood is just not going to happen. It just didn't make sense for Weiss to try to make the Bible a good book if it wasn't. Then I read the first part of the book about the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. As you know, Jews do not celebrate Sukkah and Passover, so when I found this part of his book, I had no idea what to expect. And it was nothing good. Weiss has a very poor understanding of the Jewish festival of Sukhotha, as he said that the Jews do the same thing in the first week of July every year. He said it is just a pagan holiday that should be avoided by the Jews. Not only is this completely untrue, but Weiss has an interesting way of using the term pagan, and I've seen it used in several places by others. I think we have to call it a "Christian holiday" for it has the same religious significance as Passover. Weiss claims that God only
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. ______________. __________________________. _________________. ____.  I bought the copy of this book I found on the shelf at the library. I was intrigued by its title and by the cover which seemed familiar but could not recall its author or title. I searched for the title of the book but could find nothing. I felt it should be a book that will be useful to people with the same interests as myself. So I picked it up and started reading. I have no idea what to say other than to say, it was not very good. Not just the writing, but the idea. I really did not know where I was going with the book. The "concept" was interesting, but not very realistic. My interest was to learn how to make my own paper money, not to learn about the stock market. In fact, if the author of this is still writing this type of book, it is pretty much a waste of time.   I did not like the way the author used the "business model" for this book. He seemed to think that the idea of making a book like this is just a "business" or something similar. He made it sound like the book should be something that will teach people about the various money making and investing ideas. He talked about different ways to "get in on the ground floor" of this type project. I am not sure about those. I would be interested in a book about starting a business that is more of a business. The first chapter in the book is about what he calls "the money-making machine" or some other such terms. It is really a book for people who want to start a business or want to do some kind of financial venture, but want to learn something about it. I never wanted to learn anything about money making or investing, I was just looking for some good financial tips.   and one of the most frustrating things about the book was that there is so much talk about financial strategies, but little or no discussion of how to actually make your own money. The book is very basic and should be called "How To Do A Book, A Series". The book would have been much better if he had just used some common sense business practices and avoided the "money-making" terminology.   (hide spoiler)] (view spoiler)  The book begins with some introductory material on money making, then goes into a chapter that explains a series of financial ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!I have now read this book, and have the worst time ever. The main character had no development, and his story was so clichéd, and unoriginal that it made me want to vomit every chapter. And it was just too bad that the book was only 99 cents. I would've gladly paid double the price for the real story! This book is so bad that I will never go back to the Harry Potter series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *****************   I was so excited to start reading "The Last King of Osten Ard" and I had been eyeing the first few books in the series for years. I had seen many reviewers rave about this book and I was looking forward to it, but I got a little disappointed.   My main complaint with the book was that I couldn't stop thinking about the book and was left in a state of despair after I had finished. In one scene I got so obsessed with thinking about that the characters in the book that I had to keep reading the next chapter. It didn't help that there wasn't any real plot. I couldn�t tell what was going on in this book or why things were happening, except that I was very, very interested. The writing was so bland and the characters and setting were dull. The plot seemed to move at a snail�s pace. It wasn�t until the last couple of chapters that I got really into the book but even then I felt as though I was just going through the motions. There were a few things that annoyed me, but mostly it�s the pacing.   the ending seemed too convenient to me for it to work as a conclusion to the series. The characters are still not fleshed out and there are a couple of plot holes that left me baffled. It all seemed so contrived and it bothered me that the book ended on such a lame note.  , but then again, I read and review horror and fantasy. I am sure the author was just trying to create suspense and excitement so that I would continue reading and not feel let down and let the book down. This book is a little too cliché for me and I found it too obvious.I was not thrilled with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! Why, just let me write a negative one about this book. I was so excited to start reading this. I read about a thousand books before I actually got around to reading this one. I knew it was good, and it certainly has good characters. I did a bit of research and I knew there were two women in this story: Anna and Elsa. I wasn't entirely sure about Anna. She's a smart, intelligent young woman. She was a bit naïve, which is not my cup of tea, but she was nice, caring and sweet. She did not disappoint. I really enjoyed Elsa. She didn't look exactly like the movies, but her personality fit perfectly in this book! I liked her, and I liked that she was not evil. I liked the friendship she formed with Anna. I think she was probably very shy at first but she grew into a pretty badass woman who's able to take on almost anything. It was great to read this story, and now I want to watch the movies. A very good read, but not worth the price! I recommend the movie version over this book :)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite books, I just never quite got into this book. There were some points I really loved, like the idea that people will often think that they're better than others because of who they know or because they're white. And also some of the moral lessons of the book, like that we have to value our friends and family, especially the people who are like us. It's a tough thing to teach kids. I have to say, this is also where the book loses me the most, with the "What I'd do if I wasn't a feminist" chapter. There's also a chapter called "The Price of a Woman's Ego," which I just couldn't get behind, because it made no sense at all. There wasn't really anything about the idea of a man's "ego" as such. It didn't have anything to do with being angry or angry at a man. If anything, he's "bad" because he won't allow women to be free and do what they want.   Another thing that really annoyed me was how often men are called "mansplaining" and "manslamming." If I can't understand what a man is doing, it seems like he's either incompetent or a sexist. But no, he had no idea that she was going to be pregnant.   of course this book doesn't have all of the answers - you are not a feminist! - but it has a lot of advice. This was a great book to read to my tweens when I was the age they were when I first started. They had a blast!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If there is such thing as bad news, this book is bad news.   This book is a waste of time, space and money.  I am not in favor of the use of drugs and I am against it in any way or form.  This has nothing to do with the book and is nothing I am going to use to learn anything in life.  If you have read any of the books from the other reviewers that are all in favor use of marijuana, you will notice that their books do have a different tone and this book does not.  There is no reason for people to use drugs and that includes adults.  The book does give some facts about marijuana and how it effects the brain.  You might be interested in the book because of all the facts but you might not care about what the book says.   I am hoping that some of the information I have learned on the Internet will help me, but in the end, this is a bad, bad book.  It is a shame because it is not my favorite book. If you like it, you can get it in paperback at Amazon for $17.99

If I had to choose just one thing to be horrible about the book, it would have to be the "Suspicious Death" section, because of the poor translation of "sour" from the Japanese version. The translator does this, of course, by adding an exclamation point after every verb, so he could keep writing that a certain character is "suspicious" of a particular death. However, even with that, the translators still can't get the word "soul" right. I guess "soushin", which is how they spell it in Japanese, sounds exactly like the English "soup", although the two words sound completely different to me.  The author seems to have written it like it's "sou" in Japanese.  the last part of the book is also confusing, since the author doesn't make sense. For example, the section where he talks about a character's death is supposed to be in Japanese but is filled in with "soun" and "souk" words, and the sentence "He has the taste of soup... " is supposed be "his sense of taste" but is read as "sourshin" and not "sōbatsu".   My other gripe with the book was the last section about "the end", which ended up being one of the worst parts. The author tries to imply that this is an "end of the world" type of book, but the book actually starts off by having the reader question if the book has really happened. The "end" part also seemed to be an afterthought since the end of the entire book just turns out to be one of those "fate"-type endings.   This is my first book, and I don't think this was an author I would want to read more of. The writing and grammar are really bad, the translation really wasn't good, and it just made me want to throw the book across the room.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This is a very poor book. There is too much repetition and information to remember. One of the characters (a doctor) is a complete failure, and all of his advice is very bad. I was only able to follow the "saying the same thing over and over again" bit by bit. There are so many mistakes that I can't figure out how to learn anything from this. I know that this book was written in the 60's, but this is no way to learn! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Did you enjoy this review?

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________________________________   The main character was not bad, but as with so many books, she wasn't very interesting. For me, the main character had too many flaws, and none of them seemed important to her character. I felt that the whole story was a bit forced, especially toward the end. I don't know what happened to her, but that wasn't me. I was hoping that she was trying to find some kind of redemption. It's not like the book was so bad that it made me feel cheated out of having the character, but her problems were too obvious, and not nearly interesting enough to make me really care. I didn't have a clear picture of what was going on, so I had no clue who to root for in the end of the book.   There was an entire section that was very confusing. I would love to know who was on whose side, but the book didn't give me that option. So, I think that the author did some editing and proofreading, and it's probably better. It just didn't come out the way I remember it from the book (which wasn't that bad). The story just kind of took a different path than I remember. I could tell, however, that she had an idea going into the book, so that may have made it even worse.  , a young lady who's been raised by the military and whose father was in the army. As a result, she has a lot of military experience, and she's seen it all. I loved how she knew the right things to do in many of her situations. She was very smart, and I liked her. However, there were a lot more problems with her. For example, she had too much time on her hands. I'm a busy person, and if I didn 't have to deal with my own problems, I wouldn't work on my problems. I know I can handle my own, but she was always thinking about something else, and then had to deal when she couldn't work anymore. Then, there was the issue with her father. He was kind of annoying. I found it odd, but I was a girl and wasn't supposed to think that way, but he did. I got the impression he felt he had to be in control, and that made me kind of irritated. I can't imagine what he was thinking about when he was writing the stories. He seemed to be trying to be very realistic and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on a whim. The cover was super cute and I wanted to read it, but I did not. There are so many errors in this book that it is hard to find a single point that makes it an enjoyable book. There is not one single character that we really get to know. Instead, we have a plot that has absolutely nothing to do with anyone that we know. I found myself constantly looking up the person that was being talked about. I did NOT want to read this, even if it was free. I was left with an ache in my heart after I finished. -L.B.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book just does not add up to the hype. The author claims to have created this book from a series of writings that he had done in the past. This seems to be the first real attempt to write the actual stories. However, this book just skips most of the important bits of the stories (at least from the book itself). He also makes a big deal about a man having a great time in the world of magic, but there is no mention of anything that happened after he left the book. If he really wanted to make this book seem more believable he could have made the time jump and mentioned more of what happened. This book is nothing more than the fantasy story that the author wanted to write, and I can't understand how someone who has never done this could think that this would be a great story to write.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I don't think I've had a book that's been as depressing as "Bones", a novel that I really liked. There were so many moments of hope but I was not able to enjoy them. Maybe there is hope after all. I think this book is one of the worst, though not in the least, of a series of books that were very much in my mind. I did like "Pillow Talk" quite a lot but this book wasn't as good as "Pills". It was more in line with "Bond" or "A Beautiful Mind".
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ This is a bad read. It's just boring and repetitive. There's not a lot of depth to it and it's mostly just repeating things. I think I would have been better off just reading the bible for one day if I had bought this book. It makes a poor replacement for bible study.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all, I had not enjoyed any of the books that I had read that featured magic. I guess I had just accepted that they were magic books and not real books. I was wrong. I think they are very good books. In fact I read one of them twice before I decided to start the second one.   This book is very difficult to explain. I can not go into details because it is hard for me to explain what magic was in this book. So I will just say this book is about people who make stuff come to life. I didn't realize what I wanted to say but if you love magic you will love it.  , if you have ever wondered what people used to make stuff and where they got the materials for it, I think you will like this book, and the people who made it.  I really love the story of this book and the characters. I like how the people in this world used the power of the moon and the sun to do various things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:..................................................... I've read this book in two different editions, once by the original author (G.P. Putnam), and again by D.E. Mathers. There's one big difference between the two: Putnam used color photos, and so does Mather. The book was in color. The photos are better and more clear than they were in the Putnam edition. There are some great photos of the history of the area, as well as the many different churches that were built. Some are in color, and the others are in black-and-white. The new edition is less than half the size of the original. Overall, the Putman edition was a nice read, though the color photos are much better than those in the original book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ I was expecting an easy read. It is easy to start. The problem with this is that it takes so long to get anywhere. The author does not tell you why this is the case, he does not give you any ideas. There are a total of 16 chapters to get through and it takes a very long time to do that. The end of each chapter is all about the same thing with the same answer and you have no choice but to continue reading just to get to the next chapter. My problem is I am now in the middle of this book. The second half of the book I really wanted to get around to reading more about the people in the community and my own personal thoughts. There were some very important stories that the author was able to tell. Unfortunately, these stories were in the last part of the last chapter and when I was done reading I was still in the same chapter as I was when I started. I don't know if this is due to the author not having time to tell you what is going on, the author trying to make a point that a lot of the same people are around to help you out or how this works. It was all a bit frustrating. It took almost an entire chapter to get back to where the book was supposed to be. It would have been better if I was reading this book when I first started so I knew where the story was going to go. The only reason I did not give it a 1 star is that the characters were interesting. The way they were written, the way the author told them, the character relationships were great. I would like to see more characters in future books. Overall I really liked this book, but I am not sure if I am going to want to read more.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   In a world where I can only watch my children, I've made the decision to write about my experiences with a great book.   This book was so frustrating. It took me so long to get started with this book. Then I was so frustrated as I read the last part. I feel that I should have read this book in the beginning, before starting this great adventure with my kids.   the characters are so confusing that I did not understand their characters at all, I could not even remember their names at the end, but I kept reading anyway.   and what was really confusing to me, was that the kids were telling their life stories. I thought, ok, what is going on? Why are they telling their stories? Why were they doing this? And then I came to the conclusion, these were their lives that I knew, and it was all in my head, so what is this book? It was kind of a letdown after I had the wonderful read about the other kids. I just wanted to get back to the story with them.  , not sure why you would put this book up for sale. It was a horrible read. I would have preferred another book by the same author and had to spend more money to get a different story, but then again I paid so much for this book, why not? This book was not worth the money that I paid for it. The characters were very confusing. I am not sure what was going on. I can not remember what they did, what they ate, what their daily routine was, why they were telling the stories or who they were. The illustrations were not great either. This book is not for the young adult market or anyone who loves children. It is not a good book for young children. I give this book three stars, just because I wanted to buy the other book and read it instead of spending all this money on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the books, but it was a little confusing at times. It took me a little bit to get used to all of the characters. I don't think I'll read another book about this subject in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~A great book with some poor writing.~~ In the first book, you get an amazing introduction into the subject, which is well written and extremely detailed. The book discusses the main components of how to play poker and the various strategies used by some of the greatest poker players the world has ever seen. The most memorable part of the book was the discussion about how the two top pro players in the world (Rudy and Phil) were able to outplay each other during the 2007 World Series of Poker. The writing in this book is solid, and the information presented is very helpful to anyone who's playing poker. However, when it comes to poker strategy, the author seems to have taken some of his lessons from the "Big Bang" and put them all into one short book. The main focus of this book was on how to beat the best players in poker by creating a winning strategy, but there were so many other aspects that were not touched upon at all. For example, why was it so difficult for Phil and Rudy to beat a single player (Carlos Ochoa, who finished 7th in 2007) when they both beat everyone else? I feel like the author took a lot of his Big Bang knowledge and put it all into this book and there is no reason why that shouldn't be a good strategy if it works for that one particular opponent. I felt like the best part about this book (and this will come as a huge disappointment to anyone that reads this review) is that this book isn't available in audio format. It seems that the audio format is what makes the Big Bang books so valuable to the poker community, but they really should stick with printed book format or even the computer readable book format. I'm not saying the book is worthless because it's in audio, but it would be nice to see some of these strategies in a form that was easily accessible.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I had never read any books by this author before this one. I had bought this book as a Christmas present and the book arrived late in the day. It was a little rough to read. At one point I had to read over it once more just to make sure the errors didn't show up again. There were times when I would have liked to stop reading the book and go back to my computer to get on with the work that needs to be done, but my poor internet connection would not allow me to do so. I also did not enjoy the picture on the inside of the book. I can understand that there might be a little more to the story, but it would have been nice to see the artist's work. My problem with the book is that it feels like it takes forever to get to the end, and even if you do read it, you feel like there is more to come. I could have easily finished the book in a couple of days. I think that this book could have been better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I did read it, it was a lot better then I thought it was going to be. I am surprised by the quality. I had it on a kindle but it's too big for me and I have a pretty large book collection, this is the first time I read a collection. I like the style, the writing, it's not overly technical it's light on detail but not too simple either. I wish it was easier to find the right book to read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________ I didn't like this book at all. I mean, the idea of a "love spell" is intriguing and I get that people use these things when they are in trouble. The problem I had with the book is that the way the story was structured wasn't very interesting. I couldn't really connect to the main character. Her mother told her the story of a witch who casts the spell on a girl who is having a difficult time of it, so the girl is cursed to be in love with the boy and have all her sexual needs fulfilled. At the start of the story the father tells the mother to put on a movie so that the daughter will be able to be free of the spell. When the daughter gets to the theater, she is unable to do anything other than watch her parents have sex. It's very confusing to me. I think the book was written so well that I couldn�t really feel what the main characters were feeling. I just felt like the mother was writing the story for her daughter. She didn't seem to care much about the actual girl she was trying to control. I didn�t understand what she was doing. There were also a lot of sexual innuendos that were a little too much for my liking. I know a lot people like this kind of thing but I think this was just a little over the top for me. It just seemed too over thetop and not very romantic. I would have preferred the book to be a little more romantic. However, it still would have been entertaining and interesting to read. Overall I didn,t feel anything for the main girl. I feel sorry for her. I wish she had a better story to tell about the love spell.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book with a bit of trepidation. I had only read the first book and thought it was a really good read. In this book, they tell how they first met, their childhood and growing up. But as I read this, it got more and more disturbing. They really don't do anything, except be there and have the right opinions. They are so sheltered from the world, they don't even realize what it is like to feel fear. And their only joy is getting in a fight and then running off. It makes me sick. This book makes me want to stab my sister to death. The girl I know who had these thoughts, she was actually a very nice and loving person. She was good to me. I don't know what this book was about. It was just about the two, who were so sheltered. I think they just wanted to get some "bad man" to be their mate. And that they just needed to be the boss and not have to go to work. What I Liked: This is one of the best books I've read recently. This is a story about how two friends who were both very sheltered as a child got involved in the world of "bad men". They didn't want to be a bad man themselves, so they went to "the man". But in order for them to go with him, they were supposed to give up their own opinions. So that they would get all of the right information. But this is where I started to become concerned about the author's ideas. What I wanted to do in this book is to get a hold of my friend and try and tell her what she thought. I was able to do this in the first part. But in this part I was unable to get any of the information because I didn't have any of her opinion and because I wasn't sure what I wanted in this situation. It made me feel like a very good friend, who was just being used by her friend. And I felt very betrayed. I did not want to have my thoughts taken by her. It's not her fault if she wants a "bad" man, I'm just not going to let her be the judge. This was the reason why I had a lot of problems with this book. I'm not just going to agree with her. That's not what this world needs. 6. I Am a Stranger:  This book took me by surprise. My
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be "stupid." The author has absolutely no interest in writing, or her chosen subject in general. The subject of her book is her divorce. The story is so boring that it doesn't make it any less of a waste of your time. The plotline has the same story over and over again, but each time it's more painful and boring. There are some parts of this story that are very interesting and interesting. But I don't want to read a book about this subject and just hope that I don'st have a major mental illness.   If you are just looking for an easy read for your brain then you might enjoy this book, but if you are trying to learn about marriage, divorce or life in general, you'd probably be better off finding a more entertaining way to do it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to help me decide whether to keep reading this series. At the start, I had hoped that this book would bring some closure to the series. But I'm not really sure if this is what the author wanted or expected from this book.   It didn't help me much that the author is the same who wrote the series and wrote the sequel, either. I don't even think he has read the previous books yet, although it's apparent that he's working on a new book. So, I'm left with a very vague impression about what's going on.   is a pretty good read, with the occasional good plot twist and cliffhanger. It does have a couple of very dull chapters (although, when it came to plot, it's only those three that I really had to work very hard to read), but this doesn't bother me much. I do like the characters and the story line. The characterization in this book was very good, especially in the beginning of the book. It doesn't take long for the plot to start going in the wrong direction.  , and that was pretty much the only thing that I thought was worth mentioning. I didn't like the writing style. I usually don't like when the author tries to do anachronistic dialogue, which can be anachronic because it's written after the time period that the book takes place in. Also, the "thespian" characters are all the same and don't seem to really have an individual personality. I'm also not a huge fan of the way the author has the characters write their thoughts. I think it's very strange that the characters would be in a state where they have a lot to say, when they have no idea of how to express themselves. I feel like there should be more characters who write in the third person, like the narrator. In the beginning, I was a bit confused with what the characters were saying. The author also doesn't know how to write romance. He does try to cover it up with a bit of humor, but it's still very dry and cliche.   This isn't a bad series by any means. I just don't think it is what you would expect from this author.  - Review written on 8/25/11   "Thespian": It is written in third person POV, and the narrator doesn't appear to have any real voice.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________This book is just plain wrong. The author says he got his PhD in physics from Princeton University. He claims he was a student and lab assistant in his PhD. He was in a group that made the first electron accelerator, and he was part of a team that discovered that electrons go through holes in the medium, and that this caused them to go through the wall. The wall could not be thought of as a hole as it was made of matter. So he claims he could have done it. The first electron was discovered by this Princeton team. The second electron was made by a team in France. These teams were doing different work, the first was doing high temperature plasma, and the other was doing experiments on the electron's spin and properties. It is not correct to say that the electron went through a hole in the wall or through a second electron. The team that made a lot of the important discoveries were Princeton researchers. I am amazed that he got a Ph.D. He did not have to work with these teams. He had plenty of time to do research on other subjects. He also claims that the particle accelerator was a very high-energy machine, but he does not mention that the experiment was on a sub-atomic scale. The high energy experiments were on a scale where high energy particles can be produced. The sub-atom scale experiment was at a lower energy where the electron could not even be seen. The electron was too small to be seen, but the protons were observed. The electrons did not even go through a wall. When he gets around to saying that the holes in a wall can cause an electron to go, he states that the hole in a magnetic field could be used. But the hole would not be the same as the hole he is talking about in a vacuum. In a magnetic bubble of the magnetic field of the wall, the wall could become very distorted and the electrons would not travel through the walls. I really do not know how he came up with this idea. But there is no way it could be correct. He could not have found a particle that travels through a magnetic wall. But I was not sure if he was going to talk about electrons going through a field in an experimental setup. I was so busy reading that I did not think about it for a long time. When I saw that there was a correction, I thought the author could not possibly be telling the truth. When someone is so wrong, it becomes hard to know if

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of my time. It was an interesting book. It just felt like a chore to read it. I don't think the author knows anything about science. It took me 10 pages to figure out it was all about a conspiracy involving the oil company and a professor who has a huge reputation as a climate change denier. The book was so over-simplified that it was hard to understand, or to take a position.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________   The first sentence of the first chapter tells you all you need to know about this book. It says that it is "a first person narrative of two women who are drawn together by a mysterious encounter in the city's history." In other words, you already know that the story will be narrated in the first person.   I wasn't a huge fan of this narrator, though I wasn't overly harsh about it. I actually found him to be quite nice; his voice was not that of a caricature and it actually sounded believable. In fact, I found myself liking the narrator a lot more than I did the author, even though the author was clearly more talented.  ....   If you are the sort of person that hates a narrator because the narrator is not a stereotypical "southern accent" or "blonde" or whatever, I suggest you don't read this book (the first chapter is an extremely short and shallow description of the characters' upbringing and life experience). In fact if you like a certain sort of voice, I would suggest you try to read this and not the author's first novel or anything.  , although I really liked the first few pages I found the rest of the book somewhat annoying. The characters were extremely one dimensional and boring, and the story lacked any sort of excitement or sense of urgency. I also think it was somewhat obvious that the author wanted to create an interesting, well-rounded, believable protagonist. However, she was clearly too much of a fan of the protagonist and never took the time to make the story interesting.The author is definitely good enough to be able to write well, so I hope she does write more books, but I think I would have enjoyed this book a lot less if it had been narrated by a different person.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________  The author is a pompous, narcissistic little shit. There is no depth in his character at all. In the first chapter he starts out with a story that his "friend" sent him and in the second chapter his "sister" wrote in about their relationship and how he made her so mad she made him send it to her. I had to stop reading because it was just stupid. I was so bored by this novel I just threw the book on the floor and picked it up again because there was nothing else to read. I will definitely not be buying any more of his books. I'm sorry, but the world is better when no one knows anyone is stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- It is just an OK book, with the author trying to be interesting. It is mostly in the last chapter that the book goes off track. It should be about the story and the characters. If you get the characters right, the story will be ok, but this is not a good story. One of the characters is very dull, and the other is very irritating and annoying. Not my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In other words, I liked the book, and only enjoyed the first few pages, when it was clear that this is not going to be a fun time.  But I was so disappointed and felt cheated out of a great story, because the author made me wait and waited for a climax, which never comes.  In the beginning of the book the protagonist and heroine, the princess and the princess's tutor, are both in their early teens.  After a brief conversation about their respective homes, they begin an innocent game of "Truth or Dare" which the princess has been playing with her teacher since they were a couple of years old.   As the game progresses and the teacher reveals his feelings for the princess the game quickly turns to the sexual element, and in a matter of pages the student is on her knees before the tutor.  I was quite disappointed when I realized this was going to become the only point of contention in the relationship, as it quickly devolved into a sex-filled episode which culminated with the teacher taking the princess out to the woods and having her kneel before him while she performs oral sex on him.  As much as I liked the game and the two characters, I found it to be nothing more than a setup and was left with a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. If you've ever watched the show "Will and Grace," or read any of the Harry Potter books, you will be familiar with the scene where the groom takes a bride to the forest for a "honeymoon."  There have been plenty of books and movies based on the "Love Letters" of "Will" and the "Gentlemen's Agreement" of Mr. Darcy, but the "Honeymoon of a Lifetime" as the authors have dubbed it, was far too over-the-top for my tastes.  It was nothing more but two young people who were very young when they met and fell in love with one another, who decided to have a "Honeysuckle" rather than a real wedding.  For me, however, the authors of this book were right.  In fact, they had a brilliant idea, but did a terrible job of writing the plot.  The "HONEYMOON" was about two young lovers who, despite being at opposite ends of the age spectrum, decided to spend their last night together, despite the fact that they are both sixteen.  This makes sense for Will,

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has all the hallmarks of being a modernist masterpiece: a huge, sprawling, complex, and (at least at times) incomprehensible text written by an author who is just too smart for his own good. But it just doesn't work. The plot revolves around a family, the Bekkis, and the people they deal with - the Pelties and their friends. This book takes about 600 pages to get into, which is just a waste of so much time that could be spent actually doing something more interesting in a life that already seems so busy. The Peltie's and their neighbors are just so bland and boring, and their lives and reactions to their troubles and adventures are nothing more than plot devices. I would not read another book about a group of people living in the wilderness, dealing with people, and finding themselves in such a small amount of time, especially one written by someone who is really smart and has a lot of time on his hands.   The Bekkin's were just boring and stupid. At least the Pelta's were entertaining.   a book lover of the late 40s and 50s
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I did not like the book as much as I wanted to. The characters are one dimensional and not very interesting. The plot is very contrived and poorly written. It has the feel of a story about a woman trying to get a divorce. There are just too many plot twists, which do not make sense and don't add any value to the story. For this reason, I gave the book only 3 stars. There is a good story but it has no real depth or originality. ********** I would recommend this book to anyone. *****************
Write a negative review about a bad book:................................................. I love to read about the history of this area of the country and how the culture of it changed from what it was in the middle ages. I can't put it into words the feeling of relief I felt when I finished this book. This book was a great refresher and a new look into the early history of the land.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   So far, I have only read this one (and I have the 3rd, 4th and 5th in the series), and it is a definite improvement from the previous books in the "Fenrir and his friend" series. If you like epic fantasy, read this.  12 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was boring and predictable, and there was absolutely no payoff for any of the characters.  The book ends, which I assume is a cliffhanger that was supposed to be a good sign, but it was totally spoiled.   I also would have preferred that the main character, the bad guy in this story, wasn't a complete idiot.  I have never hated a bad guy more in my life than this guy.  I loved the beginning of the book, it felt like the book was supposed too be a one shot and I had no idea that I was reading a series.  The series was also very fun to read.  What a fun story it was.  All the characters were likable, and the author even showed some empathy for them.  He actually showed a couple of bad boys who didn't deserve to be there.  It was great to read about a man in a wheelchair who was not only a thief, but a sociopath as well.  His life was not easy, but he was also a great example of a guy who took his life out of his own hand.  And the villains of the story were equally as bad, but did not get a lot of screen time.  This series ended well enough, I was satisfied with the ending, which made me sad when it ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this one. It just wasn't good for me, even though it's called a sci-fi novel. I liked the other ones in the series so much that I wanted more. I read the first book in the trilogy and then decided to wait until the last book before reading the next one. I didn`t want to read about a war between two alien races with a good part of the book being spent on their first meeting. I know what you`re saying: this is science fiction, what else is new. Well, what`s new? Well, aliens, that's what! Anyway, I still really didn` t like this book. The characters were sooooo stupid, I just couldn`t care less about anything that happened to them. There was also a lot of humor that I couldn` t get past, like the aliens using language that was very complicated and they had their own way of describing everything that happened in the novel (or not happen) like that time when they said that the alien's eyes were the size of their heads. I had to read the next book in that trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A terrible book. I got this book in the mail and have read through the first half and I was disgusted with it. I feel like I'm reading an adult version of a children's book. There are no scenes, no dialogue, no humor and no plot. There was no story at all, only a bunch of nonsense, and an almost unbearable amount of cursing. The story was basically about a cat that is very depressed and tries to kill himself because he hates everyone and everything and hates his life. It was like an adult cat made into a childrens book. So it was very hard to listen to. The book started off really bad because the characters and the story were awful and I didn't enjoy it at all. The next part of the book didn't even make sense. It felt like the author was bored or just didn't know what to do. But the last part of this book is really stupid. It had absolutely no plot and just about everything was just wrong. I guess the author wanted to write a book with an actual story about an adult with depression and couldn't write it. Overall, I don't think I'll be reading this book anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________  A wonderful, fascinating book about the development of a new and better way of building a society based on self-governance and mutual cooperation. The concept is that we need to come up with an alternative to the current system based on the division of labor. It's a bit dated now, but the ideas presented in the book still apply today.   I liked the way the author presented the concept of cooperative, mutualistic, local, autonomous, community-controlled, and participatory economics, as well as the need to avoid the current financial collapse and the political polarization. The book ends with a call for an economic and cultural revolution that will result in the complete re-ordering of our society based around the new, better, and more inclusive idea of a self-governing, self-organized, and self-sufficient community of self-managed and selfsufficient people.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book. The world building was very interesting, with a few nods to other worlds, and the characters were likable. While I didn't agree with some aspects of it, it certainly kept me interested and I found myself wondering if this world was like one of those old Star Trek episodes where they could travel the stars, or if it would lead to all sorts of weird things. It did end on a cliffhanger though, and in the end I'm still not sure where this book was going. It felt rushed, like a short novel. I also found the ending a bit contrived. It was kind of funny, but it didn't come across as real and there wasn't enough time to develop the story. I think it would have been nice to have some resolution before the book ended, but I would definitely recommend it as a short read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________ This is a book on how to get better at chess, but I just couldn't get into the idea of learning how to master the game in order to get to master a specific opening. I'm not sure how any such thing can be a useful technique, but it is certainly interesting and interesting for a different reason. I found it very difficult to read. This book would work for someone who wants to improve at chess and who has studied this material but can't get past the "how" to "why" of this stuff.
Write a negative review about a bad book:.............................I have a bad habit of buying one book and then after reading it for the third time thinking I would like to buy the next and so on and so forth. I was never able to get myself into this one. I read the first time because I thought it was going to be a great book, but then the story just didn't have that spark. This is the first book I read in a while and I was so bored by it, but the story never stuck with me again. It is just so very generic. I mean the world doesn't have a great history or something or you know something that you would want to read more about and you are given a few interesting characters but they don't do anything special and they are all very bland. They do make an appearance in the end and I can see why, but that is all they do to get to the ending. So all I can say is I wish I had read this book from the beginning. I have never had this problem with a book before but now that I think about it that is a real shame as I would have liked to read this one from the get go.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst part about this book is that I will never finish it!  After reading and writing this book, I was so eager to read it again that I had to make it a point to get it off my hands.  When I did finish it and realized I was never going to finish it, I went to the library and got another copy.  Positives: - The character interactions were some of the best I've ever read.  - The story has such interesting plot twists and many different ways to interpret it. - The dialogue is excellent.   I have never been so disappointed in a story.  I thought the book was going to be one of the greatest I've read, but I just can't find it.  This book is just horrible.  It's just a big let down.  As a bonus, the art was amazing.  You guys are amazing!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book did not make me feel as though I was enjoying it. It was an exercise in the most boring subject I've seen in a while: the study of what can happen in different places in a city and the difference in people's reactions to it.  As someone who really enjoys books that explore what the average person would find the most interesting about the most mundane of situations, I found this a failure.  About the Author A few months ago, I got a bit of an "aha" moment. It happened while reading a book on the subject of street harassment. I couldn't quite put my finger on what made it happen, but I was so surprised by it, and by how few people even talk about it, that I started to think about this book and what I liked about it. I did a quick Google search for the author and found that she writes a lot of fiction (about women and sexual abuse) and she is really good at writing them. She's published in small presses (The Good Stuff Press, and Other Stories). She's written about rape, and her characters are often traumatized by what happened to them. This book was one of the ones she wrote about. It's one of her short stories about rape in her fiction. If you haven't read this book, I suggest you do, especially if you love books on rape or are in a serious relationship with someone who's raped or has survived rape. The author is pretty open about what happened, and how she and her boyfriend, when they were dating, knew about the rape, but had no idea how to react to it, or that it was an act of sexual violence. The book tells a very good and realistic account of what happens when an innocent guy (the boyfriend) falls in love with a girl (the protagonist) that he meets at an art festival. I wish I could tell you that they have great chemistry and that the book is sweet, but sadly, that's not the case. The story is slow going, and the writing isn't always the best, but it does manage to capture the experience of an actual, real, and ongoing act of violence.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  The first time I read this book was with the help of an advanced course on self study. I found it to be terribly inadequate. It is written in an incredibly dry and academic style. You cannot read the book and not be overwhelmed. The writing and argumentation are dry and very little of what is said is actually used to justify the claims made. It's like one person talks for hours about the reasons he believes there are no other intelligent civilizations out there and then the other person points out the problems with this belief and the author says "Oh yes I thought so too, but it turns out I was wrong". The whole thing just reads like a lot of dry, boring intellectual jargon.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really enjoyed this book. It's a well-written book. But there's a few things that really bother me. First, as others have said, it's too long. That's not an issue for me because my mind is always getting somewhere, and I read a lot. But it was enough that the ending seemed a little abrupt. But really, it could have been a little longer, because I think it's a good book with an interesting theme.   Next, while the characters do end up solving the puzzle, it wasn't a satisfying ending. The solution to the mystery had nothing to do with the characters and the real question wasn't answered. I also found the author to be a bit sloppy in her writing. I didn't think she wrote a very convincing mystery. I would've preferred a tighter narrative that didn't leave things hanging or make things seem vague and confusing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a horrible book. I read it last night for the first time and I hated every second of it.

How can they be that horrible and make money from it? Why would anyone read this?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was a bit confusing for me. I started reading this book without knowing where I was or what the title referred to.   First I thought the author was talking about a kind of fruit called  fruitcake. I didn't read this book until about half way through and I was a little confused how he could say something about a fruit cake that wasn't fruit cake. Then I looked it up and it was about a cake that was made from  fruit.  This author was very vague with me, and I don't think he did a great job explaining the topic.  I feel like this book could have been better if it was written differently, because I don.t think the fruit cake idea was the best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The thing is that the first two were really good, and this one is just awful. I mean, I like the writing of other books (which I will discuss later), but it would not stand up to a serious book. My other book, the Dragonlance series, has more of a sense of place and a lot more character development. The writing in Dragonlance is really good. My problem with this book is that it's really, really hard to read, and not just because of the writing. It's just very difficult to read because it's so confusing and you just end up getting confused. And then, I just have this feeling like it's the author's fault because she had to do a lot of research in the history of the world. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but it does kind of ruin the fantasy element for me. Anyway, I liked the first book better, but this one just doesn't work for me at all. My rating:  ****
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "There is no way to describe how much this book sucked. I read a book that was completely lacking in substance, plot, and character. This book had to have taken at least 4 years to write, and would have been great to have been published at a more prestigious literary journal."   The worst part is that I am not going to finish it.   1. The author is a complete and total self-hater.  2. The characters are utterly boring, like cardboard cutouts.  in every way possible, except for their voices.  and their emotions. . If you haven't ever written a good book, please go do so. You can do it. I tried writing a good one. It is not hard at all. You don't have to be brilliant to do it, but it does require work. And I am pretty damned good at it.    3. I will tell you that I don't like any of the characters. I mean, they were pretty bland. I only thought it was funny when the "bad guy" called the hero a "pussy."  4. If I ever read a series that starts off so slow and boring that I have no interest in reading the next book, I am going to tell people to go fuck themselves. , it's the one that was so good. It got all the way to the end, and you didn't even read what was happening at the end of the book. That was all left on page 6, and I could have stopped there. Why didn't you? Why didn`t you at least have the decency to tell me what was going to happen to the hero at the very end of it? Instead, you kept on going for more. I am so sick of people like you making things up and then telling me that I didn't get it. When I buy your book, you should give me something that makes me say, "Wow, I must have missed something on page 7."If you have no respect for yourself, then don't expect anyone to give a shit about your book. You have no idea how hard it is to write a good story. The person you worked with on this had zero writing skills. If anyone else had to work with him, they would have known that there was no way he could have written this, but this guy had his writing teacher and he even told his professor about it! That should
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ This book does not do justice to this book. It would have been better had it been the other way around. As is, the characters are well thought out but not developed. It is hard for me to see why the character from the previous book was killed off in the first book. They just kept changing. They did not go much further with the story and it seemed to be a cop-out by the author. Also, as mentioned in a previous review, I was surprised how little detail was included about what the main characters had done in the past. This book could have been made into a movie or a series, but it would have needed to be more about the relationship between the characters. Overall, I can recommend this book for fans of the first one. I would give it 5 stars, but the story needs a lot more time to develop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The author clearly put a lot of thought into this book. However, the characters are not very convincing. The main characters are both strong, but the book does not develop their personality and motivation for any reason. For example, she uses a group of women to attack a man who wants to have an affair with her, but she is not even bothered by the fact that they are men. She only seems to have a problem with her father's ex-wife, not her own biological father. The only thing I found really interesting was that it was like a drama, but that could be a flaw since I'm not very familiar with drama.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so terrible, it's so bad, it'll probably haunt me my whole life. It's so awful. I've never read a worse book than this one. There is nothing good about this book.   The book is really long (almost 600 pages), with chapters written in such a confusing fashion. Every chapter is a complete mess, filled with mistakes and bad language. A couple of the chapters are a mess, in which you can almost not understand what's going on.     So the plot starts. We meet Tedd, a 12 year old girl who is about to go off to the school for witches. Tedd is a little weak in the beginning of the book and is constantly trying to prove to everyone that she's an amazing witch who can do magic. She's not a bad kid, but she's not smart, and she never seems to really get anything done. She is so stubborn, and her family will not allow her to go to the magical school because her father says he thinks she's "too weak to understand" things like "that it's important to do things the right way". But Tedd won't take no for an answer, and soon after she is whisked off to Hogwarts.   the book is filled with characters that are very poorly developed. The main character is very young, and it's always unclear whether or not her mother is actually her grandmother, because she is constantly referring to her as "mum". We also have a young boy called John. John is 12. He's a typical 11 year old boy, who loves to play with toys. He doesn't really have any real interests at school, and is completely obsessed with Harry Potter. He also likes to wear dresses.   But there's so much more. There's a 14 year old student named Mary. Mary is a total tomboy. She loves video games, and doesn't wear dresses, she's also got huge titties, and no one ever talks to her. She has a crush on John, but will not admit it. There are also three other characters that all have huge flaws, and are completely annoying, and we never really get to know anything about them.  , but it was really hard to keep track of all the characters and not go crazy and have to make notes for everything I was reading. So this was one of those books that I would probably forget almost instantly and have no idea what the hell was going

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ "This is just not a good book. The writing style is horrible. If you're a writer, this book is bad for you. It's a lot like reading a crappy blog on the internet. It just doesn't make sense and doesn't have any relevance or understanding of what is happening in this society, the state of the world, the issues or any of the issues that we have with the government, the economy, the media, etc." –Bennet, USA "This book is completely lacking in a story. I mean, there is nothing to it. And it has a lot of problems with its writing style that really have nothing to do with the subject matter. It doesn't work and it's not interesting to read." –Jason, New York "I don't want to read another book from this author, this is just ridiculous." –Von, Florida "This seems like something you might hear from a teenager who has gotten bored with reading and wants to write. I had no idea that writing was as difficult as it is, let alone that it could actually be as frustrating as it was." –John, Connecticut "This has more to do than any other book I've read about the current state of our society in general. It has nothing to say about what is going on in the world in general, but it has more than the entire current state. And to me, it is incredibly disappointing and boring. I found this one to be very boring and completely pointless. I have no doubt that the author's goal was to write a book that the reader would not enjoy and to make money on the back of that. However, I feel that the overall message this book tries to convey is very inaccurate and misleading. There is no reason for anyone to read this book as it does not say anything of value. It is only a poor attempt to make a quick buck by selling books on the Amazon store. I recommend you look elsewhere for a better understanding of our current society. Also, the book makes a very poor representation of the American Revolution. You know who really hated the British? The revolutionaries." –Daniel, Connecticut
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I didn't give it 2 stars was because of the ending.

Review by: Tanya G from Indiana on May, 25, 2015 :  My husband and I read this about a year ago and it was our favorite book until the ending of the story and the way the author ended the story.  I was in love with the character and she was a really wonderful author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I did enjoy the first few chapters. I liked the fact that the book was written by a woman. The protagonist seemed normal. I like the fact the book takes a look at different topics that would be too weird or offensive for some people to read about. The author seems to write for a wide range of readers. However, the character development, as described in the book, was way too slow. The story was very interesting, but the author could have written it better. The ending was horrible. The characters were not believable. The plot was too confusing and did not tie up at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I have bought the book and I will read it when I get home. I am sad that I purchased the book for a person with a small child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's good in its own right, but this is too long and a bit of a slog to get through.  I'm really looking forward to a future book, but if this one is any indicator I'll be holding out for some good writing and not necessarily for the length.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a total waste of time. I could not find any connection to the series whatsoever. I got this book to get an idea about what kind of novels the author read and the way they are presented. I had a feeling that this book was supposed to be a fantasy novel. I didn't see any references to any real world culture or people. I found the characters to be completely unlikable and the writing to be terrible. I read the book to see if the author had read any other books by the same author or a close relative. It is hard to imagine the author having read anything by that author. It was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first saw this book I was a little worried because I have heard good things about the author and she's known for being a good story teller. Then I read it and I was very disappointed. It's not a good book. I'm glad I gave it a try because I really had no expectations for it. I ended up reading it because of a review I read from a fan who said that she had the same problems I had with this book. So I read the book to see if she was right. I guess I'll just have to read the next book in the series. That will be a huge disappointment.   As far as the plot of the book goes I couldn't even remember it. It was pretty much a blur. If there were any plot points I could remember it was how a man found out what the world really was.  .I was really disappointed.   He couldn't accept that the world was what he thought it was and that there were other worlds. He felt he was living a dream, a dream that the man he was was living. And as a result the man couldn't see the truth. He didn't have to accept it. He had a lot of faith in the man to see the world for what it really was, and he knew what it was all about. So he tried to get him to see it. What happened? He didn the man, and then he told the man all that he had witnessed. The man was shocked. He couldn"t believe what he had seen. It scared him. He ran. And he never tried to talk to the man again.  (Note: If you've read this review you know that I'm not a big fan of the author. But I am a big John Green fan. She's not my favorite author by any means. I have enjoyed some of her books, but most of them have been bad. This one though is terrible. I will just leave it at that. But now I'm just going to let you read the review, and you'll see for yourself if I'm right or not.)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first sentence of this book says it all "When the door closes on your life, what do you do?" This is a very profound question.

I have been active my entire life, not just in school, but in my work, and my sports, but I never got around to doing anything meaningful. I have had an urge to act, but never had the motivation to do anything about it. I am still waiting.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________  I've read many books by this author and this is by far the worst one I've ever read. It's not a bad novel; it's not even a bad first book by the author; but it's a bad series of books that are very difficult to get through. The story is all over the place (and sometimes in the middle), the characters are clichéd and unoriginal, and the plot is confusing at times. The only thing the book has going for it is that the author writes in a style that's not so easy to read. Other reviewers say it's great; I just haven't found it enjoyable enough to continue with.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ I don't know whether I'm more disappointed in this book or I'm even more disappointed that I read it. After reading The Secret of Littleton, I was really hoping that my favorite fantasy would be able to come out with a better ending (I would have even read it a second time, if I hadn't had to rush to my other book). That's not what happened. The ending leaves you wondering who the heck this character is (well, me, for one, but that's another rant). In a lot of ways, I felt like I was a "bad person" and that is never the right way to read a book. I'd suggest this to those that are interested in a dark fantasy, but just don't like the way it ends.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  My friend had her friend read this book, and they are so not like me. In the first chapter, the author takes an interest in the girls at the high school that were all in the same band. This was just awful. Why would someone like that read about their own life? There was no feeling of realness to this book. The girls in the band had an amazing life and were amazing people. I found their lives in this book to be a complete bore. The main character was really not a likable character. He was the most unlikable character I have ever read. I would not recommend this book at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hated this book and the author, but this story is a gem.  It made me feel that I should have been there and be there, that I would have known what was going on and that it would have been easy to see the outcome of the plot and characters without having to read all the books.    There were no clues and no plot twists.  I would recommend this story to anyone who loves a good mystery, who enjoys the written word and is fascinated by the idea of how one person can change things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I wish my book had been better.   It is a long book.   There are a lot of places where you can find info about the history of the Church.   I learned that Joseph Smith never really had any personal visions.  He was just a kid in a box of books.  The people in the church really need to do a better job of teaching their children about the truth.  I went to school with Mormons.   It is amazing what they have been taught and they are so proud.  In the temple you do not get your own choice of clothes.  There are some people that believe you should get your clothes at your parents house.  What the heck is the point?  I was told to pray about my clothes. I found a site that had a few photos of Joseph and other Mormon women wearing the clothes. The girls were looking at them and they would not wear them!  I asked the boys to go home and look at them.  They all did.   Now these are girls of a high culture!  It is amazing the way they dress in some parts of the world.   So I guess that proves my point about some of the things in the scriptures being true.   If you live by a certain set of rules and you don't get around to the right answer in time,  then  your problems  will not be solved.  My brother was excommunicated.  He was a very hard worker.  Every year we were promised that he would get excommunicate.  The Lord never did it.   He got into a car wreck and died the next day.  We were told it was due to alcoholism and it was his fault.   Yes, they killed a man and they say it is due to his bad luck.  Jesus did the same thing and did not get the right answers and he did not die.  This church is not true! I love the Church!   It was founded by a man that lived in the woods with his wife and no one was allowed to have contact with him.   They have lied to us about everything for almost a hundred years.    He was killed in the same car wreck.   But all this nonsense is ok because he is no longer here.   The church is the only place where you will be safe and have the answers.   Not so in the other churches.   Here in our town the pastor will tell us we
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a really hard time deciding between this and The Bone Clocks. The Bone Chocks is a better story. The Bone chocks is so much more coherent in this one, as the characters come together to face the darkness that engulfs them. I had trouble finishing it, but it kept me reading and kept me thinking about it.    I wish it had been more like The Bone clocks.  So, as a reader that had read the first book and liked it (I had bought it for my daughter, and I loved the book and I am an avid reader myself), I decided to pick this one up for my niece and nephew. However, when I got it, I found myself bored and a little sickened by it. It's not that it was bad, it just didn't interest me. The characters were there, but there was nothing that made me think "oh yeah! this is the book I should have bought instead of this." (the story is really good, and this was an amazing story).   I did appreciate the use of music in this book, but I think it could have been done better. The music did add to the atmosphere, but was not enough to distract me from the story. I don't know why the book had such a bad ending. I loved every bit of it, and if I could give it anything more than one star, I would. This book would have been amazing as a movie, and would have gotten the top reviews from critics.  When I think of stories in the vein of The BoneChocks, I think about a story that has so many layers that make it an amazing read. I am thinking of the wonderful stories of The Lord of the Rings. I have loved reading these stories so much, that I have gone back to read them over and over again. The main problem with the story of The Boreal Chocks was that it's not the same story. It isn't the same world. It doesn't have the same magic. It has so much better things to say, that it makes me want to read the rest of the series. The story could have ended in the same way it ended. A young girl discovers that she can change the world, that she has to save it. She does save the world and goes home to live a happy life. A girl with no powers does the same, but instead of going home, she ends up in

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________ I can't believe I just bought this. It is a waste of money and time, I've read all the others, none of them compare. I am writing this review because it made me very unhappy because it is impossible to rate a book by just what you read on your own. I was very disappointed, it seemed to be another rehash of what I've already read before.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are several plot holes, which I am sure there were people who would find entertaining. However, my main beef is with the lack of characters and depth to the story. There is a lot of speculation of who killed who. This could be entertaining, and yet, that's all it is, speculation. If the author had put the time into developing a little more characters, this would have been better.  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: *******************The book was good, but it could be better.I love how the narrator told me exactly what was in the book, but how he didn't know how to make it any better. I like to be involved in my book, so I would be interested in something like this, but the narrator really ruined it for me. I couldn't understand anything he was saying, and I wasn't interested in getting involved in the story. I am so bad at giving advice, so please do read on your own. I also found that this book was hard to read because I couldn' t concentrate. I really need a book that I can put down for a couple of hours. I hate when I'm reading, and then it's hard to concentrate. ******************I've got my book. I'm going to be listening to this book over and over again. I think that the narrator is great, and the main character is a great heroine, but this book is just a lot of complaining and I hate it when I can't understand what is going on, and it really hurts my reading experience. ********I love reading, but I don't really have time to listen to audiobooks when I read. I want to be engaged in a book, not just listen to it. However, I love reading reviews, and this one is really good. It has some good advice about how to be a great writer, and also some good tips to make writing easier. **************

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book. I have loved the Harry Potter series since I was a child and so this seemed like a great idea. Unfortunately, I found it too boring, and I think the author did not use enough "fluff" material and was really too focused on the plot. I didn't enjoy much of the characters, although I did like the main character. I'm not sure if it would have been better if she was a bit more annoying or if I was just a bit bored of the author's style, but I think I could have given it more than a four star.   All in all, I give this book a one star, but it was really good for my "Harry Potter" fanfiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "The book was so-so. I wasn't impressed by the subject matter, and I wasn of the opinion that the story did not advance much. I thought there was a more interesting story to be told here, but I would probably read it again some other time."  ~David K. in Portland, Oregon on 6/5/2014   "It was an interesting book that, in my opinion, got its intended message but did so in such a manner as to make it extremely confusing and frustrating, that I am not even sure if the message was ever properly communicated."  "I found this book frustrating and tedious." "The book started off interesting but ended in a pointless way. I can not understand the author's intentions in writing the book in the way he did. The book was hard to follow and I was at times confused on what was happening. It made it difficult to follow what is going on. It was frustrating to the point where I did not want to read anything more." "It was a boring and pointless story. I was not entertained or educated." "I am very dissatisfied with this book and I found it very confusing and disappointing to read. It felt like there was an intention but none of it made sense and I had to look it up for the next chapters." "This book was a very poor attempt at a story. The story started off so interesting but I had no idea what was going on and felt totally lost. I feel that this story was poorly constructed, as it did not develop anything in the story and in fact seemed to only get worse with each chapter, as if the author was trying to get people to hate each other and see each other as nothing but bad. This book was completely incoherent, I could not follow what was supposed to be happening and the book was just too slow for me to read, as well. I highly recommend not reading this book. " "I have a difficult time with most books and this one seems to be the worst by far. The characters are too bland and I am frustrated that there are no real stories with them.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ This book was awful. I couldn't get past the cover image and the author didn't seem to have any interest in the story. The writing was choppy, repetitive, and not very interesting. I don't remember a lot of the story, but I can't say it's terrible. I really wasn't interested in this book. I wanted to just turn it off and move on. I was going to wait until I finished my other two books but after I read this one I feel I didn't get my money's worth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was interesting but I found that it is too similar to other books I have read in this genre.   It just didn't seem to me like the authors had their head on straight in this area.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it is just that a book cannot become a true classic if it doesn't stand on its own.  The author's other books are good so I am not sure why this one is just ok. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________  I read this on my own because it was the cheapest. I was really excited when I got it because I was waiting for a new book to come out with this character that I've wanted for a while. I'm disappointed. Not only is the character bad, but the writing is terrible. I don't even know where to begin. It's almost as if someone tried to write a book about a crazy person and then got a hold of a couple of psychotic psychopaths and just went from there.  The story is about a girl who runs away from her abusive father, gets into a car accident, and is subsequently taken in by a homeless woman. She goes with her to the house where her mother lives, where the family lives, and the relationship between the parents and their daughters is basically one long string of sadism, rape, and sadism. The mother has a violent temper, is sexually abusive, and abuses the daughter on a daily basis. The daughter is just as nasty, but in a much more subtle way.   The writing is awful. It takes a long time to start and then gets really boring very quickly. At one point, when the daughter is about to rape her mother, she just says, "Yes, mother." And then rapes her anyway. And then the daughter tells her mother what she did and she says, in a really sadistic way, "Well, I'm sorry about that."   I am so tired of reading about this character. She is not only a horrible person, but also a horrible example of a psycho, who in the end, is not very nice to either side of the story, which makes it even more sad. The whole time I was reading this book, I wanted to put it down and throw it away because I couldn't deal with it. This book will be on my list for the foreseeable future, because I'm sure my brother will read it and love it, but I'm going to give it a 3 for the way the writing was for me, but not for anyone else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book would probably be better suited for a middle school classroom as it is not a work of genius but it could have been even better if it was."  ~  "I know that the author, if he'd read his own writing, could have made some good suggestions on how to improve the writing of the book. It was a fairly well done book."  and so on   the book is written in the first person from the point of view of an author, which makes for a very subjective account, which may lead you to make up your own mind. I'm not the biggest fan of this style but it was good enough to get the point across, but it's not a classic so if you want a more definitive view on it, the reviews on Amazon are your best bet.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not the biggest fan of this book but it just seemed like the book was a lot of words written in a way to make it sound like it is trying to say something important, which is not the case at all, it's a book about how a woman should treat her boyfriend but it doesn't make any sense. It is not a story of abuse and neglect. There are other good things about it but it's just not the thing I was looking for.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- As a fan of this series I'm disappointed and angry at what has happened to this story, the way the story is now written makes it almost unrecognizable, it's now an out of character, a plot device kind of story, at best.   The writing is a mess, and the story itself is pretty bland, the book is too long and uneventful, the characters are flat, too many things seem to happen at the same time, and it has very little in the way of character development or a sense of humor. The action scenes are repetitive and don't look all that realistic, and there's nothing funny to be found in the book, the humor is forced and doesn't fit the story. This story didn't have to be like this, and I wish I had written a different review.   (hide spoiler)]  For those that want to give it a try, this story was not for you. For those that are trying to catch up, it may be worth your time, however the story and worldbuilding in this book are weak and feel a little like they were dragged out of a past time of fiction that never existed, and didn't need to be. I'm not sure if there was anything that could have been done with this story other than writing out the events as they occurred and then throwing in a few extra bits here and there, but that would be a huge downgrade to the experience I had reading the book. In all seriousness though, this book was not very well written, and should have been given a pass.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************* It is a great book but, the author has an agenda and is not consistent with the facts he presents. I think, he is trying to show the negative sides of Scientology and it seems that he uses very distorted and untrue facts in an attempt to discredit the organization, it's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, and his teachings and ideas. To say that the author is a "scam artist" is an understatement and he is quite aware of the fact that the only reason people are into this subject is because of Scientology's influence, he simply doesn't know how to present the facts in a way that is correct, as stated in the "Notes to the Reader."  1. In the "Introduction" and "Notes" chapter, Hubbard stated that L. RON HUBBARD, was born June 3rd, 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Paul H. (Paul) Hubbard and Anna B. Hubbard. Hubbard's father was a prominent civil engineer, and according to Hubbard, Paul Hubbard's family was very rich and his parents had many relatives in the Navy. This, according to the author, is not true. According to Paul Hubbard, his father was killed in a car accident in 1945, while his mother was six months pregnant.  2. The author mentions that the "PTS DUTY" pamphlet was made famous by Hubbard by making his followers think the Church was so evil that they must commit suicide before they were called to the Sea Org and be sent to fight against the evil enemies of mankind. Paul Hubbard stated to me that the pamphlet was not his invention. In fact, Paul said that at the time, he was a Navy pilot and a part of the Navy's Air Force and, before becoming an author and founder of the Church, he made copies of the pamphlet for other Navy pilots. He said that he was in his early thirties at the end of WWII and had just recently received a promotion to second lieutenant in the Air Force. ,  3. The "Preferred Organization" pamphlet that Hubbard made for Scientology's followers was never written and is believed to have been never approved by Hubbard. He later stated to another author that the idea came to him from a man named D. O. J. Capp.  The "Notes on Religious Knowledge" booklet states that Scientology founder L.Ron Hubbard never read it. I have a copy of it and have verified its authenticity. The Notes to
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book is a horrible waste of my time. This book consists of no less than 3 stories which, I think, may not have been written by the author, but instead, have been copied from another, yet to be discovered, book. For example: 1. The story of the boy, who had an accident on his way home from school, and had to be rushed to the hospital by his father; 2. The "fantasy" tale of the young witch who has to get her hair braided by the old woman to stop her becoming a frog and 3. The witch who, for some reason, had a heart attack and could no longer keep her body still and, after she was revived by the other witch, she started singing and dancing in a very sexy way which I could never understand what the point of was. The illustrations, while nice, were not attractive and were more like they were to add an illusion of beauty. The language in this book is not that clear either, especially the use of the word "thousand", which can sometimes be a little hard to understand. In addition, the author did not make many attempts to make the main characters interesting or even human. Overall, this is a book that is not worth wasting time on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an American reader who started the series on Audible. I liked the first book (I'm not an avid reader but I do like some of the YA, fantasy and thrillers). The second book was not as good. It was dull. The worldbuilding was interesting and the characters were believable, but I just wasn't feeling the romance. It took me awhile to get back into the series. The third book was a good one but not as satisfying as the previous two.   My rating is 4 out of 5 stars. I did like it but I didn't care for the second one as much as the first. I'm not going to read the fourth until I finish all the other series but I'll be sure to do so when I do.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________  A great way to get the gist of the story and to help the reader to understand what it's about:   A group of six women get drunk and visit a party on a yacht. This was one of the most interesting stories I read this year. I really enjoyed the character development.   I like that this book is told from the point of view of the women and is based on real people:  - They are all smart, beautiful, successful women who live in NYC.   a) The story has many great descriptions and details that help us to see how they live their lives.  ,  "The girls are drinking at the same bar every Friday and Saturday night. This is the first time that they meet. They have a drink and talk about the girls' jobs, their boyfriends, their families. This continues on every Friday night for another month. They all end up leaving because they all have problems and don't have any time left. But, after their third week, the girls finally leave together. This story is the origin of the word "crush" and the fact that they are all so scared to be alone. They had no life and didn't like being alone. This made them want to find each other."   b) The girls make a pact to always visit the same places.  .   the girls decide to stay in a hotel because the last time they all went together, one had just been raped by an ex-boyfriend, the other had a miscarriage, and the third was sick and got sick during the time they were on the yacht.     . The story is told with very realistic details: . the women's lives are very similar and all live in the same part of the city.   and there are some humorous details like how the ladies keep trying to make up but end up making each other cry:  ,   "One of them has lost her fiancé. Another lost her best friend. Another had a fight with a boyfriend. Another has gotten into an accident. One has two children. One of them was pregnant with her fifth child. The others have a few days to live. One had cancer."  ,,   There are a lot of funny bits in the story that make you laugh:  . the bartender is very good at telling jokes and sometimes has an amazing story to tell.  - The women are constantly in love with the same guys

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and found it rather dull.   Some of the points that were made in this book were true, some of them were not so true and some of it was completely fabricated.   and I mean completely fabricated, to the point that it wasn't believable.   in fact this book made me wonder how did he get that number of pages written, without any evidence to support his claims. he had all the sources of the research he is using in his other books in this one and how did they not have his numbers for these? he is not even a scholar in his field, just a fraud. he has a tendency to embellish his claims, and is very vague in his writings, in which he claims that he has studied and worked on these topics and even quotes the people that he is studying and studying them with. in fact most of the stuff in this text are the things he has used to make his claims to fame, such as his work on the 'cocaine epidemic', that is just not true, he didn't even study the cocaine epidemic at all, as he was working for the CIA, but did the cocaine research which was much more relevant for him, as it relates to his main subject matter, i.e. the'social evolution of the US population' - which he then uses as a cover for his CIA activities, and as you would expect for a CIA employee, he was also the author and co-author of this book, and he is known for being unreliable, unreliable in fact he was fired and forced to resign from the CIA and he has since moved to a different agency.   a bit of a long winded way of saying he was not reliable at all.  , this book is mostly about the 'evolution' of the Americans, with a lot of his claims being based on things that he heard from people that happened to have worked in the government, that was it.  He made all the 'facts' about the US from the 1800's, such a factoid about the American Indian population that there was no such thing as the 'native' people. there were not, and in fact, the Native Americans that are mentioned in this chapter were actually Europeans who had been brought by the Portuguese when they conquered the New World.    but then he makes it sound as if the Portuguese had conquered all of these people, and that is a blatant lie, and this book was written in 1958 which is over half

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ is a well written, but flawed story. I really enjoyed the concept and the setting, but it was not as good as I had imagined.The main character is a good man who had a terrible marriage to a beautiful woman, he was raised with little support and the family was not loving. He lost everything when his wife left him for another man and his children were abandoned by his wife and her friends. When I got to the point where I really got involved with the story, I came to realize I had gotten all the info I needed to know. But, that's what it is. This book is not perfect. The characters may be well drawn and there may be a few moments of humor that may be overdone, but for the most part, this book has a lot to offer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book and while the story was really well told, the prose was bad.  Some lines are long and difficult to read, like "I'm thinking about this like an ice cream bar and then a big piece of chocolate on top."  In other words, the book had no flow, and just felt like a bunch of stuff the author had read in a book on ice cream.  A very different take on ice, with a much more interesting story, but...  It's a hard thing to write a bad review for an ice novel.    I do recommend it.  But, to be honest, the story didn't do it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, I was really looking forward to this book. I like sci-fi, so I'm going to keep trying to pick up some of these stories.   What happens in this book is...well, I'll put it this way. If you love books, if you love sci- fi, if love good writing, if are a person that wants to read books that are challenging and that are not your usual fare, you may like this book better than expected. It has the same type of style and pace as the other books, but is way different in that it's sci- fied. That's it.   the characters in this story, and the way the characters relate to each other, is so much better than I was expecting. They're more like real friends you would have in real life.   at the same time, it's also fun reading about people with the same interests, that you might not see in your day to day life. The writing in this novel is good. It's not overly complex or overly intricate. It is readable and easy to follow. I wouldn't call it "a novel" per se. it's more of a story in a novel.   (I didn't get very far into the book, so that's why I said it was more of an "a story" in a book. Not bad though.)   The book is a lot of fun, it has a good plot, the characters are well fleshed out, and it's written like you're hanging out with a good friend while they read a book together.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of reading, not just because I found it a bore, but because I really did not enjoy it.  I have been asked several times by my friends what this is about, and I have always said I don't know, that there is nothing to see here.    This is like if you read the story of King Arthur and decided there was nothing to be said about it. But I was wrong.  This book is not a boring tale, it is far from that.  It is well written, it has some twists that will surprise you, and it is a very good read.  For those that want to read a story about a war, but do not have a lot of interest in fantasy, this may be a great choice.  But for me, I never found the story that interested me.  There were so many characters, so much going on that I never got very far with them.  That being said, if you do enjoy books that are about war, I do not see why you wouldn't like this book.  I am going to read the sequel, which is the same story as the first book, it looks like it will be a good read too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I received this book I was expecting a great read. But I was NOT disappointed. The writing was excellent. I enjoyed it.  But, it just wasn't the story I was looking for. /   I can honestly say that I have read about the lives of the women and it's easy to tell they weren't the typical story of women I have seen portrayed in my history books. These women didn't just wake up and start taking up arms and fighting for freedom and justice for others. Some, especially the ones who were warriors like Joan of Arc, would have gladly taken up arms for freedom. ....   The book, as a whole, was decent. It gave a good insight into the way of life of the French Resistance. It told the history from the viewpoint of the men involved. ,but not one of the main characters in the book.   There were some interesting quotes from people in the Resistance that were interesting and interesting to read about. But it was very very hard to find the book that I wanted. So I gave this one a 4 out of 5, and I'd recommend it to someone looking for a quick read.

It was pretty long, but I only finished the first 5-6 chapters, and then I quit reading. I didn't realize there were so many pages when I started reading, but it took me a while to realize it was that much of a book. In fact, it was so boring I couldn't care less about the story and was actually surprised at how slow and uninteresting it was. I'm usually a fan of a great mystery, but this one just got a bad rap from me.

I only re-watched the movie because i heard people say that it was bad and that there are some good aspects, but I would not bother.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- When I bought this book I was excited to read it because I have a lot of free time. But I was very disappointed. The first chapter was completely useless, the story of a girl with a disease that is not fatal, but causes her to be very sick for a very long time, I got confused after this chapter, and the story didn't make any sense to me at all. I didn't understand why the people in the story were talking about her "disease" and the things she does to treat her illness, but she didn't really have the disease, because she had a normal life before, and after this "dying" she had nothing, she had all of her things taken away from her, her family abandoned her, and she had nowhere to go, and yet she was still the strongest woman in this story, and everyone around her tried to kill her, yet her life is still not over. I also felt that this story was about the author's personal experience and I couldn't understand what was the point of the book at all, and what was her purpose for making the story? I can understand people having a problem reading it because they can't understand the author. I understand that, I think that they also have problems reading fiction, but I thought that they could read this book and not get confused. I have read books like this before, but they always make no sense and don't give me the feeling of a true person that could live in this world. I think this book wasn't a good choice to be published, I won't recommend it for anyone, I don't want to read a story about a girl who has no chance of living, who is going to die in a way that isn't horrible, a disease or whatever, and then it ends. I don;t think that this book has anything good to do with reality, at all I think it is just a sad story of an extremely weak girl who gets help, but no one understands her, so people try to make her suffer, they have everything taken away of her, but not to death, because they don't understand her, people can't even understand what she is feeling because she isn't alive, this is why people kill her and make her hurt, because even when she is hurt, they don;'t understand.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________   The book has some good parts to it, especially if you have been interested in the subject, like I was. But overall, I found the writing style lacking and that the narrative does not progress in the way I was expecting it to. I think I may have gotten the same tone of tone and tone of dialogue from the last two books I read by this author.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but I don't hate it. It was just not what I expected from the author, as I have read the other two books by this writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book for Christmas and I'm already a little bit annoyed with the lack of details in the text. I was told the book was written in a'mythic' style. It definitely looks that way, but I was just not able to find anything that fits that description. A lot of the descriptions sounded like the author had no idea of what he was writing. A few scenes in the book felt like they had been ripped out of some kind of fantasy novel and re-purposed for this book. I'm not saying I would have enjoyed the book if it were in a different format, but it's a book that I would definitely not have liked if I had just picked it up from the library. I would be more than happy to look up more info in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- "This book is awful. It has terrible grammar, spelling and spelling errors that are everywhere. It's really a horrible book. I felt it was written by a 13 year old who had never tried to write a book or had ever read a book. The stories just don't make any sense at all, even though it's clearly trying to be a dark fantasy series. The writing style is just awful. I read the first few chapters and went to bed. The next day I read it again, and then went to sleep again. I've had this book for less than 48 hours and I've already read through the whole book. There are many, many problems with this book and it should never have been written. I don't recommend this book."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* My friends and I read this book for a class but I didn't enjoy it one bit. We were so bored out of our minds after each chapter. Not at all. It had no story to it. It was just a lot of boring pictures and the plot was very confusing to even the most hard-core reader. We did not recommend this book to anyone. ************* I just wanted to throw a quick review because I'm currently reading this in class (and I loved it) and I'm in my second week of reading the book. I loved the pictures. I especially liked how it all came together into this awesome world of magic, dragons, and monsters. But I didn?t love the plot. It seemed like the author was trying too hard to make this book feel like a fairy tale, and that?s fine in my opinion but I don't think I was the only one that felt like she was stretching the concept to the point of breaking it in the process. I felt like her attempt at magic was rushed, that she seemed to be putting too much of a spell on the world just to put the author out of work and make the reader feel excited about this. Also, the worldbuilding was okay. The story wasn't a problem but if she is going to do that then I can understand why it would feel rushed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:...............................This is one of the worst books I have read, I think it is a collection of short stories by a person (or people) who had no intention of making a good book and instead made it to be a collection. I have been a long time fan of his and this is a bad one I wouldn't recommend.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** I was reading this book in class and a friend from work recommended it to me, so I bought it. Unfortunately, there were several errors and typos in the book. The author could have corrected them at the time, but there is a second printing of this book and I guess he had some time on his hands to correct things. It would be helpful to include an index. This book is also written for a more general audience. I recommend this book for a general audience if you can ignore the mistakes or typos.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I started this book expecting a good read. The plot was interesting and the world was interesting. What I got instead was something that felt like it was plopped in the middle of a bad movie. I was expecting to be entertained and surprised. It was a good movie but this book was like listening to a crappy CD that never gets better. The writing was terrible, I mean really bad. The dialogue was forced, poorly done and often times didn't even make sense. There were too many scenes that had to be cut out to save time. One scene I just found to be terrible was when the kids were running in a maze while carrying a giant egg. If you're not running in the mazes then how in the world are you going to move an egg that size? I think it was supposed to be some type of secret but then you have to run through the maze again to get to the exit. The author did a good job of making it seem like a fun event that happens in a dark castle that was just abandoned because of the kids having too much fun but it just seemed like it wasn't. I just couldn't believe the amount of time they were spending writing and rewriting this one scene. It wasn't good enough to make me like the characters but it made me look away from the book. If the author ever decides to write a good book I hope that she writes it. I'm not going to give up on this book and hope for better things but I'm certainly not going back to this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I am not a fan of horror and so when I heard of this book I went right over to the library to get a copy."   I am a writer and I don't believe this book is for you if you like stories or suspense. This book was like nothing I have ever read before, except maybe this book of a book that you can't quite put down. There was nothing to keep you from falling in love with this book.   The main characters:   Liz: she is a writer who is just beginning her journey into the world of publishing. After a couple of months, she falls for a mystery writer that works with her. He is charming and funny and has a beautiful, young girlfriend. She is a bit of a dreamer so she asks to stay with him for a bit. He says that his girlfriend moved out and he is stuck with her in his apartment. So she stays. They start seeing each other more and more and Liz is falling more and deeper into his world. He's a man of mystery but also an enigma. He takes his time getting to know Liz and her world. She doesn't take long to get addicted to his personality and his world, which I thought was really fascinating and unexpected. I loved the way they went from being just friends to being a serious couple.   in the end, this was just perfect. It was a real love story. The chemistry was just off the charts. They both went through some tough times together and it really made for some strong reading. The only problem I have is that I can't say that their love story was happy ever after. It wasn't. I guess it was love at first sight. The two characters got together in their own ways and the relationship wasn't always easy to navigate.   and of course...   Sophie:  :  -Liz fell for the same man but she wasn't quite sure about it, but she knew that Sophie would love this man. Sophie knew about it and didn't care much, so she decided to meet him in person. Sophie and Liz started seeing each day and even though it was only for a few days, I really felt it was for life and not just a one-time thing. Sophie really took Sophie to his world and it was really amazing how well they fit together and how they grew into a really nice couple. Sophie didn't even seem to care that she was with a mystery man
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________ I've seen several bad reviews about this book, and I have to say, "Wow, that's a tough book to review."  This is one of those books, if you have a high tolerance for boring prose, you will like this book.  I like it and I like the concept of it, but I would not say it is my favorite fantasy.  It is probably my least favorite book in the series.  ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I am not an avid reader, so I'll give this book 4 stars.  This book took me a while to get through.  Most of the writing in this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it.  At times, I felt the pacing was not great and at other times, the pace was very good.  When I first read this book I thought, "this is like a Twilight Zone episode, if that's all it is."    I am glad I gave it a try though.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I found this book to be poorly written, poorly edited, poorly conceived, and not well paced. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. The plot line had no plot line, the characters were boring, and there was little of value to the story. The author is a professional writer/editor and yet he does this so poorly that I cannot imagine why anybody would buy his books. He is obviously a professional.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A book that is boring to read and is nothing but drivel. The book is about a girl who had been born from a normal human, and lived on earth in human society. When she became an elf, she got into trouble and got expelled from human society to live in elven society. But when she came out of her elven life, she was no more human than she ever was before. It seems that people had changed the elf for the worse. The elven government is evil, the elven king is corrupt, and the elves of human society are evil. What makes the whole book so annoying are all the things that the characters are doing in it. Like a child playing a computer game.  I don't know about you guys, but it's boring.  My Review: The elf lives in an elven city, which is the capital city of elven lands. The elves don't have a king and their government is corrupt. In the beginning of the book, the elf has never traveled in a human society, so she is clueless about how to live among the people. She gets in trouble again when the elvish king orders her to go live in human world to teach them more about elves. This time, she doesn't like it because she hates living in human culture. She runs away from the elfens and comes back in another elven kingdom in order to live as an elf. It is a very sad scene. As the elver's go through their changes, they are getting all the wrong idea from their human counterparts. The people are cruel, evil, greedy and evil. That is why the elvan people will never be friendly towards them. Also, as you can guess from this book, elves donít live in a perfect world. They live in evil, violent world filled with violence, murder and death. Now, if you have read the books in this series, you have seen that they are amazing books. There is nothing wrong with this book and I have no problems with the book. I hope you will enjoy it too. :)
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________ This book is so bad it has to be written as a negative. I was really looking forward to reading it since I am a fan of the Twilight Saga. I got the book the day it was released and took my dog out to see the movie that evening. We ended up watching the movie and the Twilight movie (Twilight). I wasn't expecting the book to be good because it was just so bad. It was like a Twilight movie where they made things worse. They had so many problems with this book. First they make things worse by saying they are from Twilight, but they are not. They just ripped everything off of Twilight. They have so much problems with the characters they used from Twilight. It makes me angry because I have always loved them. Now they are nothing like they were in the books and the characters just don't feel right. I know this was the movie, but it didn't feel the same as the book. I think the main character was supposed to be the dark-haired girl from Twilight but she didn't look like her. The other characters are terrible, all over the place, and you never get any real background on them. The author just wanted to make Twilight. I would only recommend this book if you are Twilight-addicted or just really like the books. The authors want to make money off of this, and it is sad.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure where to begin. The beginning is so slow that you wonder if you're even getting the gist of what's happening. The story is really an interesting concept with an intriguing premise and interesting characters, but the execution is so terrible that I didn't finish.   So what is it that happened in this story? We have four guys who are stuck in a desert wasteland with no hope for the future. These four guys are called the OA (which stands for "Orbit Of Awesomeness"), and they are all in their early 20s. One of the men, named Michael, is a computer hacker and is considered to be the smartest person in the group, even though he doesn't really seem to understand the consequences of his actions. I have no idea why he does what he does. He seems to do nothing but cause damage and ruin the lives of others.   The other three, Jason, Ryan and Dylan, are just as much to blame. Jason is the leader and the first to get into trouble with the authorities. He doesn't seem to care about the consequences at all and doesn't know how to stop his friends from destroying everything they touch. Ryan is also kind of the most dangerous, even more dangerous than Jason. He's the one who has a penchant for breaking the most things, but he doesn,t seem to realize how bad it really hurts anyone around him. And Dylan? He's a bit of a coward and doesn.t seem too keen on risking his life for anyone but himself. He just wants to get out of the way so that Jason can get into stuff that isn't as dangerous, like other kids who want to be cool.  : )  I have to be honest. This was really slow and really confusing. At first I thought this book was written by a guy who had been stuck in an airport all day trying to get to a plane back home. But then the book started to get better, and I finally realized that this book really wasn't about anything. The main idea is not a new idea. People always talk about how our lives and lives around us are a reflection of us. We all are born in the same way, and we all develop in the exact same way. Yet some people have a more difficult time adapting than others. In fact, some people find that their life is easier than others, especially the people who have the best luck and the luckiest things happen to them
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This book sucks. I would not recommend this book to a friend. The main problem I have with it is that it's a very difficult to read book that I found very tedious to read. It is a very long book that you really must read at a steady pace. I don't like reading long books, but I would recommend this to people with very difficult time schedules. As far as I know this book has not been translated into English yet. (I hope it will be done soon). For people interested in Buddhism, this is a great book and I recommend you to give it a try. I will definitely read the next one that I can find.
Write a negative review about a bad book:...........................................................  "My first experience with this series, I was completely blown away. First off, the prose was very compelling, the writing was beautiful, the plot was engaging, the characters were interesting, and the plot twists were just wonderful. I didn't understand a whole lot of it at first but it became clearer the more I read. This series will not disappoint, and will be a staple in my library."  My final rating is 4 out of 5 stars  This was a surprise to me. I went into this expecting a slow, steady-going series with the characters growing and changing. That's what most people who read fantasy get when they pick up a fantasy series. When I opened this book, I immediately thought, "Wow, this is slow and steady-moving. Not very much change."   That's not true. This book had more change than I expected and it is the main reason why it's a 4 star rating.   There are many spoilers for this book ahead. If you haven't read this book yet, I'd recommend giving it a miss.   to sum up the beginning:   We are introduced to Venn, a warrior of the Order of the Broken Sky, and she is the daughter of two dragons.  : )   This is a great start. She is strong, beautiful, and has a heart of gold. She also has a dragon (I'm going to get into the sex scenes later, but for now I will just say she's sexy)   Her father, Venn the White, is a warrior and leader of the dragon hunters. He is honorable, kind, and strong.   a : It took me about 20 pages into the book before I realized that this is not really an evil dragon. He seems kind and caring. But he's not evil. In fact he cares a lot for the dragons. He's willing to kill to protect them. He just has a different opinion of dragons than we do.  He is also the second book in a series and it's important to understand that dragons have a life of their own. They grow up and do not always follow a mother or father.   of the three dragons, VENN's father gave her life. Venn's mother was given a life by her dragon, but her dragon did not have a name. The dragon named her Venn. VENN was given her name because it is her dragon's name

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best thing about the book is the artwork. That is one thing I liked about this book. The drawings are very well done. They are very interesting and give the reader the impression of being in a video game. However, the text is not very readable in some cases, making it difficult for me to read the text while sitting in the car or in the other room. I really wish that they would have added more illustrations like those found in the graphic novel and video games.  Helpful for learning German grammar, however I don't think that it's really necessary. I've found that my grammar skills have gotten better since learning the German alphabet. For instance, I can now understand and use German words much better than I could before learning the alphabet. However I wouldn't say that it is helpful for learning grammar. Also, the grammar is somewhat confusing. For example, the noun "Das" has many different forms in German (Das Gewalt, Das Gläser, etc.). And sometimes "Dos" (as in dos aus) is used as an adjective meaning "in a certain way". In other words, if you don't know the exact meaning of the verb "Dies" then it's difficult to figure out which form of the word you should use for a situation. This seems like it would be a good thing if they would just use the form of "Doses" as the "regular" form of this word instead of all the other different forms. But they didn't make any attempt to do this. I recommend this book to anyone who has already learned some German and wants to learn more. But I wouldn and wouldn't recommend this to grammar or vocabulary learners.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending of this book was terrible, but it's a shame, because I'm sure I would have liked it more if I wasn't so disappointed in the writing. The book was very confusing, it was really hard to understand how one character knew another, which was confusing and made me think that the writing style might have been something else. The main character (Kamika) was not believable at all. The author had very limited knowledge about her character and never seemed to be able to get her character back into character. I thought the writer had a great idea to have this group of children live in the woods and the characters were kind of creepy. I hope that they would do it differently next time and have them all be children. This book wasn't great, and it would have been great to be part of a "survival of the most interesting" group, but the characters just didn't seem like people. Also, the book seemed like it would be about a big family, but they just seemed like a bunch of different people. Overall, a good read for the time I read it, and that's about all I can say.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* It is written in such a way that the narrator cannot possibly mean what he is saying. When I read it, the only words that were meaningful to me were "The book." That was it, there was not one sentence in there which explained any of the things he was saying to us. His language was so convoluted, his diction was so complicated and the characters are so flat and dull. We do not understand anything that happens in this book. He was a very smart and educated person but when the writing is this bad, I'm surprised he did not die. I have to add that I think the narrator could have easily given us a better understanding of his viewpoint, he was probably doing this on purpose to make the reader think that it is some sort of personal, subjective experience. There is nothing personal, personal experience, that happens anywhere in the book and it is just about his perspective. The reason he did this was because, he has a lot of money and he is very insecure. He probably used a lot more words than necessary to describe his feelings but it doesn't mean anything. He said his feelings about his relationship with his wife and his feelings on his children, his feelings as a father were very complex and personal and had nothing to do with any one of these issues. If you have ever had a strong relationship with your children, you can guess how he feels. The writing was so terrible that I just had to give this book a zero. I will not be buying this book again. Thank you for ruining my night!   I've heard this book talked about, but never read it. It is not a horrible book, nor is it a good book. It doesn't matter what you think of it; it is simply the way it was written, not the message. If there was anything good about it, I did not hear it.   It all started when the narrator describes his experiences in an orphanage in Nigeria. This place is horrible. It was very overcrowded and it had so many diseases, one in particular, Ebola. The narrator would frequently hear someone being bitten by a dog, or getting hit by a car while trying to walk on the street. He didn't see these things himself, but he was a poor boy and he had the least amount of money that he could possibly have. He also didn't understand anything about this place, and that made him very unhappy. He felt like he was in a zoo, with nobody to
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I received this book as a gift from a friend. I started this book and I was very taken with it, and had hoped for a good read, but sadly it wasn't. I do not like to use the phrase, "bad book", because I am usually a book person, but that is how I felt with this book. It had many flaws, and a lack of understanding the characters. I could tell that it was written by a newbie, as I was a little confused and frustrated with it. The characters were all extremely stereotypical, with none of the actual characters seeming like they were real at all.   Some of the plot points seemed very off too. The main character does not die in the end, but there is no real reasoning why, I was not convinced it was not a mistake.  .   in my opinion the ending is the most illogical part of the book. He had already left her life after they had sex, so it makes no sense why they were going to get together.   and my favorite part of this book was when she had her heart broken. He was a good guy.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** The most disappointing book I have read this year. I loved this book, and I was so excited for what it was going to offer me. But this is not the book I was expecting. I was hoping this would be a book about a group of friends who decide to go to a new town and try the new food, get into a new business, and find a new love that they couldn't have found anyplace else. Unfortunately, this book is so much more than that. It is very hard for me to see why these characters and the people they are associated with, if that is the case at all, are even important to the story at all. There are so many things that could have been done better here; the setting, for example, is so over the top it seems like a bad Sci-Fi parody. There is even a scene where the characters are being dragged from a party into a room filled with hot lava. I mean really? What? The story is good, and the characters, with some of the most outlandish and absurd dialogue I have ever heard, are very interesting. But the setting is just so overblown. So much so, that it is hard for the characters to make any sense at all in their situation. It just feels like it is a cheap ploy to sell the book and sell more books, and that is sad. I guess it is okay, but it is nothing more than a ploy for more money and more copies. I do recommend that if you are interested in this book to read it on your own, without the other people who read it. It can be fun in its own right.  15 of 17 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ I was so looking forward to reading this, I was actually excited to see the cover art, because I am a huge fan of the original series and it was an obvious choice for me to get this book. I was really excited to get the book and have it in my hands. However, the book arrived broken on the day I bought it. The pages were in one piece and the inside had crumbled inside out, and the cover had ripped as well. I really didn't want to give up on this book, and after going to an actual bookstore to see if they could fix it, I went to Amazon and placed my order, and to my surprise it was fixed within minutes. The book itself was ok, it wasn't a great read, it just wasn't what I was expecting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a piece of shit. I can't believe I spent all that money for it. It is terrible. Nothing good could be said about it. The author has obviously not had any real training in writing.   The main character, Mr. Mackey is an asshole. He is an extremely jealous man and has to have his way with his ex-girlfriend and ex-wife. At times he is a complete bastard and at others he is quite nice. He does have one redeeming factor though. He can be quite romantic and he is trying to be more than he actually is.  .  .  and I didn't want to go on another rant about the character's but this book was the last thing that I wanted to read and I was glad I just threw it out. I will not be reading this again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   My wife got a copy of this book for Christmas last year. She loved it. We had never seen anything like it. I knew it was different, but I didn't know how different. I liked the idea of creating a novel for our son who has Down syndrome but is in special ed. I have two boys, ages five and two. The idea for our novel is that the kids write their own stories, and we read them together. We thought this was a great idea. I was very pleased when I started reading this book. I enjoyed reading it. At first I thought it was just a typical, normal book. My wife said she loved it too, but it didn't seem normal at all. I am happy to have read a different book. It really is so different, in a good way.   I would recommend this book to everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a great read and there are parts that really made me laugh.   The book starts off with a series of people who try and get an extra penny from a "tax" or fee.  The way the story unfolds, some of them are successful and are able to go about doing whatever it is that they want to do.  However, some people are not so lucky, and they end up in a worse situation than when they started.  I would say that this story is not very important to the story line and the way the book is set up, but I can understand why this is how it is because it makes for a good story.  It really makes the world seem real and not just in a dreamy sort of way.  All of these people do different things in their lives that lead them to where they are at.  There are many people in this story that go on to achieve great things in life, and some of those people that go into the work place and have to make a living because they don't have other options.  Overall, this book was not my favorite read in the book because of how boring it was to read.  A good story would have done well here.    I would give this a 7/10.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning of this book there is a little quote by a woman saying that in America "the most important thing is to find the most beautiful place in which to die." It really resonated with me as a young woman growing up in the 90's and having never seen this quote anywhere. This book was not exactly what I was looking for. I have read some of the other books by this author and this is very different. I expected more and I guess it does not matter much as this is not a book I would recommend. I do not understand the main characters in this book. I did not understand where the plot was going but I did understand why they were trying to stop the evil cult of witches who had kidnapped a little girl. However, it does seem that the only person who truly had faith in her is the little girl and not the main character. I wanted to really get to know her but that never happened. I never did get a chance to find out why the little witch's husband is so afraid of her and why he does not like the fact that her little daughter has been taken by the witches. There is something missing in this story, something that could be developed further. I would not have liked it if there were more details in the story to help make this story more interesting.   It is a pity that the little book does not have more of a plot. The book is long enough as it is, so there should have been enough information for me to understand the story. The main character is not believable because of the fact the she is an 11 year old girl.   He is a 30 year old man that does not appear to care about his little girl very much. The little girl is a beautiful girl, but the way he acts towards her does not make it appear so. He does not seem to be concerned about her at all because of her age.   a really sad ending in this wonderful story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________  A very dull and forgettable book which had no potential to be enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************   When I bought the book I was very excited to read it because it was one of my first fantasy series I'd ever purchased. When I started reading I was not that impressed. The first book is interesting but the second book is just flat and predictable. And the third book is worse. I just finished and I'm still not that bothered. And it really doesn't matter if you've read the books before or not; they're all the same except they're not as good as the first book. And at least the first two books are in the fantasy genre so I would think it would be worth the read but it isn't. I'd have to say buy the other three if you want to read the series, especially if you read other fantasy series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  There is an inherent flaw in this book in the story itself that makes it a waste of a $9.95 investment. I bought it from my local bookstore for about a dollar less than the Amazon price because I saw it on the shelf with so many other novels. The story is good, but it's a simple plot that does not make the book a worthwhile read. My biggest gripe with the book is the fact that the author is not a world-class writer. His prose is not the smooth flowing prose one would expect from a top-notch author. Instead of trying to make his story a story about a world that is rich with different cultures, ideas, languages, etc. the author uses very simple and basic stories of a group of people that are in the same country and have similar problems. Each of these stories are about a group who have something in common, but do not have the same thing in common. One group of individuals have a very specific problem (some have a medical condition and others do not), while another group has the same problem (all have to worry about money and getting their families out of poverty). This, for me, makes the problem seem very one-dimensional and lacks the complexity that would be needed to create a believable world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in 2005 and it still makes me cringe in the way it makes me feel. The whole book is just a disaster! It was a horrible book!  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I loved this book! I read it in one sitting, then I finished the book (just about 15 pages in) and I had to stop and re-read it to understand what was happening in it. I didn't think the story was the strongest, but I also didn't feel like the author did too much explaining of how the world works. It had a lot of detail to it, and I'm happy to know there are people out there who are interested in what they are. I just wish it had been written a little better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. It is not even remotely close to a good one. The idea that some of us may be unable to see things through to the end is simply the basis of the plot. There is also the whole "if it's not too late, you can still save the world." The actual ending, in the most literal sense possible (there is an entire world to save...in a movie), is so disappointing I can only say "Wow! That just happened."   There are so many plot holes I would like to mention, but I can't for the life of me find one to bring it up. The author makes this world so convenient and so perfect for her plot (because it has to be perfect, right?), but the world has so much potential it's mind-boggling! There are all sorts of mysteries and mysteries in this book that I want to know, but the author refuses to let me know...because she doesn't want to reveal anything about the real world to me. I'll let you in on a secret; I am not a huge fan of a world that has no secrets to hide!   I also feel like there are certain things that I would never even think of, because that would ruin the "true" world that is the book. There are things that go on in the real-world (or in this world if you prefer), that could never occur in this one...for example, when one of the characters comes back from another dimension and dies, which she then comes back and says "I've come back because I'm the only person who can save you. I want you to be free." That is ridiculous! That cannot be possible! How does she know? How can she be the only one who can come back to the real, the pure world and save it?! It is too obvious!   it's like something out of an H.P. Lovecraft story, except I don't think he had a book by the same name...   But I have heard that this is actually a novelization of a short story that has never been published before. And I think that is just as ridiculous and silly and boring.   All in all, this book is just a great waste of time! The author needs to take a good, long break from writing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The world was the world of the last two books; this one's a bit more of an exploration of what life is like in that world without it being at the expense of the characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book:............................................. I was very excited to read the first two books in this series, but the third book was just terrible, I was extremely annoyed.   The main character is a teenage boy, a former football hero and has an ungrateful father who is the head of a drug ring. He has just been released from jail where he was sentenced for possession of cannabis, the author makes no mention of this fact so he thinks that he must be in for something serious, then he finds out that he is going to be a priest and after that he learns that he has to marry the daughter of one of the leaders of the drug ring and after he gets married the drug lords are going to have more power and take his father's position, and so he decides that he wants to get rid of all this evil and kill all the drug dealers and his father is the only way to get a job with this drug ring...   But then things get really weird when he meets a girl at a party who knows more about drugs than he does and this is what makes the story very strange.   of course the author did not explain what happened to the girl who he thought was important and what was the point of this book   Also the girl was a really annoying and not that likable character.  , the ending was just as bad, the plot was just so ridiculous, just really unbelievable.   this book was so bad it was kind of funny!   It's a terrible book, it will no longer get any stars from me, it was just too weird and unrealistic for me to get any enjoyment from the book. I did like the girl though, she had a lot of personality.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________   I have been to a good number of horror/paranormal books and I have found none of the authors to be as good as John Langan. I can not recommend any of his books enough!   The book I have been most looking forward to is "Death's Head". I have read a little about this book and I found it to be interesting. I am looking forward for the next book to get the next installment. I cannot wait for the books. I will definitely be returning for the third book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series. I'm really looking forward to reading these books.  However, these books are so dull. __________________________________________ The story is about Harry Potter going to a school to be a wizard.   It is the best book I've ever read in terms of character development.  He has a good main story and a decent spinoff of his life.  I think I've read several series that are just not done well.  They start off great but the characters and situations are not.  It just isn't interesting enough and not interesting enough at the same time.  The characters that are included are really likeable and have depth.  These books are great for those who like fantasy, Harry Potter or just fantasy in general.  A bit pricey but it is worth the price. ______________________ I am a huge fan of Harry Potter.  This was the best of the books I have read so far.  All the characters have depth and I really liked Hermione.  There are some great characters in this book.  Thank You ______________________________________________________ (4/10)
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   If it had just been one book it would have been fine.  If the author had written another book on my list I would still have read it. . :)  - John (age 28)   I would give this book 2 stars if I could!  In fact, I may have done so already because I'm so sick of these 'how to' books.  as long as you're not going to read the actual book and go over it in the book, it doesn't matter how long it is, the advice is still the same: be careful, don't read too much on your own, don' t buy anything in a book store, etc.  it's a 'how-to' book. and i agree with all of it, but for one thing, the author is a little bit too enthusiastic in his/her delivery of the advice.   in one of the earlier chapters, the 'best' advice is as follows:  "Don't get your hair caught in a brush while you're brushing your teeth. Don't get the brush on your clothes while you werehes. Don' t eat peanuts while you wash your clothes. Don" t open your door while you"re washing your clothes, unless you can open the door without the doorjar."   and then the author goes into the details of the cleaning and the "how-tos." but they are all just as bad as the previous chapter.   "I washed my clothes after I was done with a bath. I didn"t notice the peanut on the floor for a few minutes but when I came into the bathroom I saw it. I"ll probably go in the bathroom before my wife cleans it.   to avoid the peanut, try to be careful with your hair.   this is exactly the advice you get from every 'how' book and i never get it. i"m sure that if you"ve just got out of the shower, you wouldn"t have noticed the peanut."  ,   - Kevin (age 23)  .  is this book an abacus? or is the author just trying to get you to do some mental acrobatics while looking at a picture of a tree and writing in circles with the words he/she writes.   aha, I see!   . I can tell it was supposed to be an abaca. I mean it's got
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author of this book has a very weird way of introducing the story. For some reason, she begins by introducing the protagonist, "a man in a cage". This isn't really clear until later in the book. Then later, the narrator starts talking about this man being a prisoner of his own mind and how the "whimsical" nature of his life had led him into being "caged".  I understand this to be a form of foreshadowing but it's so incredibly vague.  It just doesn't feel like the narrator was trying to foreshadow anything at all.  My only other issue with this book is the ending.  I honestly think this book would have been a far better one if it wasn't about a man in the cage.   I mean, you can easily make a story about a guy locked away from the world because of his thoughts.  And there are plenty of stories out there that deal with this type of theme.  But the main problem is the way the author ends this book.  The book ends with the protagonist deciding to release his cage and that seems like the right thing to do.  However, there are a lot of major plot points that were left out that really take away from this ending. For one, the protagonist doesn't really end up releasing his cage. Instead, the author has him find himself back in the world at a new location with a new cage.   In this story, the main character isn't a prisoner in his own head.  He's free of the shackles of society but at the same time, he's still stuck in a physical cage. I know this is a very minor gripe but I really wish this book was told in a different way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished this book and was completely unsatisfied.   First of all I'd like to state that I read the whole book within a few days of purchasing it. I had originally purchased it for my husband. He was extremely impressed with it. The only thing he didn't seem to appreciate was the ending and how it was written. I know there is plenty of other reviewers who feel the same way and that it's a great ending, but I feel that it doesn't fit well with the rest of the book.   a little about the book:   The book follows a man who has a family who are on the verge of becoming homeless. The book is set in an old neighborhood of Chicago. The father of the protagonist lives in the back of a house with his family. He is a single parent and has a son, but he is not in a stable relationship. The daughter, who is 12 years old, lives with her father and a brother. The brother has a job and is very supportive.   "The house was small, with one room for his brother. It was in the middle of a row of abandoned houses. The front porch was locked from the inside. The window with the door was barred from the outside. The street was in an open space, not unlike a parking lot, though the edges of it were wooded."   "On the back porch was a faded wooden chair that the father had once sat in, sometimes to read his Bible or watch TV. The old leather-covered arm rests were bent back with the weight of the man's old age."   the mother, who has been a drug addict for many years, is living on welfare and is a drug dealer. She has a daughter and is trying to stop using, but has been unable to do so. The protagonist's son is in middle school, but the story is told as if he was at a younger age. There are other issues of this book that didn't resonate with me, like why the father hasn't gotten help or why the mother can't get help.     As far as I can tell, it's about a family living in an abandoned house with a son who is being raised by his mom. The man is the older of the two and is on welfare. The woman is the middle child. They live in a small house with their daughter who is very much an only child. The mother is an addict and her husband is abusive.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, as the synopsis promised, but my expectations were really low. I was disappointed in the book, because the plot was really hard to follow and didn't make much sense. I kept reading, hoping to find out what the author was trying to say, but I found the story difficult to follow. I had hoped that the book would be fun and entertaining, but it wasn't.

Write a negative review about a bad book:.....................................This book was not that bad. I liked it. I mean I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series so it's not much of a surprise that I would enjoy this series. I'm not sure if I've read too much into the series, but in the beginning I thought this book was just okay. And then in the last twenty pages or so I really got into the story. I was shocked. I don't remember this book having so much emotional impact on me before. But then I thought, "Hey, maybe this is what the author is doing." I'm still not sure how the story would've played out if I had just read this in the first place. Still, I'm glad I read it.I think I'd like it better if it didn't seem like a series just to get me through the book. I know that is the theme, but I think the plot would've been better if they just kept building up. It's not a bad story, but it's also not really anything that would be my first choice for a first read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read most of these books over and over, and this one didn't stay with me. There's nothing about it that struck a cord with me the way that "Eyes Wide Shut" did.   The most disturbing thing about the book was that I read it and said, 'this is too bad'. I thought this would be the book that made me realize the extent of the corruption, but it didn't. The worst part was that, when I got to the ending, I was ready to jump up and say, "this is the end", but when it was over, I felt as if I'd been punched in the gut. The ending left me angry and confused and I had to do some digging to find out what happened next.   and that's it. That's the only complaint I have about it. I highly recommend that you buy it.  19 of 21 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My daughter is now 16. She started reading this book when she was 14 and started to have nightmares every night. I told her it wasn't a good idea and to not read it. I had my own issues with the author, but I was afraid she'd use it to tell her own stories. And, she's not the only one.   I was so angry when she said, "Mom, when I read this book, I felt like my parents are controlling me, and the books in the library are always about what I should be doing instead of what I want to do." This book is horrible for kids, because it is nothing more than a series of scary stories told in a way to scare children. I understand that there are other books that are scary, but this one was terrible. I can't even imagine having a book about horror, with no other story line.   of the books she read to her: 3/5: We read the first one and the third one to her before she went to bed, because she was tired of the nightmare stories and didn't want to wake her up. But when she woke up, she wanted to tell me more about the nightmare. She has no problems reading to her, except for one book in which she got up and went to the bathroom to cry after reading. Of the books I read to my son, I think it was my fault that he couldn't understand the story. And when I tried to explain what the story was about, he didn't understand.   to my other daughter: I read these books as a way for her to read to me, to read what she wanted and not to be told how to do it. She reads her favorite books, and has read them for years. We used to read them in bed while we were making love, and my daughter didn't have a problem with that. Of course we talked about how she didn't like the story about the killer in the house.   But, it was because of the scare stories and her fears that made her wake up at night. These books are NOT for her.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The thing is, there were a lot of pages that I would have liked to read more about. It seemed like the writers just threw a few pages at you and then they jumped. I was really not expecting a book that has the same ending as the one in the movie, as I loved that one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book was really bad, I really really liked it when I read it in college but when I tried to re-read it I realized it was nothing like it used to be. There were some really funny moments like when the characters were talking about the people in the village they went to, and the guy just said the most inappropriate thing ever to make a guy laugh. The rest of the book is pretty boring and I hated all the characters and the world of the story. I would have probably passed out by the end of the third book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no idea what a "giant" is. It looked like a huge piece of cheese (I didn't care) or like a giant piece of plastic wrapped in plastic wrap (I think this is what they use in big grocery stores). My only complaint is that I can see this being very useful to the military (or whoever) in a tactical situation.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ This is a story about a young boy who is raised by wolves, and then the wolves get sick and the boy has to leave home to survive. It is an interesting story, but the book was really hard to put down. It has lots of blood and violence, and if you do not like that, this is not for you. There are also some disturbing scenes, so if that makes you uncomfortable, this might not be the book for you either. However, this one book is about the most beautiful boy on earth, and it was so beautiful that I couldn't stop reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ I read this book about a month ago and just didn't like it.   I mean, it was OK, but I couldn't really get behind it. The writing style is kind of a slog. And it was quite long at about 700 pages.   He just didn in no way really know what he was talking about and just seemed like a guy who just came up with an idea that sounded cool, but just couldn't finish writing it. At least, he just wrote it down. And I just didn´t like that.     The story goes like this:  An alien has crashed on Earth and a bunch of people (who seem to be living underground) have come to this planet. The aliens are very good with technology and the people seem to like them.  , and they decide to create an empire.  . They send people to Earth to work on the colonies and take people back when the planets needed to be protected. They are a very rich race and they get very rich off of selling their knowledge to anyone who wants it. They seem to want us to do the same thing. The main character (a human woman) is sent to the Earth colony and she falls in love with a male engineer and they start to date. It was a really interesting idea, but the writing just made me not like it and really didn't interest me.   is a really good book. The characters are interesting, the science is interesting, and the plot twists and turns and surprises. The plot itself is not anything amazing, but it does have a very good ending and that was a very nice surprise.   a really cool concept with the aliens from another world living underground, but they don´t really fit with the human's idea of what is human. Also, I found it a little strange to have a couple of women living on an underground colony who were married to men they met there. I really thought that would be seen as an odd thing to do, but that was just the plot twist. I don´ t think it would have been that difficult for them to find someone who could live with them, and there were probably more people willing to come along if they wanted to. It didn´ t really matter to me, but sometimes it is nice to see a book plot for what it really is, instead of just being like "Oh this book is about a guy and a woman who fall in love in an underground habitat with a buncha
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed with this book and will not be reading the sequel or the first book in the series. I had a problem with the writing style. The author is very vague and doesn't elaborate much. It seemed like he was describing something from a distance. There are not many details and the characters are pretty bland. I was really hoping this would be a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ The author describes it as "a story about a girl who can teleport through time, only she can't do it while wearing a bathing suit." ~~ ~~ I can see where some people might think this is a fun, whimsical read, but if you are a fan of science fiction or fantasy, you will be disappointed in this book. ~~~ I'm not going to go through a long review about the plot of this book because I've read it before, and it's been out for a while. However, if you want to know more about the characters and their story arc, you may want to read the synopsis for the previous book I reviewed on Goodreads. If you are curious, this book is about a college student who, as the story begins, is on her way to a party with a friend. They arrive at their destination, but instead of the friend, she is stuck in a time loop, and now, it's the guy's job to rescue her. They travel through a series of different timelines that are each set in their own eras (ie: 20th century England, 21st century London, etc). Along the way, they learn more about each other, and even learn some cool things that the future will not tell us. I'm going to give the author some credit: she clearly knows how to set up a plot, and she doesn't waste much of the book. But this book had me wishing that it would just stop. Because the plot was predictable and, worse, had some pretty silly moments (like the main character's "deathbed" conversation, for example). I'm sure there are a couple plot holes (like why did they go back and forth through time?), but they are easily fixed by the author. But there was a major disconnect between this book and the previous one, which made this one feel very empty.   I'd recommend this book to someone who is looking for a fun read about time travel. The only thing I would give it two stars over would be if the plot would have been even slightly different. I really liked the characters in this, and enjoyed them for the most part. I also liked the world-building that the author put into this, as there is something that made me feel like I was really living there. But when it comes to this book's plot, the story is so predictable that I almost felt like I wasn't reading about anyone in particular.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I've read quite a few of this series, and so I think the ending could be different, and that the author is so clearly a perfectionist. I've seen the book at least 3 times now, and I'm sure I've heard of and read more, but in each instance the author has made changes that were completely and completely unnecessary, and sometimes even downright bad. I mean, sure, the character's motivations changed a little from time to time, but who ever thought it was necessary for that to happen? It was always necessary for the book to be about an assassin. Who else would do this? It makes me wonder if it was an editorial choice, but I'm not sure.   I guess the main thing I would have liked to have seen happen was an ending that was a little more open ended. I'm sorry if that's a bad thing. I like books where everything is resolved, and where there is something left undone and unresolved. I know the ending I had in my head was the one the author wanted to write. I think he has the potential to write great books, but unfortunately his perfectionism always results in some changes that take away from what should be a good book. I hope the next book isn't like this one... I'm hoping for a good ending that's not this bad...
Write a negative review about a bad book: *****************************  This book is awful. I liked the author's writing. She was interesting and the story was interesting, I read it for the plot. However, it is so poorly written, the story seems to be written from the POV of an eight year old, rather than an adult. I'm an adult, I know the difference between right and wrong, it isn't like this book was written by a five year old. There are so many things wrong with the plot that I am sure I will get the book in trouble at school. The first thing I noticed was the cover; it looked so cool, and she is a beautiful girl, but it had a horrible picture of a naked girl. I am glad it was a picture of her because it is pretty bad, but then it got worse. It is written in the third person. I have no idea what is going on, I think the author might be reading into things and writing things as if they were real, but the story is written wrong. There is no emotion, I couldn't feel any, they just said the girls were happy. The girl is just a thing, you just get the feeling she is not real. There was also a time where the girl was a person, not a thing. I think it should have been written in third person but it was written in first person which makes me think it is from the perspective of the main character. I guess this was written for an adult audience so there was an editing that was done to make it fit the adult audience. The characters are horrible, and all they do is talk and make up stories. I would not recommend this book to anyone, the characters are so horrible that I can't imagine anyone would enjoy this book, it's just bad. If anyone wants to read a book about how things should be, this is not it, it sucks.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was difficult to get past the fact that the book has all the traits of the genre that is best known as the "science fantasy" genre. The characters are poorly developed, it is very difficult to tell who the bad guy is, and the plot has been done before. This book suffers from the same weaknesses that the genre as a whole suffers from, namely, boring characters and plot.  I was initially very excited to read this book, but the way the author wrote the characters made me feel like the author was so lazy that they could have done the characters a little better.  I found myself constantly switching back and forth between the three main characters to try and figure out who is the bad man and who is good. This problem really increased in intensity in the last half of the book when I realized that the author had completely forgotten who the good guy was.  The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is long (922 pages).  6.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so good but there are so many parts that just makes me wonder where is the original author? I loved everything about the book but it seems that the author forgot that she was there and her readers who like the story.  I think that the book is about a girl who is very shy, has no social skills and it seems like she wants to have sex with every guy she meets. I mean the book starts off very bad and then the author does the best to make the story better. She is very talented and is not going to go out and do a bad job. But there were a few parts that made me question her skill as a writer. This is only my 2nd time reading this book, I really hope that I have not offended anyone. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something really good that I am sure that you will enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! A book that is full of clichés, made worse by the fact that the author is so uninspired. I did not want to finish this book. The book is full, you will never know anything in the story, not the details that will come with it's conclusion. The ending leaves everything to be desired, and I am very disappointed with the end product. - October 13, 2010The book is so boring...  Reviewer: pneulon - favorite favorite favorite - October 5, 2010  Subject: Not a Bad Book at all... There's one small problem. The first part of the book is a sort of recapitulation of the entire series. There's not really a good reason for this. If they had just given us a recap, then the book wouldn't have had to repeat itself so much. I don't like reading the same thing over and over.   I would read the entire first book again, just to see what happens. -October 5, 20110 Not a Good Book at least... .. - November 13, 2009The first part is good  2 out of 2 found this review helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is what happens when you start off with the perfect plot and then make a ton of changes.   From start to finish, the author made several major changes to the plot. The characters are now divided between an evil witch (the main antagonist) and a heroic knight (the side characters). Also, the plot became more complicated, and the way in which it was presented became more convoluted. I never could get the whole story. In my opinion, there are too many plot points that I was left with a blank.   the ending was lame, and I have no idea what happens next in this book. The story of the main hero, and some of the minor characters could have been interesting. The main villain was also too strong. She had too much power to the point where it felt like she was godly.   and the author tried to make a happy ending with a happy and loyal dog. I will never see that end!   Overall, I would not recommend this book at all!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure if it's bad because it's a rehash or what, but it didn't quite have the impact I was hoping it would. I think what I would do is read The Lord of the Rings a few years earlier, and see if that helped me. I can see it is a much more interesting read than this, and I don't know if I'd recommend it to a fellow fantasy reader, but hey - if you think you'll want to read a good fantasy book in the near future, this is a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is very unsympathetic to her friend and in the end I found her and her friend to be two totally different people. She is constantly putting herself in the victim's shoes and the fact that she and her best friend don't trust each other shows in how the story was. I really wish they could of had two different characters that were so different. The main character's sister does not even make a cameo. This book just was not for me, I guess.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book, not the great one I wanted from reading about my grandfather. I like the characters and their story.   However I have to say I would not recommend this book to someone who has never read a book written by the late, great Ernest Hemingway or someone who was not familiar with his work. For the most part the characters don't really have any of Hemingways work and so while this book is interesting and well-written, it could have been written by an imbecile.   in summary, good book but don't read it if you don't have experience with Hemingfos work, or if you have any other sense of humor than the usual sarcastic twaddle.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is difficult to get through. There is very little in the way of interesting characters. The writing style is very heavy handed and is very difficult to follow. It can take several times to understand what is happening. It is definitely a very long book, and takes about an hour to read.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** The first page of this book is the most boring part of the entire book. I mean, I got to read about how the book was going to be a magical and exciting adventure. Then I came to this first paragraph: "On one trip through the magical lands of the New World, the little girl was caught in the middle of a war between the United States and the Mexican government. In the midst of the skirmish was an ancient demon, the Aztec Jaguar, who was searching for the sacred stone." I have no idea what that means. I think I just had a flashback to when my mom told me the story about the jaguar while I was little and I was trying to get through to the people in the grocery store by pretending I understood the story. I don't know if this book has an ending. All I know is that I'll read the next book to find out about what happens next. The author has the same problem that many people have: he doesn't know what the ending is going to say, but he thinks he does. *********** I have read all the previous books by Brian Staveley and have enjoyed them. I have given his earlier books 4 and 3 stars, respectively, and I am very curious to see where the book goes. I really had no idea this book was the last one in the series, but I guess we will find out in about a week or so. As I mentioned in my previous review, I liked the character of Tanya. She seems to have good intentions, but she was also caught up in a very confusing situation and it took me a while to get into what her intentions were. The story has a few problems as well. I am really hoping that they are resolved in the next one. This book is not very long. I finished it on a Tuesday, about 3 days after I started. I also thought it was a good length.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   This is the worst book I have ever read. I can only describe this book as a horror/horror film with an evil god and the protagonist was supposed to be evil but this book was way more like a horror movie that was edited to become more of a horror film. I understand that there were some changes in the book but I would like to see an editor to be involved in any editing. This is not the type of book that I would read for horror, just for fun and this is just a horrible book. I hope it burns in hell.   I can only say this book ruined my summer. I had to take the kids to a movie but I ended up leaving with this horrible book and this horrible movie. This was a horrible experience and if it was my kid and I would have never let him go to the movie but now it's ruined my summers.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________I didn't like this book very much. I didn't get what was being explained or shown or argued for. If you want to tell me that men are "more complex" than women, then show us what that is like. Show us some male and female couples who have been together for years and years. Show me what it's like to be in a romantic relationship that is going good for a decade and not be able to make it better. Show what it is like to have to deal with people who are not even interested in you. Show my readers what being an attractive woman means to men. If that's what you want, that's fine, but don't tell me this book is for that. I had to re-read the first half of the book over again to make sure I understood what she was talking about. I am glad that my review is so negative because it is such a sad commentary on society. I will never get into a relationship with a man, because I know that when I do, it will be a very different kind of relationship from the one portrayed in this book. And I really feel like my life was a waste of time, because the only thing I got out of this book was a lesson that I would not learn in any relationship. The only good thing about this book, is that my boyfriend is an idiot.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- *I loved the ending of this book, so much that I wish I could have stayed longer to read it. *The author uses some really old and racist language to describe Blacks and his other characters. *I don't know if I'd read this book if it wasn't part of a series. *Overall, I think the writing is really good. *Very well written, very entertaining, and very well put together. *Would I read a sequel? Yes. *One of the best fantasy books I've ever read. *Read at my place to work.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ This book is a joke. Not a joke about the author or the book but a joke of the book itself. The book is about a guy named Matt (not the author) who is a guy who lives in a city he doesn't know because he lives in the middle of nowhere (and there is literally nothing around here.) he is a real dickhead and a total jerk to everyone he meets. The only one he really is cool to is a girl called Sara and he ends up helping her solve a murder because he's a moron who is trying to get laid so he has to have some sex with her. The rest of the characters are all like him and he thinks they are cute but are just there for the book. The story is about Sara and her boyfriend and all the people who are involved in it. Matt was actually there in that house and all he did was act like a complete fucking idiot (like a moronic) and just kept talking about how "she was cute" and "sounds like my type" so i don't really know how he got there or why it wasn't Sara. Anyway he ends this horrible book by going to get Sara drunk (which is pretty much the only thing he does) and ends up fucking her and then killing her and her corpse is left on the porch like a fucking sign or something to say "don't go near this place" or something (there's nothing like "don' t go near my corpse" on a porch.) She is then dumped in the river. I just don't know why he was there and what he did but I'll guess it is a mistake and this story is meant to be about Sara's boyfriend and how Matt helped him kill her and kill himself. He was the only character I cared about at all. (He does seem like a morons who will be a jerk to anyone if given the chance.) Overall, I am really fucking bored with this book.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________   I read this when it came out in 1988. It's hard to put into words what this book is. It doesn't seem to be a science fiction novel. I read this story by way of a young adult science fiction magazine. If you haven't heard of the magazine it is called "Starlog". It was in print from 1989 to 2002, about 12 issues in total. I didn't know what a Young Adult science fiction magazines was at the time, but I liked this story about aliens who are trying to contact humans.   The book opens with the crew of a spaceship called The Ark talking about how they will try and contact the alien species. This leads to them discussing the science involved in this whole project. I am not sure if it's the language or the writing that I am picky about. The Ark talk about what a computer is, how much computing power they have, what they have to scan in the planet and what they are going to be scanning. Then we have a whole group of aliens talking about what they will be looking for. They are describing different features of the planet. We are introduced to two aliens who work on the Ark. They seem like a bit of a cliché. I don't really know much about them besides that they are kind of creepy looking. I guess that is what I love about this book. It takes the clichés we know from science fiction and makes them work. There is even a joke at the end that is not from a science fic. It really is a great story. It has a really cool feel.   a) They will try to scan the planet in real time   b) They are going into the planet's atmosphere to try and collect the air they will need for the scanning   c) The scans will be done using high frequency sound   d) You can actually feel your breath on your skin   e) They can get a picture of anything that's moving   f) They actually scan in objects on the planet for later use   g) They have an electronic device called the EMIT   h) You see this device in use while they are looking for an object. I think it is a very cool device.  , i) You are able to change the size of your body through use of this device   j) You know, when I read the book I was kind of concerned about the description of the ship
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************** This book was nothing more than a poorly written book written by a "professor" for a class, I could have written a whole different review on this book, as I found it to be an absolute nightmare to listen to, but you need to pay attention and pay attention to what it has to say!   I found myself at a loss for words as to how I was able to listen and learn as I was reading this, I think I could probably give more of a negative rating if it weren't for the positive reviews, I will keep a few of them but be aware it is for a different book I read!  .   This is just one of many negative reviews I will give this book!

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I bought this book expecting it to be something of a treat and instead it was a treat. It is one of those books that is very long but in order to get to all the parts I had to read the beginning of it two times to get my bearings. This is a story about a boy who was raised by a family who were the most evil of beings. The story has a lot of violence, but even the mildest of the violence had me crying out in pain. The boy was raised so poorly that he was made to do all of the dirty jobs for his family. This included getting dirty, working in the fields, working at a factory. They would even send him to the butcher who would cut him up to make sandwiches for the family. In addition, they would take him to a house of horrors where they would beat him and treat him as if he were a piece of meat. All the while they were told that he belonged in their family. The family would also put him into all kinds of ridiculous roles. They had him dress up as a girl so he could have a normal life and then have his head cut off, he was a girl in the doll house and even as a child he had to pretend to be a baby so he would not get hit by the other children. One of the best parts of this book is when the father comes to visit the boy and tells him the story, he tells the boy the story as he has it. The best part of this is when he says "this will make you strong, it will make us proud." This is what makes this book a treat as the boy looks at him with the same look of wonder he had when he told the father the story. When you get the hang of the whole story, this is a great book. I hope you give this a try.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at a trade show. The first time I saw it, I thought it was just plain ugly.   It's like a big pile of crap that you can't pick out at a flea market.  The writing is awful and it seems like it was written on the fly or from the bottom of the stomach.  I tried reading it over and over, but it never gets interesting.  In fact, I was frustrated so much I put the book in the trash.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do like this story, and I loved the writing, but the story just didn't seem to fit into the plot of the other books. The characters were kind of generic in a way, like they were all people I would recognize.   The last page of the book was really really weird.  It just kind of stopped to a little voice: "Hey. You know, it's probably not you. Or him. Or me. Or our friends. Or the whole town. It's probably just that guy."
Write a negative review about a bad book:..........................................................It's a pretty good book, but the first few chapters felt like they could have been done a lot better. As far as the story goes, it's pretty interesting and very, very well written. But the first chapters in particular make me feel like I'm just being shown things that don't really make any sense. Like why exactly the protagonist of this book is so interested in a girl? What's wrong with him? And why does she seem to have the same interests? I have no idea why they picked these two as characters to start with. And why is he so interested? (Or does he have a sister?) These questions don't make sense, and the answers don't seem to make much sense either. I'm starting to think this book isn't all that good. I just finished reading this book, and it's definitely one I want to read more of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book. I thought this book was great. However, I can't stand the horrible writing. I was able to take the first couple chapters and read them at my desk. I did feel like the author was going off about a certain topic. After reading the first three chapters, I couldn't take it any more. There is too much talking and not enough writing. The book was too long and it seemed like there was way too much information to cover. I had to go back and re-read it all again. There were things in the book that were very important to me that I couldn?t remember. I know I should just put the book down and get a new one, but this book is getting on my nerves. I am a bit of a perfectionist. I love to read and I always want to be on the top of my class.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   "Dirty Harry" is a fantastic book.   It was a great read, with a good plot, great characters, and the occasional great character turn.   that's what really got me. The ending was great, and so was the beginning, as well as the middle. I liked that they were all interwoven, so that there was no real cliffhanger in the middle part of the book. I would be interested in reading the sequels.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________ _____________________________  The first time I read this book was in college. I was in a major on this topic, and this was the only book on the topic that I read, along with other relevant reading.  After reading this book, I was a little bit taken aback that a study I was interested in in graduate school was not even mentioned, which, to me, was a big disappointment. This is a classic, and should have been at least as comprehensive as the textbook I'm taking right now in a statistics class. It would have saved me a lot of time. This book, however, is not an absolute to get, it is meant to be read and studied, just like the textbook is.  is very well-written, and I would suggest this to anyone interested in statistics. I am a graduate student in statistics and do not usually read many books in the first place, but this one was really great. , is one of the best textbooks I've ever read, and one of my all-time favorite books. I can't believe how well it is written! Highly recommended!

The narrative was simple but it was a really easy read, it was the main reason why I gave it 3 stars, it would have been one star if I had had trouble reading this. I did have to read the reviews of others that did not have the same trouble and I was able to find some info on this from other books, it took me a few tries to find that, but it worked out. I am really sorry I bought this book, there were some spelling mistakes in the book, but the book was still really fun and I liked it. I would definitely buy this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I really thought I liked this book. I mean it was written by a very good author but the characters were not very interesting for me and I never got to know anything about them. I don't understand the author and his writing. I'm not sure if it's the fact that I'm illiterate or something, but I have no idea how he wrote a book in this style and I'm guessing he used some kind of spell to do it. I got very bored after the first half of the book and I did not care that much about what was happening to the characters at that point. It was too much of the same stuff. There was no suspense and I didn't care. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the most boring book in the entire series. It takes an incredibly simple and easy topic of human emotion and tries to make it complicated and over complicated. I really, REALLY, hope this isn't the last I'll ever read of it, so I don't have to have to re-read it over and over again.   The character is all over the place. I'm not gonna make fun of a person I don  I have to admit to the fact that I'm a little biased in this book. I love the way the author has made this world and how she's created a complex system for it. It was so nice when I first read it and I got to think and write like a real magician.     However, when I got into the book, I felt it was a waste of time. I didn't know why the girl with the magic wand was in the story or why she was in a book that was so easy to get lost in. It's like a person is trying to force everything to make things more complex and harder to grasp. There were no real twists or turns and it took me too long to realize that the girl's name was actually "Emily" and not "Flamethrower". I also feel that the plot didn't progress that fast. There wasn't a real reason for any of the scenes that I was reading or the events in the book. Maybe it was too fast for me, or maybe I'm just getting old. But that's not what I'm complaining about.  . I loved the world, it was just too complicated and boring for me.   So yes, I loved what I read, and it was so great for my birthday, but I'm also going to give it 3 stars because it felt like a waste. It took me a while to realize what was happening in this story and I don�t know why.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had just finished reading this book after having read all the reviews. I read it in 3 days (not sure if it's the book itself, or the book reviewers) and I am so unhappy that I can't really do much other than giving this a negative star. I was so excited to read this book and I was disappointed that this wasn't a good book for me. First of all, I have read a lot of books that aren't so much about romance, but this one is actually about a romance, which is a very difficult thing to do, I know, but still. The book is about a girl called Shun, who falls for a boy named Shu. At the beginning, they are friends, but then Shu ends up killing her boyfriend. But even after this, Shu still thinks about Shun when he thinks of her, he still talks about Sh Un. So he does all that is in his power to hurt Shun because of her boyfriend, but Shun has this power to turn him back to normal, and she does it a lot because she wants to be friends with Shu. She knows this guy isn't the person he is telling himself he is and if she can get Shu to return to normal (which she did throughout the entire book and she did a lot with the power of friendship), she'll be happy, and Shu will be happy. So when Shu comes back to the normal world, Shun is so happy, because he is friends with her again and Shu really is the person she thought he was. Now she just wants to keep Shu as her friend forever, she wants him to be her friend and Shu isn't. Shun doesn't want Shu to be Shu. And the book ends with Shun and Shu's friends coming over for dinner, and all of Shu's old friends show up and Shun isn't invited. And then Shu says he has to go, but he isn't going, he isn t going to be in a friendship like this, because Shu isn t a friend like Shun. Shuns book isn t finished and Shuns mom is going to get him to finish his book. So, Shuns a friend and he knows it, but in a way he can't love Shu and he is going from friendship to being a good friend to being an equal friend to something worse because he hates Shu because he can no longer be friends because of Shu. This book is a really bad idea. It was the
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I bought this book because of the great reviews. I was a little put off by how little the characters actually talked. A lot of them just said what the author needed them to. They also didn't know what they were talking about. The main characters don't seem like they should be able to talk, let alone talk about anything (although a few of the stories have interesting elements).The stories were also confusing. I didn't understand how a person would know what to do in situations that were so confusing. The authors are really good and the writing is great. But I think if they made it a little more interesting and had more character the books would have been much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this on Kindle and didn't enjoy it at all. I found this book boring and tedious. "The reason is simple: all of us are born with a soul that is not our own. It does not exist to make our lives more comfortable. It is a spirit from outside who makes us who we are. It tells us who and what we are and gives us our purpose. But when we choose to live in darkness we will forget who and how we are."  --Buddha"  "Why is the mind always so confused? Why does it need to learn from its mistakes? What has it been doing the whole time? Why is there such a need for learning? How can a person find peace in himself without the knowledge of his own condition?

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  I bought this book because I was looking for something a little different from what I usually read. I went into this book wanting to hear about a different side of the human condition, not necessarily about depression. However, my reading experience was just the opposite. I don't really see how anyone can enjoy reading a book like this. This book really seems to put the blame on the individual for not getting help. I'm not really sure how the author got past the assumption that "only the depressed have depression". It's a very short book that seems to just be about how to help those that are depressed, and this may be the case for some people, but for me the book left me feeling a little empty and I didn't want to read it again. I do hope that one day I can find a book I can read that truly teaches me how to live my life the way I want it to be.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________ The Good: ______________________ This was just a great book with a nice story and characters. I have always enjoyed fantasy books with a strong female protagonist. I think that was the reason why I enjoyed this book so much.

I was very confused for about 3 minutes after reading that. The Bad: ______________ I think this book is very short. I don't think it will be a good read for someone who is only getting into fantasy. ______________________________________________________________________________ For a short book this was a fun read. I can't wait for the sequel, which I will buy, especially if it is in the same universe. I am now reading the first book in the sequel The Black Flame, a fantasy that is very similar to this book.  34 of 37 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written and the only thing that makes it work is the cover. That's it. I found the story boring and I would have given it a 2 star but for the cover alone. I also gave it a 3 star because the only bad thing was the main character. (I really want to use his real name) but this makes him into a terrible person. I will give this book 4 stars because I'm an ex-pornographer and I like this type of book. I would recommend this to anyone who's interested in porn.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The beginning of the book is interesting, with the main character telling his story to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist tries to get the main hero to admit that he's a schizophrenic (even though it's never explained why he believes this) and how he would like to be cured. The main character goes back and forth in different directions, and ends up in the hospital, where the story continues.   At the hospital the main protagonist is in a hospital room. He sees the psychiatrist for some time, talking to him on a telephone, but when he talks back he's interrupted. The doctor tells him, "I'm sorry, but the patient is not well. He has to stay in the ward until you are ready to meet."   When the book was over I felt that this had been the most disappointing part of the entire book. I don't care if the main characters is a schizophrenics, I want to meet him in person.  's ending was predictable. I wanted to be upset by it, but there was no way that it could make me upset. I thought it would have been interesting to see the hero's life from his point of view when he was in a state of mind that I wasn't familiar with. The ending, however, was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it was recommended by my brother in law and I like romance and so I bought it on Amazon for $0.99. I was very disappointed in this book. The heroine is a really terrible character. She is a spoiled rich girl who hates her parents and hates anyone who is different than her. She doesn't care about anything besides her own selfish needs. The only reason she dates is to get into the "goodie bag" of people she can manipulate. The book takes place over the course of 3 years and during that time, the book tries to create tension by building up a rivalry with one of the boyfriends of her father. At the end of the book, the hero meets a girl and the only reason the author ever uses her is because it is the best romance he could imagine. I didn't find this romantic at all, this is all manipulation. I don't even care for the romance that much since it was only used as a way to create a conflict to set up a romantic situation. I think if the author had been more creative in the way she wrote the characters, it would have been more believable.  My rating:  To read the first two chapters you are going to be totally into this book and then you are in for a surprise and it is not a happy surprise.    Disclaimer: All books are not created equally. The author has chosen not to include certain books that do not appeal to me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed with this book. The story is very interesting and the characters are unique. However, this book was not very good. I liked the story and the character development and I liked that there were some twists and turns. However the story had a long way to go. The problem is that it became very confusing and confusing. I had to reread the book three times, and the ending left me very upset. I'm not sure if it was because the story changed so much or if there were other reasons, but there was nothing satisfying about this story. This is not a negative but a cautionary tale: I've read a lot of books that I thought were good but that turned out to be very disappointing. I've also read a few that I liked but the story didn't live up to my expectations. The ending of this book felt like the author was trying to wrap up a series of books but he didn't know how. When a book does end it's very hard to come up with a proper conclusion that will be satisfying. In the end, I decided to pass on this one. It's a good story but I found it lacking in a number of areas. Recommendation:  This is a book I would recommend to anyone looking for a very interesting mystery with interesting characters. It is a story that takes place in a small town and is told from a number Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This was the worst book I have ever read. In every way it was a total disappointment, and I can't imagine that a book of this subject would have been worth reading at all. I read this because I was searching for an easy to read science fiction book that I could give to someone who didn't like science fiction. This book was definitely not worth my time, and the writing and plot are so awful that it makes me sad to think about it being given to someone else. There were two parts to this book. Part 1 is about the planet and how it got its name. It is a science fiction novel, but it is really just a collection of silly aliens, with no real science behind them at all, and it is so devoid of good science that I don't think anyone would have even bothered reading it. Part 2 takes place on the planet, and is basically a bunch of nonsense. One of the main characters has a daughter that can talk and he spends the whole book trying to figure out if she is actually a girl. Then he realizes he doesn't even know if she even has a gender, and this is pretty much the entire plot for the book. This is just so poorly written. It was almost like the author didn't even read the book, because they just threw in the most bizarre idea and hope that I would take it seriously. They didn't seem to take any of their science seriously, and that made the whole thing even more of a disaster. And the science is so stupid that the author could have just not bothered to look at anything about it. The idea that the planet has four suns (they do, but they are so far away it is barely noticeable) is ridiculous. If you look at any planet in the solar system, there are always four sun, even if you have one less than normal. Then there are the things they do with the planet's geology and climate (a planet in which the land has to be warmed up with the sun for it to be able to be suitable for plants) that just make absolutely no sense, because if they have to warm up the land so it can be suitable to plant plants, they have already warmed up the surface of the planet to the point where the plants can grow. It just is a huge waste of energy. They also show how the weather on the surface is controlled by the weather system on the interior of the planets (which they don't explain), but I don´t
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a collection of very poor fiction, which I will not write about here. As for the "plot" or "message", this is a poorly written "science fiction" book, which has been written by someone who does not understand how fiction works. If this had been published in 1939 (or 1950), I would have called it a science fiction novel, because that was the style. This book is set in the 21st century, which does not make any sense at all. But, there you go.  If you read this book and get the feeling that someone has not read a science-fiction novel for 15 years (since the "golden age"), you have a good point to make. It really is very much like a collection. I have not read anything by this author that is comparable to this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ This book is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent on anything, except perhaps paying to watch the new Star Wars movies. I spent $60+ on a book about how the human brain works and that the "neural network" is made of different parts which are connected by synapses that are connected to each other. They said the connections were made through synaptic vesicles. They also said that brain cells were formed by the firing of electrical impulses that were coming from the synapses of the cells that make up the network. I wanted to know how those "synapses" are made in my brain so I could make my own network. This is not possible so we are all the same and it is all in my head. All this science crap does nothing but make me wonder if the author's father was a druggie and if he knew it. I have had a lot of help and support from many good people in my life who did what they could to help my son and I become a functioning, normal human being. My advice to you and your children is stay away from this book. It is complete bullshit.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *****************************"The bad is worse than the good. The bad is boring. The good is well-written and engaging." (November 24, 2011)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a book with a lot of promise. There was a lot more on the topic of what you were told that I was curious about and I was really interested in finding out how that happened. That being said I found a lot to complain about. The authors use their own personal experiences as examples of how the book has been used and how it has not held up to other modern interpretations. It was really hard for me to get into a whole lot of it but I guess I just had to be patient to see how far they could get in the book. It is not a bad read by any means but the book as written is very uninspiring and it was a little boring to read.

The only reason I didn't give it 0 stars, is because the author has a good story telling talent, so she managed to make the story understandable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** A poorly written and poorly edited book. I thought it was going to be a good one but was surprised to find it so bad. It's a well written story about a good person who made a bad choice. However, the author should have included a description of what happened before and after the bad choice was made. That would have made it a lot more interesting. I was supposed to enjoy the ending, but the ending was more about how the protagonist is now on a downward spiral. I had to re-read the story twice to figure out why this person chose to do something bad and what happened to him after. I'm glad I read it though. I can't wait to read the next one!  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________   This book is like reading a complete garbage pile.   We begin with a long, dull, boring account of a series of attacks and arrests. In the second half of the book, we get an entirely new kind of account, the police "interviews" of those who survived the attacks. (No, they are not interviewed by the FBI. But they are interviewed by people who actually did survive the attacks and the police simply ask for the names of these people as witnesses to the attacks.) We have no new information about what happened at the World Trade Center and no new facts about what has happened at other places.   in the third half of book, what happens is described. But, again, there is no new evidence about what actually happened. The author spends almost the entire book talking about what the police believe occurred, and he spends almost no time talking about anything that actually happened during the attacks, or about what a rational person would think about what really happened. And when he does talk about the actual events he gives the wrong dates and times and gives an incorrect location. In fact, there are many occasions in which he gives a completely misleading account. He talks about the plane hitting the North Tower before he gives its time of impact. He says the South Tower collapsed "three hours and 20 minutes" after it came down. But it actually fell in less than 10 minutes. (But he gives some dates that are completely wrong as well.) He describes it as being "six or seven floors," when it actually collapsed in two stories. He describes a plane hitting Tower 2 before he even describes the building's collapse. He claims that an explosion "exploded" a window of a fourth floor window of Tower 2, when it was in fact that window that collapsed. He speaks of a plane being "hit by a large number of pieces of flying debris" before he describes how much of that debris was actually "flying debris" (not people). (The description of the crash actually says it was a missile or aircraft, not a plane.) He talks of the Pentagon as being hit by a missile and not having been hit by "a large number" of pieces before he talks about its collapse.  , and that's not all. This was supposed to be the first book of a four book series and the second book was supposed contain a story about 9/11, but we get none of that. Instead we get the account from the police investigators who investigated the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A story that takes place after the end of the world is completely uneventful. The premise is lame. Even if there is a way to get home to find your family, the book does not tell you how to do it. I am sure there is some magic that will lead you to your family and maybe a way for you to leave with your loved ones, but no way to do so. I could not relate to the plight of the humans when a big asteroid hits the Earth, but as soon as I learned that the zombies were caused by the "catastrophe," the world became more relatable to me.   Why did you like this story?   I would have loved to hear more about the zombie population. As I was reading the book, I kept wondering when I was going to find out what happened to the "people" who weren't just killed by the zombies.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ If you enjoyed this book, it will be a good read, but if you hated it, it can't help that it was poorly written. I think it was written as a quick story, not as a serious science fiction or fantasy story. It was rushed, and there was no foreshadowing or character development at all. The pacing and writing is pretty poor as well. A lot of characters did not have anything to do with the book's plot, and it really annoyed me. It seemed as if I was reading a rushed work of trash. My brother loved it, because he said it's a fun book, but I don't think so. The only thing I liked about it was the plot. __________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I were to choose a favorite of mine, it would be this one. The only reason I give it an "F" instead of a 4/5 is because it was a good one to get into. I don't mind reading something I find interesting but this was just a waste of time. The characters were weak and I couldn't feel the plot developing. There was nothing interesting going on, no surprises, nothing happening. The ending sucked and I'm glad I finished it. I have given some other books 4 or 5/5 stars but this book deserves a better rating. I really have not found anything wrong with the book and I would like to read more of her. I wish she could have finished the novel first but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it as I am.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was really cool as I've seen a lot of anime shows that have a story that goes through a lot and then they stop and the characters start to forget or forget about it. I saw this anime show, and I don't know what it was, but they just kept on doing things and it was like they were repeating their whole story, I don?t know what this means but it felt like it was a waste of time.   In this anime it was more of the same thing, the characters keep forgetting and talking about something they?re not even doing but it keeps on repeating the same stuff like the guy who died at the end of the anime.   and if you?re wondering why I said this was a really bad book this is why:   - The characters keep on dying  - It?s boring  ? - The plot is over  ?" - Everything about the characters is like it has just been thrown in and is not worth the time   I think that the author is not very good. I just hate reading bad books.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. The storyline was just terrible. I know that the author likes to write science fiction/fantasy but she has to get over her love for sci-fi and fantasy books and write something that is more real and not just for a group of young girls. I wanted to laugh and enjoy this story but the writer made me want to curl up and close my eyes and not want to read another word. I would never recommend this book to a friend of mine or a young teen who is looking for a book that they will have fun and enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have only recently started reading this book, so I've not had time to analyze it. It is, however, not a bad read. There's a nice touch of fantasy in the setting, and the book is well written. I'm not sure that I'll read it again, but I'd recommend it to anyone.   There are a couple of problems with the book, however. The first is the way the author makes his way through the chapters. As I was going through it, I noticed a pattern in how the author handled chapters: he always began by describing the main character and his past and what he was doing to solve problems, and then continued writing chapter by chapter from there. This was very slow, and very boring. I found myself waiting for the next chapter to actually begin, and it never did. As a result, it didn't seem as if there was a lot happening in the book. The next problem was that the story's narrative style didn't feel all that natural. There were certain points in the story where I felt that the author tried to do something "interesting," but the execution just wasn't there. Overall, though, I don't think that this book is a total waste of time. I would definitely reread it if I were to pick up another book in the series.   that being said, I was still a bit underwhelmed. There is definitely a lot to like about this series, and if you liked the first two books, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. I really enjoyed the first book, but this one felt like it was trying a bit too hard to be more than a love letter to The Hobbit.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------This book was just a bad experience.

I have tried to figure it out, but I just cannot. I did not enjoy reading this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing style was...disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I was so very excited when I saw that this was an author that had made it to the New York Times Best Seller list, and I was not disappointed. I just had to read it so I could get my money back. The author is very uneducated on both philosophy and science in regards to this particular topic and I did not find it to be much of a source of scientific knowledge or insight. This book did nothing for me and I'm a fairly experienced science teacher and I've had to teach over 700 students on this subject. I feel as though the author is teaching her class about some other area of study. It is very disheartening that this book made it into the public domain.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ________________________________________ _________________   The Good -   First, the writing is absolutely amazing. This is a book about a man who has come to grips with the death of his son and how to cope with that. The story is interesting and I really enjoyed the way it was told.   There is a real sense of pain and loss. The book is filled with moments of sadness and the author handles them well. For example, there is a boy who is about to be forced to leave home after he doesn't do well in school. After he learns that his brother is gay and is coming over to visit, he learns about the other side of their family. It is an interesting experience.   the description of the home they live in was really beautiful and I loved it. This was the first book I had read where I could really relate to the family because of their love for each other.   it was also interesting to see how the children are affected and the way that they deal with it.   is interesting to learn about how the kids deal with their families death. It was a really interesting read.  .  ,   It was hard to get through and I wish I hadn't started it. It had a lot of the typical teen angst. There was a girl who was sad about her crush on another girl and there was the older brother who didn't want to go to the funeral but it seemed like the family really wanted him to because they were scared to leave him alone. It's a really sad read but there is something really good in it. The fact that it is a teenage coming of age book was great because it allowed the author to use some of the adult things and apply it to the teen. I loved the family. I really love this book and I am glad I read it.

My sister got a copy, and read it for me. I loved it when I finished it, but after finishing it, I went back and re-read it because it had become so long that I couldn't take it any more. I re-wrote a good 3 or 4 chapters for it because I felt that it wasn't very good. I have never been able to finish any of the first 5 books in the series. My sister got one of the last four and I gave it to my little brother so he could read it, and he also got it, as well as a few other books that my sister bought from Barnes and Noble.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, it was very funny and the way that he introduced the different characters and then had a character talk about him to the audience made the book more funny and enjoyable to read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   The book was so confusing I'm not sure why I even read it. I kept thinking: How do I read about this woman without going into details that will spoil the story? I thought maybe the author was too embarrassed to write about a very specific part of this book and didn't want to reveal too much about her past. Well I guess it's not so hard to find out. I have my own theory about this book, and I'll share it with you in a later chapter...   To understand this story I have to go back to the beginning. I'll use a different analogy to describe the beginning of this novel. Imagine the movie "Gods and Monsters", the one where the main character falls in love with a goddess. Her name is Elizabeth. I think this is exactly what this story is like. You have this goddess who is so beautiful and kind, but she is really a monster, and you just know it. She is not the kind of goddess you want to love. In this novel she is in love not with a human, but with a demon. So the story is a big mystery and I just think that this woman is just a part of it. You just want to read the other books in the series.   I liked the description of the setting. It's not the typical fantasy world I'm used to. But it is very interesting. It has a lot of magic and monsters and demons, but it is also a nice world. I would like to see the author try to create a more realistic and more like the real world. But that is probably too much to ask for. This is a fantasy novel so I just assume the author has more imagination than me and can come up with better ways to describe it.   in the end: ____________________

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very bad read. It made me very sick to my stomach. If I had known that this was about a serial killer with an axe to grind, I would have been more careful. I can't even call it a mystery. And the characters are really the only good thing.   A couple people complained about the "slashing." Well, if this was a TV show I'd be annoyed by the cutting. This is more like cutting a piece of bread with an electric knife. And don't even get me started on the sex scenes. Not even the sex is bad. It's not really the sex that is bad, it's the characters who are the problem. This was the first book I have read that I didn't really like. The rest were okay, but not as good as this.   the first story arc is very confusing to me. The second arc is almost the same. It was too confusing to make the story worth finishing.   I also thought the ending was terrible. I was so disappointed.   He said in the first half he was a murderer, but in the second half he says he was just a killer. I would like to know where he went wrong here. I also couldn't understand why he went to such lengths to kill people.  15 of 18 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________  "This book is filled with useless, meaningless, outdated information. There are no examples used to back up every claim. There is no example of what you are supposed to do if your child is abused by his or her own mother. This is a "book" for people with children, not parents. This book is designed to push your children to accept the family they are going to have, not tell you what you need to know to have a happy and healthy family. My son did not receive any information about abuse or neglect. He was told to read books about the evils of violence, and not the evils inside of him. We have read these books and found them to be useless, not knowing that they are the source of most of the problems we have. These are very flawed books to begin with. You will find this book boring to read. I would not recommend this book for anyone. I just hope that there are many others who have learned the same things that my son has learned about love and support and family."
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I just found this book at a yard sale. I have read several books by the same author and I was excited to find another one of his novels. Unfortunately, what I found is a horrible piece of trash. I can't imagine how this book managed to get past any of the editors. The writing is horrendous. The characters are bland, the setting is generic, the story is incomprehensible and you have to sit through long stretches of exposition. This book is basically the plot of a children's movie - if "The Adventures of Superman" had a love scene. It doesn't help that the book is about a young man who travels back to the 1600s to retrieve his younger sister's corpse, in which is buried in an old graveyard. I think this book could have been written as an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and "Gone with the Wind." It was just so bad that it was easy to roll my eyes at it. This is the second in the "Vampires of the Old West" series and I'm surprised no one at a library or bookstore has ever heard of this series before. I guess that's a shame because the writing is so awful it would have been a very amusing book to read. I really can't recommend this book to anyone. I would be very surprised if someone was able to finish this book and enjoy it. The first part was much better.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ I read this book as a part of a series, and I was left feeling that it was not a good fit for the others. The plot, though original, was not compelling to me. It was the middle of the book that I was most interested in reading, but the middle section is very much like a road map. I would have loved to have had more of the character development of the other books, but overall, I felt this book was too predictable and lacking. I did enjoy the plot twists, but they never worked for me. The main plot was a little predictable, but, then again, so is this book. And the middle and end of the story were also predictable. It could have been so much more. It's such a shame that I didn't get to enjoy this book, but it still had promise.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book sucked.  I don't care what anyone says about it, but for what it's worth: I'm just a plain, ordinary human. I was not a fan of the style or plot of this book.  "She was not here." I don't know, I'm a sucker for bad sci-fi novels.  I would've liked it if he came back as a character in the future.  This was my first book by the author of Dark Matter and I was a little disappointed.

It was hard to follow through with the story line and didn't add anything new to the already rich history of this country.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book did not work for me. I will give it a 4, however, because I like the book, although I didn't like this book. It was very boring. A lot of people say that this book is about a cult leader who is a man of science. He was a man that didn't really think like a scientist, in fact he was really far from it, although he thought he was doing research. Well, in reality he had his own beliefs that he wanted to preach. Also, he believed that his followers would also believe him. He tried to explain his beliefs, but many of them don't understand his reasons. He does get to the point eventually, however I thought that the first part was too long, and the second part also wasn't very interesting. For example, there is a scene where a woman that is very religious tries to convince a man to go back to her church because she doesn't want him to go with her, and he says that he would like to stay. He then goes with her to get married, because she is his idol, which is funny, but not that interesting to me. The book also talks about a lot of bad things. Most of them were not bad, but most of them weren't funny. He even talks about how he doesn't believe that his wife had an affair with his second cousin and she had never had a relationship before. I felt like he had gotten married to someone else and got divorced. It made me wonder if it was wrong for him to marry his wife and divorce her. He talks about his wife having sex in his car, in public, with her friends, etc. Also there is another couple of chapters on how much he hates the Pope and how he wants to kill the Pope. I also thought that it was a good idea to tell the readers what he believes. He had a cult in mind, but he was going to go the way of many cult leaders, and then he would die. Also in the second book, he tells about what he did to one of his followers, and how they couldn't take it anymore. I thought it was funny when he was telling how he had made her watch as he took her clothes off and the other woman had to help her clean herself up. I'm not a fan of a sex book, so this one didn't work for my tastes, but I will still give it 3 stars. It could be a good book for people

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************** My friend and I decided to try the new book and read it in 2 days. We were both impressed with the book but when we tried to read the whole thing in 2 nights I just could not do it. I'm not sure if I'll try the book again but the first thing I'm going to do is look for another copy. It just felt so much longer than the others I've read. This was my first review so I apologize if it is not very helpful but I just wanted to mention it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________The book doesn't need to be made into an audiobook for this to be of any use to you. I could easily read the book in one sitting by myself without headphones or my phone. But you'll be glad you did, as the story was one of the most compelling that I have read in awhile.The characters were all very likeable. Some of the stories were not as good as others, but they all added to the overall experience.The story is very interesting. The ending was satisfying. The way you had to listen in a certain way to enjoy it, made it a little harder to listen to all the way through. It's a great way to get into a book. I'd listen to it again, but probably not all the same way. I had to re-listen to a couple of them just to enjoy them. I really enjoyed that the audiobook narrator kept switching between the different characters and accents, as well as the different voices used. I'm always looking for a good audiobook, but for the price I got this, I didn't expect anything spectacular.But all that said, I still recommend this to anyone who loves reading. I got a great deal on it, and I had a blast listening to it. I think the value was worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. A very short, poor, incomplete book. This book is mostly written in a form of an autobiography. We are never told why the author is a doctor, why she is the same age as her mother and why she did not want to be a doctor like her mother. We just know her as this girl who is sick and is going to have a life long problem. She is a good reader and knows how to make her words interesting. But she really doesn't have a way to use her knowledge to make the story interesting. She tells a lot about her life as a kid growing up in a family of people that is very poor, but her father is a real doctor who had all kinds of medical books from all over the world to help him. She also makes some great points about how people think, and how they think they know things more than they really know. She had a very poor school, and a very rich family, and still went to medical school. Then she does her best to explain it, but it doesn't work very well. She doesn't seem to have that connection to her patients. It also makes her seem very mean, and not at all caring for her patients, and we don't really get to know her well or her patients well, just her family and her parents. She does not have a great understanding of people, and her own family is very important to her. I found her stories about her childhood not really very interesting. Her parents did not talk about how it was in the house, and she was in all the wrong places. She has very few stories of how she got into medical school, which is really sad. She says that she loved going to school, but there was never any depth. The whole family was so poor and poor the house did not look like it was very clean. And there was very little food, and only very little to drink. Then later in the book she talks about how her parents really didn't give a s***, and the fact that her father had all the best doctors and she did all the worst. In real life, the parents were so poor, they gave her everything and she is still sick with her mother dying and her father being a doctor. It just makes no sense that she has been able to do it all and make it to a medical school but that her parents could not afford to. And then she gets to meet a lot of these doctors
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ________ _________   If this is my last book I will definitely read the rest on Kindle (or whatever) but this book was definitely a disappointment.   I would recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction. I mean it's cool if you do. I think its just a bad choice for a beginner reader. It was fun but I didn't learn anything new and its not like there was anything particularly novel in it either. If this was a different kind of book I would be more inclined to read it but as is this was just another example of why it's hard for me to find good books for the beginning.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- Just another boring book. So many things are explained, but very little is relevant to anyone. It all boils down to 'you need to learn to do X' without giving any example. --------------- I was very much looking forward to reading this book, as I'm an expert in computer systems and my favorite topics are database management and network security. I do not understand why this book has so little relevance to me. I have the skills to understand it, I just can't read it. -------------- It is very hard to review something that you have not read. I can not speak for any other person, but I was hoping to enjoy myself, but so far it has not been the case. This book will not teach you how to use a database. You'll need to read the "how to" book on it. The only other books I've read that dealt with it were "The Microsoft SQL Server Cookbook" by Rick Knibbe, and "SQL Server in Action" by Bill Smith. These books covered the basics of using a database, but not the most complex issues, so I couldn't relate to any of it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of the books and have read them all. This is just a bad one. The author made the series much darker and much more intense. We need the light and laughter in life, but I am tired of the dark. No longer will I be able to enjoy this series.   What the book is:  Familiarity breeds contempt.  - - - -  The novel's main focus is that of a former marine sergeant whose past is littered with the bodies of his brothers. After he's discharged and is forced to live on the streets of a small town, he tries to survive on his own by killing anyone who will stand in his way. This includes a local gang of toughs who want to keep him on the straight and narrow.   of the people in this novel, the majority of them are a pain to the characters and to the reader as the story moves along. They are not the characters you care to love.   a small few are memorable.  .  - -.   I'll say it again, I'm tired of these type of novels. They should be light and humorous. If this is how you want to start your day, then fine. If you want this type of stuff to be an interesting experience, then you can have that too.   "This is my life."   -  "I've been a sergeant for almost a year. I'm the youngest guy in my platoon. I've been there for about four months. I got discharged after nine years, in August. I was the first guy in the platoon to be discharged, because there weren't any replacements for me. I didn't have any family members to take me in, and when I was in the hospital I wasn't eligible for health benefits, so I just got a job, just to get by. It's hard. Sometimes I think about the way I feel now. I'll be the first one in the morning. I don't want to go in. There are guys in my position. It bothers me. It shouldn't bother me. That's how I was, that's how my brother was, and my parents, that was how I grew up. I think all these things that they're telling me I'm supposed to feel or do are just nonsense. I feel like a piece of crap."   - -.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and difficult to understand. I had a hard time understanding how one is supposed to tell the difference between a negative and positive response to a book. The main character is an intelligent, but confused, man. I found myself trying to figure out the various ways that the book described different types of negative emotions. The author tries to convey the emotion through the use of symbolism rather than through the verbal description. I was frustrated at a number of times in trying to understand the meaning of a book that I found difficult to read. If you are interested in the psychology behind how people make decisions, but don't have the patience to read a long book, then I recommend this book to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of the first 2 books in the series by this author. This was the third book, and it was horrible! The entire book was a complete waste of time, and all of it was spent just trying to understand the plot, what was happening, etc. There were just no interesting characters, and the author completely wasted two years. I thought this was the final book, but I've been able to find a good deal of the books online, and even read a few reviews, and none of them seem to mention the plot so I don't know how this book was supposed to end. And I'm so sorry, but if the entire book were this bad, then I have a feeling the next books in this series would have been better, which would have prevented me from wasting money on this.   I've read two of the other books in these series, and I think that I will be stopping with this one as well. But it really didn't help much either. I'll probably continue reading The Dark Forest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "I would highly recommend this book and it is one of the best books I've read in years."  - Chris, April 2010  "This book has made a major impact on my life. I will never forget this one." , September 2009  I would strongly recommend this to anyone who's ever wanted to try to understand the basic laws of how a living organism functions. It would be perfect for someone who's never been a biologist, but is still a little curious and wants to know more about the way things work. It's a very concise book. I had difficulty with the formatting and didn't know the right pages to use for some of the chapters. That's really understandable, since the book was originally written in a different order, and then reorganized. But even in its new form it's still great to be able to reference it on the web.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________ I really enjoyed reading this book. I was in a good mood and I found the author, Susan Brownmiller, a person I could relate to on many levels. I loved her description of the way that men feel about women, and the way women have treated men in the past (see for example: "A woman's body had been taken over by the patriarchal religion of her sex," and also: "They were never supposed to have a soul. They were never meant to have anything to be proud of or to be free of."). In this book, the main character is a middle aged, white, straight, upper-class woman, and I enjoyed her attitude towards life and what it means to be human. But after a while the book became about how the author feels about her own gender and the gender that surrounds her, and it became just a little depressing. So, despite liking Susan's writing, I was disappointed in how she handled the subject of gender in this book (see how she describes the women in her life, for example). The whole book felt a little too much like a book about a white woman feeling trapped in her own house. The characters were not very well developed, and there was not enough time for them to develop (see the characters that had little or nothing to do with each other). There were a few minor spoilers, so be warned if you don't want to know anything about this book: I liked it but didn't like it much.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** A couple of years back I bought a couple of books from a group of authors. I think I got it free of charge, as I was not really interested in any of the titles in the group. I bought the third one, "The Black Cat". It is the story of two young children (my daughter and I, aged 4 and 7) who discover a baby doll in their house. The baby doll is named "Gillie" and it is really dead. The story is about the characters discovering that there is more to "Gilly" than it seems and finding out more about her past. It is quite good and if you love reading about children's stories you'll like this one. *****************   4 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. So I read the book, and I don't get how it works. First of all, the author tells you that you are going to have a hard time writing a review. You have to be a writer for a while, and then all you have to do is write a review on what you had to read. And the thing is, you just don't want to write a negative article because you think the book is crap. The book just doesn't make sense to you, you can't relate to it, and you just really can't get excited about the plot. The characters have no motivation to do anything. I think a better way to describe it is "mumble-mumble", or to use a slightly different word, "trouble". The whole thing is very mumbled. This is a book that will give you the mumble- mumble headache!
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I was not expecting this book to be worth my time at all. As far as the main characters go it has a rather weak cast and characters in general. I'm not saying that the book is bad, it's actually quite well written and I think it is a pretty good read. There's lots of tension and drama and there's some good action. However the plot is very predictable and the ending is really, really cliche. The problem is that it is just too cliche to be original. This book did not make me laugh, I did not think this book was a good read because it was very repetitive and it lacked the originality of a work of genius. But still, I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I don't think the book needs to be bad, I think the writer needs to try to be more original.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last 3/4 of the book is really boring and predictable. I expected a lot more from the author and I just didn't like it at all. 3/4 stars instead of 5/5. This book did get an A.  But I would rather have the author write the next book "The One Where...  I think the author made too many assumptions and too many points to make.  This is an example of bad writing by the author.   The first point she made in her first chapter is:  "   "I'm here to tell you that you are going to have to find a different definition of 'a' if you're going to write a definition for the word 'a'."  She made this statement before she even established what the word "a" actually means.  It's as if she has never seen the word before and never meant for it to be defined in her book.  I know that I shouldn't be so critical of an author but my opinion doesn't matter.  That's why she has to change it in the next draft.  Also the definition of a "doodlebug" is "A small, tiny bug."  What's wrong with this sentence?   This is not a definition.  This isn't even correct grammar.  The word "doodles" is never used before the word is "bug".  This sentence is just making shit up and it's making this book difficult to read.  For the first time in my life I have a lot of trouble reading.  To be fair I was only about half way through the book. I did read the end of this book though so I'm not sure I'll take this book as gospel.  "The author of this textbook is well-educated, with a PhD in linguistics and a degree in mathematics.   She has a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania and a BA from the university of Iowa.  Her writing style is elegant and, at times, a little quirky; she knows her material inside and out."  That sounds like a good enough reason to read this book. In this book I have to say that this author's ignorance is astounding.  Let's just look at some of her mistakes. 1. The author stated that an adjective is a noun when the noun is an adjective.   This is a really bad mistake.   An adjective is not always a noun

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- My book was not what I expected. It is about a man that had no idea of what he had when he was a young boy. He had no knowledge of life, of love, of anything. He thought he was alone and his life was terrible. The book starts out with his first marriage and how it was a waste of money, but then I saw that there was someone on the other side of that and it made me so mad. It started off so happy and then they went back to that person that they were married to. He thinks he's not worth anything because he was never liked by the other. It ends on a depressing note. He was so alone and it is the only thing that he is happy with. I will not be buying this book and I think I will try to get some kind of help before I try to read any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is very boring. There's no plot development at all (there's a plot line that I found interesting but all that happened was that the main character was abducted by a group of people who used some magic to turn her into a werewolf). At one point, the main guy is talking about how he doesn't think the main lady is attractive and she tells him that she's pretty and it's all about the looks now. That's pretty much the entire first half.The second half is more interesting. In the second half, the character is introduced, some backstory is given, and then the characters are introduced. Then a plotline starts to develop and it really does look like the werewolf-like creature is after the other characters. In short, the second part of the story is much more interesting than the first part. The author did a good job of making sure the second-half was better than the book's first half, though.The last part is great. It's very dark and it was written very well. It was a fun read and I'll definitely pick it up again. I was actually very pleased to learn that there is actually an audiobook available for this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I was expecting more from this author than a very poor effort to cash in on the success of his own books and to try to make some money. I can see why some people who read the original series would get excited over this, but I can't imagine that anyone who hasn't read the books would.   A lot of people are saying that this book is good, but that it's too long. But I'd say the first 50 pages are probably the best of the whole series, because they contain so much potential. I have read some other people say that it was way too short, and that it starts off too slow. I think I may have read that somewhere before but I never bothered to check and now that I do, I see that I was wrong. This book is short and sweet. The first 50 or so pages are just excellent.  ....   The next 100 pages or so, unfortunately, are not at all as good. And that's saying something. It isn't bad in any respect, but it isn't the best either. As I'm writing this, I'm almost done with the last 10% of the book and am still not feeling as good about it as I did at the start.   the first 5/6 books are so good that it is really hard to not be sucked in by the series. The ending of the first one, with the reveal that a major character is actually one of the major villains, is so satisfying that I almost can't believe that it didn't happen earlier. It does.   with the first few major plotlines. For all the great stuff that happens after that point, the ending was too much of a letdown for me. It seemed too obvious that the characters would escape with their lives, and there's really nothing to really point out that the plot hasn't been finished. At one point, it even feels like there are two separate books here because one ends and the other one doesn't. The last major plotline seems to be going nowhere, so I'm surprised that it wasn't resolved earlier. If there had been one last major twist in there, it might have been great. But it wasn be nice if that were the whole story and it was the only thing to come out of the books.   and then we get the middle and end of the series, which is the same as the last one. The book ends with the main characters fighting against
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________ The worst book I have ever read. This book was so badly written that it would have made a bad television show. The book begins with two people talking about a very strange experience that they had while in a trance. Then they meet again, and the events are different. Now we find out that the two people have met before in a dream and when they are both awake it is very strange. Then one of the people wakes up and the whole book is a dream. It is really stupid. It was really hard to follow because the author tried to get the reader to pay more attention to one character in the dream than to the other. At least it gave me a good laugh. It did make me think of the movie "The Big Chill". It is a pity that I could not finish this book before bed time because it was just too stupid. I will have to read the next book in the series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to read a book about how bad your life is, read this.   This book was terrible. I had a hard time finishing it because I kept laughing and then laughing at things in the first 2/3 of the book. So many of the things in this book were just so stupid that it's almost as if he's trying to see if he can get away with making it as a non-fiction writer.   and the end of the last paragraph was just so silly...like this "but it's not my fault" and "it's the author's fault" thing and then "it should have ended on that note". The whole book was so boring to me that i could not finish it. I wanted to rip my bookcase apart and read it again.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************   "I don't want to put my book down. I read it three times and had to turn it off and start again. It's a good book." -Mariana, Ohio   I love reading books with happy endings. It gives me a lot of satisfaction that my favorite characters get the happy ending they deserve.   This book is all about a girl named Sarah who is a princess. She has been brought up to believe that the world is about to end. It was because of her that her parents decided to take her to a witch for an evil spell that will get her to sleep. The witch, though, has not done anything to her but give her a happy ending. When the spell fails she is sent to the realm of the dead.  ...   Now what's great about the way Sarah's book ends is the way it deals with her own past. Her parents are in the castle and she is alone in the forest while her parents are on a quest. She is alone because when she got older she chose to stay at home and take care of her sick mother. She decided that this would be the right thing to do and she has spent the last few days watching over her mother and getting her ready for the journey ahead.  But she is still confused about what she will do when her parents come back to get her. Her mother asks her where she will be going, and Sarah tells her that she will sleep in the kingdom of the Dead. And her mother says that this is the last time her mother will ever see her. Sarah is now confused about where she is going. She knows that she needs to get back to her family but is unsure what it is she will find there. I loved this part. It shows us a little of what makes Sarah such a strong girl and gives her a chance to grow up. I also like how the author shows us the kingdom she is in. It is such a beautifully drawn realm. This isn't your typical fantasy world where everyone lives in mud huts and the land is covered with dead trees and swamps. You can see the mountains and trees here. It has a beautiful atmosphere to it.   in all this book was just plain enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading a happy happy ending in a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- There are a lot of things wrong with this book. I mean a LOT. First, there are too many different perspectives. There's no "one true viewpoint", it's just "a bunch of viewpoints". We get two perspectives on a topic and that is it. I have never been able to get away with that. I'd much rather get a "slice of the view" because I'm actually not that familiar with the topic, I only have my own perspective and this book does not provide any real insight into it. They did do some good interviews (like Dan Carlin) but still, it's too many people talking about the same thing. Second, the writing style of this book is not very good. I'm sure if this was a documentary or a magazine article it would have been great. The way it's written is like you're reading an article and they're just saying whatever they want without thinking about it. When I think about this book I can't believe it was written and published at all. It's like it was put out by a kid in the 90s and that kid is still thinking in that kind of way and it's terrible. There are too few good ideas in this book, which is really disappointing because a lot was good. My favorite part of the book is the "how to" section. I don't know about you, but that section was the best part of this whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I was very disappointed in this book. The main character seems like she's going to be interesting, but as soon as she gets into the scene, she just starts yelling and cursing about the situation she's in. I don't know what to make of her other than that she's a bitch. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I was totally expecting this book to be more fun than it turned out to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a couple of great bits in the book, but as a whole, this is a very, very unoriginal and boring novel.   This is really, truly, the story of a man named Kip who is sent by his employers to collect documents from a woman he had an affair with when they were both in college. He's been told this woman has died, but she is alive, and has a daughter. He finds the daughter at a time when Kip is trying to reconnect with his mother. And she is a total moron.  She can't remember her own birthday, the year of her death, or even the name of her mother, who had recently passed away. Kip has no idea if he is going to be given a raise or not. She can't even spell her own name, and she has no clue how she ended up at the site where Kip found her, or what she knows about Kip or the man who had an interest in her while he was out on leave. There is one scene in particular that really goes off the rails and becomes very unsettling, I have no idea how this lady did that to herself, and I am very, VERY disturbed by it. And then there's the ending. I can't think of a better way to end a novel than to show the bad guy escaping, then showing the girl who was supposed to have been killed, and then giving the poor guy a last, final kiss. I mean, if she was alive, how could she do that to Kip, and have it look so natural, in a scene that was supposed, like I said, to be creepy, and sad, and mysterious?   It's just so, so, bad.  ...

It is not only boring, but a big rip off of the movie.  I don't care about the movie so why would I read this?

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I will not read another book by this author. It is impossible to have a serious relationship with this man. He is extremely abusive. No matter what he does to you, you will feel horrible. I can't believe anyone would let him get away with it, and I will be doing my best to stop reading his books.   I am not surprised by this. He was also accused of sexual harassment by a friend of mine who had read his book, and who has yet to return to read another.   the only good thing I can say about this book is that he makes it clear at the end that his abusive behavior isn't acceptable in his relationship with a female friend. I have to wonder if he was aware of this. If so, this book does not help him to change.     It's really very sad to read a story like this, where it seems like there is a bright, shining ray of hope, and then there is all this dark darkness.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read many reviews before I purchased this book, and although I had heard good things, I thought it was a little expensive for a paperback. It did not disappoint and I was very happy with this purchase.  The book is written in an engaging narrative style that has the reader looking at each situation with a mixture of awe and disbelief.  the narration by John Williams is very good and the narration of the events are narrated by a different character each time, making this book very original and I like that. I like the author to do this, because it adds to the mystery of what really happened in the event. The book itself is about a man who has been working at the morgue for two years. He gets transferred to the morgues of different locations and becomes aware of all the gruesome deaths he is seeing. He is shocked to see how often these deaths are committed and the amount of blood that was spilled. He begins to suspect the dead, and starts to feel guilty, which gets him in trouble with the department of public health. Then he is accused of doing it for money. He becomes involved with a murderer named Jack the Ripper. This is where the story gets complicated and really good. This book is not a perfect book, but it is a very good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................................... I had no idea the quality of the writing was so low.

I'm sure I'll read it again to see how it compares to the other books I've bought recently.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back in 1997 when it first came out. I remember it being fun, but I've since become aware of how much more complicated the game mechanics are. I've not read it again since then, but it remains a fun game to read about.   My big complaint is that this book has no end. There are only four main characters and all of them are the same type of player. If I had to choose one main character I could only think of one, and I'm not entirely sure which one. He doesn't really get anything out of the game, and he's so boring and one-dimensional that it's hard to find a redeeming quality in him. There's no point to his personality in the book, it's just there as a way to keep the main player busy, a character with an attitude.   A friend of mine was given the book by a friend who also had it as a gift, and the second he opened the first page he just flipped it over. This guy is so stupid that he can't handle even the shortest, simplest game. In fact, he's the type of person who would play D&D if he was the DM. It doesn't matter how many different players he had in his game. Every time he played his game he couldn't figure out how to keep up. I think the same would be true for anyone who played this game. It's like trying to do the same thing over and over and expect to get anywhere.   of a good book:  Overall, a fun, well-written book about a fun old game.   "If we were forced to play by the rules of our predecessors, how much of us would be left alive?"   In a post-apocalyptic world where most humans have been killed off, the survivors have been split into three factions, each of whom are fighting to control the remaining humans: the Order, the Order of the Gauntlet and the Order Of The Sword. The Order is trying to keep to the old ways of their kind and make it as difficult as possible for the Order to come into power by eliminating the last human. The order also has a large army, which is commanded by the head of the order, who tries to impose his will on the other two factions.   The Order is set on Earth. The game takes place on Earth in the year 2020. The world has been ravaged by a disease called "Sangu
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- "It is a very sad and unfortunate story. I never believed in that man's claims to god. But this man has a gift. You can believe what you want. I have no problems with that. But if a man is claiming to be a god, and you find it hard to believe, why would you be happy with a guy who has a different belief system and is only interested in money? I am sorry, this book made me hate a man, I did not want to like him. I am not sure why. This book is full of lies. I'm not going to tell you who is lying but I know for sure that it is not him. This is a man who has tried his hardest to prove himself, only to be proved wrong by an unbelievable story that is unbelievable. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read two books in this series, both of which I enjoyed. One I finished quickly and found a little difficult to follow at times, and the other I read in four days and never got around to re-reading. Both books were written by the same author. Both of these were great reads, but the second book was so terrible it made me want to read the first book. I really hope these books are being re-written because there are some good stories in here, just like the first books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- When I first read this book I was completely uninterested. I'm not even sure if I actually liked it as much as I thought I did. The problem is that this book is a "how to" book rather than a "tell me about my own experience with this book" kind of book. I had the same problem when I first came across the book, I couldn't figure out how the author made it sound like so much good came out of the book. Then I found out that I had been doing the exact same thing. --------------- The idea of this book came across to me as being rather strange. I was told to "think like your favorite authors" or "to really get what you're thinking, get inside your mind" or whatever. I think this is sort of the same thing that a lot of writers say. However I think that there is a big difference between saying, "think about this" and "write like this". --------------- I have to admit I thought this was rather weird. For one thing it sounded like my opinion was really important. When the author talks about my personality and what I do I would say to myself, "Hmm. I might have to be a little more specific here" but I wasn't. For another thing it just seemed so pretentious. ------------ My opinion of the author changed quite a bit when I was looking through her past self. ------------------------ I really liked this book, and the author did an excellent job of making it seem like something that is right up my alley. But the problem is the whole idea of what writing is like for her. So much of the idea of writing seemed to come from a different perspective than I did as a writer. -------------- This book was just so good! If you love the idea that you can think of a story and then just write it, then you'll love this book. So many stories are told so well, but I have rarely seen a writer like this. When I heard that she wrote this book a friend told me that it was her "dream book." I am so glad that she got her way. I just finished it and have already made a few changes to it, and have been so inspired to write my own story. This book is perfect for anyone who has a real love for a story. I highly recommend this book for all ages. ------------------------------- ------------- I loved this book and thought the author had the right idea, but then I read

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** The only positive I have to say about this book is that the illustrations were done by an incredible artist named David Bowers. He had a lot of fun and even came up with some ideas that were very cool. ******** The main reason this book was a disappointment to me was because, I believe, the characters were only loosely based on real people.       What is even worse, is that many of the events in the book actually happened to my brother, who is a real person and not just a name on a map in a book. I have read numerous other books based on true stories and this one really didn't seem to have the right feel of history to it.   So if you ever want to read something about real people who were part of historical events then by all means, buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I have been waiting for this book for a long time and I finally got it. It's so bad that even after finishing I wanted to finish it all over again. It was a long and hard journey but I am so satisfied. It is not even my opinion that the story is bad, it's really bad. The author doesn't seem to want to tell the reader anything. She doesn't even seem to care, so many times she repeats her story, and then she goes back to repeating it. I didn't care that she repeated what I said, I'm only telling you this because the plot is so bad. If I hadn't been reading about a girl dying of leukemia in the last chapter, I would never have read this book. I'm a college student so I'm not going to waste my time with it, but it was one of the worst books I have ever read.  If you like bad books, read this one.  a l e a s t i n g  A few weeks ago I received the first (and I mean first) copy of this book from a reader, thanks to her, I was able to finish the book. Well I'm just glad I read it. So bad that I thought I would give this book a second read.   First of all, the writing style is terrible. Everything that the author says is repetitive and it's like the author is repeating her story and it just happens to rhyme. The story begins with a girl named Rose who is in a terrible accident. The next morning she wakes up and decides to go to school. There is no explanation for what happened to her because the hospital has never released any information about her injuries. Then she is told to come back the next day, because her brother is sick in the hospital. When Rose arrives at the school she meets her older sister who is there to visit her and the two of them go to the park to play. That is the first scene, that's pretty much it.  the first chapter is a terrible start to a story and the story does get better but it is not until the fourth chapter that the reader actually gets to know the characters. This is the last scene. :The characters are just annoying and unlikable. The main characters are named Rose and Chloe and they seem like an evil twin sisters who are going to kill each other, but the story just keeps giving us the same thing and repeats this over
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This book is awful! It is a book where the author uses various stories from history, along with historical facts, to paint an uneducated picture of what they believe the true history of the American Indians were. The author says in her introduction that the information she used for the book was pulled from history books, but in truth this is an outright lie! She uses these stories to make up what is in fact a horrible, racist, and misinformed view of the Indian people. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the real history of America. I think there are many things that are wrong with the way the author has portrayed the past, but the fact remains that she knows more about history than the average person does!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has NO redeeming qualities, but is still an entertaining read for the most part. I have read so much bad poetry and this one is by far the worst.   The author was supposed to be a poet and was a wonderful writer. She did NOT get that job. She's just a copy cat of every other crappy writer who's ever come out of the country.   the worst part is that her stories are just so poorly written they are almost laughable.   (view spoiler). There is not a story line to follow, no logical flow to be found, just a series of poorly worded paragraphs. (view Spoiler) The characters are almost non-existent, not one of them is a memorable person. (The only one that comes to mind is the character of K, who's only good by being able to write about herself for a living) (view spoilers) The story isn't all that bad but the writing is so bad that it makes one's eyes glaze over. If you are looking for a book that will make you laugh or feel good, then this is for you. I didn't enjoy it very much, but if you're like me and you like to be entertained then there are a couple of moments where it seems like the author did try her best to be entertaining.   in summary, this book is terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a hard time getting through this book. I do not particularly enjoy stories that are narrated by a person who sounds like she is from a different country. I know I can get a little misty-eyed listening to somebody who sounds English as their first language. However, this is a very bad book. It has lots of good things, but its very hard to look past some serious flaws. First, it takes a lot of the good aspects from a number of different books, and reassembles them into a clunky work. This book is essentially the same as an audiobook of "The Good Earth", and "I am the Way". But, while those other books were good in their own right, I would argue that this book fails in two ways that seriously damage its reputation. For one thing, it makes a huge number of small changes in some of the more important characters that make them totally unrecognizable as the characters in their original books. Also, it rewrites major parts of the plot in some very significant ways that don't match the original. That being said, the story does move along well, and at times it's a really fun story. There are also some really pretty and poignant moments in the story that I found quite moving. The plot, though, was hard to get into. The pacing was a little on the slow side, and I found myself just wishing that it would go on. It was really fun, though. I can't recommend it, though - this book is just not good enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ This book was amazing!!! It's written very well and I am very happy with the final product.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I had high hopes for this book. It looked interesting, and the synopsis sounded promising, but when I picked it up I found it disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ (See all)  Reviews can be tricky things. Sometimes a good book will be overshadowed by a bad one, and then there's that moment when you finally sit down to read it, and you'll have a completely different opinion of it. I was once reading the short story collection of the same name by the great Michael Crichton, and it felt like an interesting read, even if it was only a short story. One day, I finished it, put the book away, went to read another book, and noticed how much I enjoyed this short story, so I bought the full book. It wasn't long until I finished the entire book, so then I thought, "Whoa, what the hell? How did this one book become this long and complex? Is it really that good?" This is a hard question to answer, and honestly, I don't know if it really matters that much. However, I do feel that I need to do something about this: If you're reading this review and you enjoyed Crichto's story, or any other book, PLEASE buy that book instead of this one. There's a little something extra that goes with the experience.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------The book sucked. I wanted to love it and I couldn't. The book was confusing and lacked any sort of coherency. I kept wondering how I was supposed to get from one chapter to another and what the author meant by the "evil empire" that is "the world". The story itself is interesting and I liked it but it would have been much better if there had been less exposition and more actual plot. The fact that the book was a "sequel" to an existing work and I never got a clue where the story would go next is quite disappointing.The world that the author created was very strange and I felt as if the author didn't quite understand how to create believable characters. As for the actual writing of the book itself, it was not bad, but it wasn't good either. I found the dialogue somewhat distracting as well. I thought the author did a great job with the art of the cover, but other than that it was uninspiring.There is no plot in the world of the world building, the story simply is. I think the fact that I could read the entire book in one sitting was a blessing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good story but the character development is way too forced and unnatural.   I felt like I was reading a diary.  There are several characters that were so stupid that they could not get out of their situations or even if they got out, they are just a bit too stupid to act like real people.  If I were a teacher or teacher's aide and this were my class, I would be concerned about students and how they can handle certain situations.  I got some points off because the characters are actually really smart but the author is just trying to get out the best in her book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** I was excited to read this book, and am even more excited to have a chance to read a sequel, because I was extremely disappointed. I loved the first book, so when I heard this was going to be an omnibus, I wasn't too worried, and I'm glad it is, because it is the first of these series that I've actually enjoyed. The first part of this omnibus really didn't do it for me, and the whole second part wasn't much better, so I'm not sure if it was the characters that had me or if the book itself.The characters are interesting, they just don't really have much to do, which is frustrating. In fact, there isn't much reason to care about the main characters, so the plot has to drag a bit. Also, they're really old for their time, so it doesn't really work well, either. I'd recommend this, if it were the only book. But unfortunately, it's not. If you're a fan of the Twilight series, you may want to read it. If not, it won't do much for you. So you can't really blame me for having trouble giving this one 3 stars. But as with anything that has the Twilight name on it, it comes with the risk that I'm gonna end up saying what everyone else has been saying for years, which would be, "that was terrible."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this is not good reading.  it is just boring.  I had to read the second part of this book to know what happened, but I guess my mind got tired by then, because it's just another bad book, and you should not buy this.  It is really just a bunch of boring events that happen in a group.  This book just seems to take a long time to get to the important events, and the time lapse between events is just the beginning of the pain in the story.  The whole time they were there I felt like they were just reading about the main character who was boring and not making anything of themselves, and just trying to make things happen to make him happy, but the events never came together and there was no reason for him to make the decisions that he did.   I was actually upset that I couldn't have a more interesting and different character who is a lot more capable and creative in the book than this character was.   I know this is a review about the second half of the book, but for me it was all over the place, and very confusing.  All in all, a really bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be rather poor. It is written by the author of The Big Book of Bad Books. He was the one who came up with the title. In addition to all the bad stuff, it also had a lot of grammar errors and grammar mistakes. I really feel this book should be called "The Bad Book of Grammar and spelling". I think if you can't follow the plot of the book or you don't have a good understanding of the English language, this book may not be for you. The main character is a teacher. His name is Jonathan "Monsieur" Hebert. He's a rather boring teacher. The book follows a lot about his classes. The kids are in the same class as the main character. When a kid gets a bad grade the teacher takes them into the class and then tells them what to do to get the grade back. Hebert is a bit of a tyrant. He always has his own way of teaching, and always wants to take his students to work and stuff. The only thing I like about Hebert, is he does make some good points, but he's not the one that is right. That is for the kids to figure out. The ending was really strange. It took me a long time to realize what was happening and why it was happening.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The author does not seem to want to create a realistic story or character. I felt I was reading about someone I knew in some fashion. His character seemed so well defined but I could not place him. He was like a faceless, gray, hollowed out man. I never knew how the guy got into the position he had in the story. He never asked for help, never seemed like he was down to get help. It made it seem like the story was trying to be a good one but the author just couldn't write it. I gave this book two stars as it was so poorly written. The story was not about the man who is in love with a woman and in a bad state of mind but the story about his struggle to get out of the relationship.   Review Details  (Verified Buyer)  Fiona  September 23, 2015   I bought this book and was so excited to read it as I had always wanted to read "The Girl on the Train". Unfortunately, it wasn't quite that good. The pacing was a bit off (I found myself reading about 20 pages a day at the start) and the story itself was a very shallow one. It seemed like there was something going on behind the man's eyes but the mystery was never answered. The mystery at the end was a little too simple. The ending seemed forced, but it was still well written. I found this to be somewhat confusing at times. It wasn't that the man was evil but it seemed that his emotions were causing him to be an accomplice in the death of a young woman (but the author never gives her name and doesn't give her a reason for her death) who wasn't even his girlfriend. I also found it strange that he wasn't being pursued by anyone. He had the same kind of eyes as the girl that he loved and they seemed like opposites. Also, why he didn't try to leave the relationship wasn't explained.   not a good read.

The main flaw I had with this book was the pacing. The beginning of the book was slow and the middle was slow but the story got interesting in the last few pages. The last ten pages were just boring and unnecessary, they made me want to end the book right away.   Writing: The writing was just like every other book by the author. I don't really think this is a bad thing. I do like the fact that she makes it very clear how everything works. There are a few times that the author made some comments that made me think she was just being lazy. I just didn't take the time to really think about the comments.   the author does mention in one of the sidebars about some aspects of the world she came up with. I thought the author would have been better off keeping these comments to herself and not mentioning them in the main text.   it's true the author tries to do a lot of things differently than what we're used to and she makes a lot more changes than what most authors would normally do. I know people will disagree with the changes she made to the setting and she did try to add some new elements to the universe. The things she did add seemed to be quite subtle and she didn't go all out with them. So I suppose I'm a bit disappointed.   a lot has changed and we're still learning about what's going on. I still think she's doing her best but she's having trouble getting her ideas across. I'm not sure if the first few books were all she had planned or if she's just been on a roll lately.   of course, that does not mean that she didn.t succeed. There's a lot that happens in this first book and that's part of the enjoyment of it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a fan of the first book and I was not as impressed with this one. I'm still reading the second book but am finding it more challenging. In the beginning, I found that the pacing was too fast. But now that I've read the second part of the book, I am starting to understand the reason why. I have my theories now why they are so fast paced in the first part but slow in the second half. I still have a lot to learn but so far, so good. The story is pretty interesting and not as much about the evil forces trying to conquer the world but more about human relationships and the consequences.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________ _______________ _____________ Review for Mockingbird by Stephen King If you have a problem reading Stephen King's book (which is very often the case) and you have to put up with the long boring slow chapters, I can only recommend to you to read it in the short term (i.e. not to reread all the chapters over and over, that will give you a different view of the same story), then read a book that you liked to get to know the author and the characters better (see my review of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and its characters). Mocking Bird was a book I hated to read. It was so poorly written and thought-provoking. I would have read it to myself. I could never recommend this book to someone because it did not entertain me in any way and only made me want to find something else to read instead.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, but I couldn't get into it. The writing style was offputting to me and it didn't seem like it had much to do with the story and I didn't care for it. I felt like there was no focus on the main character at all.  It was just a lot of generic stuff happening in a few locations and that was it.  If you like fantasy, especially with magic, but dislike writing, I'd recommend this to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "The only bad thing about this book is the lack of a conclusion; this was really missing from a great story."  Overall:     If you're into the supernatural, this book's for you. The book itself is very well written and has a nice setting and plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. I've listened to almost every audiobook by Audible.com in my lifetime and have never come away from a purchase disappointed. I have had a series of audiobooks for ages. Now, there is a new edition of this book which I've purchased with the intent of listening to it once.   I'm going to start by saying that the audiobook narration is terrible by Audibility. I never expected this at all. I usually love reading audiobios. But, for the most part, it is enjoyable. I'm a big audiobook listener and usually enjoy the narration and the storytelling.   in this book, he is very annoying. He is so annoying and unprofessional in his narration. He just doesn't understand how to narrate. He doesn't sound natural, he doesn't look natural, and his voice is so bad. He sounds like a guy that doesn't know how to record a voice. He also has some really odd accent in the middle of a sentence that just makes it hard to understand. In my opinion he shouldn't be allowed to be a narrator. He needs to learn to sound more natural. He should have never been able to be hired.   at all. He's just an unprofessional jackass. I hate to write this, but it's true.   " I'm sorry that the story didn't come to life. But I really want to believe that all the time and effort you spent in making this wonderful tale, and that it was your intention. It was a real thrill to listen to this story through your voice and your heart. I love your voice. But please, don't call me. It's not that I don't like your writing. It really is fine. But just please don't waste your time telling me how great your book is. I don and wouldn't be interested in hearing about it, even if it were great. I hope I'll be reading more by you soon. I just wanted to tell you how much I liked it."   There is no way in hell I was ever going to give this 5 stars. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars and the voice actors deserve better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story has some good ideas and the characterizations are strong. The writing is pretty poor though.   I would suggest giving this book a shot, but don't expect it to be anything more than a story that is being told from the POV of a kid with a unique point of view.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book with a gift card from my husband and he had it on his desk for quite some time. The book itself was really good and my husband is an avid reader. The problem is that this book was so slow to get to me that it was completely useless. I was trying to go back through it but just got through the first book. I think I'll have to buy another book or a book of stories to try again.   For me, it was a good read but not worth the effort. If you have a long commute and need a quick read, this is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed by this book. I didn't want to like it, but I did. And I don't understand why you can't write the kind of book that interests people.   The only way I could tell I wasn't going to like this book was when the characters were at each other's throats for the first few pages. I thought it was kind of cute. It's like when a girl wants to make out with someone at the beach and you're not going to let her because she looks bad in a bikini.  . There is no love story in this book and that's really bad. The characters, while a bit generic and a bit stereotypical, have some charm. I liked the author and I liked some of her characters. I just wanted the love story to happen.   to make a long story short, the only reason I wanted this to be good was the author made her characters look like they really liked each other and wanted to get together and make love.  : I am going to be completely honest when I say that this is probably the worst book I have ever read. I read this book because I thought that I had just finished a bad novel and I wanted to finish this one. I can say with confidence that it isn't even close to being the worst novel I have read. The author can write the worst story and still get readers to read it. My advice to the author: stop writing and do something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- *This book has too many plot holes to count. I started it, and just kept getting distracted by some random, confusing plot point, and then something unexpected would happen, and suddenly I was thrown back into a scene from the book, with the exact same plot hole. I was reading this book to take notes on one of my classes. All the students started to do this, "Read more! READ MORE!" Then the teacher said, "What are you talking about? You read the book." And they all stopped reading, and they had to ask the teacher to start over from the beginning again. But he didn't, he just took the first chapter out, and put the next chapter in, and the next, and eventually the last one. It was a complete waste of my time, and my textbook."

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not yet read this book and am only a third of the way through. While the book is well written, the main character was an annoying little monster who kept asking me if he was going to die every five pages or so. I could tell his mother was a little concerned about him and his mother has a very stern attitude, but at times the book got quite a bit grating because of the writing. It felt very repetitive to the point that it did not feel like he was learning anything about the world. The characters are not interesting, as there was little that I learned about the main characters and the main villain (the demon who has the girl's hair as a trophy for life) was really creepy. It would have been nice if she had a real purpose behind what she did or what she was trying to do. She didn't really seem to be a character, like the other characters in the book. I didn't understand what the main antagonist was trying too. I hope she's not just trying to use this book as a back up plan for her next job. I just hope she doesn't use it for bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ My friends and I were listening to the book of the same title by the late, great David Foster Wallace, and we started talking about the book. We were discussing that it felt like the kind of story that is often set in a small town, and that it seemed like he was talking about his hometown of Austin, Texas. So, we made a little note about it and ended up spending more time thinking about it than any other book we've read in a while. Then we decided that maybe we should read the book! We decided to read the second half of the book instead of the first, and boy were we surprised. The book was more about the characters, their lives, their problems, and the larger forces that shape them. I don't know what the author was trying to get at with this one, but it seemed to really get to them. It's a fun read, even though you get through it pretty fast, and I would recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  There are some really cool ideas here, but the ending leaves you hanging. I didn't really care for the final outcome, and I felt like there was a big gap in the story between the beginning and the conclusion.  The ending is a little too quick and the story kinda just sort of... ends, which, given how great the ideas are, really sucks.  If this is what "epic fantasy" has come to, I'm out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was my first Harry Potter book, and as much as I enjoyed it, I just felt the first half was too much about getting to the wizarding world. Also, the beginning was completely unrealistic. I don't know why, but the first thing that Harry did was fly. It made perfect sense, but it still made me roll my eyes a little bit. The book had some great moments, and had some pretty good plot twists, but I think the last third was all about getting all the magic figured out. I'd suggest this book for those who already have the first two books and like the idea of getting a new, interesting perspective on the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********The story is great, but the writing was atrocious. It was very annoying at times, as if the author was trying to make this feel like a movie, which it's not at all. I wish I had never bought this book. I had to force myself to finish it. The characters, even the main one, are so stupid that I could never believe that anyone would do things that stupid. ***********The characters were annoying, and I just can't believe they thought this book would be any good. One of the characters even thinks the story could be based on her character (i.e., if she has a baby, she wants the baby to be adopted by a black family). At least in "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", I never felt like I could sympathize with the main characters and felt like the author wanted to have them on the receiving end of the jokes. Even the most stereotypical black characters (like the "mammy" or the "butch" ones) weren't realistic, and the main character is so stupid, I had trouble believing he was any good or wanted to be any part of the story. The author tries to make it look like the main hero was a good, intelligent, hard-working, good kid. But the story makes him out to be an idiot and completely out of his depth, and he really doesn't belong in this book at all, not even close. ***************This is a textbook example of how a book can be made to sound like a film. The plot of the book was very cliché, so it would be so easy for the story to be turned into a movie and make you laugh and feel bad. The writing was awful, especially for this book, which I bought to read for fun. This is a book I would never recommend to anyone, because the writing is so bad. My advice would be that if you buy this book to read it for fun, it is just a bad experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________  I've never liked this genre of stories, as most stories are a bit corny or dull. A few times I've tried to give this book a try, but I've not liked it at all. It is soooo dry. If I were going to read a book that was so boring, that would be my pick.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was terrible. I read the last few chapters after it started to snow and then I was so sick of the character and the plot I could have died. I'm writing this to alert people of the horrible things that happened to this book and to warn the readers. Please don't waste your time with this book. It will ruin your day
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This is probably my least favorite book of all time. It is not only poorly written, but the characters are so unlikable that the book becomes a painful waste of time. The only thing I like about the book are the moments when it attempts to show us an alternative reality, but then it is a far cry from that.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I didn't realize that this was such a long book. I thought it was a short book, but I'm glad I was wrong. It was a very boring read with nothing going on, the only interesting things were the many times in the novel that she referred to her books as her books, when in reality her books were "her" books, the one thing that bothered me was that there was no "the" for a part of the book that it was suppose to be the "this", but she said "the this" was important and that this is important, but there is no such thing in the book and there is "the and and and" and in the "and" and she can't make up her mind if she's writing a book about a dog, or if she wants to write a book that's about dogs. The book was written very clearly, as you can tell. It wasn't confusing, it was just confusing. I have a good memory, so it's not that I forgot what was in it, but it made it that much harder to read.  I read the paperback version, but since it was published in 2002, I read the new re-release book because I was curious as to what the changes were and to see if it was any different. I'm a little shocked that a book I had loved in the 80's has been edited to make it sound like a different animal than it actually is. The only thing that was really different was that I read a little of the "second" section of the original book before the first section, because the new book had a different opening line which made me have an even more difficult time following what she was saying. .  is very much the same as the book it's based on. It has the same characters, same story, same setting, same plot, etc. The difference is that the book "the first" is much more entertaining than the new version. But for someone who hasn't read the book they will never be able to fully appreciate the fact that it is a book based on the movie. You can't see any reason for anyone to buy a new copy, unless they want to read the movie version. It is really a shame because it is such a fantastic book, I can't believe that a movie based on a book would have the same quality. I've read lots of fan-fiction, fan-novels, and fan-
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is not well written and was very slow and annoying. The main characters had no development in the beginning and were a little predictable.  I was really hoping that the characters would develop in the second half of the book but they did not.  I don't really think the book was good enough to read  I would have preferred a slightly less fast paced and dramatic book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* I really wanted to like this book. I am from the southern U.S. and this is a very accurate portrayal of our southern country. The thing that made me frustrated was the author does not address issues and struggles that we face in today's society. There was no mention of police brutality against blacks, or lack of opportunities in our society. What the book did talk about was the fact that people in the south are very different from those in the north, and that they're not all alike, but I felt as if this book was not about the south, but rather the author. The lack of a better term to describe this southern society would be "narcissistic." I'm sure this book is meant to be funny but for the fact it is not funny I can only conclude it is an attempt to create a new sense of normalcy for the reader. I understand that the book was written a hundred years ago and that we have progressed, but this book does not relate well to current society. This book is very political and has no time to focus on what society looks like today. I think that the author should have added a part on what it would be like to live in the northern suburbs of our major cities (Chicago, Detroit, Chicago Heights and St. Louis). This book could have been written in the 1940s or 60s. I would not have liked this book at all if I had not read it first. I do think that if you are looking for a book about the southern culture you might as well buy the book it tells of. I have read other books about the history of our country, but they were not very descriptive. I highly recommend the book and this author. Just do not take my comments and opinions as a definite negative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it is a collection of bad writing from a good author. The story starts with a lot of interesting ideas and the writer is able to create interesting characters and situations. Then the story quickly starts to descend into stupidity and is nothing more than filler. It ends up not really having a great message so it becomes more of a slog than a challenge. A good story should not be boring and should challenge the reader to think about what they are seeing. The author should strive to tell a compelling story, not have a reader read through it with no comprehension. I had to stop the book several times because I could not understand anything that was happening and my mind was stuck on the same issue. The book was a great story and I recommend it to a friend but not as a book for the sake of it. If you want a book that will keep you reading through the end of the book to the end because you think that you can read it in one sitting you are in the wrong book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book and it was well written with a great narrative. It was the last book in the series that I read and I loved it. The characters were well developed with some really nice backstories and emotions from characters and I even felt sorry for one of the main characters. I also found a little bit of humor in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story with great characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I read this book for the first time a week ago and I am really disappointed. I can tell it is not a book that the authors had intended to make into a bestseller. I've read so many books like this recently, I'm thinking I must have been a lucky recipient of a particularly good one. It feels like the book is rushed, rushed, and rushed. This makes it very hard to enjoy, but I'll take the frustration of not enjoying this over not enjoying a well written book any day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in two days, and it was just as much of a chore as I thought it would be, but there were a few moments of sheer brilliance that got me really excited to read the rest of the book. I really do like the protagonist, who is definitely a great protagonist, but he is definitely just like one of those people that seem to just be in it for the wrong reasons (the "meh" or "hated on" type). I am a big fan of the writing style of the story, the descriptions, and the pacing of the plot. I did find myself thinking some of the questions were answered at the end, but I would have liked more information given as to why they were asking certain questions, what their intentions were, why it was important to them, etc. This book is a great read and I am definitely giving it another chance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was written for a young audience and I do not feel it was appropriate for that. I did not like how the hero in it was introduced, but I can see where the author had him as an innocent guy who had just come into trouble for the first time and was caught. Then the villain in the book showed up and it was too complicated.   I just wanted to laugh at him being a dumbass. I am not going to waste the author's time on that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the concept and thought that the writing was good. I liked the idea of the "mysteries of the sea." Unfortunately, the writing is completely forgettable and has no plot. It is like some people are playing a video game.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was so much worse than I imagined it. It was so badly written and I think the author was probably high when he wrote it. I wish it wasn't as bad as it was. I know what I am getting into. I will give it another chance and I may give it 4 stars just because it was written in the 60's but still I will not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I think this is one of those "not-quite-good" books that people tend to put on "for later" or "when they've had some time to think about it." It is hard to be critical when you have been immersed in the book for so long that it is very hard to say "oh, that was weak," or even "that didn't really make me want to read it," when you already think you agree with everything else that is said. Maybe in a second or two the "why it was a bad read" would come, but I think most of the time people are content with that. I think I would have been better off just buying a physical copy or renting from a video store instead of trying to find a copy in a library, because it is really hard to understand what the original publisher says about a book you have no idea what the book is.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I bought this book based on the reviews but I did not like it at all. The story is so unbelievable to the point where it makes you laugh, which I don't like to do but the stories that the author told seemed too good to be true. It also seemed like the author did not want to use a real name. I also was really bored with the ending because the character is not interesting at all and it just ended.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. For all its merits and interesting characters, this book was extremely dull. The book is about a man named Sam who has an amazing love for books. When he is given a very rare book by his friend, he has an out of this world experience, and I quote "This is a book that I am going to treasure." This book does not disappoint. Sam loves to learn and read and the book keeps adding new experiences to his life. One day, Sam is invited to a private party at a castle, and there are books everywhere. When Sam opens the book, he falls in love. The entire book was about Sam's discovery of books and how it affects his life, and that made it incredibly boring. There was nothing about books in this book that stood out or made me go "Ah, I'd love to read this."   The first half of the book is great. Sam goes out exploring the castle and trying to discover more about the books he was given. Unfortunately, Sam does not discover much. I did not enjoy it, but at least the book started strong and did not have a slow down. It's nice to know that a book is ending, but I was hoping for something better from this book (I'm sure it's coming). The second half was boring. This book was completely different. This time Sam was told that the books were going to make the world a better place, and it seemed to work. He goes to a city and is able to meet people who he would otherwise never meet, and the city is much better than it was in the book. I think it is a great concept to start a book on, but this book didn't live up to it. The world building and book learning in this part of the story were great. However, once the second half of this book came along, it was just awful. This was the worst part of this story. I couldn't understand a single thing that was happening in this second part. I was left wondering how this book could possibly have been worse. I wish I could give it zero stars, but the fact that I couldn  This book was so boring that I read it over and over and I would give it less than a 5 if I could. It was absolutely mind numbing. If you are interested in books and you like learning, I would recommend you ignore this book and just go read something else. I would definitely recommend this book to
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ If you ever decide to pick this book up, do it in a well-lit room at a quiet table and with the windows rolled down. It's a difficult book, and a very difficult read. The writing is slow, deliberate, almost languid. It does slow down a little after about the 70% mark. But it doesn't stop. The pacing is always quite slow, and there are no abrupt shifts in direction; there is no sudden burst of excitement or character development or dramatic shift. It just kind of drifts along for what feels like months. It will probably keep you engaged for a while, but if you read it for a literary, academic, or academic literature appreciation class, then it will be extremely frustrating.   As a writer, this is a wonderful book. I have spent the past several years reading a fair amount of books, and this is my top pick for the best book I have read. I like to think I'm a literary critic and it's always a great thrill to read a book that I consider a "best of" category. However, when it came to this one, I had to make a decision between a few "best-ofs" and it came down to this book and The Great Gatsby. I think it was a close call. The Great Divide is definitely a "great" read. It has a profound impact on me as a writer and is still my favorite book of all time.   is one of my favorite literary works of all-time. This book is an important part of my cultural education. And like a lot of great things, it's complicated and I didn't quite make the decision to read it in its entirety. But I have the feeling that I may read it eventually. It was a difficult decision, but I'm glad I made it. And since I already read all of The Great Wall by the late, great Cixin Liu, I knew I had a lot to learn from it.is one of the most brilliant, deeply meaningful, and intensely engaging literary works I have ever read.It's been twenty-two years since I first read this book. At the time, I was a very young undergraduate, and I had just taken the first of two classes that the instructor, who was a professor, was offering this year. And I was in the middle of an intense and often very difficult literary project. This was before the internet. There were no blogs or message
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so disappointing, and I wanted to like it.   The story was good. The characters, and the plot, was okay. But this book just did not have any real substance to it. The story had no real focus, it was more like a story that was told to give you an idea about some other characters. This book just made no sense. We know that the main character is a man, but who or what the main characters are really talking about, I do not know. All we know is that there is this mysterious person and they are after the ring, and that they are killing people off for it. There is no logic in the story, and it is very confusing. The author does mention at some points, that there were many, many people involved in this story, but this is not explained anywhere in the book, except that a lot of characters were involved in it. This is not a mystery book, it is just some people are killing, stealing, killing, and stealing. And then some more are stealing. This would not have bothered me, if the story were more interesting, but it is nothing but a mess.  ....   Overall, I could not recommend this book. It was a poor book, and was nothing more than some people being killed for some ring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It didn't teach me anything that I didn't already know, just in the opposite direction.   I'm really glad I purchased this book because it does teach you some really great habits and techniques. However, it's a very frustrating and difficult book. I'm not sure that I can recommend this book to people looking for a way to improve their bodyweight skills.   was so bad, you'll probably get tired of me reading it. I just wanted to give the book a 1 star rating but I feel like the author will be just as frustrating to read. The first three chapters are a great deal of fun. The final third is a little less fun because you feel like your a little like you're being yelled at for reading the book. Was it hard to follow the book? Yes, it was. Was this book a waste of time? No, it wasn't. Was the exercise necessary? Not really. But that's just because you have to work for it.  17 of 18 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   I really liked this book, but it could have been better. There is a lot of things that were explained so poorly and it seemed like there was no real intention of explaining anything at all. As a matter of fact, the author used this to make the book seem more important and profound. I know we all have our favourite authors and this book has so much going on that I am left thinking the author was so overwhelmed that he had to use it as a crutch for his other books that he could write about, and maybe that is why it didn't seem to flow. It really didn't do any of the things that it was supposed to do and that bothers me. I'm disappointed in this book because it doesn't have what I would call a "big hook." I don't think it will be read by anyone in high school but I think that might be just because it isn't as interesting and it isn,t as good as some of the books I have read but, I still think that it is a good book. It's just a really crappy book that didn't deserve to be on the reading list, but I'm not going to say no to something that sounds so exciting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The story was boring. I was so bored I just skipped forward. This book was no better than the other book I read this week. I do not think this is a good place for a young reader to be. I can't even imagine how much the author wants this to be a hit!
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________ The Story of Soma: The True Story of the Soma Revolution - by Steven Strogatz In this book, Soma, the king of wine, has been poisoned by his brother, Gautama Buddha. Now he's trying to recover his lost powers. As he does, the world is falling apart around him. The Emperor, whose family has been ruling for 500 years, is dead. His brother is an idiot and a bad king. The Empress, a very pretty woman who loves books and never reads a book, has gone mad and is killing everyone. And then Soma gets drunk. Soma has two lives. He can be either Buddha or Gaut the alcoholic. In one life, he is Buddha. He is the great teacher, the founder of India, and the author of the Buddha Sutras, which form the basis for Buddhism. In the other life, Sombra, the evil Buddha, takes over and the world gets destroyed. The only person who can stop the destruction is Soma. He must find a new path. To help Soma on his path, he sends a small group of people, the Kshatriyas, into the city to find the poison. Sombro's army is so much stronger than Soma's that they are able to beat Soma and take the poison away. Soba and the Khandhas, the assassins, are sent back to the countryside to search for the poison in other places. The plot of this story is that Soma is Buddha while Sombre is Sombri and Sombru the evil. I had an easy time enjoying this book because the author, Steven St.rogatz, is a writer for young adult children and he does a good job of writing about children as well as adults. The main thing that I really liked about this book was that it was easy to read. I didn't get tired of it in the least and there wasn't a lot of repetition. I also liked the way Strogat's characters were written. I liked how Soma was very simple yet had an interesting life. Soshia was interesting because she had such an interesting past, but she had a lot to deal with and was a very sympathetic character. I especially liked the fact that the book was written in three sections. There were chapters about Soma growing up, chapter about the Kshetra and chapter about Sombras armies. When I first started reading the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a story about a girl who is being bullied by another girl. At some point, she turns the tables and turns her bullies into her friends. The main girl's friend is a bit of a sassy girl who does things like say things like "If you wanna be on top of my bitch list, get a job". I don't really get that. Then again, in my opinion, she probably would've been perfect for the girl in this book (probably) had the book been about that. The book's pacing was very slow, and as the first half drags on, it takes away from some of the good stuff that happens later. The ending was a little bit ambiguous, but not a huge deal.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I was not excited to read this book, but I did. The premise is pretty simple and easy to understand. You take one guy who's a drug user (not to be confused with drug dealers) and you put him on a one week program to get clean. He is an interesting character and while I would not have put him in the drug addiction category, he is at least trying to get his life on track. He does everything right and I enjoyed watching him progress. The problem is that at the end of the week he comes back, and as it turns out, he's got his old friends back who he'd rather be doing drugs with. This is where I became unhappy with the book. Why would he be going back and forth with these people? In the end he decides to stay sober and just go with the flow. The book ended before I could really get my mind around this decision. That's a real shame because the book could have been a really great book.   I got this book because it was recommended by my friend and it was on the list of books that we are reading. I didn't get too invested in the book and was more or less on the fence about it. This book did not exactly get me on board with it but I'm not going to completely rule it out because I enjoyed it.   the only reason I gave it four stars is that I really liked this book. I would recommend it to anyone who has a drug use disorder. It doesn't have to be in the beginning stages or anything like that.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************** I am really disappointed and confused with the writing in this book. The author used a ton of technical terms in a way that was hard to understand and didn't make much sense, I tried to figure out what they meant but they didn't really seem like the right ones. Also in her writing, there was a lot of typos and awkward wording that made the text hard to read. Overall the book is a disappointment, I would not recommend it to anyone but it should be a reference for the beginner of the science of psychology and would not be for a very advanced reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  This review is long overdue. I read all of his books and have no problems with them, but this one is definitely his worst. It has the worst characters that he's written. It is all just too...there. It was just a bad read. I have no regrets about not purchasing it because it was just so hard to read.   Edit: I just read the second book and I was very confused. I was trying to figure out how did the events of this one happen?   The only positive that I can give this book is that I was entertained. It wasn't bad for the most part.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________" I gave this book four stars because there are parts of it that are very good. But the rest is so terrible. The first half of the book is very interesting, it deals with a number of issues I've been working on, and also has some very interesting ideas. But then it goes in a very bad direction. As I said before I have been working with my partner in a therapy relationship on how I cope with what I've done, which is very much about the fear of what I am and what I will do to myself. And I can't help but see this as a very good book. But as I read through the first half I saw it move away from what I felt I was writing about and start describing how I would want the outcome. It became an attack on me. My thoughts were demonized. It went from what it wanted me to think to how I really felt. I don't know how a person who reads a book like this can not feel the effects. My partner came in and asked if I wanted to cancel our session and when I said I donned my white coats we ended the session. It was the first time he had seen the effects of a writer going after themselves and I know I will have to work on it. This book has a bad taste to it. If I didn't know any better it looked like I was being abused. It made me feel like I had gone back into the dark ages and the worst part was I thought I had the right to make my own choices and be free to live my life without my partner. I am not saying this book needs to be banned because of the contents but I think it needs to have more warning signs. And this is a very powerful book."

Write a negative review about a bad book: *******************************  I was looking for some good, good old fashioned horror and decided to give this a try. I read it and had the usual horror tropes, the scary woman, the creepy man, and so on. So it started off, I was like, "eh, no big deal". I mean, I know I'll probably hate this book, so I expected that, I mean what can be wrong with having a good old-fashioned, classic horror horror book?  Well, that's where the trouble began. First off, the setting, if you can even call it that, is just awful. It is really, really old fashioned. The house is not a mansion, it is an old farmhouse. I think that is why the creepy, scary man in the basement is a man and not a ghost. It doesn't really look or feel like a "mansion", it looks like it is just a really old, shabby, run-down house. I don't know if it was just the layout of the house or what, but that really made me feel like I was on an old country farm with a couple of creepy men upstairs, telling me I was being a stupid slut and that I shouldn't be in there. I was really scared. I guess the point is that even if you are reading a book set in a house, don't expect it to be a cozy, cozy, farmhouse with an old man who just wants to chat. That was just wrong.  The second problem was the characters. I thought they were very stereotypical, although I didn't realize it at the time. They were all very stereotypical. First of all, the women. I mean there is no denying they were all strong, independent women, but they were not strong like they were supposed to be. They all looked pretty much the same. They didn't have that little spark of badassiness that all the good women in fantasy tend to have. They just looked like they wanted to get their way, or that they wanted the man to get in trouble. It was like they just wanted a man who would treat them the way they wanted. Then you have the men. They seemed really stereotypical, except the one guy who was just a jerk, who I guess he was supposed to represent some kind of manly manly spirit. But no. No way, manly men don't act like jerks. It's like they don't really like

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________ This book was a big disappointment. It is filled with bad science, bad statistics and, worse yet, the authors claim that global warming is a myth. The most glaring error is that the IPCC's climate models predict that the amount of solar energy reaching the earth will be the same no matter what. The earth is, in fact, absorbing a huge amount of energy as it warms. If we want to avoid a bad future, we need to have lower CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the author fails to consider that the warming the earth has had in the past is largely due to humans. If, on the other hand, we reduce emissions of CO2, we will also reduce warming. Also, the modelers made a huge error with their temperature estimates. In all, the chapter is a piece of junk science, but its primary purpose is to convince people that carbon dioxide doesn't matter. They claim that their model forecasts that CO2 will make little difference in temperatures. But this is just a gross overstatement. For example, a recent study by scientists from NOAA and NASA concluded that CO 2 makes a big difference. The study states "On average, a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 results in a 3.1°C [6.3°F] increase in global mean surface temperature (a 3.7°F increase in the mid-latitudes and 5.6°F in the high latitudes). In contrast, a similar doubling of CO 2 alone results in approximately 0.2°C increase in temperature on average (a 2.3 degree temperature increase in mid- to high latitude regions and a 0.4 degree increase in high latitude regions). This effect is more pronounced for short-duration extreme weather events." It should also be noted that CO has many effects. The greenhouse gas traps heat which causes warming. CO can also trap water vapor. So if we want higher CO levels, we are also adding water vapor to the atmosphere. The other problem with this chapter is that it fails to mention that carbon pollution is the main driver of warming. If you don't believe this, go to your local Wal-Mart and ask the cashier about the greenhouse effect. The CO2 is actually causing a massive overspill of the greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming. The final flaw in the chapter deals with a very important question: what is the best way to cut CO 2 emissions. The authors answer this question with an absurdly
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book sucks --------------- The book is filled with all sorts of inaccuracies (which are really not the author's fault because he does not understand the material), and some parts of it are just plain bad. The whole point of this book is to teach children about the differences between the world of man and the world in which we live. What this book did instead is to attempt to teach these children that there are only two sides to every story and that the world outside of their walls is a bad place. In particular, in the part about religion I found some quite strange things said: "God doesn't care about people's lives and doesn't give a shit about their feelings." (the author didn't say this, but I doubt it). "The world will end when it's ready, because there's nothing we can do to stop it." In a way this really makes no sense. In reality, as many religions are quite vague about this, and most people seem to know it is something that needs to be fixed. This doesn't mean God can't care what happens to his creation, but it does mean that if you don't like the things God is telling you, you should probably just leave the religion. And that, frankly, sounds pretty much like what the author says in the end about religion (although I would argue that we should probably be leaving more often). Another point that annoyed me was when the author mentioned that he was a fan of a certain book. In the end he claims that it was nothing like his book and doesn the book and all its problems, but he then says: "I was glad I had this book and read it. This is one of the only places I will go when I want to really understand something." I have read the author has his own website (http://www.fansandcreators.com) and even writes a fanzine (http//fanzine.com/) where he does interviews with famous writers and artists. For someone who spends his time studying a subject as complex and deep as religion, I think it would be very unfortunate if he were to get all wound up when people disagreed with him. And when he finally said: I know we have different views, but my main goal here is not to change anyone's views. He does not say that he doesn't think these other people are right about anything. He says that his main goal is to understand something from different perspectives, and if he disagrees with
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a little hard to get a hold of the audio book because I wasn't really an audiobook fan until i read it. But, it didn't really help. The characters were very generic, and not much of a story was given to them. This doesn't really do much to make me care about them, so it feels like a bad story to me. If there was more to the characters then there would be a better story.   I would recommend this book to people who liked the first one, and are looking for something a little different. It's not as good as the original, but it's better than most "novels".

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************** The author uses the "evil" "evil world" to push his "evil agenda" and "evil force" in this book. The first few chapters are not evil at all, as he uses evil for good reasons to explain the history of a people, a place, a culture, but as the book goes on the bad characters are revealed. The author, himself, doesn't think about the impact his writing has on society. I don't think he understands what he is doing as he's writing this book (he is supposed to be a writer, after all), but he wants to force his opinion on people who don't believe in him. This is sad, as the author can be really charming in person. The writing can be "awkward" at times. It's hard to understand everything the characters say. One person's "evilness" is another person's kindness and compassion. This can be a real problem for some readers, especially if one of the people in the book happens to be you or someone you love. This book may be a great read for young teenagers but it's not a good read for someone with an adult outlook. I was also disappointed by the fact that the characters' names were so similar to people I've heard of (some people even say the characters sound like characters from Star Wars!). Overall, I don,t think this book is worth reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like to give bad reviews for bad books, but for this book, it is hard to get past the horrible writing.

But when she gets pregnant she doesn't know if she wants to keep it or not. She doesn't want to have a baby, she's scared of the thought, but she's also very grateful to her doctor, and in turn she is thankful to her husband for supporting her and being so understanding.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author of this book is a man with some of the worst writing I have ever read, and it is all over this book. The first half of the book is about the author trying to tell a story about his life and then he throws a whole bunch of unrelated crap in the middle to pad out the pages, and in the process makes his life story much less interesting. It is also very poorly written and the author uses an incredibly old style of writing, which is also pretty terrible and not the best. If you are going to write a book, at least have a coherent story. I got bored after about the 1/3rd of the way through this book, so I decided to look at other novels. I still wanted to read the rest of the story, but the author did this for me and ruined the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ ="   First of all, I'm not sure I understand what the reviews are about. I read the review of the first book which said this book was a big disappointment, I felt the same way too. However, after reading this book, I feel the same.   This is about three people who have just returned from a vacation to Italy. They find their way to a local resort. They decide to play cards on a balcony in the hotel. A woman with a baby falls in and gets seriously injured and dies. When they go to the hospital, the manager says it would cost so much to treat her. That she will have to be cremated, which they are against. Their friend suggests a memorial service for her at her home, which is not allowed. But he says they can't do nothing. She is in their memory and she is not going to be forgotten.   of course, all of the rules are changed to make it easier to deal with. The friend gets a job with the host and the two friends go to her house. While at her house, they find a little girl who is not really alive. And when they wake her up, she says, "Mom, Dad, I have a bad headache." I won't give the book away, but I believe the daughter was named Amy or Amy who lives in the nearby town. She has been brought to the house by her grandmother. The daughter and her friend say they would love to help her but her grandmother, who is a nurse, doesn't want them to come and treat her, so she wants to send her to the local hospital. There, she won't be able to come out. But they come anyway and take her there. They also find a dead man. The man says he has a stomachache and will die. They can't find anything else but the body and a gun. But the police find him dead and the gun. So he had been killed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read. I'd never heard of the author before I started, and didn't have high expectations from him. Instead, I found myself reading a litany of bad ideas and illogical arguments, and getting lost in the details of each. At the end, I had a headache and felt sick to my stomach from the sheer boredom. If there's one thing I've learned over the last 20 years, it's that if you expect anything from a book, it'll disappoint you. I'm happy that the book has been made available for free, but it's a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a bad story, it made me uncomfortable and it made my heart sink when it was over.  In the end I found the book very interesting but it had a lot of problems.  My biggest problem is with the last third of the story, I felt like the story was going to end with something really big, but it didn't, it ended with a really small ending. I liked the premise of the book but it was boring and I didn't feel any emotional attachment to the characters, the author didn't write them in a way that made me feel like I knew them well or cared about them, it didn' t make me care for them, which is always a great thing when you're writing a book and I was really disappointed because I was looking forward to seeing how the author handled the last book, that part of the novel was definitely a let down and it was frustrating for me, and I think it was for the author as well.  This is a really great book, but that last third is a problem and I'll never read this book again
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________   "This book has all of the elements of a 'how to' book on how to get through a difficult pregnancy. First, we are told what the fetus looks like. The description is informative. The reader is then told why the fetus is called a "head." Next, the reader is told how a fetus develops. The chapter on embryology includes an anatomical diagram that clearly depicts the fetus' head and spine, plus the fetus in utero. The book also discusses the physical characteristics of the fetus as it develops. However, there is nothing in the book that explains how this information relates to the baby, what will happen during pregnancy, or how to make the process as safe as possible. This information is given in terms of the risks involved, but nothing about the risks to the mother or her baby."   ---Linda L. Davis, M.D., author of The Unstoppable Baby   In the third chapter, Dr. Kornhauser's chapter on fetal development discusses the "head" portion of the fetal fetus. This section of the chapter does not include any information about the mother, her health, her prenatal care or her choices.  Chapter 4: "The Heart"  In this chapter, the author describes the heart. While there is a very large amount of information on the heart and its functions, very little information is provided about the actual fetal heart. The first thing we read about the heart is the description of it in Chapter 1 of the book. After the description is complete, we find out that the fetal heart is in a large amniotic sac. The author mentions that the heart's "structure" is much like the adult heart and that the "heart has a smooth, circular architecture with a thick, branched aorta with three segments, the two outer segments connected to one another by a single sinus. This aortic system is very well developed, with a large heart and a well developed aneurysm" (p. 4). At no point do we find anything about the fetal "heart," whether or not it has a beating, how its structure differs from the adult's heart, or any information on how it is different from the fetus's heart. - Dr. Catherine N.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    By: S. L. King, Published: December 7, 2015  The author is quite passionate about the topic of the book. She makes the reader care about the characters and even puts them into their own story. However, the main issue I had with this book was the dialogue. It's quite cliched, and while it's well written, there are times when you want to cut out the dialogue so that the characters could say what they wanted to say.   The book is primarily a historical novel, about King Henry VIII, Queen Catherine Parr and his first wife Anne Boleyn. There are many interesting details to be found, and the author manages to keep the focus of the story on the events. This was quite an accomplishment, and I found myself following the storyline very closely. One problem I had was the fact that one of the characters was a villain. You might be thinking, "how can a historical book have a villain?" The answer is actually quite simple, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.  In addition, the author makes mention about the character being a "great lord" and the importance of his position, but she doesn't tell us who that character is, and neither do the books. This leaves the reader to wonder who this person is and what he's like. The main character, Henry, comes across as a braggart, who is more interested in having the "right" woman, as opposed to being a nice person. The romance between Catherine and Henry is weak, and although it may be because he's young, it felt rather forced. He doesn't even seem to really care about her well being, he just wants her to fall in love with him. The book doesn't explain exactly why his father died. Perhaps he had an affair? Who knows?  When it came to the subject of marriage, I didn't really care much for either character. Catherine just doesn't seem to care about a man being a proper gentleman or a good husband. Her husband seems to be more concerned with his reputation than her happiness. Henry seems like a bit of an asshole, but not that much of one. He seems like he has little concern for women and they seem very much at his mercy. He does seem like he knows his place in the world and tries to do what is right, but it doesn't always seem like it. The whole situation
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was disappointing. The first part of it had a great concept. The author describes how the planet has gone through a great climate change and all of the different animals that live there have evolved to deal with it. The problem with this part of the book is that the author really makes the story seem boring. As a scientist he should be describing the new discoveries he is making and how the data he is finding can be used to make predictions about the future. Instead he is describing the animals that are dealing with the change, making the animals seem more like props in a movie. It really makes it seem like it's a movie instead of a book. For example, the last part about the animals in the arctic is a movie plot. This could have been used to describe how some animals deal with the harsh weather and cold that is coming to the arctics.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************This is a terrible book and I feel like it was written by a third-rate writer who never had a chance to write her own stories. There's no character development, no tension, no emotion or plot. I hated the fact that I had to read it to even enjoy it. The story was pretty much a bunch of random events happening around the main character. She starts out as a good person that just can't do the right thing. Then, after a tragedy (she was raped and murdered by a co-worker), she becomes a villain. She murders and abuses her employees in front of people and just laughs about it. I found it very depressing, especially in the second half where we learn how much the company loves her because she helped them save the company. I wish the book was half as long and half as interesting. I'm sure I'll read it again and hopefully that will be the last time I have to read one of these books. I think the author of the book is so lazy that she didn't even consider making this story a book and just had it be a series. She probably only had one character, the CEO, and that's what she created to drive the story. She was just trying to make an interesting character and that turned out to be extremely bad and made this book an absolute chore to read.I am very upset with this book because the entire thing was just like the first 5 minutes of the movie Clueless. It was a bad movie, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy it or it became a chore to see it again. If I wanted to see someone just making things up that was so boring and horrible, I'd watch the movie. It's just the same movie and I wish it was the first thing I saw when I got into this series. I wouldn't even finish it and would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________This book is not for people that read long books (usually in the 60-80 page range). There is an excellent description of how the different parts of a book are put together, and it is very good. Unfortunately, the description of the various parts of the book were vague enough for the reader to be confused about how it all fit together. For example, on page 5 he talks about how the chapters were numbered, and on page 16 he talks of how there was a chapter for each step in the process (which actually isn't true). This means that at the end of the reading of the first part, you may be feeling confused about why the second part is called the "conclusion" chapter, because the first one is still a bit unclear and you may need to read it again to get it all explained. I think the author should have done a better job of telling the reader that everything is happening one after another in this story, not one after the other in a series of linked books. I have read other people's reviews that they really enjoyed the book, and I think this could have been a really good book if it had been written better. I know I'll definitely be looking out for the next book that the author will try to write a better one, but for now, I'm disappointed because the book just wasn't that good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have heard that the final draft of this book was a mess, and the editing process seemed to take forever, but for what it's worth, I really enjoyed this book.  The plot was interesting.  I enjoyed the characters, but I did not understand what was happening.  There were times when I thought that I was reading something, but then, in the next sentence, I would realize it was actually the end of the book, and then I would be in shock.   I wish the author would do something different with the plot in future books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!The story is a total crap,and the characters are not likable at all.It is a good book to read when you feel bored,but do not let that fool you into thinking that it is a great book. It is a complete waste of your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________This is the worst book i ever read. The only thing that kept me reading this book was the fact that it was in 2 different formats - and it was a hardcover. The entire thing was really weird and confusing to me, as i did not fully understand it. The characters were completely different and it just seems like the authors couldn't even think of one that would fit the genre. There is only one woman in the book, and even she doesn't seem like a real person - i couldnt help but feel that she was a character created by the author for her own entertainment. Even the writing was very awkward to read.I can't say i enjoyed this one at all.  "All is lost, the only hope lies with the past. For the past it was not known, it was never meant to be known."   I will warn you before the review that this is a book about a group of teenagers that discover their mother is actually alive and is a vampire. The first part of the book involves their friends trying to get rid of the vampires and the second part is their story when their mother goes missing.   The main problem with this book is that the main characters don't really do anything, they just sit there and take notes. It is really strange as the plot doesn't really start until about the halfway mark and then there is some really confusing, out of nowhere stuff that makes you wonder why no one seemed to think of this before and the fact is that it seems really out of character for the characters. It was hard to follow and it made me wonder why this book even existed.   be warned, there are some things that you don't want to read, and the writing here is so awkward that you have a hard time keeping up with what is going on.  -The first half of the story doesn't happen. They are reading a book together and all of a sudden there is a flashback to where they are and there is no explanation, no explanation what is really happening in this book. I am not sure how this book got through but i was like why doesn't anyone care to read it before it gets published.  , not much more to say, just a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book is a great one to read if you are a fan of the original trilogy or just a fan and want to know more about the game that made them so rich! The book does not give all the details of the game like other novels, but it does give some general information on how the game worked, how many soldiers, the types of weapons, etc. I can only think that the author may have made some mistakes during the writing process. Some of the characters were not developed well enough to be likable. However, if you have no clue about the games history then this book will not give you enough background information to be able to understand and enjoy it.   There was a point where I started reading this book with the assumption that I should be getting the second novel because the books in the series were so good. That didn't last long. I couldn't get into the first book. The book was hard to follow and I felt as if I had to memorize a huge amount of information to understand how the characters lived. The books feel so different from each other that it makes it almost impossible to read them all, and that's a shame because I feel this is the only way to go about reading the games.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book. There was a lot of good information and insight in the book. But it was way too long and it left me wanting more. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is just starting or is looking for an insight into a subject that is too complex for them.  There are better books for learning about some of the topics covered in this book, I was really interested in. I got the info I needed in about half of the book, but other stuff was not so clear.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________   In an attempt to improve my writing I purchased the author's previous books to see if any of them were good. I was expecting something different than this. I think he is a great storyteller but his writing style is more like a rambling diatribe than anything like being a storytellers voice. At some point he started to ramble and the pace became rather slow as the story took him on a journey to a town called the "Powder Mill". This is probably the worst book he has ever written. It starts off so good. Then the story takes an unexpected turn and it is downhill from there. It has no clear focus other than to tell an interesting story. The only thing that saved the book was that it is a novella. I will not be reading any of his other work.   Note: A story called The Last Day of the Year was also part of this collection.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! This book was so horrible to me...I felt like the author was saying something for her own benefit...it wasn't true and the author, a person I trust, said it. I can't believe someone would write a book like this. I think it is really bad to just write about what you want to say. She just made me feel bad for having an opinion.   I was given the book because I am a victim of a car accident, I lost my car and car insurance didn't cover any medical bills. I was put on this program by an attorney from a small firm and it is supposed to help you after you are involved in a car crash, your car is totaled, and your insurance does not cover any damage. So it was like the lawyer told me my insurance was going to be paid and he could help me out. I am so sad about my loss. I have had an accident before and it was pretty bad, and so this book seemed to be saying that I need to find a way to make more money out of a situation like this...it just didn't make sense to me. It didn't seem to make sense for what she was saying. I wasn't made to feel bad. I just felt like she wanted my money.   the attorney had to ask my permission to take my medical bills to another insurance company, even though he said he didn't know if they would pay. He also did a scan on my head, and my friend told me it looked like she thought she had a tumor, even I am not sure why he said she might have a tumor. He then told me he would check out the tumor and then he asked for my permission again to scan my head. He showed me the pictures and told me I had a bad thing on my skull, and that it was dangerous. I said "well this is my car, if I get hit by someone, if my insurance doesn't cover anything, then I am out of there". He said "that is the insurance company's job to pay your medical bills, and they can't just let your friend take care of your car". I said it sounds like it is his job to help me, he said "you don't get any say in the matter". I felt like it was not right for him to say that. I also found it very hard to believe that his company was trying to get money out me. I'm not a bad person.   on the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think you will enjoy this book, but the ending is just plain weird.  The ending is kind of a mess, which seems to be common for these books.  "There was a darkness.    There was something in the darkness. I wanted to know what it was and how to fight it." I wanted to read this book because of the synopsis, which suggested that it was set in a "Gothic Horror" style.  The synopsis said something like, "The book takes place in a small southern town after a mysterious plague that sweeps through town and kills all of the townspeople, except for four young women.  In their time of darkness, the four women struggle to survive their own nightmares as they seek the answers to what caused this plague, and a mysterious stranger."   The book does not seem like a Gothic Horror novel, so I was surprised.  I wanted it to be, so when I finished it I was a little disappointed.  There was a lot of talk about something that was just weird and not like anything I have ever read.  Here are some of the things that bothered me:  The ending I guess.  So... I was expecting some kind of "happy ending", but it turns out there was a "darkness" that would haunt these four women for the rest of their lives.   One of the women who didn't survive the plague was a nun who had been working with one of the patients (a child who had never seen the outside world).   She was a very strong woman, but was scared that she wouldn't be able to help the child, but she didn't know what she could do.   The mother of one of those women was killed, and this mother-in-law was the last person who lived in the town.   She told this woman that she couldn't find anything that would make her happy.   But I don't think you can tell anything about someone's happiness or lack of it from just looking at them.   It's a pretty dark novel and it makes you realize that sometimes what we think we understand about life is just wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main characters are very good characters. Their personalities are well developed and make you want to know more. However, the main characters have problems they will face at some point that will have consequences and make their lives hell.   Overall a good story with a lot of depth, but the ending just felt rushed. It was good but not a classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disappointment! The author's knowledge of military history is pretty low - the book is about an army, not the history of the people in it.  She had an awful time with the book, and the author does not come across as a particularly good historian or writer.  I think she went with an extremely amateur writing style that felt sloppy and underdeveloped.  The narrative was poor and not well thought out, and in places it felt like an afterthought rather than a central part of the story.  One particular character (my favorite and most respected of the protagonists) had more of an impact on me than any of the others, yet the book never explored her past or her life.  There is a great deal of evidence of the authors own dislike of her, which she makes very clear in her personal notes in the margins, which seem to have been written by the author, with only a few small corrections.   I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I highly doubt that the author has any intention of making it available in any sort of print.  Also, as stated above, the book reads poorly and it's hard to tell if it was ever even produced.  In a nutshell:   It was a hard book to write, and a very difficult book to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The more I read about the war, the more I realized that it didn't seem so bad. I was glad when the fighting stopped, so I could get back to the happy life of my own books.   Now, however, the book is a nightmare. And not only that, I was so unhappy that I refused to take the book back after reading the first chapter. My whole life is a tragedy! I'll never forgive this author!"

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________  I had this book written before I was even finished my third book. I loved the first book so much that I wanted to keep reading it and then I finished it (yes, I am obsessive about finishing books and I can't get out of it). This book however, was a complete disappointment. The author does a good job of describing the world and the creatures we meet but the characters that make up the rest of the book are boring, shallow and don't really have much of a story to tell. The main villain was the least interesting part of the story. His motivations were really unclear, he made no sense, and didn't add anything to the overall story. And of course, I found him to be a stupid villain.   I was really hoping to like this book. Unfortunately, it really didn't go the way I wanted it to.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you enjoyed the first book then this is a much better read.   It is a more believable world with many more aspects to it.  I was excited for this one but it ended up disappointing me.  The story seems more developed and it is more of a character study of one person.  There are some fun parts of the book but it seemed a bit rushed.  It could have been a lot of fun but it just does not seem very original.  For people who would like to know more about the setting:  A couple of reasons why you should go with this book: 1- The first book is amazing.  While the second one can seem confusing and confusing you will be much better prepared.  In this book there is a bit more of an emphasis on the other characters as well as some very interesting side characters.  2- If you have read the first and second book then you will definitely know what you are getting into.  If you do not want to read it then you might not understand a few things.  3- If it is a sci-fi adventure book then that is cool.  But if it is the kind of thing where you expect to see some amazing action then you are going to be disappointed. For a book that is about a girl and her relationship with a tree you would expect the tree to be quite beautiful.  You would also expect the relationship between the two to be a little complicated.  I was expecting them to be completely compatible and they were not.  Instead they seemed to have some issues, which is good because it meant that I learned a lot more about them.  Even though their issues may have kept them apart in the beginning I really enjoyed reading about them and how they tried to get over it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:..................................................... I just finished this book and I don't like it. It was a bit dull. I didn't even like the character. She was only interested in herself and her own desires. This woman is so self-centered that she has no care about anyone else. She's a whore to herself and wants others to think the same. Not true. She is just a whoremonger. She didn't know that the other girl was having sex with her boyfriend and he didn't tell her. And when he started to make advances toward her, she told him she was only in love with herself and didn't care about the other person. I don' t think she's a good character, but the guy has a nice story. I just don't think there's a reason for her to become a whorer. This guy deserves to be happy and not have to keep having sex all the time.

"...This book has been a great addition to the literature on the life of Abraham Lincoln. It is both entertaining and educational."  the Chicago Tribune  Reviews  (click on book for reviews) : This is a book that I never got around to reading. I am amazed at how this book has become a best-seller! I wish I had read it sooner! The author does a good job with the narration. This one was a little difficult for me to read. Not sure how long it took me to finish. The narrator also did not understand some of the issues the author tried to address. However, the author did an excellent job of making me understand and learn the facts about Lincoln. The only criticism I can give this book is that I found it a little boring at times. I found myself reading the book again and again to see if I could find anything new. I did find myself looking for other sources of information about Lincoln's time in Illinois. This was the first time I have read an accurate historical book about Lincoln in which he was a part of. I really enjoyed it, but if you are looking for a more exciting and interesting story about Lincoln then look elsewhere.  From the Chicago Reader: "A long and interesting read, and it is quite interesting that Lincoln's first job after college was in Springfield."  of course, the other thing that is missing is Lincoln as a politician! This book does not tell that story. It tells Lincoln's life as a farmer, a farmer who married and started a family, a preacher who began preaching to others, a politician, a soldier, and a President.   "While Lincoln's reading was great, it would have been even better if he had been able to narrate the life that happened around him."  a reader from South Africa : It is
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I bought this for a great review by one of my favorite authors. I read it before I could even start reading my copy. I was very disappointed in the book and the author. I am not even going to give it 2 stars for that. I cannot put into words how disappointing this book is. If you read this book you will think the same thing I did, that if I could be anyone else and read this in a good light I would. This book does not live up to the standard of a good story. The author has poor grammar, terrible descriptions, poor characterizations, and poor storytelling. It also lacks a real sense of humor. I will not be buying a copy of this. I also will not recommend this book to anyone who has not been to a horror convention.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was bad. I read it, it's horrible, it was boring, and it sucked. It was all those things. I couldn't read it without it getting to me. I know that a lot of people hated it, but it was a good read. I'm going to look back at the negative things that I said and the bad things that others said, and remember why this book sucked. I also remember my friends saying that I read the book and was "that guy" who got all pissed when it was over, and that made me feel good because I don't think people should judge a book by the type of person who read it. The book itself was not bad. It just wasn't good. The writing was not that great. I found it really boring, especially since the main characters, I didn't like at all. I felt as if the author had no idea how to make the characters really interesting. I wanted to throw the book in the trash when the last page was opened. This book was just bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~~This book made me really upset~~~ I mean, I've read a lot of bad horror books, but to say this one was BAD would be an understatement. So, I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if this book will appeal to people who like horror, or to people trying to stay away from it, because it made me very angry.I hate to be too harsh, but the way the characters behaved was really immature and stupid. They didn't seem to take responsibility for their actions or take the punishment they deserved. I really could've used more of a story. I don't really think the book was bad in a bad way, it was just extremely immature and not interesting at all. I guess I'll have to keep an eye out for other books from the author, but this book won't do it for me at all..
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************** I was excited to start The Boy Who Died in the Woods, when it was announced last year. I didn't have to wait long for it though, in November I found this book sitting on my shelf. This book, and its companion story, The Girl Who Could See Time, were actually published in the UK in the early 80s. The story is about a boy named Peter who has his imagination, but never actually learns to control it. In his third year of secondary school Peter is obsessed with a boy who looks just like him and plays the same game as him. So what do you do when you can't get over a crush. You don't make up another one. You have your little girl, and her name is Kate. You spend all your free time with her. When your family move from London to another small town you have to face the consequences of your actions. I did like this book. It was a slow paced tale of an obsession. If I was reading this book for the first time I would have loved it. I think the author could have made the story a little better. For one thing, I think it could have been a little more interesting if the boy who resembles Peter had a name. When I read the books the names of the characters always had a lot of potential. I was hoping for another name, but that didn't happen. I could see that the author put a lot more effort into making the characters and the world as real as possible. It didn't take long for me to become enthralled with the world, and by the end of the book I was really rooting for Kate, even though she was in the minority. She has an odd personality, but she has a strong heart. I would recommend this book to a friend if you are looking for a slower paced story that has some real depth to it. This is a book for people who enjoy books that will hold their attention for quite some time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ If you can do better than this, please don't rate it. I'm not going to do a review about what the book is like. If you read the first few pages, you'll know what I'm talking about.   This book is an example of why I hate reviews:   "Forget the concept of a good book or movie. What we're looking at here is a series of badly written, poorly paced, poorly organized, badly written books. It's like a series where every book is a self-help book, and the bad ones don't get any better. The best way I can describe it is like a bunch of poor, badly acted, badly edited movies with bad dialogue."   I could go on, but you get the point. The book, the movie, the TV show, the other books, the whole thing, it's all a collection of poorly written, badly paced, badly organized, poorly written books that all have the same basic premise: "Do things better, please please please make it better, I really, truly, really want to help myself, please help me, please make me a better person, please, please."   the end result of this process is that it's basically just more self-doubt, more self doubt, more doubt and more shame, more shame and more self pity. What do you do when you're being bullied, or you're not allowed to do what you want to do, or whatever it is? You make more excuses. You justify. You become defensive. This is what you do in a self help book. If this is a new concept to you, that's fine. I can't stop you from buying it, but if you can't read it, can't comprehend it, or if it just makes you feel bad, please just stop buying it. You don't have to like it, don't like it is going to be a waste of time and money and you don't need to spend your life reading a series like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would give this book two stars, but for the fact that the only reason the characters have names (and thus no personality) is because of the author's attempt to make us believe that the characters are real.

As much as I would love to say that I liked it, I'm just not ready to talk about this yet. It was completely unenjoyable.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I was looking forward to reading this book. I've read many books on the subject of the paranormal. They've all been bad. This one was better than all the rest. I felt at peace while reading it. It was a calm and serene book. The author did her research and gave us lots of information about how these things work. It's not a scary book. It teaches you about the paranormal and how to approach it with an open mind and a sense of respect for the paranormal as something that is very real. The book also has a lot of stories of those who have actually encountered the paranormal, which are very interesting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about these topics. You won't be scared, you will learn. I am happy to be a part of the growing paranormal community. -A.S. (Florida)

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters seem to be completely devoid of life or emotion, like in the movies. This is not a case of 'bad' characters, but a case where characters are so unlikable they have little value to anyone. The main character is such a bad ass and is in charge of saving the world, but has no personality. I have never seen a more boring character than the main character. The fact that there was no backstory for this man is a big turn off. I was just really bored with this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I was a bit confused as to why the book was published, but I read it, and I was wrong about so much. This book is absolutely atrocious. The main character is so obnoxious and overbearing. The first half of the book takes place in a dream state where he is a boy, and when he wakes up, he is so happy to be a man, he has no idea of his place. He takes a job as a teacher, so he could get the money he needs to become a man. When he finds out that he is not man enough to be the teacher, he tries to change back to a boy. The teacher, who he is really in love with, is not supportive of this. It takes so long for her to realize that he has become a different person, and she is only concerned about his sex life. They begin to argue over their relationship, and this eventually becomes a physical fight, because she realizes that he doesn't love her. Finally, she goes to the principal, and tells him about his sexual affair with the girl. She refuses to stay in his classroom and he is forced to leave. However, the principal is a pedophile, and will do anything to keep his students happy, which includes turning them into perverts. So he comes up with a plan to force the principal to stay, in order to make the students love him again. Unfortunately, the students don't like the plan, so they all leave, and that's how they are introduced to the "real world."The characters are so stupid, and the way the story is told is so poorly written. I don't know who wrote this book, but it needs to be taken out and thrown away. I would never recommend this book to anyone, and it was so obvious that it was written by someone with absolutely no talent. I've heard of some authors who have a terrible writing style, but this author just has no talent whatsoever. There are no surprises, there is no suspense, and no growth in the characters. The author does not write characters who have any depth to them, or make you care about them, like most other authors do. He writes a boring character who only has sex with the teacher for money, who does not give a single thing to the character and is nothing more than an object for the main characters to be with. There was no buildup, there was no development, and there is nothing to make you feel any sympathy for these
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was going to be good. After reading some reviews I thought I'd try it out. Boy was I wrong. It was very poorly written. I feel that someone with at least 1 other person to read it with must have read the first few chapters and just skipped the rest. I am very disappointed with the whole book and would not recommend to anyone. The characters are uninteresting, uninspiring, and the plot is poor. I have not read any of the others by the author, so cannot comment on the quality of her other books.   I found the first 50 or so pages pretty boring. I kept wanting to jump ahead, but the author kept making me read more and more boring pages. It wasn't until I was halfway through that I could finally get into the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I was not familiar with the book, I probably would have given the book 1 star for being too confusing to understand. It made little sense to me and there was a lot of grammar errors. I have no problem with people who get confused, but the author needs to know there are a lot more readers than just her own little fan base. I am not sure if the story is too long or too complicated, I can say I was still able to get through it but still had a hard time getting through everything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A bad book in any genre can suck and you can find good ones in a million different books or movies, but if it is written badly, you will have a bad experience.  That is just my opinion, not something to blame anyone for or defend, I just have a personal opinion.  The story starts off with a bang, or so it seems, as the protagonist, "Ira" (also called "I" by some) is in the middle of his first successful career as a professional bodybuilder.   Unfortunately, that is about to change as his career begins to take a turn for the worse.  A bad mistake, a horrible one, that no man in their right mind would ever do.  So they say, as Ira wakes up one morning with a cold and an inexplicable desire to take drugs.  He grabs a packet of Ecstasy and starts down the road of self destruction.  Unfortunately, once he starts down that road, Ira is not going to make it through alive. This book is written well, as it is not about what the protagonist is doing in his own head, but rather what the antagonist is doing behind him.  The author clearly is trying to convey something.  However, it does not come across well and it really does not do its job.    The first half of the book is where the author makes an attempt to get across what drugs are and why they are so bad.  After I read a good part of the first half, I realized it was just so much exposition and that the author had no idea what drugs actually do or what they could do to someone.    It also seems to be a little bit dated, not being that original and new in that area.  It would be a lot better to show what these drugs are actually doing to a person's body and brain.    As the first section of the novel opens, I found myself thinking, "This is going to be much better".  The first section starts off as something I could really see myself enjoying.  What the author is trying so hard to do is make Ira seem like a nice guy who is just trying to get through his life.  Sure he gets hurt and makes some bad decisions, but that is the price we have to pay for living in a world where everything we want is more than we can ever imagine.  This could be something that would make me love this book
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I was really excited when I saw that this book was about what it's like to be in a loving relationship where one partner cheats on the other, but it was also about how to be there for your partner through that time. The author did a good job of showing the ups and downs, but the whole affair was a horrible experience. I think the main reason it was so horrible was because the other person had no idea what was going on. She thought they were just doing a random encounter that turned into something sexual, and even though she said she was really happy to have the other woman there, she had no clue what was happening. The thing is, she was so into the affair with the other man that she didn't know what was really happening. She didn't realize the extent to which the other guy was hurting them or that he was using her and didn't even realize he was doing it. When he was cheating, he didn't tell her and she didn  really like him so it really hurt her to see him be so selfish and hurtful. She kept saying he should get some help, and he told her he just didn't think it was the right time. He said he liked her but she had a boyfriend so they were gonna take it slow. They went on a couple of dates before they went to a place where the other guys was taking off their clothes and making out. They were so into it that he wasn't worried about anyone else and started touching them on their bodies. They had all kinds of fun making out and playing games and he didn.t even notice. The girl wanted to end it, but she kept feeling that something wasn't right and knew something wasn. When they got in the car, she told him that she knew it was wrong, but he just kept telling her to get back to him. He started making out with her in front of the other men in the room and the whole time it was happening she kept making excuses for him, even though they weren't wrong. They ended up going back to his place and they started getting all crazy and making up weird stuff, he even made up a story about someone else making out in his room. He went on and on and when he was done, he left her alone in the hotel. She felt like she had done something really bad and it really destroyed her because she wanted to break up with him and he was so nice to her, but just left her there
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   The only real problem I had with the book was the pacing. I could not get the plot moving anywhere fast enough to keep my attention. When I'm reading a fantasy novel, it should take me longer to finish than it did, but the only thing that slowed it down was the author's constant changes in POV. The point was to let the reader be pulled into the story, and there is a great deal of that happening here, but it is in places too fast and it becomes hard to keep up with everything. And then, when the narrative does finally start to pick up, it is almost like a blur: "And that was the last of the book." The last book? But it ended on the final page! I'd thought that this would help it stand out more and take me a bit longer to read, but I think I'll stick with it, but not read it this time around.   Other than that, the book is great, and I am very excited to read it, especially after my first read of the series.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- It had all the hallmarks of a typical John Grisham novel. It's a fairly typical thriller in that the protagonist is very well written and has all the makings of a hero. The twist is what made it interesting and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels the author has an eye for the dramatic. But once I reached the end, I wasn't surprised by anything. --------------- What could have been: ------------- I'd recommend this for anyone who loves thrillers, thrillers and more thrillers. As for me, I'm pretty sure it was a fun read, but I won't be picking it up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________  A bit too hard. Too many things happen for one character to survive.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read several books from that author. These are not books that I would recommend. They just don't do what they claim they will do. I'm not sure if the reviews about the book just need to be edited or if the publisher needs to have a serious rethink of the way they produce books. I'll keep an open mind and hope it's just an editing job gone wrong. Rating: 0.0
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it's been on my shelf for a long time. It was recommended to me by my boyfriend and I was going to reread it. Unfortunately, it's only been on for about a week now and I can't remember why I liked it so much. I am in high school.   There's no romance in this story. There's no angst. There is no fighting. There are no heroes. In the end, it doesn't really matter who's who.   for me, this was just too slow. There was way too much time spent describing the mundane.   in my high school I learned how to read faster. I had to. In high school, a book could take two days to read. At college, it could take 3 days, or more. Even if it's a mystery, I'll read it as fast as possible. When I read this, I didn't read it at all. I read it the second or third day. That's what I had planned. I was actually reading the first few pages of the book before my mom got home from work. It took me 3 days to finish it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________ I'm giving this book 5 stars because I really liked it. I've never been a fan of "realistic" fantasy (I'm also not a fan if it's "horror" or "action"), but I really enjoyed this book and it's setting. It's very well-developed and the characters are all interesting, with very little fluff. I found the writing style very engaging. The author's style is very unique and interesting, and she uses very few words, and when she does, she uses them in appropriate places. The story itself was very good, and I was surprised at how well-thought-out and well-researched it was. Although, I would say this is one of those "once in a lifetime" books. I have not read any other books by the same author. Although I liked the characters, I didn't like how I could relate to them. I know that they are all very different from each other, and that it's easy to relate to different types of people (even though there are some very odd characters in this book). Overall, the book was really good and I'm glad that I picked it up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is not good and some things are over powered.   But most of all I would just like to thank him and tell him that I hope he will get better with his writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's good, but the story itself is really bad. I mean, why would a vampire want to eat people? He's too busy eating his victims to think of that sort of thing. The story has a lot of plot holes. A vampire that is very old that is a bit weird. And it's just really hard to get into and read for me. The characters aren't well-developed at all. They're bland. I don't care for the story as much as I do the characters. I do like it though, it's very fun.     Overall:    I have a few other books that are a bit more entertaining than this one. However, the writing style of the author just didn't work for me that well. I enjoyed reading this book.  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was reading this book for the first time and had no idea what to expect. The book is well written and the story is interesting and the descriptions of the cities are quite accurate. The story seems pretty good and there are even some twists. As a first time reader I was expecting this to be a boring and slow story and that it would be a long book. I was absolutely surprised at how fast and well written this book was.   The narration was pretty good, he read the book as if he was watching a movie on the television. It was interesting to listen to him, he sounds like a young man in his early 20's which I found refreshing to a book in this genre. The dialogue was clear and understandable. One of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much was the characters. Every character is likable and well developed. The first three or so chapters were a little slow but after the first hundred pages I had completely fallen in love with all of them. I really hope to get the next two books in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ is a book I have read a few times in the past, but never gave it 4 stars! This book was a complete train wreck! First off, I hate the word "stupid". The author, Paul, was able to write a book with the word stupid in it, yet somehow manages to make it a good book! The first chapter is just ridiculous. It makes me want to throw my computer across the room! It has this strange word game where he has to use the words "Dumb" and "Stupid" and make a list of 10 random words that each come up and describe one of the characters in the book. I mean, it's like this one person could write a 10,000 word book on that sentence alone. It's crazy! I felt sorry for the character "Sue" because she has to do everything for this stupid idiot Paul! It was just so...weird! Then he writes a long novel with tons of crazy "Suitcase Movies" that are all just terrible. I think he thought he was writing a book but really he just wrote a pile of garbage! I think his main issue is that he was so busy writing the "stupids" in his book that he didn't write enough stories for the bad characters, like the evil boss that does "Stupid Stuff" to everyone that he meets. Paul spends way too much time on the bad people and not enough on the good characters. The other thing that pissed me off is how he talks about sex, or at least "sex." Sex is such a sensitive subject! Most people don't want to talk about it, but Paul tries to make a case about the importance of sex. But it's just stupid! This was one of those books where if the "bad" things happened in the story, you'd think he was trying to make some sort of point. I felt so bad for his character "Bubbles". She had such a sad life. When the story focuses on her, she has so many things going on that she's in so much trouble. But, she also does this stupid "Sex Thing" with this guy that is really dumb and embarrassing to watch. It was really sad to read the story about that. I just wish that Paul would have learned that I HATE sex scenes in books! It is way too important! I want to say the only good thing about this book is that it's in the "The
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   A book that is a disappointment by any means   So I bought this book and I've only read a little so far. I will try to finish the book and make notes on it but I think the biggest thing that I took away is the ending. There is no conclusion to the story. You never know what's going to happen. So the whole story is in your head and it's hard to figure out what's real or not real.   The characters are terrible. They don't do anything for the story and it seems like they don't even want to do anything. They are very flat and they are very forgettable.   the characters are not very interesting or well developed.   (I will get back to this)   Plot is pretty good. It's a little slow at first but by the end it builds up really well and I had a lot of fun with the ending

Write a negative review about a bad book:    * I really liked this book.   The main character was interesting.  It was interesting to learn about her background. I liked the mystery behind her murder.  Her past was well-developed and explained in an interesting way.

I wanted to read more.  It was good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   I've been reading this for a week and I have no idea why it is so horrible. The plot is boring and the characters are horrible.   So there's this guy, Mike, he lives in a giant apartment with a bunch of roommates that include a girl, Alice, the sister of the guy, and the son of the woman he's sleeping with, and they all live together.  , I got it. This was in part because the roommate's names are Alice and Frank. I was expecting to be introduced to more characters that weren't named Mike.   The other main character, Mike's wife, Marcella, is an ass. Mike is a bit of a dick and he really, REALLY wants to be able to have sex with Marcellah. It's not that he doesn't want to do it, but that the woman is in a relationship with his other neighbor, his father's former partner, so it just isn't in the cards. But Marcellaah won't have it.  : Mike says his wife doesn't like sex, but he doesnít get how she isn't into it. Mike's character was really annoying and I was really bored by it. :Marcella's character wasn't bad but I just thought she was a stupid and annoying girl. I liked Alice a lot but the way she is treated, she kind of came off as a whore. :Mikeís parents are a bit annoying as well. Their character didn't seem all that bad. :Aliceís character just comes across as a big stupid bitch that hates her brother, who I feel is just being portrayed as a jerk. I don't see it as that bad because she does have a point and he's probably just being a jerk and she's just as bad.   at one point Mike gets a big cock from Marcellahaís father, and he ends up taking it up his ass, and that was it. I mean, why do you have to be so cruel? There was no reason for this character to have a dick.   and what was the point? What did he have to do with it? If you want a real shock, just think of that.    I didn't really care for the characters. I'm not even sure the author is the author in this one. Her writing style was so cliche and the only interesting character was Mike. :the plot was pretty dull and predictable and just felt
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. ___________. The author was not very good at explaining what was happening. I had read this book a few years back and didn't feel the need to re-read it. If you are looking for a good story to read, I think this one is very good. If not, I wouldn't read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________ This book is a load of bull. It is very obvious to any rational adult that the author is in cahoots with the CIA. He is a very biased, unreliable, dishonest, dishonest person. The CIA has nothing to do with the authors decisions. A book about CIA/mind control is so far off base that I would advise people to not read this. The author seems to be a fraud, and has no integrity whatsoever. This book just proves to people, that people like me who have already been exposed to these kinds of claims, are right: this can NOT be true. I feel that my time has been wasted with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ The author seems to get lost in her own research, and the conclusions drawn are illogical and not useful to the reader. _________ The book is difficult to read, and I am not sure why I waited a year to buy it. ___________________ My husband is an avid collector of all types of historical and archeological books, and was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, it took him several tries before he finally figured out how the book was being used.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  The book is great, the narrator is great. But the whole book is the worst book I have ever read. I would give it 3 stars if I could. I was so bored for a half hour, that I gave it up and bought the book a second time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had never heard of Mr. Dutton before and have read nothing by him before. I purchased the "Tales from the Duttonian" for the reason I thought it would be a good book to read for those wanting to read something about a particular historical period in Western history. My expectations were high for this book. When I opened the book I was greeted with a "Who would have thought". I found myself wondering who the author was that had translated this book into English. I was disappointed at this. There is nothing that is original about the translation. Some of the names are similar to other peoples names and the fact that the "Duttonian"'s are not the same spelling is confusing at times. I have only read a little of the "History of the Anglo-Saxon" so I would have appreciated more information about the English people in general as well. This is the reason why I give a low rating for this title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book. The premise is great, but the characters were just poorly written and didn't make any sense. The author makes it seem as if there is so much going on that the reader just has to keep reading. I could not understand why he would make this character so angry. It is not so much that he was just mean, but that he always acted just the same. In the end the only thing that came to my mind was how much I liked my older brother growing up in the 1940's.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   I loved this book. I've read some of his other books and enjoyed them. This book was a real treat. I just finished this about 10 years ago, but I'm still going through the archives to find this book and the others he's written. I know I'm only in my mid-30s but the stories just keep going.   This story was about a man who became a vampire and then went to another world, where he learned to live in a city made of books.   has some really good lines that stuck with me even after I had read the whole book:   "You should be careful not to forget what you were, or what you did, because you will be back in a very short time. Don't make any major life decisions while you are in this place."   The first time I read this I loved it. This is what I was thinking at the time: he is a vampire. He doesn't really know how to live, so he becomes a book writer and becomes a professor, because he is bored. He goes to another land, but ends up killing many of his students and then goes to an animal park for his rest. He gets chased by a woman and finds an animal with wings who helps him get away. The last scene of the book, which I won't spoil, I'll just say that he returns to his home world. It was just so sweet and heartwarming.   to be fair, I've never really enjoyed romance books. I found them a little bland and uninteresting. I would've liked this one to be more adventurous. This one was okay. There wasn't really much in the way of story, just a vampire, a book, and some cats. I did enjoy the little romance stories he did, though. They didn't really move the story forward, though it was nice to see him in love. He's not the type of man to settle for a love that isn't deep or true.   The last section of this book was the most heartbreaking part. It's not a very long scene, but it was very moving. I read through it to find a place where he could be happy, but that's where it ended. I'm going to wait until I finish the next book before reading it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ is a great story, but is very predictable. The way you know this story is coming is at the start, and I've waited months for it to come out. It just seemed like a waste of time to wait for it. This is a good read for adults, but it is a bit tedious to follow the characters around. I think it would have been better if it was broken into chapters or have had more of an open ending (the story is not bad, but there is much more going on). I was disappointed with this book and I will not be recommending it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ ______________ This is not an interesting book. It has no plot. It does not tell a story. It just tells a story and it's not good. The characters are all one-dimensional and the story is just about them. The protagonist's family is also not very interesting. The world that they inhabit is not believable. And the plot is pretty lame.   My only positive for this book is that I liked the cover, which I think is a great idea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping to read a great story but was given this story. It had no plot, just an author making up stories based on personal experience or other people's memories of events. I never learned anything new. The memories I did learn are nothing like what was told in the book, it was a poor translation of the author's experience. I can imagine it was hard for him to write this book, the writer did not even bother to look up the original source material. He was very disappointed in himself.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful

It reads like a poorly-written horror novel with no humor and with a lot of terrible dialogue. The story of the couple trying to get their relationship in order is a good one, but then they are forced to do a ridiculous "dating game". When I got to the part where they have to find a room to sleep in, I started to laugh. This is just the most awful novel I've read in years.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ I started reading this book after I finished The Wind Through the Keyhole.  It was so close to the end of the book but that was only because I wanted to finish it faster.  In the end it was all just a waste of time, and then I was confused about where the story was going with a character that didn't seem to be doing much except trying to get the woman he loved back.  I really can't believe he was so blind to the fact that she might be cheating on him,  I also can't imagine how he got the job in the first place to begin with.   I'm giving this book one star but it should not get three stars because at least I know what happened to this guy and I know that he can't fix this. I also wish he was more honest about what really happened, but that's a story for another time.  So, as I said in my book review, I would suggest anyone to read this book, but please don't waste your time reading it or thinking it's going to be a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I read this book at the YA section of the library. I thought it was good but I have a problem. The author is wrong and doesn't understand the history of the Jewish people. When the author states that the Jews were expelled from Spain by Christians and were forced to live underground, he is incorrect. In the 15th century Jews lived peacefully in the area where Spain is now and it wasn't a Christian country. They had a flourishing community that produced scholars and authors and were extremely well connected with their Catholic relatives in the rest of Europe. They even had many Christians living in Spain and they lived together with them and were well respected for their work. The Christian Spain that expelled the Jews is nothing like what he is talking about. Jews were the leading intellectuals of Europe and Spain was the leading Christian country in Europe. This book is based on a book called "The Destruction of Spain" by Josephus Flavius and it is 100% wrong. The Spanish had their own written language, there was no Roman Catholic Inquisition, the Jews did not have to live in caves, and they were never expelled from their homes. There was a large Jewish community in Spain up until the 1590's, the Christians killed off many of the Jews there. They were in the middle of the civil wars and when the Christians won the civil war they decided to take what they wanted from the Jews. Some were taken to Cuba, other were taken by the Spanish to Spain, other Jews in America and Spain. When they got to Spain the Jews began to flee. The Jews in Spain were able to live there but they did not get the rights they were promised. They did not lose their citizenship when they got there, they still had their rights and it was not until after the Christian era that Jews in the Iberian Peninsula lost their rights. There are many other errors in this book. -------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I loved this book, but I read it in three days. It was a good read, but it was definitely a rushed read. It didn't feel like a "book" or a novel. It felt like a few thoughts about life and one sentence. The sentence was "life goes on, nothing has changed" I felt that sentence, but the book didn't let me get the full emotional and spiritual experience. I felt like I was reading something a few hours long, and I couldn't get a full feeling for it. I would give it 5 stars, but 1 is probably too high a rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ __________________________________ _______________________ ___________________________________  From: D. F. C  Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2001 20:44:44 -0600  Subject: A Review   The book is interesting to look at, and the ideas are solid, but I couldn't put it down. I am not sure if it is an author's intent to make this a history, but in the process it becomes so overly focused on one side of the story. I just read about the assassination of the Romanovs and wondered where we left them. I would have liked to see a more complete picture of their life. The end leaves you with a sense of the author's disappointment in the events and his confusion as to why they were so suddenly destroyed.   If there is another book, it would have been more interesting to hear what the author had to say about these characters, and if he has thought about how his own views changed. But there was so much material from the first book that I found it hard to keep going with the book as a whole.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I purchased this book a few months ago and am just now beginning to finish it. I have read several books that were excellent and this one was just not up to par. I can understand that it's a "work of art," but I couldn't get it to make me feel "at home." I felt as if I had dropped into a poorly-lit and overly-motorized version of "Jurassic Park." It was unenjoyable and made me feel as though I had been a spectator. I don't think it is my fault that this is a hard-cover book. The pages are so thick, and I'm not much of a reader anyway. I am not sure why they felt the need to include a "help" section but it was so poorly written it wasn't even worth reading. If this book was made of paper (it isn't) it would not be this difficult to open and read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************* I read this book at a friend's house. It was not only a terrible book (I don't know why he thought it was good. It's not. The characters have no real plot. They just sit in their home for the whole book and you read the journal entries.) and it was written by a very rude man. It makes me very angry that this book could ever be given a "good" rating. He is rude to the author, the reader, the author's friends, the people that buy his books and the people in his personal life. He insults almost everybody and it makes me sad. It breaks my heart to read how his wife treats her husband (herself) as if she is a dirty house or he is a filthy dirty house. *****
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in 2006 but I remember it was a good read. I really liked it.  I don't think anyone should give this book up and not give it another try. It's a classic. If you read it in a public library (don't think that it will be on the shelves here for a few more years) it might be hard to find. But you'll find it and that will make it worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book made me feel so guilty for not reading it sooner! It was an okay book, but i read it the week it came out and didn't finish it. There was no real reason why, just a lack of interest and time. I wish i could give this book 3 stars but it's just not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________   I read this book so that I could learn how to work in the publishing industry. I am a freelance writer, I have never written a book before. However, I do have a degree in business management. I read this books cover to cover, and it was a very easy book to comprehend. I have learned that a great editor can change a book for the better. I had several problems with the writing of this book, but it was still a good read, and I would highly recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------  It is a bad read.   A well known author of horror books, and most of these have been adapted to the big screen in the past, makes this his first novel for children, that I can see. It will probably not stand the test of time. I read it through to the end, and can't imagine that this book has many more chapters to it, as this story is nothing to write home about. The pacing was fast and furious, and the characters just seemed like they could go anywhere at any time, even though there is a very clear cut plot and a logical climax.  , if you are interested in the original work, I suggest you read it, or if you can't find it, do a Google search for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ It's like he has never read a book that didn't make him a bit nauseous. He can't put his finger on what the problem is, but the more he reads the more it seems he's just never had a good experience in any genre. This is why I hate reading reviews of novels that I haven't read. I just go to my local library and look at books that I've read before and the more I've been reading the more i've realized that I don't like this genre of book. I'm tired of it. It makes me want to go outside and do something that is more fulfilling than reading about people's love lives or the lives of random characters in the story. If you don't love it don't waste your time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friend bought this book with me and it was pretty bad. The story is nothing but a bunch of clichés from the beginning. The main character is a pretty stupid one who just wants to be popular in school. He also has a crush on another character who has a weird personality. So he tries to get them to come to his school as his friends. Well, nothing like it turned out. The protagonist is just stupid and annoying. I felt bad for him at the end, because I wanted to give him a high rating, but I didn't.  Review by: goshen on Apr. 10, 2018 :  this book is about a kid from the east coast who lives in the west coast. he goes to visit his grandma in south korea and there he meets a guy who tells him about a place called wakaru that exists in the east. i feel like this guy is the main character of the book and is a great character. i love the main protagonist and the fact that i can learn so much about what he was thinking, how he acts, and how he talks. i think this was a very good read because it was very enjoyable and easy to read  review by: danny davis on Apr 01, 2018  I don't think there is a story in this book I don't understand. .  ( I was trying to say that there is no story to this book. I am not a book reader, so I don\'t really know how this happens. You know the old joke about a guy named R. B. who has the following questions: How do I change an electrical outlet? How do they do those things? How can I go to the toilet in space? How come I don \'t have a gun? How could I be on a planet with people who don\' t have guns? So the only one who can answer all of those questions is the "god" - R.B. I was wondering if there is any connection between all of these questions.)  Read more
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written as if it were some sort of children's book or even an old fashioned children's novel. It is certainly not written as a children's or children's stories. The prose in the book is very old fashioned. It has no sense of grammar or a sense of rhyme. I am a professional writer and I have read hundreds of childrens' and young adult books, but this is the first time I have had a book that did not interest me in a literary or entertaining sense. I was only able to finish this book because of my kids and because they were willing to take it from me to finish it. I can't say I recommend the book.  Was this helpful?

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- A great story in a bad format. The writing is fine, but it isn't a very interesting story to read. The characters and setting are very well drawn and the plot is very well put together, but there just aren't enough good scenes to hold the story together. There are a number of characters who are very poorly drawn that I don't care about. The author seems to be trying too hard to be realistic. He says the main character has a history that causes him to be very protective, and it really seems to come out in the characters he makes. When he gets hurt or goes off to fight someone, he doesn't show any emotion or sadness for them, and the reader just doesn't care. Another problem that really seems out of place is the ending. It's clear to the reader that the book is very much written in the last third of the book, and that it doesn't feel as if it could come after the rest of the plot. The final part is the weakest part in the book and seems to just serve as a sort of anticlimactic conclusion, but that is not the problem with the story. This book is still good fun, and for the most part, the characters are a lot of fun to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful. The characters had no motivation and they were made to feel like they were nothing but tools of someone else. They were given too much information to believe it, but they never really did, only what was in the story and that seemed really hard to believe, since all of the characters in the book seemed to want the same thing. The story was really hard for me to believe too, since I can see this guy getting really powerful over a long time, and I'm guessing that the only way this book could have come to be was if he was insane. That being said, it was too good to be true.   It was written in the 80s and the author was clearly on drugs when writing this one. I would have thrown this book away ages ago if it was not for the fact that it was so unbelievably amazing and entertaining to read.   of all the books I've read, I've probably read more of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- In my opinion, this is the worst book I've ever read! From the beginning, the author goes out of his way to make sure he doesn't give you an explanation as to how the universe works. He is also very negative and disrespectful in his descriptions of the characters. I was so pissed off when I realized I had been using my imagination and making the characters I thought I knew true, until I realized that I didn't. Now that I've finished, I'm not sure I can ever put this book down. It was so bad that I wanted to start writing a fan-fiction about it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________ This book is soooo bad! I just finished it. I did not enjoy it at all. I found it to be a total bore. I had a headache after a couple of chapters. I thought I would be more amused by this book by reading something else that is much more entertaining and interesting. I gave the book a zero rating because the author has no respect for her readers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was a bit difficult to follow at times.   As far as characters go, I didn't care for them.  The one girl was a bitch and the other girl didn't even try.  They didn't have the character development necessary to care for any of the characters.  It took me to the edge of my seat with their characters.   I was really hoping they were going to get some development into them but that was not to be the case.   The writing was a little bit boring and I felt a lot of the main character's personality was lost in the story.    This book was not for me.  At all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________The book was very bad. I was so excited to get it, but I couldn't even finish it. The characters seemed to be drawn out, and it was just annoying and frustrating to hear the characters talk all of the time. I can't believe it took me so long to realize this. They talk about things that they haven't even seen or experienced. I kept expecting this book to be like a Disney movie or a video game or something like that. No one talked about anything that made sense. Not even the main character, or the two main characters. And most of the action happens in a boring warehouse that I wouldn't go to even if I had a million dollars, because of how boring it was. I would rather listen to about five random voices talking about their feelings all day. Maybe they will make a good story, but this book just had too much of everything, and none of it made any sense. If I wasn't so frustrated with the author, I would have given it a 4/5.But it wasn't just a bad story. I had to read a couple of the comments that were left on the Amazon page, and the comments were so bad that they were making me sick. The worst was a comment that said: "This book should be rated as a 3 or a 4, because the characters are a joke." And another comment that read "Why in the world would anyone listen to people who want to take away our free will?" This is the type of stuff that people like when they want to be offended. And it's hard for me to listen to these comments on this book, because I'm so tired of reading about someone who wants to take back their freedom. And they think that the way to do this is to put people into cages, so they can't think for themselves, and then go around the world spreading this message. But if you think this way, you can't be taken seriously. If you want to have a debate about something, go on your blog and write your opinion, and let other people decide what you think. This book should have been rated as an 8 or a 9 or something, because it was so full of false information. And the fact that you were so offended when I said something about what makes sense, is just another symptom of your low self esteem. So don't even get me started on that.I'm just done.I won't be reading this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I loved this book, but it took me way too long to get to the good parts. I think I'm going to read another book from the author before I continue with this one. I'm not a fan of the romance aspect, and the author had many romance elements, but when the story isn't there it's hard to love. I thought she did such a good job with the first book, so it will take me a little while to finish this one, but I really wanted to like this one more. I loved all the characters, but unfortunately I didn't like the author. -April 14, 2012- Bad book, good beginning!  Reviewer: Lulu - favorite favorite favorite - April 12, 2012  Subject: Interesting A friend of mine had mentioned reading this book and I was intrigued to see if this was true. I am so glad I gave it a try. The story is fairly complex with plenty of twists and turns. I found the story compelling and I did like the romance. The book did take me quite a long time to finish so I'll definitely be checking the author's website for updates. The author is great and she does a good of a job of balancing out the romance, action and drama. I give this book a 4.5 star. - April twelve, 2012Interesting
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ I liked the book. I just didn't find myself that much in love with it. I liked a lot of the characters, but not much of the story. It felt as if some of the character were just thrown in to fill out the pages. I also felt as though this book didn't need the plot at all, and was more of an extra. I was reading this because it was on sale, and I'm sure a lot will be thrown in as "spoilers". I think I'll pass.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I got this book for my 16 year old daughter, and I gave it to her and she thought it was hilarious. However I saw it in a library and she told me that it's really stupid. I gave her the book and she actually hated it. It makes no sense at all, you know when you buy a book from a library that it will be like that. But that is just the book, and a library shouldn't have to be a library. I hate to waste my time buying books like this. This book should have been taken from a bookseller.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This is the worst book ever. Not only did I have to wait over 6 weeks to be mailed the book, but I lost it! It was the last book I planned on buying before I was a bit on the money, but as I've learned from my past experience I just don't buy anything in that format. I was going to have my son read this for Christmas as a Christmas gift, and now I'm just not going to bother. The whole experience was just bad, and no one really wants to do business with this company at this time.   Rating: **  "The worst thing about the book is that it is filled with mistakes. The author uses a lot of clichés and fails to make any good use of them. The story is about an elderly couple (the narrator and her mother) whose son (the author) falls ill from a mysterious disease that never attacks the average human. It is not until the illness becomes so serious that they are forced to live with him, that they realize that the disease can be passed from human to human, and that it was the son who created this disease. After his death, the mother becomes an author herself in order to write a book on the subject, but in the meantime, her son's diary is found. She realizes, in the midst of her grief and despair, that what he wrote is the truth of the disease. She goes on to write her book in the hope that it will help to prevent others from suffering. It turns out to be a novel of great insight and strength. But in the end, her book ends with the narrator's suicide. She was the only one to write an insightful book on her own life."  - Michael H.   the author has been known to make mistakes. In "I Am Charlotte Simmons" (published in 1994), she made mistakes so glaring, and so blatant, that I decided to just buy another book from her to save myself the embarrassment.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   The "trouble" is that I'm not a fan of the author's writing style (it is so verbose and disjointed that I find it difficult to keep up) and that the content of the book is very much lacking in detail (there's a huge amount of unreferenced info to fill in, and some of it is clearly written for the sake of having a story to tell). The narrator is also rather wooden, making many statements that are only slightly related to the story (like how it's impossible to use magic without a blood pact, as if they are totally unrelated) but it is understandable since she is telling the story of one girl who somehow gets a blood curse.   I don't believe this is an intended sequel to "The Sword of Destiny", but I am curious as to how the story goes from here on.  , a good series of books from a very good author. They are all short stories (usually around 200 pages or less), and they have a clear beginning, middle, and end. The author does a good job of creating an atmosphere that is realistic, but not too real-worldy. The stories are all about the same type of character. They come from both the human side and the gods, and although each have their own quirks and personalities, each is very relatable and interesting to read about. The characters are often very emotional and have many layers to their personalities (as well as an overall "villain" or "hero" complex).The "problem" is mostly in the way the author uses dialogue. I don't mean it in a bad way (I really enjoyed them), but there's no real need for the author to keep giving the same line of dialogue, for example. A lot of the dialogue in the books were like this:There's a lot of repetition here, and it's hard to follow some of the lines that are repeated. It makes it hard to understand the character's thoughts and what they are thinking. It also makes it difficult for the reader to follow what they're saying. I think this is a flaw that's fairly common in the genre. And it's not just one small flaw, either; many of the scenes are like this.The most problematic part of this book is the story itself. I really don't like it at all. I find the writing style of this to be very annoying, as well as a little disjoint. There
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ *The first book was a waste of time. *I did not like it as a teenager, then as an adult, then when I was in my twenties and 30s, then it became an addiction. * The characters are completely useless. *They will always go on about "life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness". * The main character, the one I loved, the main character who I have always admired, the same one, the character who was always a source of pride to me, the author's self-importance, has now lost his soul and his purpose. *This book should not be about the quest to "find who you are". *The author needs to learn to listen to his readers, especially if it's something as simple as "I liked that part of the book because it was different." If you like a book, it is not the book, you are the book. *If you like this book, please, go and read "The Secret" by Joseph Campbell.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This book was disappointing. It is so hard for a man to talk to a woman about sex and love. It feels very much like a book about sexual dysfunction. We don't get any depth on why men want to have sex with women who are not their wife or girlfriend. We are supposed to feel some kind of deep empathy for these men and have sympathy for them. But when you come down to it, it is so unrealistic and impossible to see beyond your own emotions. It's like a movie in which the hero is a good man, but his romantic life is ruined because of a woman he met in an airplane. He is left with nothing but a pile of broken promises. The movie was so good because it had a nice touch with a guy who was still trying to be a good guy, but he couldn't help the girl that he loved. My only hope is that this book will be a better adaptation. It really would be nice to see the author get back to his roots. Maybe he should have used a female character to help him explain his problems with his wife. This book had a real impact on me. The sexual dysfunction felt real to me, and the author has a way of portraying men and women in an amusing way. His books are my favorite. However, I wish I could give a better rating because the ending was a real let down.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I don't have anything bad to say about this book. The only thing I could say is that the cover is a bit too over the top for my tastes. I'm a fan of graphic novels (I have a huge graphic novel collection - it's about 20 x 25 and I'll put it on every time I walk in the store) but this one looked like a children's book. I had to have it to pass the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first thing that popped into my head was the word "disaster".   This book is absolutely a disaster.   I read it as a kind of introduction to the world of F&SF. I had read The World of Fantasy and The World War Fantasy and they were all great books and I enjoyed them.   the only thing I disliked about them was that they were kind of prequel type of stories (the whole world is dying, people just have to move to the big city because of the death of the gods, blah blah blah). So I did want to read something different, something that took place before the apocalypse.   and that's exactly what this book does.   in the beginning it is all about the city of New York. It starts with a bunch of different people having adventures and trying to survive.  "The people of the twenty-fourth century were now so old that a good many had lost the capacity for physical effort, and so had lost their capacity to think about anything but physical exertion."   It was actually very funny and sad at the same time because a lot of these people were like "wow, I thought that was all fiction, this is what really happened" and it was all very true.  , a world where all people can fly and travel to other places at will, this world also is in decline. The gods have died and there are not enough gods anymore to sustain the empire and so they decided to destroy the remaining gods by killing them and then turning them into statues. But of course they forgot to make sure that the statues are all on the opposite side of the globe from each other and so as soon as the statues die they start to crumble.  : in order to maintain the illusion of civilization people in New York have invented the time machine and it allows them to travel back in time to any time in their history where they can find gods. There is even an entire museum dedicated to the time travel and people go through it to visit different parts of the world.  - the gods are now kind of like the real life version of elves and dwarves. They are kind of elves, dwarves and so on. The dwarves are like "we have this magic rock in the middle of the desert" and the elves are like: "no you don't, we know the secret of time and we'll take it out for you" and of course the gods have this huge cave where they hide and they all have

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This is a really bad book and it really ruined my entire experience with it. I have been searching for this book for YEARS, it is so long that I can't believe it hasn't been reprinted yet, and when I finally got it it wasn't in a perfect binding, and it just wasn't very well designed. It was also hard to figure out which pages were the back and what were the front. It even has a few mistakes in the writing. The worst part of all is that the text is not easily translatable in any way. I cannot get this book to translate to other languages. And when I read the book the pages are so small, and the lines so small that I am unable to read. And the pages just get smaller and smaller and it is hard to read at all. But the worst part is the price! It would have been a 5 star book, but the price really destroyed it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  When you are first starting out, books that make you look up stuff and do some research are the key to success.  But after reading this book, I am afraid to go into stores again, as if I am looking at one book and not an entire field of knowledge.    I'm just a casual reader.  I haven't read a lot of books, and my knowledge of how to use my camera is very limited.    The books that I've read were on the topic of photography for the more serious photographer, not casual.   I have been shooting since I was 13.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could give this book one star, I would. The author does not know how to write a "good" book.

Then the book just turned into a rambling, incoherent rant that had no relevance to the main plot of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not an atheist, but I am an anti-religious bigot, and this book is the most ill-thought-out piece of nonsense I have read this year.   Atheists do not believe in a supreme being who is omniscient and omnipotent. They do not see a higher order of being, or god, who does all the thinking and planning and controlling.  .   are there any atheists, or those of theism, or pantheism. Atheists are people who believe in god, but believe in the separation of the spiritual and the physical. They believe that the "higher powers" are not separate from the physical universe. And while it is true that god is a concept that has existed since the beginning of time, there are many, many religions that do not have any god.   the author takes great liberties with these things in order to make this book more palatable for the masses. For example, the author makes fun of the idea that there are people out there with magical powers (this is a myth created by Christianity), but the author fails to realize that there is also no evidence that there aren't any actual magical powers in the world. He also makes fun at the idea of god as the creator of the world and all the good in the universe, but then makes fun for the idea "if there is a god, how does he know that I am doing these horrible things?" And he does this to the point that you feel like you are being mocked by the author. The author also fails to mention that god does not control and create everything, but it is the role that humans play in the creation of things, and god does play a part. And finally, the "moral" of the story, that this book tells you to do, is that the only reason people should have anything to do with god is for their own happiness and pleasure. It is not because god is omnibenevolent, or has a plan for all of us, or because god gives us free will. It's because god says so. It does not take a lot of thinking to realize how ignorant this is, because there are plenty of people in this world, and lots of cultures, who don't believe in any god, and none who are willing to believe in it. I don't know why this book's author thinks it's ok to portray the atheist as a bad person, because even if you are an atheist with the best
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I just purchased this book for my daughter's seventh birthday. She loves to read but this book wasn't her favorite. At first, she loved it because she liked the characters so much. Her teacher said to the class "If you want to see the story of how this book was written, please sit down."

I mean, just look at these sentences: "I couldn't tell her whether she was trying to make conversation, be flirtatious, or to just get a better look at him." What is a good girl to do when she doesn't even know if someone is trying to be flirty? To be flirting? She clearly has no clue what being flirty is! I was a little offended at some of the descriptions about how hot men are, and I feel like these descriptions are unnecessary, since I'm sure most people have never been with a guy and don't think the guy is hot. I found most of the book completely offensive. I hate that you get to see more than once that he isn't interested, and you have no clue why. I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is about the same as any other book, but that is about as far as it goes, it just goes on with no sense of progression. The way the story is told is very disjointed and not very coherent. It feels like the author just sat down and went "hey what if I wrote a story about this?" I don't know who the author is, I mean, is it possible? I don' t really want to believe this is the writer, but I am willing to listen to anything.   The writing was okay, but just ok. There are no big surprises or twists or anything like that. The stories seem very similar to each other, and the author doesn't really use any of the character's unique features to make the reader fall in love. I don t like when I have to look up to find the main character. It seems like I have had this exact experience. I did find the writing style to be very readable, however.   in my opinion, this is not a book for everyone. I do not see why this book would get an 8.1 rating. It's just not something I would recommend reading. I am sure it would work if you were already a fan of the genre, but there are better choices.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this one is terrible...i'm surprised i'm still buying this crap.  i thought it was a series that was gonna be about a character who was like a female James Bond with a few twists thrown in, but instead it was about a guy who just wanted to kill women and take them's money.  he's kinda likable, but a bit boring.  i've heard so many good things about it though, so i'll have to read it again to be sure i'm not going crazy.   this was my 2nd favorite in the series, not so much because it's good, but because the characters were interesting, and it's not boring. Overall rating: 2 stars - I don't think you're meant to read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** It was a little disconcerting when I first began reading, the story and the characters seemed strange. The story seemed to go on forever and yet there was no progress in the plot, the characters were not as well developed as they should be. The main character is a female police detective who is trying to solve a crime that is being investigated. The crime is a murder. There is no blood and she never really explains why she is wearing gloves. After her murder the police ask her why she put on gloves. They say that she was trying to make it look like a suicide. So, why is she trying to cover something up? Who the heck is the man that her boyfriend was talking to that night? Why did he leave her so abruptly? All these questions have been answered at some point in the story, but they are all just background noise. And even when there is background noise the story still gets confusing. But this is not a bad thing, there is no suspense because there is a lot of background noise that just does not help. The author does not use dialogue very much, the reader does not need to know what the characters are thinking to understand the story. A good writer uses the reader to draw the reader in, the writer knows how to make the reader listen. But, there are too many details to listen to. This book is not for me. I had heard that the author wrote a non-fiction book called "The Secret Life of the Superhero," and I did not like it. I just wanted the action to come to me. ********* **********
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, the story is not original. Some authors come up with amazing and unique ideas. There are many. However, this one is just flat out rubbish and in many ways, it is a parody of a book about a woman who travels in a car with a blind man to the world of the blind. In the real world, that would be impossible. The main character is the blind man and the two women are his "wife" and his "handmaiden". The story in fact is about a man and a woman traveling in a very strange car to meet some very unusual people. The story is completely stupid and the author tries to pass it off as a real book because of all the "interesting" details. The only "interesting detail" is the fact that the book was written in 1987 and has all the right equipment for a road trip. As if that would have been enough to make it a real novel. There is nothing in the story to really make it worth reading and it is simply a bunch of ridiculous events that happen to the main characters.   The writing is also terrible. I have always hated long, drawn out descriptions. The author uses a lot of jargon and really goes into detail on very little and there are no explanations. It reads like a long dissertation on some obscure subject. The characters are not even that interesting to read about. The way they react to everything is flat. I could almost feel bad for them as they all seem so stupid to me. It is like the author wrote a character who can only say one thing, and it makes sense in the moment but it just ruins the book for me. The women are just flat and boring and their whole character is based on the fact the man is blind. As a reader you are supposed to be rooting for the main character. Instead, I feel like the whole thing is a big farce that the author just wrote for the sake of being creative.   of the bad characters: there are several good characters who make this book worse, but most of them are the main and the women. The protagonist is very stupid and has some very ridiculous traits. The narrator is very dry and has no personality whatsoever. It also seems the author never really thought about how to write a good female narrator because this character is so annoying. The two women never develop and their motives are completely unclear.  , I think. It just makes me want to throw my phone across the room and punch the author
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this was one of the worst books I have ever read. I was hooked right away on this book because I think I'm a huge fan of the character and I wanted to see him and her try to keep their relationship alive as it seems that there is a lot of hurt between them. When the book began, I thought it was going to be the first of many to follow. Instead, it was the last book in the trilogy that was all about the two of them and their relationship and then it was just the beginning of the next book. The story didn't grow on me, but there was plenty of good stuff, it just didn't interest me in the way the other two books had.   The Characters:   I like the characters a lot.  Shelly: They are supposed to be some of the best friends anyone could have. But it took me several books to realize that she was one person and that she had some of her own issues.  has some real problems with alcohol and other substances that have ruined her life. In the beginning, Shelly seemed like a decent person, but she has a hard time taking criticism or responsibility for anything. She's an older woman and she seems to have had it all in life. : I didn't like how the two people were just there as a background. No real motivation for their actions, no feelings or feelings of their own.       Shella and Jack have an attraction to each other, but Shelly has had a difficult life. She has two kids she abandoned, and she lost her husband. She was also on her own when the book started and I was wondering why she didn't try to get Jack to open up. As the story progressed, she seems really worried about losing him as she's always saying how she can't see her without Jack around.   The story is told mostly from their perspectives, with Shelly and Jack talking on the phone and sending pictures to each. They both seem to be saying things like "don't make things so hard for me", "we're not in love" and "you'll always be my first love".   In my opinion, Jack is the one who wants to be in a relationship and be together with Shella, and Shelly is the girl who wants her to just forget about him, go away, and just live her life without him.   and, while the two seem like they're close
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My copy of this book is a horrible copy. It has a lot of the same issues with spelling, grammar, and a ton of missing words. But even with these issues, there is a lot that is still funny and engaging. There is a good story here that does not involve the love of anything, nor does the author spend a lot in telling it. This is the type of book that I am sure I will like even more if I get a better copy.  I do not recommend this book. _________________________________________________________________________________________   I am a big fan of horror, and I think there is something for every fan in this list.    There is definitely a book for everyone.   So enjoy the list.    10.) The Last Castle (2013) by Jack McDevitt   (ISBN 9781401145532) What can I say?   It's so bloody good.  This book was so amazing that it made my heart melt just thinking about it.  There are plenty of people who will not be turned off by this book because of it's gory content.  I will just say this; you should read it.   And you should do it now, because we are only a few days away from the release.  It is only $3.99 and so far it's been a huge success!   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  There are many that are worse. This book is the worst by far. In fact, it's so bad, that it makes me laugh because I love horror and I can't even bear to look at a cover of this book. It is not even written in a funny way. I mean, look at that cover: I've never read a book this bad in my life. And that's the most important thing: no one has read it. No one in the world has read this book so that they can talk about how it is a good book. Because it is nothing. The book does nothing but read and scream and moan about a girl that we don't care about, and the main character that we do, and everything is made about how stupid she is. Just let the story be good. Instead of making the book so bad that the only reason someone would read it is to talk about the main heroine, what the main villain is and how he is awesome, how the hero is so awesome that the girl can never be anything but his wife, why this book is good, how awesome the main characters are, how bad everyone else is and when she's going to get a husband so she can live in peace. How much it makes the girl like her mother. Not one single thing made me want to go to the end to see if it is all going to be worth it.  I really wanted to see her life, because it is not going to end here.  A Good Book is Better than a Bad Book When you read something that is good... Read a book with good writing. Read something that doesn't scream and whine and talk about a woman and a boy that you don't have a thing for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________   This book is a waste of time. The information is in all the right places but it's just too vague. I don't understand what it is they are trying to prove in this book or what their research shows. And I don'   I really think that people who read this book will end up going to bed with the wrong idea of what science is and how science works.

But even if it is an error, I would expect the other scientists involved to be equally confused.   If you can't understand it you will only end up confused. If you can understand it but still end up making silly mistakes, I really don't think you can become a science person.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is so incredibly wrong and stupid that I can't even use it as a comparison, but instead I'm gonna say that the author was so wrong, that he can't possibly be a true scholar who writes a book on ancient Egypt that is wrong. It's one thing to be wrong in a book you've written, but even if you've read every book on the subject, it would be hard for the author to say "I got it wrong!" I read this book to see what's wrong about this claim that the pyramids were built by a man named Khufu, because it makes the claim that a man built the pyramidal structure of the Great Pyramid without any explanation whatsoever, and then explains why he got it all wrong. But this book is wrong because I can tell that the only reason the author thought he was right in the first place was that he never investigated how a man could build the pyra- matic structure of this structure that looks like a large, giant human body from space when there are no skeletons on this planet that were built before this structure. Then he said "Ok, I did my research, now I can prove that the Great Sphinx of Giza was built by Khufus." and the next page it tells us that Khufum built the Sphinx in 3050 BC. You know what? I just don't care anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________Readers: Please review. It helps other readers. Thanks for reading.  It wasn't that it was bad. It was just, you know, too boring. I found myself getting distracted in between the boring bits (which didn't make it any easier to concentrate or read)  I read this to my daughter at a weekend camp at my sister's. She read it before bed while I read a book. I wanted to get her reading it for her own sanity because I am not great at it. However, my daughter did not have much enjoyment reading it. , it is too long, and it doesn't give much away in terms of plot. I know it's a book that I need to get in the back of my head, but the story just didn't appeal to me. Maybe I just hate books like this but I didn't feel it was as exciting and well-paced as I would have liked. And I can't read in a row. This book just dragged on. But if it were on a CD it would have been great.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ was the least interesting book I've ever read. The main characters are the characters we expect to see from a chick lit novel. They are interesting but they don't have much to say. We see the girls make a mistake that leads to the main character getting thrown into the deep end. They make up for that mistake with a nice lesson but it was not enough to save the book. It felt like I had read the last chapter of a textbook that went to 5th grade instead of 5th.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- * I have not been able to finish this book. In fact, I am going to give up on trying to finish it until the author has a new book (the first one was so bad it made the new one impossible to read). * There was no description of any world of "A" in the book, there were just references to the world of A, the names, the places, etc. I did not even understand what the reference was and I have no idea how the author thought they could have the time to do such a poor job. * The plot was not interesting at all, the characters were dull at best, and the events did not seem to have any relation to each other. I feel that if I was writing a story from the perspective of the characters, I would have given it a three star rating.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********   I was really looking forward to this one.  It came in a good package.  a paperback.  and a nice book bag.    The book is a history of an Irish ship which is in port. A great part of the book is told from the point of view of the cook on the ship. ,  The ship is about to sail for Scotland to rescue people stranded in the storm. .  at the time the captain was on a business trip to America. - he was in a cabin in the upper deck. I just wanted to check out the book and was disappointed.  (The book was an old re-issue. the first re-release of this book was a very old paperback).  This book was old. Old in it's style. It had been around for years. It is written in a style that seems dated. The author did not seem to have the ability to read his text and write as well as the previous book. The book seemed like an effort to create a "great ship" out of a book about a "small ship" that had been used in the British Navy.  in other words, a book from the Victorian era. and that is what this book is. Old. and out of date. (and that is my biggest problem with the book). The book has a lot of historical facts about the ship, but the author does not explain why those facts are important.  is the history of the ship important? no, but why? there are many facts about this ship which the book did not explain. the author seems to have a hard time explaining his facts as he did when he wrote the book.  the reason I found this book old was not because it was a bad history book but it is just so out of place in this age we live in. it was written in the Victorian Era. and when you are a person living in this time frame, there are lots of things which seem out of touch with modern times. so in other word, the reason why this book does not make sense is because it is outdated. so out-dated. and so out in the way of time. It was written by a very busy man that could not read or write. in other word, I found the book dated and out-of-date. to me, this book did nothing but bore me. and did I mention
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "For what it's worth, there are plenty of excellent books to read about the history of women's suffrage." I wish they'd written that instead of the second half of the title.  There are a number of excellent, informative books about the women's movement, but none of them are "For what's worth".  Instead, these books are all well written, well-reasoned, and have lots of great information.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most frustrating and illogical books ever.  From the title:  "When you're done you will not have finished" "I will be a failure to my father.  I found this book to be one of those that had a lot to learn and one of that books to "unlearn"  This book will never make you a better writer nor will it help you write better.   From the very first sentence: "I am not writing this book because it is my obligation as a student to write, however I am writing this so that I may write about my experiences" To the end: This is a complete waste of time!  The only thing I can conclude from this is that the author never read a book, or studied for one, before writing this one, which is quite amazing considering the fact that a professor would not allow that!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an extremely bad book.   I am a huge fan of Robert Heinlein and his books, and I am always happy to see a new edition, and in this case a new printing.   "The Man Who Sold the Moon" is a fantastic first edition that is the first of the first three volumes in his series, "Starship Troopers." The story of the Moon is an exciting and original take on a space opera. The characters are so well developed and so clearly defined that I couldn't help but want to know everything that happened to the two of them during their journey, and it didn't take long to find out.  ... I love the Moon's character so much, and yet when the story started to focus on her, I was completely and utterly disappointed. Not only because it seemed like every character was a one-dimensional stereotype, but also because she wasn't really any better than the others.  , by Christopher L. Bennett (September 29, 2010) The Moon is such a great character. She is a woman of action and adventure who always seems to be finding herself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with what she was fighting before. The other characters are also interesting and very well-defined, and the book really gives them some depth and an even bigger role in the story than they got in the first two novels. What did I like best? Well, it has to be the characterization of the moon. She's just so different from everyone else, and that's an amazing thing, because I don't think I've ever seen a woman in space before who was more different..... I really liked the Moon and I really didn't like the people around her. That was very surprising to me. This is a very good book. I just can't get enough of it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________   I didn't give this book five stars because it's so overrated (the first half) and under rated (the second half) It's a book I have to re-read. I enjoyed the first half (about 30% of the book) it was interesting, but the second half, was really frustrating, I've spent time and effort in a course that is called how to study and it is not just a copy of some book and the professors put their own spin on it, they actually gave the information in the book. So the material in the course is better and more detailed and this book doesn't do that.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------  So far my first reading experience of this book had been one of disappointment. The characters are so weak and illogical that I can't really get a handle on how this book is supposed to go at all. I've read some decent science fiction before, but this one seems like some sort of parody of it. There's lots of technical gibberish being tossed around by the characters in order to explain some of the strange, unexplained, and ill-conceived things. Not to mention that many of the stories take place in different time periods, each with their own language and different cultures, and yet they all seem to be in direct, chronological order. The only thing that was consistent to me was that I was never surprised or entertained with the main characters or story line. I'm not even sure what happens in the last few chapters! I finished it almost exactly a month ago and yet I still don't quite understand what was happening. At all.   And it's not just the characters either. The story is so poorly thought out, and the ending seems to have no logic or resolution, it has a whole slew of holes in the story that I had to completely re-read to really get the gist of what was going on.  There were a lot of things I was not expecting from this book. I thought that the story would be intriguing and full of surprises and that it would be more than just an odd-ball book about a bunch of aliens that want to take over the world. I was wrong.  . There are parts where the aliens are shown doing a variety of seemingly odd things in their home planet, such as floating around in giant bubbles and the like. I don't know what is going on with those, and I don  This book did not interest me one bit. It's strange. It has a lot to do with religion and the future of humanity. It contains a lot about how to create a better future for mankind and how to help people cope with the effects of alien technology. But at the end, we don't get a conclusion. No big reveals, no resolution. It is a weird read that doesn't have anything really interesting to say, and for the most part I couldn't get into it. It was an interesting idea, but for the least interesting part of it, I think I'd rather just look for the next book that will have even more bizarre stuff that will make this one seem like an
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have nothing but praise for this book and really hope that some of the reviewers who are hating it can read it and learn something from it. It is a hard book to explain to people, and it can be hard to grasp at first, but you have to take my word for it that it is really, really good. The cover is really nice! If I don't read this book in the next 2-3 weeks I'm going to try to buy it and send it back to them so they can fix the flaws that they have mentioned. It's not perfect but it is a work of art. The book is divided into 5 sections (that I think have a good deal of content): The Characters  A story about an alien that was abducted by a group of people that want to understand what's happening in the world and what it could mean for the future. (I think this is how the book will be called on Amazon and elsewhere.) The Characters & Interactions The Art of Writing  How to tell a story without getting it completely wrong. The Book as an Author  This is where the author's voice shows through. The Mechanics of Writing The Characters are presented very well. The characters seem real to me because they are. There is a sort of magic to them. I really like the idea of the aliens, they seem like real people, like you and me. They have their ups and downs, I get why they do things. They are good at many things but they do make mistakes, just like real life. The interactions between the characters and the world are well done, even when they are a little bit awkward or awkward. The Art itself is a little disappointing. It doesn't really help the plot or the character development. But it's not bad, it's just not great. For me, the characters were the most fascinating part of this book. There are several characters in the book, and they are interesting and likable. The alien has a very strong personality and very realistic thoughts about things, for example, if they think that they are the cause of the global warming, they may think that the Earth is dying, or if they have come to Earth to find a planet to live on, they would think the Earth has already died, they might be very concerned about their own species, and a lot of them are very passionate and strong people. They each have their own flaws and strengths and it is easy to get attached to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book about a dead person is nothing more than a poorly written book. I read a review on Goodreads that someone said that they liked the book but it's really not. I really can't stand this book. It's nothing but bad writing and dull storytelling, especially that last chapter. It was really boring. If I had been reading this book while someone else was reading a book they are supposed to enjoy, I would have been bored as well. It seems that everyone else enjoyed it so I was expecting it to be a good read. I was so disappointed in it. This book just felt like so much work to read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ I read this for a class. Students in our class all had a problem with it. I felt it was the same as "The Red Shoes" by John Steinbeck. It's sad when a young woman does a novel that is nothing more than a series of flashbacks. I wish I could find out the plot, the characters, why these people are there, what the real problem was. I think the author wants to get to the end and give a positive review to the reader. I have never read a novel with flashbacks to the past. It would have been interesting to know the actual reason. ______________________________________ My husband was extremely bored with this book. He kept thinking it was over and that it would come back next week. It didn't and he was upset. We will not be buying this book again. The story was interesting but not a good way to pass a time. I'm also not sure that he was ready to read something so depressing. He would have rather been in class or doing something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********The story of this book is awful. It is not realistic. This book was written to sell books, and it is just a piece of marketing to make money.I have bought many novels on Amazon to help pay for university. I have read some good books, but I will never buy another one. It's very confusing. I was expecting more from a book about the World War 2, but instead of an awesome story I got a story that is completely out of character for this time period and the time period that this was written in. I would not recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like war stories. I wish I could give it a zero stars, but it is what it is. This was written by an author that is not that good at writing. I will not be spending my money on this book. This is a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- It was terrible. The plot has no logic, and is just random and nonsensical. At times, it even made no sense. The characters were just stereotypical stereotypes. This book is basically a novel version of the movie "The Breakfast Club." They were all in love with a girl named Mavis, and they all had the most horrible personalities ever. They had no problem with bullying other kids, cheating on their own relationships and were all too willing to sell out their friends, family, etc. I felt sorry for every one of these people. My favorite character was the main protagonist, who is also the most hated of the bunch. I don't know why I even bothered to finish this book. This was the worst of the best. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not what I was looking for. I expected a solid and detailed explanation of basic scientific facts, but instead I got a confusing mix of scientific terminology, and pseudo-scientific nonsense. The book begins by discussing the various types of research conducted to study the topic of evolution, and then the book jumps straight to the "hard science" part of the book and starts discussing, you guessed it, evolution. Well, as I said before, the "Hard Science" part is where the "fantasy" begins. You see, if you have a "hard" scientific background, this "fairy-tale" may sound plausible. However, it is not! The book explains why the hard science doesn't back it up, but only "pseudo" science. Now I am not going to read every chapter of this book, and I am very disappointed because I really like how it started. However in the end, I could not see the point of this "study" at all.   Also, I am writing this review because of the way the book is written. It is very descriptive, yet is too technical and boring at times. The examples given are quite ridiculous. For example, one example is a "strange" plant called a "Carnoseria", but if you look on a plant, the first thing you see is the plant's stem. Now the same plant has a long, thick leaf that is "strangest" to this scientist. Another example is the example of evolution described in chapter 5, about an organism getting a large head because its body is large. But this organism didn't have a large body, but rather, the head is just a huge part of its body, which has no influence on its growth. The only "credible" evidence to support that is the book says it is "not possible". In other words, it can't happen, but this book tells us how it can.     The last reason I am disappointed is because this book is based on a book called "The Origin of Species". I have read this book at least a dozen times, and have always learned something new about evolution. If this book had been based on this book rather than the "Origin of Species", it could have been a good book. The authors of this new book probably didn't read that book, because they are just as wrong. This new book is so poorly researched, and written that I can only guess

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I don't even understand how someone could read this book and find it to be enjoyable. It was very slow, and it got so repetitive after a while, I just wanted to get to the good stuff. There was some interesting stuff about the past of the characters, which I'll probably get to later, but for now, this book is a total waste of my time. * *********** ******** ******** I'm not sure what to make of this book. I found it very funny, but I have a hard time believing it will be good for me. If you want something funny, this is not for you, but if you like history or the paranormal, I suppose it could be fun. I'm going to try to pick up the other books from his collection.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been a fan of the series since the first book, and the second book was not what I had expected at all. I read it and found it to be uneventful. The main character was not well developed, the villain was a jerk, and it felt like a lot of the book was devoted to the main character running around trying to do the right thing. But even that wasn't all that bad. I didn't mind the pacing because I knew that what was going to happen next would be predictable, and in the end the book ended on a good note. I still enjoyed the book, but that may not be what the author wanted to happen.   ... I wish that the author had gone with the traditional ending for the book; if he had, this might have been the book that I would have bought, and I may even have gotten a full trilogy.   If you enjoy action packed thrillers with a lot going on and a good amount of action scenes and suspense, then this book is for you. You'll get all the action, intrigue, twists, and turns you can handle.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!  My family enjoyed this book as well. My daughter was very interested in what she heard about this book but she wasn't interested in the story. She would have been more interested if the book was not so dry and the story was not too difficult.  I don't like to give a bad review but this book was a disappointment to me. The story seemed like a dry read and the characters sounded so wooden that I was very skeptical about how believable they were. This is not the book that I thought it was going to be. -Tess  The story is just dull and I can't even imagine why someone would want to read such a boring book. I found the writing too bad and had to stop it at many times, just because I couldn't get past the writing. It really took a lot out of me to read this book.  "He sat in the kitchen, sipping his coffee, taking a sip from the thermos, feeling good, happy. A few of the house elves were working on the stove, stirring the potatoes for a special dinner, when he walked in through the front door. He had a great view of the trees beyond the windows, and the sky was clear and blue. His thoughts turned to himself, to all the people in his family, and how nice it was to see them. He glanced at the table, saw the dishes, and made a point of placing his glass on the table. "I've been having a great time with my family, today," he said. He paused and looked up at the ceiling, noticing how many stars there were, and smiled. "Happy Easter to all!" He sat down at the kitchen table.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- ------------------------- I read this book for a writing class at my college. I had to finish it in two days, and was really disappointed with it. It was a very hard book to get through, and I am sure I will not finish it. The characters are terrible, and nothing that they say or do is funny or interesting. It's just the same cliched story over and over, like the old movies about the people that are going to be famous, or the people with the perfect marriage. There are so many different types of people that the story will never capture and makes no sense. I could not see how any of them would have enough money to live comfortably like the characters in the book. So, it is just a very boring, stupid book that is written with a very bad style, and with bad writing. I don't think that this book will sell much, and so it was written for a class that I think that it was meant to be used as a self-help book that will help students to be successful at something in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  A really good read   I liked the story, even though I feel like it started off a bit slow.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   I have read many of the books written by this author, and while many of them were enjoyable, this is the first time I have ever felt that it was not written from a true believer. I am not a Christian, but this book definitely pushed my buttons. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they truly have a desire to see the good in the world and the good of others. This book could not help but push me further away from the Christian religion.   There are times in the book where the author will talk about how God is good and the author has a heart for others. However, this book will not take away from your heart for your brother/sister in Christ. This is a book about human beings, not God.   on of my favorite parts about this book, is when the author talks about how "bad" people can be in their actions, and how God would help us if we only know who we are and what our true purpose is. I felt bad for those that would be in the wrong in his book. If you are a Christian or believer, I would recommend this for you, but you will not feel the love in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is crap, so why am I wasting time on reviewing it? I don't like it, but I am going to anyway. My problem is the way the author is trying to "prove" her point, it is actually an argument about why women should not be in the workplace, but that doesn't change the fact that it is crap.  The author begins with a story about a young woman, who wanted to be a veterinarian, she is an only child. She had dreams about being a veterinarian. She always had such a dream. However, she didn't want to grow up and become a veterinarian when she could have been an engineer. So she became a vet technician and got her degree in animal science. She got a lot of her knowledge from watching TV shows where animals were being trained to do tricks. She learned all about animals and animals behavior. She also read books about animals. She would sit with her dad at the kitchen table watching cartoons about animals training. She loved animals.  When she turned 18, she was ready to do her doctorate. The first thing she did was go out on a summer internship. She was in the internship at a university where a student had died of a heart attack.  This internship was a disaster for her, because she was very stressed and not doing very well. She thought that she was going to fail, but when she saw the students work she thought that it was worth it. She knew how to do this stuff, she did it before at college.  However, after this internship, she realized that if she wanted to get a job, she would have to get out of the animal science field and do something different, something that had nothing to do with animals. So after graduation, she got a job working at a pet store. She liked the pet store because it was quiet, and it made her feel like an adult.  She hated her job, however she felt like it was better than the internship and she thought she was good at it, and she enjoyed her job.  But then her boss was fired, and that was the end of that for her. She never wanted to work there again.   In the past, she had planned to get her master's degree in teaching, and then she was to go to university to become a psychologist. But she had her heart set on getting a job as a veterinarian technician because she knew it would be easy to get good money. But now
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for this book and couldn't find it. I looked through every one of my old textbooks, hoping to find it, but they were all on the shelf. I am sooooo glad I got it though. I'm so glad that I read this. It's a great book.   My favorite aspect of this book is the discussion of the different kinds of learning. You get to see the different styles, how the learner's mind works, and the benefits of these methods of learning and remembering. The author mentions how he can remember all the times when he was taught by people who did not follow the "traditional" methods for learning. He compares that to his experience as an adult learning a new skill. He says he learned so much that the skill is still new to him, but he is more than able to accomplish the same things as those who did the traditional methods.  . I found that the "non-traditional" learning methods the author talked about were:   a) A very good, if not the best, introduction to a subject; this book talks about all aspects of any subject from a very different perspective. You will learn about the historical and literary background to the subject. The information is easy to grasp, and if you read along with it you will learn much more than if you had a textbook.   the first thing that I learned: that this book does not include a picture of a brain in any way. No photos of the brain, only illustrations and charts showing a brain working. I believe that this is a very important aspect in learning that you are left to discover for yourself.   a) Another very interesting aspect is how the brain works. You see the parts of the body that a person uses to perform certain tasks. You can see the fingers, hands, and feet. This is a good way to compare the brain to other parts of body that you use. This helps you to understand the workings of a person, when comparing to someone who can't read or write.   I believe this is very important for those who want to master a particular skill.   for example, some of the parts that the brain uses are vision, touch, and taste. One can have a good sense of touch and taste by learning to feel, touch and smell something.   The main subject covered is reading. In this book, the author shows how people in ancient times used to be able to read, and how reading developed into

Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I read this book it was at a really great time in my life, I felt like I had some sort of epiphany and I was finally ready to face myself. And to my amazement the book gave me all the answers I needed to deal with the problem that I was facing. It just kept getting better and better.  Then the book went to a whole other level, it was all about understanding how people are wired. Now I was thinking, "Why is this person reading this book, there must be more to it than just being smart." Then after about 4 years of being diagnosed and dealing with this, I decided to actually read the book and was totally blown away. I just couldn't believe how insightful and smart and honest this book is. It had the answers to everything I was having problems with in my daily life. The author was very kind and did everything to help me. Now, that wasn't what I needed but it was the answer. ,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is like the worst book I have ever read.  There was no suspense or any kind of good storyline in this book.  The story was bad.  A girl was raped in the story but it did not affect the rest of the story at all.  I was wondering why the guy raped her when it happened and then did not even kill her but then it was just a dream.   The characters did not make any sense.   There were no character development.   No one was likable.   The man with the dog. The man that had a dog was very annoying. I don't like the guy with the red hat, I have had problems with him before.    I feel like the author just wanted to write something and never thought that people would like it.   I did not like this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a bit dull, not because it is poorly written, but the characters.  The main characters are all one-note.  You may know the type - a rich, spoiled, snobbish, arrogant woman who has no problem with her daughter cheating on her.  In one of her many attempts to belittle her daughter, she tells her daughter that she will marry the man who is chosen for her and that her daughter will never get married again.  This is not so much a criticism of the book as it is an attempt to make this book as negative and ridiculous as possible.   This does not do the book justice.  I have to agree with the reviews that it's an interesting read and interesting characters. If you like the type of story you read in this book, then by all means read it.  But if you are someone who hates the type, don't read it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:..........................I was expecting to find a bit more history, a bit of political and social commentary, a smidgen of humour, a small sprinkling of self-mockery, and a smattering of what I call "bibliophilia" (read, bibliophilic people). However, it was just a bunch of stories that I didn't care for: the characters were not developed, the writing style was clunky and un-crisp, and I just didn't find the author's personality interesting. I didn�t find any of the stories interesting enough to give them a thumbs up. The only person who kept me reading the book was my girlfriend; the others were just boring. I know some people like to read nonfiction; I just prefer my fiction. This one just didn�f work for me. I liked my books better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  The only thing that I find wrong with this book is that it was written for an adult audience. It's basically a story about two best friends who happen to be aliens, and the whole thing is a mess. There is no rhyme or reason to the plot. There's no resolution or logic, just a bunch of weirdness and nonsense. This is why I found it difficult to finish the book. I read this book in one day and I had to stop reading because I had already put it down for too many hours. It is an interesting concept but the writing is really bad and really hard to follow. I think that this is the reason why this book didn't have a lot of popularity, as there isn't a lot going on to make it interesting to read. If you're looking for a fun book that you can read over and over again, then this is definitely a good choice, but if you're trying to learn something about aliens or aliens in general, then there's really nothing here to grab your attention.   I don't know why I read the book, I read it because I liked the author's name so I figured it was something good. But it was all over the place and I didn't really get the point or the message, and I ended up giving it a 3 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were so many flaws and mistakes in this book. The way it was told and the way it wasn't really explained was such a let down. It felt like this author just wanted to tell the story of a good girl who does good things, but didn't really understand how the world works. The book was really short and it felt like she didn't want to explain things in depth, which I can understand if this is her first novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible book.   The first 2 chapters are great and informative and will make you feel comfortable and in the moment. The next chapters are more of the same boring information with the same tired jokes. It isn't until page 90 or so that the author gets a grip and tries to entertain with more interesting information.   with the exception of the first couple of chapters the information is all about the same old stuff you would read in a book about a specific business and/or product. And the book doesn't even try to educate you on the topics. The book is full of boring marketing, sales, and general business information. So you are more likely to end up buying the book than learn anything new.   on the subject of sales I don't care for how they handle sales. I don�t know much about sales, but if you read the book you will see that it is more of a sales book and not something you can read in your spare time to learn about sales. As a former sales person I can tell you that most people can't sell much without a good sales plan. The authors don�ts know this either.  .   is the only redeeming feature of the book. the author has the knack of telling a funny story without telling you what the funny thing is. it makes me laugh out loud at the story of how the book is sold and I can't remember anything the author said. I was disappointed as I was hoping the book would be something new.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* *********** ******** ******** *  This book is all about the "big brother syndrome". It is about how big brother or older brother or whatever has to do with the younger siblings, but never for good. It's never really said directly, it's just implied. This happens every single time. If you're a child, you'll read the whole thing and think "I know what this book is about, but what does it actually mean?".  If you are a parent, you will go "oh wow, I didn't know I was supposed to be a big brother/older brother."  It is also about how a parent can be totally right about something, but still wrong about what should have been done.  You get the sense of what I mean from the title. It sounds a bit scary.  and if I could change one thing about it, it would be the title because it is really just a bunch of little kids talking.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ It was boring. It had no flow.  It was a complete waste of money. ~~ I was so disappointed and I wanted to give it zero stars. I just couldn't stand it, I have to admit that. The author is terrible in writing and narration, not to mention his pronunciation is terrible. He doesn't know how to use words properly. So, I can't really write a good review for it. The only positive thing about this book is that it's very interesting to read about some of the strange phenomena happening around you (some of them are just plain weird). The Worst Book Ever by Stephen King This is a no-no book and is really hard to recommend to someone who loves King. It's not that hard to read but it's just not a good read. The story is very bad and the writing is atrocious. The ending is just wrong and not in a good way. This is not a book that I would recommend anyone to read because the writing and the book are so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a terrible waste of time. It has very little to do with what the author claims it is about.  It is filled with random facts and observations that she tries to make the reader believe are the most important things to know about the topic in question. This makes her work completely pointless and un-helpful. It could have been cut down to 10 pages and still been totally useless. There is just no substance here. This is not a guide book. You can go online and find a book on a specific topic. This book does not really have one. You will have to find what you are looking for on your own. I was skeptical about purchasing this book but after trying it out and giving it a try I can definitely say that it was not worth the $.99. The information that was given was extremely wrong. It's basically a book full of un-needed facts and information. If you are reading this review and reading any books about a specific subject, please remember to check out the author's sources and facts before you commit to purchasing the book. There are countless people, who have studied and written extensively on the subject in question and this book is worthless.

I will say that I found it to be mostly amusing, especially in the way it portrayed a "science-fiction" world. If you're looking for a good laugh, read this book. If, however, you're interested in the science and want to understand it better, this book may not be for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My brother and I really enjoyed this book. It was sooo funny to read. I did not expect it to be as funny as it was. We got out of the house, and got ready to leave, and this guy showed up at the front door and asked if we wanted coffee, etc. He gave us a ride. He kept talking about how hot our mother was and how he was getting ready to have sex with her. This was after we made him promise to come home with us. I knew something was not right about this guy. He started making me go through my belongings, which had no value, and he was really mean about it. This guy could have raped me, but we made sure he got the money for coffee, and then we got him a new phone. The story kept getting better and better. The guy's name was Sam. The whole story made me laugh so hard. I would like to give this book 4 stars if it were a 3 or 4 star book. I will give this one a 5 star rating if I could.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................................. I was expecting this book to be great but I was really disappointed. I like the concept of this book and the author tried hard. I also like the way he wrote it. The problem is that it is a story about an ordinary boy and the other characters are too unrealistic and un-emotional. The guy with the gun, who was an ordinary kid but was forced to shoot the person he loves because of some bad guy, is so strong and intimidating that even the boy who was the most innocent in the book, will fear him if he ever sees him again.   I was so tired of all these unrealistic characters. This book was a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "In this world, there are no good guys and no bad guys. There are just humans who have no idea what their destiny is, and who must deal with each other, in some ways."  That sentence is about the main character's inner turmoil.  He feels he is destined for some kind of destiny, and at one point feels as if he has the power to change it.      His best friend, who he is obsessed with, does the opposite.  This is just how the plot of the story is told.  "What good is power if you don't use it right?  It's like the one thing you never want in life is to be like a loser who can't find a good hookup."   That's a great line by Peter David, as the protagonist goes on a journey to make his life change.  I like this guy, he wants to be a hero.  His problems are his own.  He is flawed but he is a good person.      "My God, is there anyone out there I know I can be with?"   When he tells his girlfriend that he loves her, it is not a boast, but a question, like "are you sure about that?".  This story is funny and touching.   There are some problems in the book.  Here is a hint for you.     I read this book because of the author, and the narrator.  They did an outstanding job of capturing the characters and the story.  The story was great, I could tell I had been there before.  You can't really get a real feel for what it's like to be the main guy, because I don't think there is much of a story there.  However, when the character's lives intersect with other people, I was able to see what those people are going through.  "But, I can see the world, they just don't understand me" is how this guy feels.      The writer had a lot of good stories to tell.  One of the more interesting bits is the relationship between the main characters.  It had a good balance of funny, poignant, and realistic.  Some of the themes he explored were:   1)  the power of being a hero;  2)  what it means to be human; 3)  being a loser and finding a good woman; 4)  getting a date; 5)

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I am new to reading, I bought this as a gift for my husband who also had a good experience reading books for me. However, when I got it home it was completely covered in ink. Not just a few marks and smudges, there were huge lines, all over the page, and the cover was scuffed up from the ink. My husband had to pull it out to read the instructions (which was a big inconvenience). The book came in a nice cardboard slip case but there was no instruction sheet with it. We had to email the address to a customer service agent for an answer. There was nothing on the internet about this or on Amazon about this happening and no answers from any other customer service.   At this point, my husband is so annoyed with this, that he is considering returning it to the store. I told him that I was going to have the agent look at this for me and hopefully find a solution. I will probably wait for the book to be returned from the agent to see if there is any way to get it back to me.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book did not live up to its title. The book focuses on the first couple of days of the war and was not meant to be a comprehensive work of history. It focuses on military and leadership strategies, and is written in the second person from the point of view of the officers who are fighting in the war. In addition, the author includes a lot of historical information and is good at describing the events he describes in a way that is understandable by the general reader. However, he often uses the same phrase in different ways, making it difficult to follow his narrative. Also, he makes some pretty sweeping generalizations about the enemy, which may not always be correct and may include some of the wrong information. Finally, although he gives us a brief history of the War, it is not the primary focus of the book. There is a lot left out of the story for the purposes of a general reading. The author ends the book with a short summary of the lessons that were learned during the war, which I found a little disappointing because most of the books on the subject end there. This book, however, does not leave us with that feeling. This is not a book that will be re-read; it is a history book, and one that I would not recommend for a general audience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bunch of crap, and I'm going to make it very clear what the book is about and why it sucks. It is a good read, but nothing more than that. If you are expecting some sort of high fantasy action epic, you will be disappointed. I have heard good things about this book and I've read other books from the author. It doesn't seem to have a lot of depth though. If this was written by a less talented author, I would give it a 1.5 or 2 stars. The main character is called Gwen, and she is a human. That's it. There is no backstory, no back story, nothing. Just a human female. She is in a lot more of action than you see in the book though. There was a lot less sex in this book than the last one I read. I was expecting to see lots of sex, and there were a couple of times I was disappointed with the lack of it. If the author had wanted to make Gwen the dominant character, that would have been fine. But I guess she didn't want to show us her personality. It makes the story not as important as it should be. It was also written in a way that you can almost tell the author wanted the book to be as fast and exciting as possible. I guess I can see why, when I was reading it, but I have read other non-magic oriented books where the pace of the book was slow and you were more interested in what the characters were thinking and doing. This story seemed rushed, and a lot quicker to start then it actually was. It felt to me that the author was just trying to write the most exciting things possible. This book is also a bit of a mess. There were some sections that I had no idea how she made up her story. I felt like the story itself wasn't bad, but more like a bad attempt at an epic fantasy. I just feel that this book is kind of a letdown and not nearly as good as it could have been. I didn't enjoy it as much as the last book I read, although the first book is probably better to begin with. I also don't like the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I did read this book, I loved it!! So, I decided to buy it for my kids, and it is so good! I gave it a 4 star rating. I give it 5 stars for the characters. I gave a 5 star rating for the action! I give a 5 stars just because I can't stop laughing. I will be rereading this book. I'm going to let them read this one as well because I would rather let them learn from this book than read it from beginning to end because it's just so darn funny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was really well written. I liked the story, but the writing style was confusing at times. The chapters were so similar I did not know which chapter it was in, and sometimes the author would end a sentence with "but it is not the same story." This made it hard to follow and make it clear which was which. I wish the author had gone with the less confusing method of writing it all in the first place.   The reason for this is that there are only 3 main characters and the story is about them and their adventures. I find it hard for a story to make me care about the main characters. It would have been easier to go with 2 main characters for the book. I also wished the story was about another family of vampires that had never been mentioned. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second story from the first book and the first one is pretty good.   The only thing is that the story feels very rushed in a very good way.  , and they all end at the same time but there are no real consequences. Not really a big problem but the pace of the story felt really quick.   that is what kept me reading it even though I was disappointed by some parts.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I'm an avid reader, and I think a lot of what is in this book would be useful for me. The information is very good and well-presented, however, I think some of the stuff is not necessary for me to understand the book. As a female in a male-dominated field, I've had to deal with a few things in my career that I've never had to cope with in the other fields I've been in. So the following are things that I wish I'd known when I began this career. 1. Don't expect people to respect your professional credentials. This has been true for me my entire career (I have a Master's degree in English, and my Master's was in teaching, but I've not had to prove that to anyone) but I think it's still relevant in my field. 2. In a field that is very technical, be sure to take care of your hands, even if you don't think you have time. This is something I have to work on constantly and this just makes me feel even worse about it, because I know how important it is to take good care of my hands. 3. Don,t use your phone at the office. This was the hardest for me, I know, because this is something that I used to be taught by a mentor of mine. But my hands are always in my phone, so I just couldn't imagine doing that in front of anyone. 4. Don' t use email for work. I don't know if anyone can tell me if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it is something you have to be really careful with. I feel more comfortable with email, so when I get emails I answer them. However, if there's something you need to know quickly, email it. 5. If you are an undergrad, don't worry about writing papers for your thesis, you have plenty of other options that are a lot easier to do. I just wrote down my notes for my own review. Also, it's not uncommon to have to do the same thing as the professor, but with someone else. 6. Don''t expect to be on deadline all the time. People who are used to deadlines have the luxury of doing things more slowly and in a more orderly manner, but if you are just starting out, you may find that you have a lot to learn in terms of this. 7. When you get an offer on the table,

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really had high hopes for this book. It was marketed as a coming of age story and I was hoping the protagonist was the kind of person who could be taken seriously when he talks about "dumb" things like being in love. I got sucked into it too. It started off really slow, but the main character was the reason I kept going back to it and it grew on me. I was in love with him. It's hard to describe how I felt when he would say things like, "You will be one of the biggest rock stars of the year." When I had to say goodbye to him he was devastated, but he wasn't done with me yet. The plot was the best part of it. It gave a nice twist and left you wanting more.   The last third of the book was just boring and pointless. He went through the same motions over and over again. His friends and loved ones were all trying to save him from the dark side. His mom was doing everything she could, and his parents. He wasn't just going through the motions though, because the ending was really not what I was expecting. I mean, I was waiting for something to happen, but it wasn't there. It got even worse in the end, it had to do with his mom's death. It just made no sense and left me wondering why he didn't stop it before. I really hated that ending.  , I hate the end of this book, too. I would have liked him to stop all of it, especially the death. I understand that he's on the verge of breaking, but why didn't he stop it? I know it was going to happen eventually, but this is the first time I've had to put down a book and think to myself, "Damn, that would have been fun."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My son was 13 years old and read this book as a bedtime read. He is not the child that takes things a bit too seriously. He loved it though because he got to meet the real character. I think the book is about a boy who is in a lot of trouble with his father and his mother who is a drug addict. She gets locked up for some reason and is being fed dope by her husband and his friends. I do not want to give away too much but it was very hard for me to get a hold of the book. I kept getting it stuck in my Kindle that I couldn't use and I kept having to go back and fix it. I had to take off my book blocker and it was hard to finish it since it was a really long read. So if you are looking for a good read you might try this but keep it in a book blocker if you want to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *(1) *(2) *   My children were very excited about this book and wanted me to read it to them over and over.  The story of  Little Red Riding Hood  is very old and has been used in many different ways over the years.  My children all enjoyed it and now all of them are grown up, so it is time for me to finally give the book a read.  It has good pacing and a story that the kids can relate to.  They all loved it and are now saying that it is their favorite story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   "I was disappointed with how this book has been published. The author has a clear agenda, which is to tell a story that promotes the cause of environmental extremism. The book attempts to present environmental issues as if they were somehow not in conflict with economic and national security issues. This is the only logical conclusion you can draw when you take a look at what the author has said about himself. The chapter on "Sustainability" is a clear example of the agenda behind the book. I've been listening to the Environmental Working Group for almost 20 years and never have I heard a single person use the term "sustainability." In fact, I have heard people use that term when discussing the economic system that destroys nature and creates economic instability. The article by Richard Wurman does a good job of debunking the book's arguments."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** It was disappointing because this was my first time reading one of these types of books. The first time was my favorite book in the series, and I loved the character development and what not but this one was just too confusing for me. When I started reading I was really impressed by the author's writing style and his prose, but now after reading some of the other reviews I realize how bad the writing was. I'm not sure why people are praising this book because it's one of my least favorite books in the whole series and I don't really care for it, but I guess I had too much expectations for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________  If I could add one negative thing to this book I would be a little bit concerned about the fact that the author was using his real names in the text and not a pseudonym which is normally used for that purpose. Not that I have a problem with pseudonyms but it bothers me when I'm dealing with some of the information that he is using in a real book.  "For me the book is an exploration of how people use fiction to navigate a world of their own creation and the different ways in which these stories allow us to shape the world around us. It is not a straightforwardly factual book – instead it explores a range of issues related to the use of fiction and how we create meaning out of life through fictional narratives.  The book explores, among other things, the relationship between fiction and reality. This is important as many of the issues I deal with are influenced by this distinction between the physical and the fictional.  to illustrate the point I will give two examples:  1. An author wrote a story which involved a war in which a hero was killed by the enemy, with the character of the protagonist dying before his eyes. He described this on the front cover and described his dead protagonist, using the author's name. He said it was part of the'realism' of the story. This was all well and good but if the story was written as a fictional narrative, in which the hero actually dies and the story is all about his survival, then I would question whether this was a realistic depiction of the war.    2. The story of 'The Lord of the Flies' is one that has been around for decades. In this story a group of boys who have never had anything like a school experience try to survive a school run by the cruel principal, who makes the boys do humiliating tasks and in doing so encourages them to become more cruel to each other. To explain this to another example: in 'The Hunger Games' a young girl is put through a series of brutal tests. These tests are designed to make the girl more cruel. . I have some sympathy with this. As a former teacher of about 100 teenagers, I have seen a lot of terrible things done to students. The teachers that I knew would never use the word 'bullying' to describe what they did to children but if they knew the meaning of the word, they would have thought about changing their methods of dealing with the students and the way
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really do recommend this book.  For sure I was disappointed in some points, but I think the book did what it set out to do.  The book is pretty accurate in some aspects, but also in others, it was just wrong.  I am a teacher and I read this book in my courses and we have to learn and be more accurate.  And so did I.   I can see it getting used in a few situations but I really do have to question it's usefulness in real life.     I really wanted to like this book, I really did.  It's so easy to read it and understand, it's clear, and I found it easy to follow.  But then, after the first 2-3 pages, I got frustrated.  At first, I didn't really understand why the book was so wrong, but then I read through all the books that the author used and I realized that most of them were pretty accurate. I am surprised because, I do believe it was an honest mistake and it shouldn't have happened.  So, if you get this book and you are a student and you learn something, I would advise you not to read this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This is a bad story and is filled with lies. It is filled w/ misinformation and just plain lies. This book is one of the worst I've read. I was promised that this book would give me insight into what it is like to be in the military and what it takes to be a leader. I am sorry if this is an exaggeration of my experiences in the army, but it has all the characteristics of a lie. First off, we're lied to. The real story is about this female officer named Kelly. She doesn't want to be an officer in the Army because her husband died in a car accident. The book is not about her military career or the hardships of being an officer. We're not even told that she was a captain in the Navy. The whole thing is just a ploy to get you to buy this book. The story is full of lies and misleading information. The biggest lie in the book is the title. It claims that it is a true story of an officer who made it to the pinnacle of military life. The first time she actually shows up in the story is in the section called "Operation Diversion." This is the entire chapter about her being put on leave. All of her story lines revolve around her time off. It was told that this was for the sake of the war effort. However, when this happened she was out of the Army. Then, we are told that because of her absence she was promoted to a position as an intelligence officer in charge of a military base. When she returned she was reassigned to a new position in the field. At this point, she had been off for over 4 months. At the end of the chapter, we were supposed to see her standing by her new position with an Army of her own, yet when she went to see General Hap's command she was gone again. When we get to the actual section on her time at Fort Bliss, we learn that she didn't go to school. She didn't even attend classes. Instead, her main purpose was to get the Army to grant her a promotion. The entire reason that she is at Fort Bragg is because General Haps wanted her to learn what it meant to lead people. She isn't there to learn how to lead soldiers and she doesn't even have any idea about the situation they are facing. When I heard that, I almost choked on my tea. At some point during the book we're told that the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read. Not only does it not make you think logically but the author seems to have no clue what she is doing. It is just confusing to understand and if you are an atheist and read this you will never trust her again. The author does not seem to know what she wrote nor does she seem to understand how to use a computer. All the writing is incomprehensible, no grammatical errors whatsoever. This book is a joke and the main idea behind it is an insult to all atheists! I hope everyone who reads this book is put off by it because there is not much else in her book. If you are one of those people reading this and have no friends, no family or no religious friends then I advise you to give this book a miss. If I had a daughter and I had to read this book to her I would tell her that she should never read something like this to anyone else. She will be the one to make me leave her for this type of stuff, I hope she doesn't have to read it to anyone ever and that she never read it in school. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had never read The King in Yellow before. However, a friend told me about the book and I couldn't stop reading about it. So I gave it a try. Well, it was just terrible. Not only was it slow, confusing, and not very well written, but it was very scary. It was like I had the worst headache. The characters are not likable at all, especially the one who was the main character. I don't know what I expected from the novel. It definitely doesn't live up to what I had read about. If you don't want to read about scary ghosts, this is not the book for you.  29 of 34 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst novels I have ever read. It is filled with so many spelling errors it is hard to make out what is being said. It also is filled up with grammatical errors, improper syntax, and wrong terminology. It feels like I have been reading the last four thousand words of a book and it hasn't been a bad translation and then the author gets a little off track. It's not a bad story, it's not terrible, but it's very unreadable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................................ I had been looking forward to this book for a long time and was excited to finally get it in my hands. I expected a lot out of it. I was wrong. I've read many books about depression and these were no exception. What I did NOT expect was to be so thoroughly pissed off at the author after only the first few pages. Her tone is condescending and she makes a big deal about how her own depression was "very common" when she didn't even have a diagnosis of it at the time. But if I'm honest with myself, I don't think I've ever read anything that felt so smug about people suffering from depression.   This book is an absolutely wretched mess. At least with the books by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens I can go back and read their books over and over again, so I don,t have to feel this way. This book feels like the author's way of trying to make up for the fact that she doesn't have a book deal. I'm sure some readers would probably be put off by this, but I just don't have that kind of time and I don.t want to waste my time reading a book that feels like it's written in the first person. I would like to point out that the writing style of this book is a complete mess. When I was reading it I was getting the feeling that I was in the middle of a bad movie. I know you can't write with a straight face, but that just didn't work for me. The dialogue was ridiculous and unhelpful. I just didn;t care if a character was talking about suicide or going on a vacation. The author wasn't able to think of a word to use to convey her point. There are at least two or three times where she could have used a quote and used the sentence structure of the book. She didn't use them, so it felt like a missed opportunity.   The final nail in the coffin was when I got to the part of the story where her husband is killed in a horrible car accident and she was left at home. Her husband was an avid athlete, an excellent listener, and was always the first to offer a helping hand when needed. She was such a kind person. That kind of person has nothing left, she says. She tries to keep living. It's impossible. How is it possible for someone like this to be able to live with this kind of
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a big disappointment. I thought it would be about a woman who goes to a doctor in the middle of the night, and she discovers that her body is actually turning into a man's. That's it.   I was thinking about this when I read the other reviews on Amazon. A woman, who is sleeping, discovers that she is actually male and then has to figure out how to take control of her new-found sex life. This book is about how women are supposed to react to a sex change, which is just not how I experienced it. I was so disappointed to read that it was only a man, who was not really all that bad looking, being in my body for a while.   to be fair, it does happen more often that people think it does, but only by a few times a decade. You can't always find someone who is a complete man and not a complete woman. The book describes a lot of different options for this, and I was really disappointed that none of them are ever taken.   in the end, it was all a delusion, and it was really, really frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** * This book is absolutely not worth the time. It's a bunch of fluff for the kids to read. And it contains the occasional bad joke or 2. It does not teach kids how to think. It doesn't give them what they need to know in the real world to be successful. ********* I found it to be a very boring, repetitive book. The kids were bored and the author made them feel stupid for being so interested in what they were reading. There were so many problems with it. The first problem is that it's a collection of fluffs. The children were not taught anything. There was absolutely no information given to them regarding the real problems in the world today. It did not give them how to get out of this world with knowledge and wisdom. It was an endless supply of "I know that's why you're crying..." and a series of "now that's an awesome story" and just a lot of words in the book. It actually made the book longer because of it. Secondly, I found that the author never explained why she was making these jokes. There are things she says and does that make no sense. At first, I thought it was just a joke, but the more I thought about it, I realized it was the real reason for the joke. The most obvious one was her "we're making up the name for a new dinosaur. We call him Hyrulian" when they first meet him. That name is completely nonsensical. What does she mean by it? And that is not something a dinosaur would have a name for. Another thing she does is have a few sentences that make sense and she then uses "oh we forgot what he looked like" as an explanation. Then after this she talks about what they did with him, and that's just lame. Thirdly, the kids did not read the information in the beginning. The only reason they bothered to do so was because of the "now I've made up a name" bit. If you do that, you have to do the "I just came up with the name" and the "Oh no you didn't" bits. If I were to write this story, it would have been so much better if the kids didn't bother to read the info that they get from the beginning because then it would've saved about 90% of the book's time. ************ * I would give it a 4.5 for being a great introduction to a great
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a terrible waste of time.  In essence, it is a self-help book for women (of the "feminine" variety) who are convinced that they are the "bad ones". The book's only real purpose is to help women identify what they think is wrong with them, which is a totally subjective thing.  The authors are so convinced of their own self-importance, that they think that by identifying a problem in women, and finding an "expert" who will "fix" them, they will be able to get out of their "problem" and into the right body (i.e. a man's body).  Unfortunately, the book just leaves women feeling worse about themselves, and less confident in themselves, rather than helping them identify what is wrong and find the problem solver.  I had read a similar self-improvement book a while back, which I did not really enjoy, but I was not disappointed by this one.  If you are a woman who feels like she is "bad" because you are attracted to or enjoy sex with men, and if you also know that you are not attracted to men in other ways, then read this book, as it may just save your life, but only for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:...............................  "There were lots of interesting things in the book and it was well written. However the ending was a bit bizarre, the author tries to justify the story by saying that there was no real plot in this book, but I found it kind of hard to believe as there was such a plot."  The rating for this book was provided by Goodreads.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I've been trying to read this book for the past month and I just can't get myself to do it. The story is interesting but it seems like the characters are very flat and one of the characters that seems to have the most depth, is clearly written as a cardboard cutout and the whole story is very poorly written, at least it's written poorly in my opinion. The plot doesn't move, the characters seem flat and forgettable and the language and the sex scenes are bad, especially the sex scene between a character that is married and a character with an abortion.   The one thing that I found interesting is that there is a character who is bisexual who is married to a woman and has three other husbands, I thought that that was interesting and it made me think of how different the world is for people who are bi. The characters seem like they are just trying to have fun and not wanting to think about the future and the end of the world that is coming. The character I'm looking forward to seeing the most is the character I've mentioned already, the priest in the story who is supposed to be a very wise man who is very good at his job and who is not very fond of his wife. The fact that she has three husbands I've read about and I didn't know about them because I have not read anything about her yet. I wonder if it will get revealed that he is bi or not. If he is not then it is going to be sad because it is not going to get much more interesting than the story.   the ending is really depressing and I was hoping to see the happy ending of the priest and his wife and the way the author wrote it made it seem like the priest wanted to kill himself at the end but I couldn't see it happen.   He was not in any great trouble but it wasn't as interesting as it could have been.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is nothing special at all. The story is ok but I feel like a lot of the characters have been overused and there is no emotional connection to most of the main characters. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in science fiction but feels like it is too slow paced and that there is not enough action in the stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!   1) This book is terrible.   2) I do not want to read more of this book.   was going to do another read to try to find the similarities between the book and the real life events, but I do think I've discovered just how bad of a read this is. The events in the book have the same names as the actual events, and have the words of "Mr. N" in common with his daughter's mother, and the "Mrs. C" as an old coot. The characters are awful.   the main character was an older man that died suddenly. I felt bad for him when he died, since he had a kid in the house, but that kid is an ass. I also did not like him for not trying to leave the place, he did not even try to kill the bad man.  's parents are good people. In fact, I would say that they are a bit less than good. Both of them are kind of ignorant. I don't want to give anything away, but it's obvious that they didn't know how to handle the situation and were afraid that the family might get hurt. The other characters are not too bad. the author has a few more pages in the author's note about them, but she does not go into too much detail about them. It seems that the author wanted them to be like the good guy characters in the movie, but they weren't. I really disliked the bad guy, because he was not evil. He was just greedy, and had no respect for the other characters or his own daughter, and that was why he did what he did. If he were the main villain, then it would be like he was just a really bad person, but the good thing was that he was an asshole. Also, the other main characters are just not very well written. I thought it was just the writer and her friends at a party, but my wife says that they were actually her friends. There is not enough characterization for them. My wife and I are pretty similar, and we both like to tell stories, and so when we were doing a reading group, my wife said she really liked the book, and I said that I thought so as well. I think I was just being too hard on the book when I wrote that.   The rest of the book is just the author telling her story about the events in her life. I feel like I was supposed
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________   This book is a compilation of the works of the ancient sages, and the ancient teachings of man, and is one of the oldest surviving books of the New Testament, and it is written in the original Hebrew, and by some say the most ancient language still used by the people of the Old Testament.   Unfortunately, I think it was written at a time when the people were still so ignorant of the things of the world, that they did not know that the world was round and that it was not flat. That is what I found so confusing in this book.   of course the world is round, but the Bible says it is round in the Old and New Testaments and the New Age movement in the west is the same way. It seems to me that this is another example of the ignorance of the people at that time.   it is a short book. It will take a while to get through. It's kind of a history of the earth from the creation of the sun and the moon, and all the planets, and to the big bang.  :

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________ Last year I picked up a copy of this book on a whim because of the great reviews it was getting on Goodreads. I love the idea of "the true story" and it sounded like a fun read. Unfortunately, there was a major flaw to this story that makes it very hard to find enjoyment in.

I have been looking for a good novel to read for a while and this book was exactly what I needed. This is a book that I would suggest.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********This is a very good book but it was terrible, terrible, horrible, terrible. I had read this book 3 times already, and my mind was not open to the thought of a bad review, and that was the main reason I took a chance with the third time around. It's a good book, but it is terrible. It has one good idea, but that idea is poorly implemented and the main character is not very appealing. I wish I could give it zero stars, but I can't. *****I will say that the main premise is well thought out, but then it gets out of control with the way they introduce it and the way it ends.I like the idea of it all, but they just seem to throw it all together in the end, and it's not very good. I could understand if it were a book by someone with a more established world, but not an author who is completely unknown and unknown to me. They should know better. This book is a joke. This was a great idea, only ruined by bad execution and an author with nothing to lose.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've had the best luck with the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. The books have taught me a ton about being a female in the world, how to love, how and why to get revenge on the people that screwed you, and so much more. But the last three books in the series are some of the worst books I've ever read. It was a huge let down and completely destroyed my enjoyment of the Harry books. There are so many things wrong with these books. First of all, there is no doubt that J. K. Rowling is a master writer. Her writing style is so beautiful and poetic that it's almost hypnotic. But as a writer she's a terrible one. I just hated every chapter she wrote. She is just so bad at making me feel things or make me care about something. She has no idea what she is doing. She's not a great reader. And her writing is so cliche. I couldn't believe how bad they were. Also, the characters are completely useless, so unlikable and unbelievable. They're just as bland and uninspiring as the main characters are. And you never get any character development and the way the story is told just feels repetitive. And there are soooo many inconsistencies and things that happen that aren't necessary. It is just plain bad. I would not recommend them to anyone who reads, especially kids, who would just laugh it off and not read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this book.  The only thing I didn't really like about it was the ending.   The ending was completely out of left field.

In any case, it wasn't a bad novel overall, especially for the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very hard to read.   I can understand why some people love this book. I'm a huge fan of James Ellroy. His books are a feast for the senses and he has a very good sense of plot and world-building.   and that is why I love this novel. It has a beautiful world-conception, a very well-crafted plot, and some good characters. I've not been a fan of Ellroy's other books, but that doesn't make this book any less enjoyable.  -   But this book is so damn hard to get through, it really feels like there's an obstacle at every turn.  .     -  .  . -  -.  The whole worldbuilding and the characters are so rich that I didn't know what the hell I was looking at. Ellroy knows how to write complex characters, so it was all easy to follow.   be able to read the history, the language, and everything else that made me really excited about reading this novel was hard to swallow.   -   .  ,  , 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I bought this book to be a fun, interesting read, but I was really disappointed. It's hard to find a good read with the main character being a girl, I mean, come on! In fact, it felt like there was a lot of writing wasted on this book. It felt like the author just wanted to make the main characters interesting and make them "different." But what could be more unique than being a teenager who is so afraid of being the "first girl" she meets, she won't even date or go to the prom with someone that she finds attractive. She also doesn't even like boys. So now we've got a "sick" girl who doesn't have any friends and is "bad" because of her fears? It's so unoriginal and I feel like it was just added to add some more "character" in the book. This book was also really long, I was getting kind of bored after a while, but there wasn't anything wrong with the writing, it was simply that it took too long to read. That's just my opinion.  26 of 30 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the worst book I have ever read. It is so dull and boring and repetitive, I just didn't find it entertaining to read.  The story doesn't even have any kind of theme that I liked about it. It just was too boring.   I got the book from a book club that I'm in and I read it in about 30 minutes and I was so bored out of my mind I just put it down and walked out.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ This book is bad. I mean really bad. There are some parts I don't like, there are some portions I like but the majority of the book is just...wrong. The story is good but not great and the characters are poorly designed. The characters are just too stupid. They have no concept of life and relationships, they just want to be right.   This book is the worst book I have read. I hate to write this review but I really think it's a waste of time to waste your time with this book.  0 of 0 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. It was hard to follow along, and it seemed to be more of a personal rant than a story I felt like I could relate to. The characters in the story were hard to get into because of all the yelling and shouting and general drama. It wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. This book left me feeling somewhat disappointed and frustrated.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book isn't good. There is no character development, plot holes, or any other flaws that a good book should have. There are also many grammatical mistakes. The characters sound like they are from the 90's. The dialog is also very generic and uninteresting. I felt that the author was trying to sell his new book by making it as much fun as possible. He did it by trying to make it sound like a story about a crazy young girl who wants to be a detective or detective's assistant. It is not. I think it would have been better if he tried to make the story a bit more interesting by making the character more likeable. The book ends with a cliff hanger which I do not like in a story that is supposed to last a few weeks. Overall, this book is not bad but not good either.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------This is not a good book. The first book was good, I bought the second because I liked the first, but this book did not work. I could not understand the book at all. I mean, I understood the concepts in the beginning but they did not make sense to me. It was a very confusing book, and the author did not give any good tips to the students or what to learn. Also, this is not the best novel to start with. But as I said, a good novel to take on a field trip or to read in a long car ride. It is interesting, and I would like to read another book by this author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to finally read this book when I got a free sample of it when I signed up for Kindle Unlimited. When I got the e-book I had to close my browser because I was in a hurry. The story is quite good. It is a bit slow at times. The narration is good. The pictures and text are in proper color, and the writing is crisp. But what I liked the most about this book was the characters and it's theme. In my opinion there are many interesting people in this world. If it could be a bit more short, I would not be so bothered by it. I would give this book 4 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was totally excited to read this book, but I had the same expectations as everyone else. I'm a huge fan of the old west, and I read this novel while eating a pizza out of a Styrofoam container. And to make it worse, there are no subtitles, and it is the English edition, so I am only learning about the culture of the time and the language used to describe things. In the last third, though, I began to realize that this was a really good book, because it makes me feel nostalgic for the old West, and a little bit sad for the future. I wish that I had had this book when I was younger.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ This book is awful. If you don't already know this, you are going to hate this book. I found the main character annoying and the book is riddled with flaws. It makes it look like it was written by a teenager, but I know that isn't true.   The book is set in the future in a post apocalypse world where humans are no longer the dominant species on Earth. They are no more than a sub species. I do not know where that information came from, but it is the main point of this book and it is a major flaw.  :I thought the first chapter was great. I liked the way that it explained how the survivors from the Earth came into contact with the other Earth species. They were able to learn from the other species because they were able survive in their own environment. It gave a realistic look into how the planet was able to sustain the humans. The first chapter also was great because it introduced the main villain who is the leader of the survivors. I did like the fact that there is no "God" that the humans believe in. They do believe in karma and the concept of reincarnation.I did think the book was boring. I thought this was the main flaw of the book.  -The protagonist is not believable. The author tries to make him seem like the main protagonist, but he is not. He is very unoriginal and you don' think that he would survive in the apocalypse. He talks in a boring way that makes it impossible to believe that this guy could be the main hero. I was hoping that the author would change his name to John Doe to give the main story more believability.   (hide spoiler)   -This was the only thing about the book that made it a little enjoyable to me. I actually really liked the ending because it seemed very realistic. I could only give it 3 stars because it made it seem like this book was going to be really good. I didn't realize that there was a main character who didn't survive. I would have liked to read more about them and how they got to where they are now. If it were me, I would not have read this book because it would have been so bad.I have read a few books that have been terrible, but this one was just awful. I wanted to like this one but it just made me dislike it more and more. It's just that annoying and unoriginal.It just made it difficult

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book and I really wanted to love it. I read it twice and I kept going back to read it again.  I really wish I could have read it more than 3 times but I am so glad I read this book.  The writing is so fantastic, it really makes the reader feel like you are in the same world.  The illustrations are so beautiful.    The ending and the ending scenes were beautiful. There are a few inconsistencies and that makes me sad but i like that they are there.  I wish i could give more stars but I can't.  Because I read so many books that are good but this is the most perfect book of all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I really don't like this book at all. It is just so repetitive. The prose is so awful that I didn't want to keep reading, which is a pity because I really wanted to. It has been over a month now since I bought the book, and I am still reading the same parts over and over and again. The story line is just a mess; there is so much happening at once that it feels like one long story line. The characters are so shallow that you find yourself wishing for them to die and for things to end, but you know that's not going to happen. It takes about three books before I got bored of it. I don't know why so many people enjoyed this, but I didn?t. I am not an expert in the paranormal, so maybe the author just had a really good idea and never managed to finish it? I'm not complaining though. I just didn't enjoy it and I will be reading other books from this author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to get this book as a gift for my son and his little brother. Unfortunately, they were disappointed as they did not receive any of the books. I understand that the books are not in stock in a lot of stores (I live in the Bay Area) so they were at the mercy of local bookstores. I had been talking with my son's friend about getting one for him and his brother and my son wanted to be a big boy and pay $20 for a book instead of paying $2 for a new toy. If I could give it negative stars, I would. There is a section about the history of the Bible (I am a Bible junkie) and while the bible is a wonderful book for all ages, it is not something that everyone will want to read. I could see why some might want to include this section on their childrens bookshelf but not for me. If the teacher was trying to cover all the different books in the Bible and it was too long, that would be a plus. I am sure there are other books that would have been a better choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- My boyfriend and I are still in love with this book after all these years. His favorite scenes are when he has to say how great it is to have a girl like this. And his favorite character is the one who's just there, not doing much, just giving in to the situation, and trusting her. I love it. I do like the way the book ends, but I think it could have ended much more happily. If I had to read it over again I would've changed the ending to have her and Luke going to Europe to do a real "European tour". But this is how it turned out.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I really liked this book, it's interesting and well written. However, the characters seem more like caricatures than human beings, and it just doesn't feel authentic to me. For instance, there is a great story about how the protagonist met a girl who had fallen in love with him, but because of his reputation he didn't feel able to tell her about it. And yet when he actually did he realized he wasn't really interested and told her the truth. _______________ - May 22, 2017No human emotion  Reviewer: mnstljn - - April 30, 2017  Subject: A strange one I found myself liking the book because of the characters and their interaction with each other.

Pulver (published 20 Nov 2014) I would have given 5 stars, but then I read this review and decided I didn't want to read it! I had to know what the reviews were about. The story revolves around a little girl called Lily who had been kidnapped and held in a box for days. Her captor is a man with supernatural abilities and he uses Lily to lure others to him and he keeps them hostage so he can be with Lily. The first part is all about the relationship between Lily and the girl called Sophie who's a child who is able to sense when someone has been hurt by someone or someone is about to do something. They get involved in a game called "Birds", where they have to find out who's hiding something and then rescue the person in question. Lily wants to help Sophie, but Sophie thinks she is the only one who can save the other person in trouble. However the story moves onto a second part where a little boy called Harry is also being held hostage, however Harry is the one with magic powers and he has no fear of his captors. He's also the only person who can help Lily escape. Harry is in the same class as Sophie and Lily and it's obvious that Harry is more intelligent than Sophie and more capable of solving problems. The thing is Lily doesn't want anything to do with Harry. She can see that Harry
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After finishing the book I was so relieved to finally see some closure for a very, very, long time. It took me awhile to get to the part where it ended but when I did I was thrilled and relieved. I was a bit worried that I would hate the character of Astrid but it was really not at all. I liked her very much and found her to be a good character. I thought that I'd like to see her go on to find something and not just just go to be one of those poor girls in the middle of nowhere who gets abused, which is how she ended up in the mountains. Her father was a good father but a really bad husband and I liked how she handled it all and moved on. She had a very good sister that is very annoying and annoying in that she keeps telling her to shut the hell up and to shut her mouth or she will find her own way. In the end she goes through all of this stuff with him so she doesn't have to take the brunt of all the blame or anything like that. I think that the author did a good job of showing all of the ups and downs in the life of A and I really liked how A kept finding new things to do in the end. The only thing I wish I could have said more about was how much I wished that A didn't end up so bitter. I guess I really felt like A didn a lot in life and I wanted to help her but it just never happened. I don't know if it was because I felt a lot of sympathy for A or just because I knew how she felt. Either way, I think it is something I will go back and re-read again.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to try to make sense of a difficult situation. I would not read a book without reading through the entire book first. It is a challenging book.   The book itself is very well written. It follows the same format as other books I've read. For instance, the first chapter is a summary of the events that occurred. The second chapter is the introduction. In the third chapter, the story gets into the action and the ending. It's clear that if you go to chapter four you have the rest of the story.   the author starts off by stating that his main character is a police officer who was investigating a murder. He discovers that the person he is investigating has a brother who is a retired police detective. After talking with the brother and investigating the case, he discovers a lot of unusual things, including the brother's former lover having a lot more experience in the business of the police department than he does. The brother is dead. After this, the writer begins to follow the other characters, who have other jobs, or just different lives. They begin to unravel this murder case.  , for the first time, the main character has his own agenda and is not simply following the orders of his supervisor. As the story progresses, the police officer finds out more about himself and the other police officers. In addition, this detective is a former Marine and has a lot less tolerance for people who get in his way.

Write a negative review about a bad book:..............................I have not found a negative on this book at all but I did find some things that could not be easily explained. The book is supposed to give the answers. In the beginning of the book, he starts explaining the theory and the whole way through it seems to go along very well but on the last pages of the last section he tries to tell us how to do the actual thing. In other words, if you want to do something you will have to find a place that already has a person doing that. The theory he talks about is just as good as it sounds but he goes on and on and tells us all about how to actually go about doing it and all of a sudden it just became so confusing. That is one of the things that really killed the flow of the whole book. Now I do not know if it is due to the fact that he was a very young child and the fact he had a good brain for the time period but he really had a hard time following this part. And I do agree with his theory that it is easier to tell what we want to know than it is to really learn how to get it. It just is what it is but it is one thing to find it and another to actually get it which is what I found so confusing about it. Now with all that said I am just going to give a 2.5 star rating since I really enjoyed the book so much.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *******************************   "So, the book had me excited as hell and the ending was amazing! I would have given this book 5 stars had it not been for the fact that there was absolutely no character development whatsoever.   First, the characters were a bit boring to read. I get it, they had some kind of past and the author wanted to keep it a secret. But, I'm not the biggest fan of character development. It's hard to take a character who only seems to care about herself and give him or her any depth in a book. I'm hoping this was written for children and not adults. Also, the author could have given some real emotional depth to characters other than just a few lines. I didn't understand why she decided to end the book so abruptly when she did so well so far.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" book is one of those things you know about. Its a kids novel about a little girl who has to run off to the next town and has no idea what to do. She has to pick a place to go and the book is basically all directions on how to get there.  However, this is not a book you want to read to your kids because its full of things your kids will absolutely not like:  * Lots of swearing in all the scenes. * Lots of sexual situations.  Oh well I'm not really sure what it is about this book that is bad and not just the kids.  I just wanted to be like, "That is not what I want my kids to be reading!"  It has an adult ending.  So why are adults reading this book to their kids?  Because its so good at being entertaining to adults.  Its not just a book about a girl who can't decide where to go.  This is a book that takes place in a fantasy world, but the story doesn't really take place there.  It is very much the sort of book that we would expect our grandparents to read us.  When I was growing up we read this book and we made up lots of stuff that was very much in this book.  If you are a parent reading this to your child you will want to put this book on the shelf that your child can't see.  A book is not just good for kids and their family. It can be entertaining for adults too. I read this to my kids so they wouldn't have to have the first chapter on the list and they are enjoying it.  I don't know what it was, but somewhere along the way they decided to make up this whole town, and I have to wonder why?  This is a fun book for children and adults to read.  And since it's a little bit out of date its perfect for kids who read it as an adult.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on Goodreads and read it about 2 weeks ago, and I am very disappointed. It is an awful story. The plot is terrible, and you have to go and buy the hardcover version to find out if you want to be entertained. The characters are also terrible. A couple of the people that are mentioned in the book do not exist in the world of The Night Circus. I just could not get behind it at all.   There is a man in the woods who claims to have seen a child in the forest, and he goes to visit him. But the child is gone. And then the man goes to the town that has the most missing children and he does the same thing. There is an even older woman who thinks she is a witch and is known for being in the same house as the missing girl. And the children do not believe her. The guy who has the weird feeling that he sees the girl is also an alien that came down from the sky. He says that all he sees is a white light in the sky and that they don't come down, but then the boy who claims he sees a girl in the tree is in his house and he tells his father that he has seen a girl falling off a tree, and then a woman who he has to run away with tells him that there is another girl in a tree and that she is being chased by a man. When this is all over, the two boys go to the woods and kill the other girl, then the girl that they killed is seen again by one of the boys, but she is gone too. They keep going and killing, but they are the only ones who remember what happened, so they keep going. At this point the man is in the middle of his own disaster and he takes off to a small town to see a doctor. He doesn't want to go because he thinks he is going to see another girl. He does see the same girl in his mind, and it is not a girl but a thing he is afraid of. And they keep finding things that they have not seen before, and this leads to one of them dying, and at this point they start losing their memories again. The doctor says he is just going to keep going because this is what they have come here to see. When they go to see this doctor, he wants them to see the other doctor he works for, and the other doctors are crazy too, and they both
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________   A couple of days ago I was introduced to a novel by a couple of really nice friends of mine. I'm not an easy read, even when I finish books that I really enjoy. I just can't finish them that often. In fact, in about the last three years or so I've only read about 10 books in total. Most of those were just too long for me. But this one was short enough that I finished it in two hours. But what a rollercoaster ride it was. It's about the relationship between a woman who was abducted and a boy who was the only person to help rescue her. It makes a lot of references to both religious and occultism, as well as to the paranormal. And it has some really amazing artwork. It was easy to find my place on the page. In all honesty, I was not expecting the ending that I got. I kept expecting some sort of twist. But I was completely in the dark when I read it. So I really can't say I had too much of a surprise when I came to the end. But that is not the main issue. I think that what really put me off about this book was the narration. Not necessarily the narrator's voice or how bad her voice was (though I feel that she did try to be deep and smooth) but rather the tone of her voice, especially towards the beginning of the novel. It just felt so pretentious and self-satisfied, almost as if she was mocking the reader. Her voice felt like a parody of a "real" narrator. It didn't help that she kept changing things when she narrated it.   But then I just felt that a lot was made up for by the art. I loved the art for a number of the scenes in the book. There's a lot that I did not know about the occult that was revealed in a way that was easy for me to understand. I've never had a lot knowledge about the paranormal, but I found it to be really interesting.   The writing is not bad at all, even if I was expecting a little more from it at the beginning. And although I was disappointed with the ending, it was still better than most of the books that were on my list. The ending wasn't a huge surprise, but it was better than the ending in The Mortal Instruments. And even though I'm really not a huge fan of vampire fiction, this book had more of

By the time I was halfway through I was bored out of my skull, the characters were so corny and the plot was so predictable. I kept waiting for it to be over, for the book to have some sort of happy ending. I tried not to give it a poor review but it was obvious I was reading a book for teenage girls.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ________________________________________   This book is nothing more than an attempt to prove something. The author's premise is that he/she can do something "no one else can do." It is simply not true that anyone can do anything. We must have faith, it is the source of our power. This book has nothing to do with science and it is a load of nonsense. A typical author, trying to prove a theory by citing examples that do not exist. A few examples could be given. The power of the human brain is unknown and cannot be measured. It is not the size, the size of the brain. It does not give us powers beyond what the mind of man can do. This claim has no basis in fact, but it is true in philosophy, as is stated in the book. If you are trying to use that as an argument to prove that you cannot be harmed by a chemical, you should ask yourself why your brain would have such a powerful defense system when you cannot physically attack or harm anything.   A typical example of this in the author's opinion is the author quoting a scientist that said "if there is a gas that could cause death, then it is not lethal." This is simply an erroneous statement. There is no gas that will kill you. The gas is harmless. But the person quoted as saying that he cannot be killed by any gas does not know this. If a doctor tells you that he can not kill you, it does not mean that he does not think it possible. The writer has stated "if it is impossible to kill you with this type of poison, it would not be lethal." It would be a false statement. A chemical cannot be lethal if the poison is administered by the patient. The doctor cannot inject poison into a patient without the patient being poisoned. This is not true. However, if the patient dies due to the poison, then the poison killed the patient, and the poison can be lethal. The statement of a scientist can not be used as an example, it will not be verified, and has no bearing on the argument.   and finally, a typical example:   The author's argument about the possibility of a negative energy field that could affect objects around you is also flawed. The energy field, in the field's own words is "positive" when in the presence of good, and "negative" when not in the surrounding environment. This means that it will affect anything around it and anything that gets in it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ _________________________________________ "I have read a lot of reviews and I must say the author does not have the necessary knowledge of the subject to write a readable book on the subject. I had the opportunity to visit the author's house. This was the first book in which the authors had been to Japan. She had a Japanese tutor help her. This book will teach you nothing except a very basic Japanese vocabulary. She should not have taken such a big risk, but I guess she is trying to please the author. But it does not work. The grammar and vocabulary is just not good. You can see that she did not learn anything from the book because the book has very limited coverage and her Japanese tutor didn't help her to the point of being able to learn the grammar. I would advise anyone that has not read Japanese to stay away from this book. It's all right if you're a student studying Japanese, but for the average reader it's just not useful."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is awful, the characters are all bad (a few exceptions) the prose is terrible.  If you are a horror and science fiction fan, don't buy this. _________________________ It was my first time reading a novel with female leads.  This book is a classic.  The story has its ups and downs but overall it is a good read.    It has the same sort of thing going on that made the original trilogy of Star Wars so enjoyable.  I liked the fact that the main characters were the same.    They are both the same sex.  I really liked the new story.  They were both new in that they were more realistic than the first one.  What is the main character supposed to do, get her hands on some sex toys.  She is in a school where the male students were doing this on the male's behalf.  It was very interesting to watch. One thing that annoyed me about the book is that the author wrote "she" as if it was a pronoun, not a name.  My guess is that her intent was that the "she's" be gender neutral but it was too late for that.  If I had my way, it would have been gender neutral.  However, I liked how the author was able to have a gender neutral pronoun, although it wasn't very descriptive, it did help me get used to it, so thank you for that!   In the end, I like the new characters and the story.   I think they were well written.  There is more of a plot and there was some development but not as much as I was hoping.  As a first time writer, this is my least favorite.  For some reason, I couldn't stand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this in the mail today and i couldn't wait to read it. i read the synopsis and realized this book is going to be boring and not very interesting. the main character is a girl that is very naive and easy to fall in love with. she gets to high school and the first thing that she does is go get a fake ID and gets a fake boyfriend. her fake boyfriend is called daniel and is a complete dick. she is told she is not good enough for him. he makes her a big mess in the morning, she is angry and does whatever she can to get him to stop and leaves. she then comes back and starts dating the guy that she thought was her best friend and she loves him. it gets better when they finally meet but he doesn't even look at her. they go out to get pizza and he starts making out with another girl while she is doing her dishes. he then goes into his bedroom and starts rubbing himself and masturbating in front of her and she is crying and yelling and screaming at him. she goes to the bathroom and then runs out and calls him. this book started out really well. it was a good introduction to the idea of fake boyfriends and fake ID's. it is very well written. there is a lot of sex and they start to fall for each other. they have sex in the kitchen and in the woods. they fuck in their bedroom and at their house. the sex is really hot and the ending is a good way to end the book. i was hoping there would be a more intense sex scene or something but nothing much happens. the next day the school finds out about it and they kick her out. they are trying to help her get back in but all they can do is kick her back to school. she says she isn't going to school because the teachers think she is an adult. she was kicked out but she is planning to go back to highschool to get back at her fake fake boyfriend and do whatever she has to to get the other girl to stop.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________ I read this book expecting to love it, but it was all the wrong things I've come to expect from Stephen King, and I got nothing. The story itself is very good, I enjoyed it, even though I felt it was just another example of King getting too big for his britches and writing a generic King novel, nothing too unusual, not in the least bit original, it is just what we've all read before. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, there was something very captivating and interesting about it that kept my interest, but there just wasn't much new in this book, and the ending wasn't anything to get excited about either. In short, it's just a bland book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to reading this book, but I really couldn't wait for it to be published, because it was going to be about my friend "Drake," whom I met in high school who is the most brilliant man I've ever met. The book does have a lot of references to high school, but it was not very helpful for me.  There were some references about how it made Drake want to kill himself and his depression.   I was so disappointed.  The book was almost as bad as my high school memories of him!  He also mentions that Drake, when he was in highschool, dated this girl.   In reality, this is the only girl that he ever dated.  And she was the "love" of his life and he wanted to die.  His parents were never supportive of his relationship with "Sara."  He also wanted to kill his mom at first because he was so sad about her death.  He finally found peace with Sara.  If you're interested, there's a blog that talks about Drake.  I was so confused and hurt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ [The author's wife is in love with a man who is a sociopath, and he loves her back.] [She can never be too careful with people. She's terrified that he'll use this info to destroy her. She has to tell everyone who they've been sleeping with.] [He has a strange, hypnotic voice that hypnotizes people and makes them do things they don't want to do. He has no empathy. He's always doing things for someone who needs him. This is the worst thing he can do.] [His mother is always waiting in the car, saying that he can't go. He says he can, but he can only be with her for fifteen minutes or twenty. Then she shows up in the passenger seat. He won't talk to her.] [They live in the woods, and it's very dark when he's not home, and there are no lights, and the whole neighborhood has turned into an encampment of zombies. He needs to sleep at night, but it's too much for him. One night he gets out of his bed and runs out of the house. He is pursued by a pack of zombies who are very angry at him for not coming home. He hides in the bushes and keeps running. He escapes, and hides in a dumpster.] (In the book, the author says that this doesn't happen, but I think it does.)  The title should really be "The Case of the Missing Children." This book is very creepy, but is there actually any evidence to back up the premise? Or is this just one man's theory? I would read it and see if it actually happened, but what I want to know is what the author thinks is true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to this book. It's been a while since I read one, and I was looking for something new and different. What I got instead was a book that's really good, but so very boring. I didn't like it. My favorite character was the guy that reads, which makes sense for a science fiction book. But his character was bland and uninteresting. His dialogue was uninteresting, and he made some pretty bad decisions. The other characters were also pretty bland and unlikable. I read the entire book in one sitting, so my knowledge of the science didn't change at all. I can't believe I have to admit that. I would recommend this to people who want to enjoy a good book, but don't want to do it because it's so dull. If you want to be entertained, this book will certainly do that for you. It is not the book for people who are looking for a good science fiction story. It was boring, and there wasn't any good reason for it to be in the story.   3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________   I was very happy with the first installment in this series. I just read the second book and found it to be a little less good. I have the first book and only got the second by way of an audiobook.   When I started reading, I loved this book. It was funny and very funny. The premise is funny and the book is a great read. However, that doesn't mean I enjoyed it very much. I found myself getting bored and wishing I had started the second installment before finishing the first. There were so many parts that seemed to be happening at the same time that I couldn't keep track of them and ended up reading some of the sections in the second one.  , an 8/10, is not one of my favorites. I thought it was a very funny book, however, it was also very confusing. The plot was a lot to keep up with and I wasn't able to keep all the characters straight. There was also a lot of character development that didn't pay off and was over before it really began.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a lot more from the author but... I was disappointed by this book. I really was hoping for a different view on the problem of race in this country but I got a different kind of disappointment.   The author does not try to hide his biases which were already very apparent in the first book. He is very honest and at the same time he writes a book in which there is a lot of "white guilt."   I am not interested in a book which promotes a political agenda of race hatred. I am interested in real information on the causes of the race problem.   beaufort was not able to do that and that is not his fault. He has written a very well written book but unfortunately I did not get anything I could recommend for this book to someone interested in learning about race and who has never been a racial separatist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is full of inconsistencies and holes in the story and I just do not feel comfortable reading it.  There is so much wrong with this story and with this book in general that I cannot wrap my head around the author's intentions and the way he/she is telling this story.  This book is just a mess.  I just did not feel like it was any more than just a way to pass the time and nothing more.  No one in the entire world (and I really think everyone) knows the full story on this and it just makes me upset that this is where my life is right now.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking for this book for years, and I finally got my hands on it, but I didn't finish it. I've read the entire book three times now, and each time I get the feeling I'm missing something I read earlier. I also can't help but feel I got cheated out of the real magic in this book and I can't imagine what was changed to make it acceptable.  What did you like best about this story?  The story itself is great, though I found it hard to connect with it and I was expecting something much more complex. It is a good story to read in a quiet room with only the person telling it to you for company.  I like that there are a lot of different characters, and that they each have their own motivation and dreams. I liked that the story is about the people that make up the magic world, not about the magic itself. The story is told from the perspective of a man who is being hunted by the people of the magic realm. I was really intrigued by the story because there were so many strange and different ways the people from the magic could die, and how they died was so different.  he had a very different end than the main character did. I think that makes the story better, and it was fascinating how it was written.  of course, I also loved the ending. It was beautiful, emotional, and powerful, and made the reader want to know what was next. The last line was so perfect, and when the last pages started to roll, I was so sad to see the story finish. : "I knew that there was something special about you, Harry. It's been a long time since I had met a friend like you. But you made that last moment, as if it were tomorrow. And that made all the difference. "It's the things that you see that move you the most. I can imagine that was why you fell in love with me. You knew that I was a friend who wouldn't let anything get in the way of our love. "…I'm going to stay by your side. It won't be long before the other people from our world see us together. There won't even be a night in my life that I'll be alone." "I can feel myself fading away. I'm a bit too much of a burden for you to carry on your own. You've done so much already.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~This book was too much like a badly written bad book. There was no "good guy" in this book, no real characters. Everyone was horrible. No one cared about anybody other than themselves. I know this is a children's book, but it just made me hate this book more. I was looking for the "happy ending" at the end, but unfortunately, I had to look hard for it. There were no good characters in this whole book, and I know many people have different opinions about books, but I could not wait for the end. I could have waited for two weeks and still not have gotten an idea what happened to the "good guys." ~~I wanted to scream at this book! I did not like this book. ~~ I wanted to love this book!!! ~~The ending was disappointing, and all the characters were uninteresting and annoying.  2 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but I was disappointed by the way it ended. I felt like the end was rushed and rushed, but that's me. I liked it though. I got to know the main characters really well and felt like they were well developed and interesting characters. I wish I got more pages to follow the story and maybe know what happened to them.   It was interesting to hear the main character talk about all the crazy things she was planning to do and the things she had already done.  -The main character, and I mean THE main character of this book (if you don't count the "monster" that lives inside her head or the "other" person who was "turned" into a monster by her sister) was a 17-year-old girl named Emily who has a severe case of autism. Her parents were divorcing when Emily was born. Her father was a professional musician who died during an accident. Emily grew up without her father so she never knew him and she doesn't talk about him much. She was adopted and adopted by a family who would only accept her if she had autism. The only family she really knew was her adopted mother and the foster father (who I think would be a cool name for an album, by the by).   Emily was raised in a very conservative Christian household. It was the first time she ever heard any kind of secular thought and it broke her. She didn't know what to do with her mind. She knew she was different from everyone around her. Because of this, her foster parents tried to force her to be a Christian at a very young age. They even sent her to the church to be baptized and get to know Jesus. But Emily just wasn't getting it. So, she started going to school to learn how to make music, but she couldn't make any progress.   and the people in the church didn't really understand her, they were too religious and stuck in their ways. So they tried to find a new church for her.   the church was about an hour away and Emily had to go pick her up. So she went and sat on the floor for two hours, crying until her foster dad came to pick her. And he drove her home with tears streaming down his face. That is the story I was told when I was a child, and Emily's story is similar to that, except that it has a little bit more of a happy ending and a little
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this as a gift for a guy who is a huge fan of Stephen King and I absolutely love it. But unfortunately it wasn't anything like the books I would have given him if I had gotten the book for myself. It didn't seem real and it didn't feel like a real book. The story was a bit rushed and the characters were not well developed. I can only imagine that it would be awesome to sit down and read it but I just didn't have the time to do that when I wanted to get a gift. I just think it's a bad choice for a gift and the person who gave it to me needs to get over it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I would like to thank the reviewers for reviewing this book. This book is full of misinformation. If you read the book as written by a reviewer, you will think that the book is correct. The author uses words that are just not true. Some of the words and expressions are used incorrectly, and sometimes the authors use wrong terms such as "homo-sexual" in a sex book. "Homo-sexually-identifying" is also wrong. Homosexuality is not an immutable condition. Many gay men are still sexually attracted to men, as well as women, and some are straight (not exclusively homosexual) but they are "heterosexual" in the sense that they are attracted to the same sex. I was appalled by the author's misuse of language. I read a lot of sex books. I am embarrassed by many of the terms used in this book, and this one is no different. Some authors use words and phrases that are totally different than those used by the authors of the other sex books, and I cannot imagine why a sex therapist who works in the field would use such a wide variety of inappropriate and inappropriate words, and the reviewer must have not read any books before writing her review. The word "gay" is not mentioned once in the whole book. The authors say homosexuality is normal. But what is normal? Is it normal to be attracted to more than one sex, to masturbate more than once a day, to eat chocolate before sex, and to have a hard-on the day of or the night before sex? Are all people attracted to one sex or are there gay people who are attracted only to women? In other words, are all heterosexual people attracted only and exclusively to men? Is all heterosexuals attracted only, exclusively, to men or are some heterosexuals (men?) attracted to women and some heterosexual women are attracted mostly to men. How can it be a disorder to be sexually attracted exclusively to one gender? Is the sexual orientation "same sex attraction disorder"? Are people who have a sexual orientation of being attracted to both genders "homosexual" as in the book? Is this a disorder that can be cured by medication, surgery, counseling, and religious beliefs? I think these questions are important, and they should be addressed in the discussion of this book's contents. I find it very disturbing that the authors have tried to give people a wrong idea about homosexuality, especially since it is a complex subject. The book states that homosexuality
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books   I've ever read   The first chapter is so confusing   There is a large jump in time in the middle of the book   If you don't read this book you will not understand anything about it   A couple of paragraphs are so unclear that you can't really tell what the author is trying to say   To me, the author seems like a typical author that was trying to make his name. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I have been looking for this book for years. I don't really read very much fantasy. I do read horror though. My husband and I both had read and enjoyed this book. However, we decided to read it together. We were just looking for something to read while he is driving to work. But the reviews and a google search had us both hooked! When I opened the book I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it and loved reading about all of the characters. This book is one that you just have to love. I can tell I will be re-reading this one. Thank you, thank you thank you, and thank you again! I am definitely recommending this book to everyone!

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------I gave this book a good review because of all of the great things that the book had to offer. The book also has one very good negative. Although I didn't find this to be an issue with my reading of the book, I didn`t find it that interesting. I am glad I tried this book, but I would not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   This is the first book I have ever had published and it has certainly been a learning experience for me. It is a good basic guide to how to take better care of your animals and how to care for your animals when they are out of their normal environments. I was a little skeptical at first about how my pets would react to it, and then I did what every responsible pet owner does - took it to a pet store to get some advice. The person there assured me that I had every right to use this book to my advantage and that my pets will love it, so that I am certainly satisfied.   The first time I picked up a book about my pets, I just loved it. It was so easy to read and easy to follow. It did not require any reading ahead or waiting on my animals. I just laid the book down and let it tell me what I needed to know. The only thing I did not like about it was the pictures were very small and not very good. But I was able to easily tell by their color and the layout that this was a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ It took me a while to get into this book but once I did, I was hooked. It's a very interesting and well-written novel with quite a plot and the ending was a bit confusing but it was still satisfying and I liked the twists and turns. This is a book that I will probably not finish reading, I know I'll get a lot of comments about it but I just don't like endings and I was hoping the ending would turn out to be more satisfying than the previous novel but it didn't. I found it a bit too predictable and didn't have that great of an ending for me. But I think it is a great book that deserves to be read and I am really glad I bought it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very long tome, with the same plotline and some of the same characters all the way through. The narrator's style is a bit clunky, and the prose is choppy. As a fan of the show, I was not pleased.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited for this book, and thought I'd give it a try, but it was just a waste of time. It had a lot of promise, but the story was extremely predictable, and boring. The writing was also just plain bad. In the first chapter, a girl says something like: "When you see a wolf, a bear, or a coyote, you always know what you're going to get." This isn't a bad sentence, but this book uses it as the basis for everything that happens, like "when a little girl in a red dress is attacked by the monster in the closet." Why does a little boy have to tell his little sister that the monster might be a girl when she's running away? Why does he have to ask his big sister if she knows if she saw a wolf and she told him a bear. This book is basically an extended version of "The Princess Bride." The author, who is actually the same person, has a lot more charisma than William Goldman did (even though he was way better), but he does a terrible job of telling a story and really does not add anything new to the series. This isn the most disappointing book that I have read in a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I heard it's a pretty good book but I had to take it off of my shelf because it didn't match my tastes and expectations. What I was not expecting was that the book was not enjoyable at all. There are many similarities to other books I have read, but it has so much less to it. If it was a story with an interesting twist that would keep me reading then I may have liked it but this is a very predictable plot line with a boring hero and an unlikable heroines that makes the book feel empty and fake. It's not even a good book for the genre because it is so far away from being what it is meant to be. I found this book to be the complete opposite of the book it is based on, so I have wasted 3 hours of my time. I would only recommend this book if you have some interest in science fiction or fantasy and you are looking for a different type of book then this.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst thing about this book is the bad writing. I would call it incoherent and poorly organized. The first half of the book is about the characters trying to understand what is going on in the world. When a group of people, called The Black Orcs (or the Orcs as they are called here), decide to destroy a whole village for the sake of their god, the characters are confused and do not believe in the idea of a god. This is important as a new religion, called "The Children Of The Sun" (as the character called them, a name that would later be changed in the final draft to The Sun Empire), is born. This was the first thing I noticed about this story when I read the first three chapters. The Orcs and the Children of the Sun are completely separate characters that are never introduced in the same sentence. So what I was hoping to find is a more traditional fantasy story with a religious concept that would draw the story into the world the characters live in. The plot is much more interesting and engaging than I expected it to be and I think that I was a bit disappointed with this book because I thought the story would take a darker tone. The Children Of the Sun seem more like a good story to me and this may be because of my lack of experience with fantasy books. The children and the Orks are both presented in a very entertaining manner. I was also surprised by the fact that the Ork leaders are not only human (as is expected) but intelligent as well. Even the villains are given their own personality and it is hard not to like most of the characters. The ending of the story is probably the best part of the whole story because of the way it ends. Overall this book was not the best but it was a great story and I enjoyed it very much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In other reviews I have read the author was so angry that the author wrote a negative book review because the book was bad she even wrote the book and did not give the book to me for free so she could get a refund for her book she bought off amazon  So she could write the book review on amazon because the author bought the book for her to write a negative negative review of and then she get a free book with no risk for her. I think her review is so unfair and just plain rude and unprofessional but that is just my opinion. She even has a lot of negative reviews on amAZON so if this is what she is like i would not recommend her books to anyone.  If you really liked this book and thought it was worth the wait just don't bother contacting the author to do anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book had a plot that did not make sense for the main characters, and then you had to work to understand it, and at some point, you just gave up. The author seems to be telling you the story of a woman named Laura who is living with her brother and a younger brother and father, who she is in a relationship with, that they were born to a good life, and that her father was a great man who gave them everything they wanted. But, when Laura became sick with cancer, she was not even able to visit her family for five years. That's why her brother is getting so excited about meeting Laura. That doesn't make any sense. When she was around, the kids were happy and loved to play and they were good to her, and now, all of that is gone. And she's just stuck with a brother who is a lot older than she is, and who seems to have no future with her. It wasn't very interesting. This book just didn't have any good parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________, or (I don't know, it really doesn't matter!)   A/N: I have the feeling that these are going to be some of the most popular fanfiction stories, so I'm going to try to keep it somewhat PG-13. I'm sorry if there are a couple of naughty words, or anything that's inappropriate for young minds. But as for the actual story itself... well, it's just a good story, and it's one I really enjoy writing.

It was the first time I'd heard the word "Lord". My mother, who'd just recently given birth to me, had been trying to figure it out for months, but her mind was simply not made up yet. It didn't help that she was an elderly woman, and was so worried about Harry that she hadn't even looked into the man's eye since birth. She'd been adamant that she never even thought of him as "my son", and was even more adamant that he not even think of his mother as his mother. I don andt think that there were a number of people who would agree with that position, but my mother did. As for me, I had no idea what I was supposed to do with the knowledge that I would be a Lord for the rest of my life. My life was too chaotic, and I was too young to make a decision that would set off the chain reaction that would lead to my downfall and ultimate demise.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a bit of a disappointment. It was supposed to be about the aftermath of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Instead, it focused on the investigation that went on after the fact. I found it frustrating that the author had to constantly remind us that what he is saying is just a story. He tries to make us think that a fictional story about a fictional man, who is fictional, would have made a better story than a non-fiction account of the real events. That's why I don't recommend it unless you really like conspiracy theories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  No stars for this book. I was hoping to read a good book that I could relate to and so far I am not seeing that in this book at all. This book has a huge problem: it's so vague in places that I am lost in the story. I'm reading it in the dark and the story is so unclear. I do think that it may be possible to understand the story (I read in book club this summer so there's no excuse not to know the basic story) but if the story was as great as it seems (and the book tells us that it is) it would be worth the effort to read it in front of a litlle light and be a better reader for it. I will still try to read the sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a very short book. The last 5 pages just didn't make sense for me.  And I really don't want to be too negative about it, I read this for fun.   But this book was the worst I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I read this book a couple weeks ago and it was nothing like I imagined it would be. The protagonist is a woman who gets lost in a park and falls in love with a boy. I loved the character's story and I loved that it was set in a fictional town. The story itself was not bad, but I was never really invested in the plot because the plot was boring to read. The plot is too generic and does not really make the reader believe that it is a story set in the world of fiction. If you like reading about the real life events, you should not give this book another chance. I really enjoyed it, and I think the premise was not completely unrealistic. I just wish the characters had more to them. The narrator was annoying too. The narration sounded almost as if the author was speaking to herself. I found it funny too, when she said "I felt like it was time for me to stop and start again" when the boy and her had been talking for a while.   There are some bad reviews out there and they might not be fair. I have seen people say that the book is depressing, but that is not the case. The book is not going to make you feel bad, even if you know there is no happy ending. My daughter actually had the same thought when I gave her the book for her to read as well. She said to me that the story was actually really touching, and that it would make her cry. I could not agree more with my daughter and she thought this book was very beautiful. I wish I could find a copy of the book so that I can give it to her, but at the moment I cannot. The good part is that she did have a lot of fun reading it. This book will certainly have a long life in my library. It might even be the book that I give my grandchildren to read before they get their own books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:.............................. I bought this book thinking it was a good read. After reading the first half I was like....hmm....this book doesn't have anything going for it. At all. I was really looking forward to this book. So I took it to my local library to read. They gave me the back cover and i couldnt wait to flip through the front cover because this book has a great cover. When I read through the first chapter I was not a happy camper. There was so many things i could say about this book but i won't. I got this book to review it anyway. If you like romance this book is a must read. There is romance in this book and its not that bad of a thing. Its okay. There are not that many people in this story so thats good. The story is okay and the characters are pretty well written. I am just not really into the romance so I can't really comment on that. It was all fine but it was very bland and didn't really get into my interest at all. There were some cute scenes but they were very, very few and far between. The whole story is just bad. So all in all I am not that interested in this. It just didn't do it for me. It had it's moments but it's overall just a boring and meh story. I really would have loved to have seen a different kind of story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________. ______________. ______________________.  3 out of 5 stars Jennifer I've been reading this series for years and it's a great series with lots of great stories. The author did a great job at making the characters really human, not just the stereotypes. But the writing was lacking and had no emotional or emotional power. In the fourth book ( The Blood Ties of House Ravenclaw ) there was an attempt to take place in one of my favorite Hogwarts houses - Slytherin. It made no sense to me and it just didn't fit with the rest of the series. I would have expected the other houses to have made appearances but Slytherins were basically ignored. In fact, I found this book a little annoying. When I thought of Slytherinity I was thinking about how the pure-bloods were a little bit too arrogant, egotistical and arrogant and how they would not hesitate to destroy anyone who is different from them. But when it came time for a "evil" character to make an appearance (the Gryffindor House, who is now the Slytherinc. House of "Hate"), I felt sorry for the Hufflepuffs who were basically the Slyths' opposite - too "wimpy" and cowardly. Well, I hope this series ends and that I get to read a book or two where I can finally understand what Slytherims are really like. 3out of 5 star Jennifer The Harry Potter series is one of the best fantasy books ever written. The plot is amazing. The characters are amazing. There are many exciting adventures and some really good scenes of drama. And it has magic... Yes, magical... Yes the story is fantastic and I have loved every book in it. The first book in the series is the best. The series is great, but the fourth is an abomination that ruined everything. This book ruined everything, it's the worst thing I have ever read in my life. I loved the characters, they are all well developed and they all have their own unique personalities, there is nothing in this book that made me not enjoy reading it. I think it has taken the author too long to write this book, that's what I think, the author could have finished it before the final book and the end of the books would not have hurt it one bit. This is a book with a complete lack of emotion in it's writing. It is written as if
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book took a while to get to me, I had forgotten it existed, I really wanted to read it, then I finally got it, and it was not all that I expected it to be. It seemed to me that the writing was not quite as good as I had remembered, I just found myself going back to it again and again for more info on the characters. The story was interesting, I don't know why they didn't just write a novel with a short and sweet introduction, I think the introduction of the characters is a part of this book and if you don't read that first you might not understand how everything works. I'm not even sure if that is a spoiler, just a bit of information I found interesting.   Overall: 4/10

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________   I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. E, but this book does NOT live up to its hype. In fact, it falls far short of expectations.   The premise of the book is so intriguing and captivating that it could only be a success. Unfortunately, the book's execution is so lackluster that it was hard to care about the premise. For example:   "The last days of this world will be like the last days on Earth, as it will be torn asunder by a war between the living and the dead. It will be a battle between life and death, life and destruction, and it will not be the last time the two will clash.  , with the title and all its accompanying imagery, is a very cool and intriguing book. But the execution is a little less than perfect, and the premise is one of those where you might wonder if the author had read any of the numerous other novels which have taken place during the last thousand years, such as the book Lord of the Flies, the movie 2001, the TV show The X-Files, and so on."   Yes, it's a great premise and a great idea for a novel, but it needs to be executed in a way which would make the reader want to keep reading.   the story begins in a near future, in which the Earth has become completely uninhabitable to both human beings and their intelligent animal companions. The world is a completely barren wasteland devoid of any life or light and devoid of anything that looks remotely like modern technology, from cars to televisions. And then you have a group of surviving humans, which includes a group called "The Travelers," who have discovered a way to harness the power of the sun and use it as a power source.  "The Traveler's Power" is a name that will be familiar to anyone who has ever seen a summer movie, and I'm not just talking about the "it's a small world" kind of thing, but the kind where the sun's power is used as a source of power, like when the sun is shining at full strength. In this story, it is used to recharge the solar cells of our solar powered devices. This invention works because it harnesses the power generated by the sun for us to use, and not just for us. In order to make sure that this works, the Travelers also have to send out teams of people called "Bots," who go
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and I didn't enjoy it at all. I was really looking forward to it but it just didn't happen for me. The story wasn't anything spectacular but it wasn't bad either. I know it's just one author and this is the author's first novel but I wish he would have written a different novel for me to read. I'm just really disappointed in this book. The ending is so bad I think it's really bad. The last half of the book seemed to be the most interesting part to me but the ending sucked so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a pretty horrible book for me. I have not read any science fiction before, but this book had so much wrong with it. First of all, there was no way in hell the author could have done any research into the history of the earth. In reality, there is no way the earth can survive being hit by an asteroid. Secondly, there are too many things wrong about the asteroid that he uses to explain it. He says it hit the moon, when the moon was on the other side of the planet. There are also discrepancies between his book and real science. He claims that the meteor hit the surface of the moon and the rocks hit the back of the mountain in Arizona, and there were also reports that there were fires. However, there were no fires reported at the site of the meteor. It would have been hot enough to melt the rocks and cause massive fires. No reports have been made of that happening. In addition, it was only a small meteor that hit the ground. If it had been larger, it could have caused quite a bit of damage to the ground, and it could also have caused some pretty major damage to a city.  4 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will probably never read any of this book, unless it's an excerpt from a much better book or the book is reprinted as a Kindle edition or something. I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this book. This is one of the worst writing I've ever seen. It's so stupid that it's not funny, so in that sense it's a good book. I will probably not keep it around.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. Not only does it take a very long time to read, it makes me sick to my stomach. I have always been a fan of paranormal stories, but never thought this could happen to me. I did not like the premise of this book, and it did not end well. I would not recommend this to anyone, and would not purchase it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I bought this to study for my AP Computer Science classes, and I was so excited to get it. It's one of my favorite reading apps, but it's just a horrible experience. The entire reading experience is unreadable and hard to follow, there are so many typos and a bunch of errors. I've tried reading the last couple of chapters of the book with this app, but the story doesn't really change much and the audio is just awful. I'm pretty sure I could have bought the book at the store and just paid less and saved myself so much time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ I was disappointed by this book. It has the word "cuss" in the title. I found the characters to be pretty well developed, but their problems did not seem to be as interesting as some of the other books I have read about this type of crime. I would prefer to read more crime books, as they seem to me to be more fun, and more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was a waste of time and money. The author did little to establish his or her character, and did not add to his or hers writing. I did not understand why I felt so bored by the book. It was not enjoyable at all, and I was so disappointed. I'm not sure why you would want to read this book. 6/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought the book and have been reading it, however I have read many books with a good story line but poor story telling that is boring to the reader. This story was not only boring but was poorly written.  I will never give this book another time and I did not waste my time. The ending was really dumb.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   One thing I'd like to see in a sequel to the first book: a chance to see the whole of the situation from other people's POVs.   The characters seemed a little one-note, but in a good way. There's a lot of plot that can be told from just their POV, but the characters feel like they were written with care, not a single one is over-the-top, and the whole is definitely a whole.  I enjoyed the story.   is a novel that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good story. It had a lot to keep me interested throughout and it kept me reading. I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes a good, gritty, gritty fantasy novel.   with a score of  One thought I had while reading this book was "I could use a few more of those in my life right about now".   I didn't really mind this book all that much, although I had a couple moments where I wanted to skip over some parts because it felt a little rushed. I am a huge fan of the first one, but I've got to admit, I had some issues with the second book.  , despite the fact that she was a female lead, had no redeeming qualities, and was barely as intelligent as the other characters in the book, still managed to be a bit disappointing. She is still a nice, likable character, but her story never seemed that interesting to me, I didn't find her a strong female lead in this book, and while she is one of the few women in this series that's actually shown to be intelligent, she wasn't shown to have that much character development. This book's biggest problem isn't that it didn't work, it's that it seemed to be an attempt to do what George RR Martin hasn't been able to do with his female characters so far (in my opinion) which is make them a little more complex and interesting. I'm not sure if this was the author's intention, but it was certainly the result, as I didn a lot more with her. But it still left me with more questions than answers about her character and the events that happen in this novel, so while it was a good book, it just didn't live up to my high expectations for this book and I can't recommend it to those looking for one of Martin's female characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will not ever read another book by this author. His prose is so ugly, his stories are so pointless and his characters are so bland. My only positive is that I can't imagine anything interesting about him except that he's the first English writer I've encountered who can make me think of the American writer Flannery O'Connor. I read his first novel, The Wind in the Willows, in the 90's. It was dreadful. I didn't give it a second look until I read this book. Not only did the prose seem to have improved, but the characters in The Wind In The Willows seem to be more like real people than the ones in the book, and their interactions are more natural and believable. The plot is rather dull too. I can imagine someone writing an original and entertaining story about a group of villagers who have been locked up in their village for no reason at all. The wind in the willows has a similar premise. The problem is that the plot seems to be an afterthought, not the main feature of the book. The characters seem to lack any depth, motivation, or background. There seems to only be one character (and he's really nothing but a background plot device) and his job is to be a sidekick who is nothing more than a plot device.      7 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book before reading the first of Jodi Picoult's series, 'The Good Book'. I was expecting a bad story and bad writing. I am very happy to say that I was disappointed. The author writes in a manner reminiscent of a first person narrative and the language is very thick. I found myself bored and frustrated. I know it's the way I've been conditioned to read, but I'm looking forward to 'The Bad Book' - hopefully I won't have as much trouble with this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not get very far in this book. At first, I was intrigued. However, I couldn't get past the fact that it was just another boring nonfiction book on the same topic. What was wrong with that? As I kept going through the book, I began to see more and more holes in its arguments. I was able to find only one flaw: the lack of a bibliography. To be honest, if the book was just a collection of random quotations and quotes from other books, I probably would have taken it in stride, but it was supposed to be a serious work. I hope it can be improved to make it more interesting. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is interested in reading some history, but does not want to read the same book over and over again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this book. This book did not live up to the hype. It was not worth the money I paid for it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm currently reading, "Masters of the Universe", by the great Ray Bradbury.  While I love his other works, including the Bradbury series (and, yes, I do, as evidenced by my recent post on this series, "Bradbury's 'Eerie'") "Mmasters" was supposed to be his final novel.  It came out in 1976, just a year after his death.  I found it in the same year at an obscure comic book shop.  At that time, I was quite young, but had seen and heard enough to know that Ray Bradberly was a great artist.  When I saw the cover art of "Mmaster", it was obvious that I had to buy it.  The cover of the book is an interesting illustration that shows a starfield, with a giant red planet in the center, a huge, rocky moon orbiting it, and the "M" as seen in the previous illustration.  I've read this one in three different editions, and it is pretty much the same cover as the first edition.  They have been printing a new edition every year for several years, so the current one is "retailer exclusive", but the earlier editions are still available.  This one is also pretty much all of the stories published from 1963 to 1976.  There are two issues of "Hazen the Cat" published from that time period, and I'll post them soon.  In "M Masters", Bradbury wrote about a group of astronauts who travel through space to a planet where there is another life form (a dinosaur?) that they explore.  "Sisters", which was originally a story I read in the early 1970's, is a story I've always remembered fondly from my youth.  Other stories from that era that I think I'll include below are "The Martian Chronicles", "The Mummy", "And the Sea Began to Flow", "Hiro", "Worms", "G.I. Joes", "Moonshine", "Shadows", "Lonesome Dove", "Boys and Girls of the Atomic Age", and "An Encounter with Mars". The other stories are "Mister Smith Goes to War", "Sleeping Beauty", "Bartleby the Scrivener", "Robinson Crusoe", "It's a Mad, Mad, MAD, Mad
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   "A little more history would be useful. My review is for the non-fiction portion of the book."   My rating is based on my general knowledge of the story. I am familiar with some of the sources the book is based off of, but not the other sources and sources for the rest of the information. I will not be able to review the other portions of the text without knowing more about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It is soooo boring, I have not read a book in awhile that doesn't have the same boring plot. But it still has a lot of funny lines and characters to keep you entertained."   What's that? You haven't read it? Well you may want to. It's got the same old "plot" every other "funny" book has.  I'll skip that part.  and   The thing is, I just couldn't stop reading the book. In fact, I wanted to finish it right away. This was not my first encounter with the "Dork Memoirs". I'd read them a couple of times before and they never really bothered me but I couldn't let them go by. I had to find out more about them and this time, in a couple months time, I was going to go read them all over again. So why am I writing a review now?   It's a book about two kids. They're just really smart and very funny. The book is about what you might expect from the authors: a child with special gifts, some troubles and a lot more than meets the eye.  the first time I read this I thought, "This is what a normal kid would do".   Then it hit me. There are all sorts of hidden meanings to this book.   Here's a quote from the book:  "So I looked up on Google and found out that we are the first-ever children to have created the internet. We are the ones who brought a global village to the world."  and: . "It is no exaggeration to say that the internet has given our children access to knowledge that they would have never had in their own homes."    That's pretty clear isn't it? When my friends and I read the first couple of chapters, we knew this book was a lot deeper than it seemed.   on the other hand, the author really was just writing about her kids. She wanted to see if any of this could be put to good use. There is some good stuff, but the book isn't very entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The book is not a work of fiction. It is a work based on fiction. I wish I had bought a copy at the time it came out. The author's version of events was not believable." I disagree and I've made my case. "I didn't understand the point he was trying to make. He seemed to want to make me feel that I should not worry about my safety in the future. It felt like he was telling me to 'toughen up'." If someone has to suffer through a book like this and it has this many negative reviews (which you'll see that many people don't) why would you read another one? If you're a fan of the author it seems you'd want to get off the shelf and take the book out of your collection. You'd have read this one for a long time and would not want to put yourself through the same experience again. 4/10 I think there are lots of good things to say about this book. I do wonder if the author was trying too hard to make the reader believe in his world. It feels like it could have been very, very different. If I were making a list of books I would not recommend, this would be on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   This book is terrible.   Not a bad review, I mean...I would give it a 3.5 rating if it were not for the fact that this is a review of an eBook. This book is really a novel. I'm sure I will never read the book in its entirety. It's been available as an eBook on Kindle, as a PDF and I'm fairly certain I have it lying around somewhere. There are several plotlines, many characters, many viewpoints and many characters who say things that I wish I could tell them.  -This book could have been made better if the author was more clear in his explanation of how he went about creating the characters and creating the world.   is the only way I can get past the awfulness.   a story about a child who is a genius. it was never a spoiler to any of my friends that I was reading it. It also had me entertained to no end. I hope the next book will be better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book was a waste of time, and I wasted too much of my time in it. I went back to the beginning of my books to do research for the book, and as soon as I finished the last chapter, I was just tired of reading. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Gulliver, and while I agree with the basic premise of the book (that it is a book of fairy tales), this book is so boring, it made me laugh, cry, and think, and that's just the first half of the story!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* If I had read this book in high school I would have never learned about the Holocaust. ***** The book was too long for my kids to get through. The book does not tell you everything in detail. I didn't understand much of what happened to the Jews during the war and the Holocaust at all. The author is trying to make this look as terrible as possible. The ending was too much for my children to handle and I don't think it was an option to finish the book. I will not be buying this book for my little ones again! *****  17 of 18 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- [This book is] not for beginners. I'm a non-programmer and I would never try to write programs in this language. It's confusing, and it's not intuitive. It doesn't have the elegance of a language like Python. It has a very "real world" feel to it. It just feels like programming, even if you never want to program in real life. This book is not for everyone. ----------------------------------- I did the exercises on this book from the beginning and now I am completely lost with this language, so don't buy it unless you already know how to do it. --------------------------------- The most interesting feature of this book is that it has a step-by-step guide. You can just read it without worrying about the syntax or understanding the syntax. However, once you get to the language-level, things start getting more complicated. ---------------------------------- Overall, this book was good for learning a new language. Unfortunately, it can be a lot harder to do so if you have previous experience with programming. However this is an excellent beginner's book. If you want a really good book on how to program, I would suggest you to read "C Programming in C" and "The C Programming Language." It will give you a good foundation and you will be able to create a simple program in this programming language. -----------------------------------------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is horrible.  It was very clear that I had not read any of the other books in this series.  This is the only thing I can say that I have any real negative to say about this book.   I was hoping for more character development than what I got.  A few characters just disappear for no reason or just fall out of character.  The setting seems so much older than the times that are described in the book. So if you are looking for something to keep you entertained while waiting for a book that will not be as good as the other series that is currently on the market then go for this.  I hope that the next book is better. I am not sure why you would pay so much money to be in another series for something that is not as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** I bought this book on a whim thinking it would be good because it has lots of examples of how to use the language and examples of bad English I've seen in other books. It also includes the English version of the book so I know what I'm reading. It is sooooo bad. It has nothing to do with bad grammar or bad spelling. The grammar is correct, but the grammar is so bad that you'd never use it in real life and I can guarantee you, no one would ever use it as their first language. The bad grammar is just so random. I was looking for a quick way to learn a new language so I can read and learn it as well as the examples it provides. I am really disappointed in this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really thought the first half of this book was just awful. The main character seems so boring, and I thought he was supposed to be a teenager. He was so boring that I thought "maybe I am not supposed to like him, because he is just a boring teenager." I was not wrong. The first 50-60 pages were all about his parents' fight over his homework. I'm not sure how to describe it but basically the author just tried to use the character as a plot device so that he could have another kid to write about, even though he does that in almost every book. It was awful. Also, I read the book and I was very disappointed. It had a plot so convoluted that it almost made me hate the author. I couldn't understand why he was writing such a complicated story, even if he knew it was important. I thought his writing was terrible, as well. There were times when I didn't know whether or not it was a true fact, or if it was just his opinion. It seemed like he was just making things up to add drama to the book, which really bothered me. I hated this book, but I loved it more than any other book I have ever read. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone, because it is one of the most amazing books I have read!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I read this book because I wanted to hear a story about a mother that would make me cry, and this book is a beautiful story that made me cry. It is a long, complicated story about the end of a family, and there are many things to love in it, and some things to hate. One thing to hate is the fact that the mother was left with a child who she had not known for a long time. There were things in the story that are true and a little sad, but the author is wonderful and I enjoyed it. I am giving this book 4 stars because of the story. I will finish this book after I read the next one. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to cry. I think my husband will enjoy it.

I'm not even talking about the writing, it really isn't very good, it has some great ideas, but it just takes a while to get anywhere. It just takes too long for the characters to figure things out and it becomes boring and repetitive. I hope the sequel isn't just a repeat of this book, I just don't understand how this happened to get so bad.   Overall, I don't think I'm interested in this author anymore, I got what I paid for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so boring it's horrible. It doesn't have any story. It's like someone put a lot of information on the Internet and they tried to say "This is how things are done." This is an extremely poor book that I would never read again. It really doesn't matter if the writer is in the Navy or the FBI. It was made by an average high school student trying to be a professional writer. The author is very ignorant of the Navy. It seems like the author doesn't even know what a computer is, it's so stupid. All the information is so confusing and you could read more than the entire book by just clicking on the links and reading the first pages. There is not a lot there to know and that is the problem with this book. I had to read it through 3 times to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This is a horrible book. It is very boring and has the same old story. In my opinion, this author should not have gotten this book in the first place. The writing is atrocious and the plot does not work at all. I wish I had never given this book to my kids. *****   The book was supposed to be about a very brave lady who rescues some poor little girl that was kidnapped by a man and is taken to a house where she meets a man that helps her, and a little boy and girl that are also kidnapped. It's like I went to a movie and was asked to tell a good plot of the movie. I can't even begin to describe how boring the story was. The little boy was basically an asshole for most of the story and I hate to say this but I was so bored by the guy that didn't do anything to save the little girl I would have given up on the story.   It's not like this little girl didn't have a chance, she was saved by the brave lady but he was such an asshole. The girl was not allowed to talk because he thought she would get mad or something. He kept her in the house all day and didn't help her to find her parents or help her escape from the man who was kidnapping her. The man was a bully, that was all I could think of.   the girl doesn't escape because her mother told her not to and there was nothing she could do. Her mom wasn't at the house to help her either. The guy is a jerk, and he was the only one that would help.   for the most part I don't like kids books. I think it's kind of a waste of time if they're just going to make the kids read about whatever. I read books like this about ten years ago. Kids get into stuff like this because the stories are so boring. I've always wanted to read a kid book about a brave little girl. This one just wasn't it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------It is a great book. It is a good book. The ending is very dramatic, but it is not what you want.I have been reading books by others for years and I would not buy another book by them. It does not matter how well written they are, or how well they have been edited, or whether or not they are an expert. I will not read anything by another author who does not have that experience. I hope someone comes out with a book that does not fall into this category. It was very disappointing and I will be looking for another book soon.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I will say that it was hard for me to get the first book as it came out last month, I thought it was going to be a bad series but I have to say that the first three books are great. These guys are really good writers, and there is a lot of good stuff in them. I'm not the biggest fan of space opera, but I've really got to like this one. I'll start with the first: The Farthest Shore. I was in the market for a sci fi fantasy and this book was a good one, a good beginning to a series. The story is about a space station, with the main character being a woman who is tasked with getting supplies to a planet that is far off and can't be reached by normal means. She meets a bunch of space outcasts that she rescues and eventually has to take on a ship of space pirates to get home. The book was exciting but there was some confusion with the characters that were introduced, but overall I was really excited for the book. The next book is The Fall of Light, this one has more action and is actually about a girl who is stranded on a planet after a ship she was on was lost. This book is good and has more of a sci-fi/fantasy vibe, but isn't quite as exciting as the first. The last book is Dark Shadows. This one is about four people who are caught up in an evil entity in an abandoned hospital, which is now a ghost town. The characters aren't bad, and I liked their motivations, but this is a pretty low point for the series. I can't really blame the writers for this, because the book just didn't seem very well done, but it didn't have that wow factor of the first two books. So I give the series an average of 3 out of 4 and would recommend it if you want to have a good, exciting sci- fi book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The writing is terrible. It's so bad I almost feel sorry for the writer because she has no idea how to write a book. The characters are stupid, the plot is nonsensical, the story is not exciting at all and, most of all, I just do not care enough about the characters, the characters are just there for the money and for the readers to hate them! "   If you want a great adventure or an adventure that is not your average fantasy adventure then I suggest you not read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " I love the art! I LOVE it! And the story is... well, not a bad story but doesn't stand out much. " " This was a book I was really looking forward to. I've never read a work of fantasy before and I love fantasy so this is my first. But this book is just a lot of the same stories and characters from many other books and it's not so good. I don't think it was well written and I wouldn't recommend it. The characters... and I really mean characters are a little bit annoying at times. One of the main character is annoying because she talks to herself the whole time. (it doesn't even make sense) Her relationship with her boyfriend is one of the worst and it felt so forced." "I enjoyed the book a lot. I especially liked the characters and their personalities. The story was quite a pleasant surprise that I could enjoy. It wasn't the type of book I would read again, but I think I'd be interested in reading the next one from the author." Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone, even if they love fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing to do with how I view this or anything else for that matter. This is an old book by a well known author and that is about it.   It's just a poor old book that I wouldn't recommend at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not so much disappointed as I'm disappointed in the writer. He's so talented and has the ability to put together such a story.  The only flaw is that he was able to fit into the genre that he chose but wasn't able to develop that story to the point where I didn't get bored. I guess in order for something to be great you have to be able to do it in different genres and do it to perfection. I didn't love it, but there were some great moments. The book ended abruptly. I'm looking forward to the next book by the same author but this time I might not be so impressed because I feel that he didn't have enough to work with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................" The book is NOT a good read, this was NOT the book for me." I have been waiting for something to be like this for a while. I have to admit this is a good book for an adult, I really liked the romance and the fact that there were some mature themes, it was well written, but there were parts where the sex just took over and made the story not worth the read. The story really went nowhere, and it was really strange how many details were left out, which I think they should have explained in a little more detail as a couple of the girls had very similar situations to me. I'm not looking for a book with an 18+ rating, but I guess if this was for a younger audience this would be fine, but for anyone who loves a good romance I'm really sorry to say this is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________ This was a terrible book. It felt like someone had to write a story about the story of the book and forgot that the book itself is really really stupid. It is based on a series of books that I think were a collection of short stories. I don't think you can get a deeper sense of any characters that are in the book from the first to last book. The narrator is so annoying. I loved the first half of the novel but by the time I got to the last 2 or 3 I thought she was a total asshole. There was no reason that I should care about anything that she wrote in that book. And to think she was so interested in writing a story that is about a character that is supposed to be the hero of the story. And that character was a really annoying jerk! I would not recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think that the authors of this book have a hard time making up their minds about what the message is. Some chapters I am sure are supposed to be about what Jesus was trying to get people to believe, and I know it sounds like a very long winded introduction for a book. But, then, the next chapter says the opposite. But other chapters seem to be trying to put in words what a person could mean by the phrase "the kingdom of God." The author never really settles on any message. The chapter on the first man was just the author talking at his own self, without any real effort to be clear about what he meant.  In the chapter on faith, he comes off as a man who thinks he knows what faith is, when the point of the chapter was that he really did not. The author is just talking to himself. He doesn't seem to know anything about the Bible.  He doesn's understand it enough to know that there is no proof for miracles, and he is trying to show us the way to Jesus and the Bible, but he is really not talking about what you are supposed, or even a person should think to do when trying to think about what this word means. In the book on marriage and divorce, the author is trying very hard to be a man about things, when he is just making things up as he goes along. It's like he knows that God doesn't say one thing and then it doesn't mean that it must be followed, but that it is one of many things and that God does not always do what it says. He says that if you are a "good" person then you should never divorce your wife, but the book is full of things that seem to imply that it's a good thing to get divorced.  I'm not trying to say that this book is an unmitigated disaster, but I think it is important to know the basic ideas before jumping on a bandwagon and thinking you're going to get some good advice. It would be a good idea to look at some of the major points in the book, to get a little bit of background about what's going on. I don't think it would take much, but you never know.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! Please, please, PLEASE, please get another copy of this book and read it before buying or recommending it to someone else! I'm so disappointed. I've read all of the previous volumes, I know the rules for this book, I don't know how you could write a book so poorly that you lose all the great points you had at the beginning, or where it was going, or even that there was any plot whatsoever. It seems you decided to just throw out everything that was good about this story and the original books in the series. Why waste your time writing a book when you don't care about the story at all, except in the most superficial way? I'm a huge fan of J.K. Rowling's work and this book has nothing to do with her or her work, and I've been so invested in the story and characters for four books I didn't care if the author had decided he wanted to throw out all that was left. I was so excited to get into this one and read the next volume as we did in the first four, but I couldn't have been happier when I finally got the book... I was sad when it ended because I had been so attached to this book all along and now it was ruined. I am really upset about the whole thing. This was a great series and I'm really sad to see it go. I want to see this story continue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................. I don't read enough books so I decided to pick up this book. I was looking for a book that I could read while doing other things. I got this on a recommendation from a friend of mine, but I have never heard of this author before. The book is actually a good one. I liked the concept, but it seems like the author is a bit inexperienced. There were a lot of typos in the book, and there were some grammatical errors. The story also felt a little rushed at points. But overall this is a good story and I will probably read the rest of the series.   Overall rating:...............................................2 1/2 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book is a nightmare to read. The writing is so sloppily written that it is a real pleasure to see the characters' faces when they realize the terrible writing of the author. The first three chapters are so confusing as to why the character does what he does, the last third is a mess that makes you go WTF! The ending was also confusing, but that's not my problem. I just think the book is so poorly written that I can't take much out of it. *****
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________  "This is the worst book I have ever read. There is nothing new, and the characters and plot are not very interesting. This book has no redeeming qualities at all."  __________________________________________________  _____________________________________________________________________________  A review by a customer:  I loved the book, but the author was not very imaginative. It was basically a story of a young man who is trying to find his way, with a little help from a local wise man. I thought the way the author described the wise man was really interesting. But he had no impact on the plot, and didn't do anything special to bring out the plot. But the story is interesting enough.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Outstanding book I loved this book so much. It has a realistic tone. It's a quick read, and it tells a great story. . : A great read and an exciting story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** *********** This was the most tedious, overlong, and boring book I have ever read. The writing style is really bad. This is not an easy read and is certainly not a good one. It took me a while to find out that the two main characters are two completely opposite types. This makes sense as the story is told in different perspectives and is not really that "chronological". However, because of the two different perspectives, it was very hard to relate to the characters and really felt like a book written by two different authors. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a story to read for a long time, but not a very good one to read. ****** ************
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** I read this book back in 2013. ************** I loved it. ***************** I had read this on my Kindle (which is amazing!) and I also picked it up in hardcover. The story is brilliant and it was a fantastic read. I was very frustrated with my lack of response. I feel like I've done my part to get the book. ********* I was really disappointed. ****** I was so excited to get this book. I read a few reviews but I kept hearing that people have had problems with this book and how many people have given up on the book, etc. I don't know why the author would put this on so I decided to try to re-read it, and I really liked this time around. I'm going to reread the book because it sounds like I read it before, but I don\'t want to do it too late in the day. I hate the author of this book, the story is so bad, and the book could be so much better. __________________________________________________________________________________  My Thoughts on the Book "I loved the premise of this story. The idea that all of life is a game with rules and an ultimate prize is so unique. In the world of Dune, it was the spice that brought them all together to compete for the final spice. It was an interesting concept that I liked. I thought the characters were interesting and the world that was introduced in the novel was really well developed. I just don't get the point of the spice. There was nothing in it. There is a lot of talk about the desert. The world is described as a land of sand. There are sandstorms. There aren't many people. People have the ability to travel through time and space. The food is great. I would've liked to see more of the Dune book. It did a decent job for me but I want to read it all again. I think if there was more to the book it would make it a really good book."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, and if it could have just been published in the 70s, instead of in the 21st century, it would have been perfect. I liked how this story told how the young man, Henry, learned about the world, and the power he could have had as an artist, but it had some problems. In the beginning the story was written really nicely and it was exciting, but in the end, I felt that it wasn't as good as the beginning. The ending was weak and I didn't get the answers that I wanted, and it felt like it wasn, well, let's call it like it was. I'll give the writer the benefit of the doubt, because this is a book, but still.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. _______________   No, this is the first book I've ever actually read. I'm a sucker for self-help. I've read a ton of self-improvement books, and there are a lot of them. But I've never read any that I'd consider "bad". If a book is truly awful, I'll still read it, but I'm not going to buy it, at least for the purposes of this review. I mean, I've only read a couple of those.   I liked this book. It was entertaining and interesting. It wasn't bad. It didn't have anything wrong with it. I gave it 5 stars because it was good. A little boring. It left me wanting more, though.   the first time I read this, I wanted to read it again to see if what I had read was true. I just didn't get it. And I was hoping that maybe after reading it twice, I would get it, and I was sorely disappointed.  , I got it from a friend, and even though I thought it was really bad, I read it because I liked the premise. But it wasn't even remotely close to the book I read when I was first learning to read. This one was so... bland, so uninspiring. And so... boring. I want to give it a 2.5 star rating, but... why? It was really just so bad I couldn't find any redeeming value to it at all. I guess my enjoyment of the premise wasn't enough to overcome the fact that I really did not want to re-read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I did love the story line and thought the plot was really good but the writing was poor at times and not what i expected from the author. She had a lot of fun writing and if you have read her other books then you know that is not a bad thing but in this story i found it really hard to get into and you get an idea of the plot and some action but not too much.Overall i would give this a 5 out of 5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was boring and did not make any sense. The entire time I kept thinking this was a movie script. There was no plot. It was all just action, and lots of it. This is what happens when you write about people and have them be action figures or something else that is not life.   Don't waste your time reading this book. Don't waste any more of your life. Go buy a cheap video game, or get in a fight with a bunch of other kids and kill all of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was pretty interesting, and I was really excited for a sequel. However, I was disappointed in this book, mainly because I have little interest in vampires and werewolves in general.   This book was interesting, but a little boring, and the story wasn't very compelling, even though I got a good idea what happened.   in fact, it was just like reading about a normal, everyday guy who was bitten by a werewolf (and that was a little strange). I am not very familiar with the mythology of vampires and/or werewolves. It is not necessary to know it, but the story is a little thin, and didn't add anything to the story.   was really interested in this story, even moreso than my friend's werewolf story. And, the story was really interesting, especially considering that the story focused on the normal guy.  - no werewolves, and no other supernatural events. It just wasn't that exciting or interesting.  .     So, to summarize my overall impression of the story, I would rate this book a 5.0, because I'm sure I would enjoy a sequel and this was a really good book.  The rating is based on the story quality and not the story genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This book just sucks! This book's main reason to exist is to try to teach people about the real world. The world is not like the fantasy world the author created. The book is terrible. If you're trying to learn how to live in the real World, you should buy other books and learn from them instead. I'm not saying it's a bad world, because it isn't. But you don't want to spend hours and hours in it because your life is bad. This book does not teach you how to solve problems. It doesn't teach you the things you need to know to solve a problem. Instead, it teaches you how your parents made you feel when you were a child. It teaches you what your parents expect you to do and what they expect you not to do. And it tells you how not to behave. When you're a parent, you expect your child to know exactly how to behave, to not do anything out of character. This is not what you are expected to do in this world. No parent should ever expect their child to behave like this. Not at all. It's terrible and the author knows it.The author tries to create an emotional connection to her characters and give them motivation, but the connections just go straight to her head. I had to take breaks from the book because I felt like the characters were saying things to me that they would NEVER say to anyone else. Like, if I asked a character "do you think ____ is handsome," the character would say "NO WAY!!!" and I would say, "But why? He's not in love with you?" No answer. I've never met anyone who has ever been in a relationship with someone like this person and could say "no way" and "I wouldn't do that." The author had me fooled from page one.The book is very boring. I know I would have loved to have seen more of that "real world" stuff, but that's not the author's fault, that's my problem. I'll be happy when I read the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book boring and frustrating and, ultimately, I felt it was a waste of time.   The protagonist, Daniel, is a middle schooler who is diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called Asperger's. He is a bit odd, a bit withdrawn, and at times quite a bit antisocial. He suffers from what the other kids at his school call "nerddom," a combination of boredom, lack of social skills, and inability to make friends. Daniel suffers from his inability to get along with other people but seems to suffer from all his "disabilities." He's a bit strange and he's got a different way of seeing the world and everything that goes on in it.  ... Daniel's parents are divorced but he's not exactly raised to "take it with a grain of salt." The book doesn't seem to say anything about his family life, so I'm not sure if it's a matter of his parents getting back together after a bitter divorce. But I have trouble believing that any parent who loves a child could just give up and move on. It's not as if Daniel's mother doesn't care about him (he has a really sweet, goofy side to him). It's just not clear how he'll handle the new situation. He seems to be quite a nice kid, though, so maybe he'll get over his "nerdy" ways. He's smart and he doesn't want to be anything but his best self.   (It's a common theme in books for Aspergers to "pass" as normal or even above-average, which is really frustrating for anyone with Aspergid.) It's very easy to see why Daniel is lonely and why he suffers in social situations. He lacks the confidence and social skills that other people, especially women, have. He doesn't understand why the people who treat him differently are so fascinated by his weirdness and his inability, or unwillingness, to fit in with them. (He has never been really good at reading body language and he tends to go off on crazy tangents and sometimes makes stupid decisions.)   Daniel is an extremely intelligent kid and, at least in my experience, this is a good thing. But in terms of actually getting along with people, he struggles. He has trouble understanding how others are trying to communicate with him. He talks over and gets frustrated with people who have not been very open with him, and it takes him some time
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ I started to read this book very very slowly because I was really curious and excited about the book and I wanted to see if it would be good and I would enjoy it and it was not. I can't say I really enjoyed it and I didn't like the way it was presented to me. It was written as if it were the first time I was reading something and I think it was because it was the last book I got in a series and I had so many questions in the back of my mind and I was thinking it was kind of boring. There were some great parts of the book but overall I think I hated the book, it was like a lot of the stories in a few other books. It didn't mean I wasn't interested in the other books, just that I wanted more. I have to say I'm really glad I waited for this book because I think the next book is a lot better than the one I had in my mind for so long and I'm hoping I'll be able to read all of them in the series.   1. Characterization is very very bad  This was my only complaint, but I do have an issue with character development. I don't know how to put it so I'll just say it like this. When they say "we were going to have a lot to discuss about you" it sounds like it's a big deal and that there are so many things they will talk about but then when I read it, they don't really talk about anything because the story is so simple.  , and then they say it again, and again and again, they aren't really making us think that this person is important, they're making us like them. It just made me feel stupid because you're telling us this person and then the story just ends. I was expecting something that would have been interesting like "You're the leader of this band" or something like that, but the writer just didn't do anything with her. They say they'll talk about her, and they really don't and I felt like it just wasn't interesting and not in a good way. So I guess the character isn't really developed and that's the only one I would say.   of all the characters they were the only ones I could really understand, but other than that they were just one note characters and nothing more. It wasn't like they had an impact or anything, they were nothing, they didn't really

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very good read. A good story to read and a great introduction to fantasy. However it's only around 3-4 stars for me because of the very low fantasy rating and the low rating of the characters. All 3 main characters are very similar to one another. Even the two that we don't know much about they do have similar personalities.  I was really hoping to have more of the story. I love a good story. But I can't really recommend this book to anybody who likes a good fantasy story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a fun read. What I got was a book full of confusing, pointless, and sometimes downright stupid characters. The main character is a woman. The book focuses on how she is struggling to figure out her feelings for the main male character. She doesn't realize she feels anything. She can't figure out what is wrong, but her emotions are so overwhelming that she's not able to process them. She is also trying to figure why the man she loves has suddenly decided he doesn't like her any more. It is really hard for a woman to figure that out and the author didn't help much with her. I don't know how to feel about the characters. I found it hard to get through this book at times because of the confusing story line and confusing characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This book had no merit. The characters were so unrealistic that it's hard to feel anything for the characters. It was not a good read. There were a couple of things I thought were good about the book, but not enough to save it from a DNR. It made me feel the worst about reading it. I couldn't enjoy reading this book and it's not for the faint of heart. It's also quite expensive. You should not waste your time with this book. ******   I wish I didn't feel this way. I've heard a few good things about the author, and I'm a huge fan of books, but even I can't get on board with the author's writing skills.   What really irritated me about this book is how it was written. It is so far away from reality it's embarrassing.  As a first person narrator, I felt like I was really in the character's head. His actions and dialogue are very bizarre to me. It makes me wonder what he thinks, and how he feels. I mean, how could a person so far removed from reality even know what a toilet is?  His dialogue is so bizarre that I felt a little uncomfortable reading this about a man who goes to an all women's university (not to mention the fact that he's a graduate student) that has so much information that he has to make it up to the woman he was sleeping with to be allowed to be with her anymore. That's pretty insane, I feel.  the only positive thing about this novel was the fact I really liked the narrator's narration, even if it was a bit off putting to me at times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first book on the market was a disappointment. I had no clue what was in it, I guess you could say, I had just been told, and I didn't know how to read, so, I read in a desperate attempt to find anything that sounded like something interesting. I was also quite sure I had been misled in some way. The book tells the story of a young girl who wants to know what it is like to be a boy. After all, she is a female. It starts out promising, but as soon as the girl and her mother realize that the girl is female, the book devolves into a tedious, sexist, misogynistic, and anti-male polemic. The "boy" character is constantly being called "dude" (a word which, like "doll," has its own set of connotations that are as varied as any gender and sexuality), he is told he has no rights, he is beaten for failing to comply, he goes through puberty in a place where the female population is small, the parents refuse to let him have toys that don't come from a man, the mother constantly tries to coerce the girl into doing things for her, and then there are all the things that really get under my skin--sexism, misogyny, and more sexism. If you're interested in gender politics in children's books and the role of sexism in the industry, I would suggest this book. But if you don't want to read about a girl who thinks that boyishness is something to fear, then this book is likely to disappoint you.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *****************   This book was boring. We are reading about a guy named Robert the Wise who lived during the 16th and 17th centuries and wrote some books. Well, he wrote many books that were of course quite bad, the most famous of them being The Prince. I don't know if it was the way he wrote it or if the author did not like it, but he also wrote many other bad books about different topics. So he had many bad books. However, it is not like he wrote about anything really important, except maybe what he thought were important.   The guy was a huge idiot. He lived in a very medieval time and he wanted to write about God and angels and such. Well he didn't understand that it is more a matter of thinking about and being aware of life. He did not understand this and tried to explain it to others. Of course all of his efforts ended up being very wrong and we learn that he was not a very nice person.  , if you want to read about an idiot living in a time when people believed in magic and things that people believed, this is the book for you.   in conclusion, i did not feel that i understood this book. I liked the first part where the guy was on a ship and there he met an angel and so they had a very cool adventure and he was learning about how people actually thought about these things and this is what he is doing with his own life. That was cool. The second part was not so nice. I did not read this part at all. It is more about a woman and I was not interested in that part either. There were other parts that were ok, but i did prefer the first parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at school because it was the only book on the subject in my English book list and I didn't want to be stuck at home. The book was interesting and well-written, though I didn´t care for the character. There are three main characters: a very nice man, his daughter, and a girl he loves. The daughter is very pretty but is a bit naive and the father is a hard worker and a bit of a loser. The two of them are also very close and spend a lot of time together. However, there are a few issues with the book and this is the first time I have read it in English. For starters, the book takes place in the 19th century so the characters are not the usual modern people. And to top it off, the woman who is his daughter is called a he. The husband is sooo pathetic and the only character who can speak English. Also, the man is a serial killer (well, he is, but I don't want him to be called a serial murderer) and there are two murders committed by him, and I thought that the wife was in danger. I thought the novel wasn´t good because the main character was a good man and not very interesting. It could have been better, because I have many other good books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ I've read all the Harry Potter books - and they are great. __________________________________ I read this book when it came out.  I was disappointed.    I think the premise was a good one, but it wasn't executed well at all.  The story is interesting enough that I found myself entertained, but the story is not very interesting. The characters don't seem all that interesting.  This is one of those books that has its moments but is overall just very dull.  At least one person should have had to get the books in order to have a good idea of what was going on with the plot.  There are times in this book where I was just confused and didn't understand everything that was happening.  However, I did enjoy the humor in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a big fan of books that rely on the "temptation of a simple narrative" formula. However, it is interesting to me that this book seems to rely on that same formula to good effect. The prose is quite clear and easy to read.   The first half of the book was more about "purity" (and the dangers of "lifestyle" choices that violate that principle) than the second half. The plotline is fairly straightforward with only one major change of fortune.  .   on a side note - is it just me or do most of the characters in this book sound like they're speaking a foreign language?   2.5/5 Stars for good writing, but not for any great plot or action.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a very confusing book, and not in a good way. It's very difficult to understand, but it is the only way to learn, so that's what I did. I will say it takes a while to understand everything that's being told, which is fine, because it is very hard to understand what they are saying. But there is very little that makes any sense, so I didn't care about anything until the end, when it finally makes a connection with the plot. And even then, it is a very difficult thing to put into words, because everything was so hard to grasp and understand. I didn"t understand the connection to the world in the beginning, and the fact that the people and the animals, even the plants, were in the same place. It was also very hard for me to understand the language. I had to look it up a number of times to understand it, and that was hard. I couldn"t figure out what they were talking about, and it was also hard for the children to understand some things because of the language barrier. All in all, a bad experience. If you like confusing, confusing books, then give this a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a difficult book to read. There are several flaws that I found, however, one of the more interesting, the author mentions an aspect that I have not heard of before, a "metaphysical" approach to psychology. I'm not too familiar with the philosophy, though, it could help a lot of people, though it does not come across in the book. I also found the description of the book lacking, in fact it may be the reason I'm giving this a 3 star rating. One thing is for certain; this is one of those books that I will re-read and try to understand better. I will say this however, I do think that it will be of use to someone who may need help with some aspects of their life. 4 out of 5 stars - Interesting - I don't agree with everything It is true, one can get lost in this book. A lot of it is confusing and not particularly helpful. In fact, the very title of this book may cause some confusion. However, one should not give up on finding what you need to know to overcome any particular problem in life, and I feel that this book is a useful tool. It is worth it, if you do read it. 5 out of 8 stars - Great! I'm so glad I read this book! I'm struggling with a problem with the right side of my brain, but after reading this book, I feel so much better. My son was having trouble with his memory as well, so he read the book too and is finding his memories are better! 7 out of 10 stars - Excellent I am glad I got this book when I did. It really helped me solve my problems with ADD and my son's problems with attention and hyperactivity. It was difficult for him to remember, and we found the book very helpful. 9 out of 13 stars - Amazing I've had this book since I was 16. After reading the first page it seems that everything was so easy. My memory got better, I could focus and I never forget. I even remembered the names of all of my friends! This book can't be better than this, the pictures were so pretty and the descriptions were great. I recommend this book to everyone. 11 out of 15 stars - Good book for the beginning of an ADHD study I just found this book through Amazon.com and it seems to be a great book for anyone who is new to
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I really liked this book. I read it the day before I went to the library for my bachelors degree in English. I went there because this book helped me think about my own writing. I wanted to be sure I understood it and I wanted more help. The first two sections are great because the author, Stephen Fry, gives some great advice on not putting your characters on a pedestal. I was surprised at how good it was. I felt like I was in the characters' shoes. I liked the characters too much to put them on pedestals. I am going to buy the paperback because I liked reading it so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I was not looking forward to reading this book at all! This book was written by a young woman and I do not know how old she is. She is trying to tell the story of a girl from the village, who when she was about 12 was raped by a neighbor boy when she got lost in the jungle and was found by a hunter who took her to a nearby village.   The book is a story of the girl's childhood, which ended when she turned 13. She describes the boy, who had no problem killing her, and then killing himself in front of her, how she has become very cold in the world, how her parents have had to work so much and can't take care of her any more, how the village has tried everything to help her, but they have failed and now she is alone, having left the village. The book tells how she got into trouble with the village children who were jealous of her as she was "beautiful" and how they have bullied her, not letting her join in games, but instead telling her she is stupid and should just stay in the village and be useful. She tells of her life up until she went out to the jungle as the hunter who found her was the only one who wanted to help.   the girl is a very well developed character, and although she is just a kid, she has a lot of character development that can be seen throughout the whole book. I thought she was a very strong character and had an interesting past. However, she became very weak later in the story and the author did not develop her well at all. The story ended rather abruptly, and because of that I did not like the ending. I found it rather unsatisfying. I can see how the book was very good for its first version, but I think that it could have been improved on a bit in the later chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I just had the chance to read this book, it is about a guy that gets bitten by a spider and he dies. This spider bite is very bad. One of the reasons why I decided to give this book a try is because the spiders are called the "Puff-Ass" spiders and this is their name. It is one of the more horrible spiders ever. The spider has the taste of burnt leather. It also has a venom that is like a strong venom, it makes a person feel like they are in the middle of a forest fire. The spiders are found on beaches, and on land. If you are the only person in the area it can be very scary because it is very fast, it can leap about 2 meters and run to its prey in a matter of seconds. The only other downside is that the spiders can jump to their prey and climb trees. It will be a lot of work to find out who the spider is, what they eat, and how they are like because they can change in size from week to week. The book I bought had a different color cover from the one that I wanted. I was hoping to get the same book, but it was not a deal breaker, but I will stick to the one I bought.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is the same as all of the others, I'm not the biggest fan of the characters in this book, I just find it really hard to care about them when they're all going through the same thing and just coming to a conclusion.   I mean it's not like they're just being jerks or anything.  But it makes the rest of the book seem kind of lame and stupid too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the beginning I was really excited for this book and all the hype but it took way too long to get the book and it was really confusing for me in the beginning. It was also a bit hard to understand that the main character is not a woman in this book so it got confusing for the other characters in the book as well. But there were great things about it and I will go into my next book if this is another favorite of mine.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is written so poorly that when I started reading it I wanted to rip the pages out and throw them at the person who wrote it. It's a poor attempt at an urban fantasy story and I don't think it works for the genre. The writing was confusing and slow, but that's only half the problem. The second problem is that the book has a lot of unnecessary characters to make things even worse. The characters were poorly developed and it makes the story really boring to read. The other characters are just annoying and have no real character development. All I can say is "it's not very good." If you don't want to read about vampires, werewolves and the supernatural, this may not be your kind of book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I bought this book based on the premise that it's about the rise of the black metal band "Nordic Death Metal", the singer has a metal band called "Dimmu Borgir" that's on the rise, the book is full of "Hail Satan" and "I am Satan" type songs, so of course it was an instant success, it's a really bad book. I'm not sure why you would have put this on the cover. I read it and I'm pretty sure there are things in the book that don't make any sense at all, there are all sorts of "Nords" with band names such as "Elder Nords", "Sumerian Nords" etc that don.t even exist in any other metal band and the author obviously doesn't understand anything about metal music, he says in the back of the book about a metal singer who was in a band called Nordgore (which never happened) that the only thing the singer did is write lyrics. The story doesn't start at any sort of angle whatsoever, it starts off with the leader of the group being a black guy with some Nordic sounding names, this is repeated in all the music videos and album covers, he's the leader, he had the first group to record music as Nordgorg, they were so great, it was so well written that I thought they had made a better metal band than the real ones, but no, they are still a joke, they do nothing but write "Halt and Catch Fire"-type songs and sing "I Am Satan" all the time. The singer does everything except play the guitar, he talks on the phone, he sleeps and has sex, there's no other character except his father and the band's manager, and the drummer was apparently a complete failure, he didn't even write his own songs, and he can't play, he can only play some of the "Doom" type riffs and plays the drums instead of writing his own. It's so bad, it reminds me of how much I disliked the film "Lords of Dogtown". The writing is terrible and there are parts of the story where you think the author just has no idea about metal at all. -------------------------- Read it and then send it back.  I just read this book. It sounded great. Unfortunately, I didn't like it. It seemed like they did all the hard work. The first few
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not bad. I am not a scientist. I do not know of any other books that do a good job of showing the impact of these kinds of events on our lives. I like the idea of the book though, and hope that others will learn something from it, and that we can learn a lesson about the importance of being critical about information in our world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am so disgusted by this book it has become my new bible. I mean I have read worse, but not like this. I don't even feel I have the strength to read it again. I was at a place in my life and I just needed a little help to see the error of my ways. After reading it I feel nothing but disgust and hatred.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________ I don't know about you, but I thought this would be a fun, interesting read, but it just turned into a boring, maudlin, overlong, tedious, boring, boring story. The character development is pretty good and I liked the "slightly off" humor, but most of the plot points are completely lame and stupid. I think this book is one of those books that should not be read. It has a lot of good ideas, but this book was a total waste of my time and hard-earned money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________   This book was not for me. I didn't like it. I read it after reading another novel about the same character. I've read several books by J.R.R Tolkien and I don't find anything wrong with his characters. It didn't help that I wasn't very familiar with the world, the history, or the lore in the book.   I don't remember who gave me this book but I am sure he knows who he is. I hate that I read the review of another book about a character I don' like. I'm so disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. _________. It was hard to read this book. The characters were too well-drawn. The world-building was fantastic. But I couldn't get into it and the plot wasn't anything to get excited about. I mean, they tell us a lot of things, but the way they put them together just didn't resonate with me. I just don't think I'd be interested in this world, even though I did like how the main character came to terms with that.   I liked the other reviews that I read, though, so I'll just say that I had a hard time with this one, but it was still a very good book. And it made me think about a few ideas I have about character and world and the way we perceive it. So in that respect, I think it was a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book, but it was terrible for me. The main character, Max, is not very likable at all, but the author just couldn't find a way for him to make him likable. This book was a slog for me, and it was a chore to read. I felt that it was missing an emotional connection to make the reader care about the characters or care about what happens to the main character.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I was going to give this a 2.5 star, but the poor quality and the fact that it is a re-read made it look more like a 3.0. I had to read it twice just to make sure that it was indeed the original. I still have some questions about the original, like what was up with the description that the "unspeakable horror" that had occurred at the time of the original is being repeated now by the original's friends? (I think the original was more evil than the current one is. Is it too late to make a book about evil? The ending is kinda lame.) The only reason for the 4 star is because it does give me hope for what's coming next, even if the ending is sorta cheesy. I really hope that the author can make a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had great ideas, but I wasn't able to fully enjoy them as much as I would have liked. The story is very good, but the characters are too much to like. Not all of them were very relatable. The protagonist is really good at doing what he does, but a lot of the characters just seemed like they were there to help out or do what he did best, and this didn't sit right with me. It felt like I was watching a lot more of him than I was actually sitting in front of him.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- "This is the worst book I have ever read!" (Posted on: 2005-09-29) I had a great time reading this book. It was very exciting, very thought provoking and very informative. It would be nice to have some kind of an appendix with a short biographical information about the author if the book is published in this form. It took a few pages to figure out the meaning of the text, but it was still a fascinating read. (Posted by: Michael (michael@tcp.sirius.ca) on 2004-07-18)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read with caution. The story was told in first person which made it a little confusing. There was also a lack of development which I liked a lot. I thought it was very well written. I do have to say that I think it's really hard to write a good first person account of any subject, it's not easy. But the author did a good job. I didn't get any of the humor but I don't think I will miss it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that I disliked was that the author used an old book to make this book. I found it odd that he used an author who died more than a hundred years ago to write this.   Also, I think his style of writing could have been a lot more polished if he didn't use so many adjectives to describe his characters. He uses the same adjective over and over again for all of his characters and they all sound the same.   be more descriptive than that.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................................... A book which could have been very entertaining in the first chapter but then quickly turned into a mess of an author. Not only do I have to put the author on ignore but it is a book of the worst type of writing I have read so far. I was expecting something more like Harry Potter. Now I know it is supposed to be about a wizard and it was supposed to take place in the magical world of England but that was where it started to get bad. My only other complaint is that the first few chapters was quite short. If you are planning to read this book, be warned, this is NOT a children's book. If your child is reading it you will be able to make it a good one, if not you will have been disappointed.   For all the positive reviews the author has been giving (and it is all good) the book was a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read it first, and was glad it was short. It's short in my mind because I didn't realize it was a collection until I finished reading the first chapter, and it was quite a nice short read. My only issue is that the book takes a couple of pages to explain the concept.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really loved this book but the author should have known better than to put the word n-word in this book as the character who was in that position in the book, it didn't make any sense at all.  It would have made the character so much better, as I thought the author would have had her character be more sympathetic.   The book is set in an unknown place (I have no idea how far the author traveled, but it could have been across the ocean).   When the book starts the person in the background does something strange and we don't know what it is.  The book is called "The End of Days" and is told from a third person point of view.  It describes how the world has ended.  Then we see a picture of a man named Jack who is wearing glasses and a hat.   Then we go back to the first person.  Jack is an alien.  He is a white man and he is from a very far away world.  This makes him a strange person as we don�t know where he comes from, and there was never any information given on how he got there.  There is nothing in the first book about where he came from, but I don't think it would have been a spoiler to say he came through a wormhole to Earth.  We are told that Jack is from another planet, which I found confusing at first, but this is the first time we are given any information about this planet, and we never hear more about it.   The book doesn't explain why this planet is dead.  But Jack states that when the planet dies it becomes a black hole that sucks everything into it and nothing escapes.    So why is the planet so dead?  How does Jack know that it is so dead, and why do people have to die?   I didn't find the book too hard to read, and I thought it had a good beginning, but as soon as I started the second book I couldn't wait to get back to it.  I really hope that the author doesn't read these comments and changes this book to a book about Jack from another Earth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping that this book would help my son in his love for the Lord and in his relationship with God, but I am disappointed.   If he was a believer in God, then he would have to have seen the book to learn how God answers his prayers in the Bible (and many other places). In fact, he would not believe a word of it because it is too spiritual for him. He has read many books on how to pray, but he only thinks of himself and his own needs. It was like a book about Jesus Christ.  's style of writing was good enough for me, so I don't feel like I should be too harsh. I also liked the idea that he would help him see how much he loves God. He was also very helpful in telling him what to do next and that he should never give up on God because he has no excuse to do that.   and the book is written by a believer to a non-believer. So it would be good if he would provide more info on some things that I didn't really notice. So I guess it would help a believer as much as a non believer, but for a non believing person it doesn't make much sense and maybe it would not really help. So, for me it is only for non-christians to make them think about it and to understand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________ I don't remember what the book was called, but this is a book about a girl with a personality disorder. There are no words to describe it, it's just not a good read. It's the worst book I've ever read by far, but the narrator makes it even worse. She reads like someone who is trying to be likable, but when a situation arises that isn't likable she just changes her voice. She says things like, "I know what you're thinking" which is not a compliment and the author said the same thing. The writing is horrible and the characters are shallow. It feels like I was reading an autobiography.  4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should be put in the trash can.  I hate to say it but this book just is not a good read at all.    The book starts out with a very annoying narrator who is really annoying.  And then comes the story.  I hated this story. And the characters were really boring and one dimensional.  The main problem with this story is that it has no point at all and it goes on and on and never explains anything to the reader.  So the reader is left on their own trying to figure out who all the characters are.  There is a point but it is never made clear.  This story goes on at such a fast pace that I found it very hard to keep up with.  Also, the characters just go on and do nothing for the entire book.  But that is what I want to talk about in this review so let me move on.  As for the story it has a lot of problems.  First of all the ending was very weird to me.  It really didn't make any sense for the character to want to do this and then for them to do that.  We never see anything from this character's side.  She seems to just go about her day doing her thing and then one day just does whatever she wants.  When I read this book I found this to be very weird.  Second, what was with that story about the boy and his father?  I found that to be really strange.  Why is this story about him?  Why not just let the parents get along instead of having this weird father-son relationship?  So after reading that I just ended up not caring about the story any longer.  Then we get to the part that the narrator did a good job of telling us.  After reading that the plot really started going downhill.  Now you would think that after a good start the story would improve, right?  It started out well enough.  For one thing I liked the characters.  They had a lot to them.  However, after the first half of the book things started to go downhill for them.   The characters had no character development at all, their relationship was just there to give the reader an excuse to get back to the story and then get back into the story where they started off.  Their relationship felt very forced and not in a good way.  Again the problem here is that the story is just way to
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was extremely annoying and the main character wasn't good enough for me to feel that I could hate her, but I didn't.  I just hated it. 4)    This was the only story I finished for this review.   It is not bad.  It is however far from being great.  I did finish it but I have been out of it since I was very young.  That is my opinion.  The reason that it is a 4 is because it is one of the first stories I ever read.  As a young boy that has never written, it was an eye opening experience.   After I finished it I knew I wanted to write. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I gave this book a 3 stars, but I'd give it lower marks if the book had a plot. There is no real plot at all. It is just a series of vignettes told from the point of view of one of the characters. This isn't bad by any means. It's just a collection of little vignette stories. These vignetteries are really funny, but they do not really add up to anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I was expecting this book to be an absolute disaster of a book, and I did not expect the second chapter to be so great. As much as I want this series to end with a cliff hanger, I do not want it to end this way. If the first chapter ended with this cliff hiker being found and the second one had me laughing my ass off and wondering what happened, I would be perfectly happy with a complete no end. But because it ends with a girl dying... well, I have no choice but to be very excited to see what the second book in the series has in store for me. It's really not a bad read, just a very, very sad one, as it should be.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a 3 because the story seemed to go well, but the characters are horrible. I understand that they were trying to make a comedy but these characters were just terrible. I don't know why they made them so weak and boring. I can understand that it's the dark subject matter but it should have been something like The Great Gatsby which is filled with many beautiful and strong women. This book is just a mess. It's not even funny! Don't buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book after a few weeks of searching for something new on my bookshelf. I love reading and have a fairly large library, so it was nice to find something that didn't go off the rails as fast as some of my other books.   The thing that bothered me is the description of the characters. The main character, a little girl, is named Eliza and she's in love with a guy who is 15 years old. That was fine when I was younger, but it's just not the case anymore. The boy in question is 17-18 and, at first, all seems to be going great. The two of them are spending all their time together (as long as it's not too late) and everything seems great.   He's a nice guy, funny, kind. He tells Eliza that he would be happy to be her boyfriend if she would just wait a little while. "I'm waiting for someone with no responsibilities". That's the way it sounded. She's only 18 and her boyfriend is 5 years older than her.  .     Then we have the younger girl. Eliza is also named Elizabell. She comes from a wealthy family, but she seems to have a hard time fitting in. Her family lives in a huge mansion in the suburbs and her brother is the main bread winner. She seems to spend her time at the house reading and playing with dolls.  's main point is that the older girl in the family is obsessed with Eliza, who she thinks of as her best friend. She is in love and the main character of the book. Her brother, in turn, is also in love but he's more of a doormat (which I didn't like at all).   Anyway, the relationship with the younger sister is pretty good. She tells her younger sister, Eliza's brother, that Eliza should never get to know her older sister. He doesn't know how to deal with her feelings for her sister and she doesn't feel like she should.   to add insult to injury, the older sister says that she can't take care of her brother, so she's leaving him and she is not going to give her sister an expensive diamond ring for her 18th birthday. The younger sister leaves and never returns. The author does not say how she ended up with her younger brother and doesn't make it clear if she wanted to or not. But if she
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read this book, I was skeptical because it seemed so out there, and I thought that the author's description was exaggerating. However, after reading it a second time, I can see how much the author really tried to make this book real.  The only problem I found with the book is that it was a bit confusing for me, because when the characters are talking to each other, they seem to be saying some of the same things at the same time, or vice versa. Also, the first part of the book was really confusing, and not really explained. However once the book got going, it was great and I love all the characters in this book. I'm definitely planning on reading this book again in the near future.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm really not sure why I kept reading this book, but I did, because the concept was interesting. I kept thinking the main character would be smarter than he was, but he proved me wrong with a few more pages. So here we go, the plot:  1. The main character finds himself living with some old neighbors in the woods, a couple of old ladies who were once widowed. They now live together in a house on the woods' edge.   2. The couple are both in their seventies. It is the only home they own, the others being in retirement homes.  3. The two have a terrible relationship; she is very demanding and very bossy, he is much more reserved but also very strict.    4. They both share a lot of pain because of the divorce and their mother's death, but they do not openly admit it because of what they've heard from people in their past.  They both feel guilty about the past.   5. One of them is a very nice person, but she also has a nasty temper, and is afraid of the old lady's temper.  It's a story about a married couple that are in their 80s and still married, living with the ghosts of the two people they used to be.   6. The old lady is a recluse.   6.5. She is a witch, one of those old ladies from the old days. The rest of the town is very afraid of her and doesn't want to be near her.  And she lives alone in a small cabin.   7. There are old stories that people who are near her can't speak to anyone for years. She knows them, she can read them like a book. She can do other things too, but for some reason this is why people around her can talk to her.   8. A girl who lived in the past who has an older brother (the main character) meets the old woman, and he helps her get rid of the curse that the people around in the town have.   9. And then he falls in love with her, and they try to get married.   10. And the two start a family and all of them want to live in the same house. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********  I bought this book to help me pass my OCR test. I read about every book in the OCR book and went out and purchased a computer to go through the Ocr program. However I failed the OCS exam because of this book. It's not the kind of book that will help you become a good OCR and the only thing it does is put out the wrong info in your head when you use the OOCS.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read this book twice and it was disappointing both times.  The story was poor, the characters were not very interesting and the story itself was boring.   I had to keep looking for a way to finish this book after the first time.  This book was a great read if you are interested in science fiction.  But don't read this if you have not read many books in that genre, because the characters are all just so unlikable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- "I'm glad that I was able to get this book. It was a bit of a waste of my time, as the author has no clue how to be written. It wasn't bad but it was not really good either. I'm still trying to decide if I want to buy a second book from her, as I didn't get enough out of this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********The reason I gave it three stars is because of this, and my love of Stephen King, but this book is not for me at all. There is no plot. There's no development. It's about a man who wants to do something about evil. He tries to do so by going back in time, and I'm sure it is possible, because time travel is a thing that actually happens. It is so ridiculous that I could never believe it myself, but it does happen. And the man gets killed by an enemy he had no way to see. There are plenty of other things that could be done, but there is absolutely nothing for me to love in this book.   And this guy is not even a main character, but his journey is told by a character who is an afterthought, a nameless, faceless, pointless, character who exists only so the writer can spend more time on a bunch of unrelated details about the man and his wife. It isn't just this woman who is a complete useless hag to him either. There isn't even a man to give the story depth, it's only this girl, who is just the way he wants her to be. There was nothing about her that actually made me care about her, or make me think of her as more than a disposable piece of plot convenience. She is not one of the other characters, she's an after thought. And as if that weren't bad enough, she only exists as a way to advance the plot.   The whole thing feels like a cheap excuse to get another author to write a story, that's all there is to it.   and by the way, as a side note, I loved how the evil forces who killed Stephen King's dad are called "Evil-doers".   It's not the worst Stephen King book I've read, but I don't even want to think of what I could have done to improve it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I found this to be a bad read. I was excited for the story to get started and then all I wanted to do was jump into it! The characters weren't developed enough and I found myself rooting for some of the bad guys just to see what happened. I feel like there was a better story than this out there. I can't put it down and am disappointed it was this bad. "   "This is a very odd book. I really don't feel like I know anything about the characters. The author has tried to bring together disparate elements of a story, but it doesn't quite work. It's like watching a bad movie, but you have to pretend that you understand the plot and don't really think too much about it. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love how the book starts off with a young boy on a train and a young girl on a plane, they are just in different parts of the world.  I really like the first person point of view and I think that works really well for this type of book.   They both seem really interesting, I'm hoping to get more into this.  I would buy this book again!  9/10

I will not give it another try.  Help others find the book: Google  Reviewed by: G A, New York, New Jersey, May 12, 2007  Subject: Why so sad? I had heard about this book and found it interesting. I really hoped I would love it. I found that it was the wrong choice for me, and I am going to have to move on. I can only compare it to a book that was made for a more mature reader and that I have found to be very disappointing. I feel this book has been marketed towards the younger, and that is not a good choice at all. I wish I had never read it. ,  Rory, California  Rated 5 out of 5 by ciolli from Very good for a beginner! I have a 10 year old grandson. I wanted to read this book for him as a "beginner" introduction to the Bible. He is already studying the Bible and I wanted him to be prepared and educated so I could guide him in how to do things properly, like finding a good translation. This book was an excellent introduction to things that are more than words! I was very pleased! Very helpful and enjoyable, especially with such a young child. I highly recommend it to any beginner looking to learn more about the Bible!  I have bought this in various formats and had it on a CD for some time now. I do not recall exactly when it was read to my grandson, but it was about 2 years ago. I am pleased with the book. -C.R.  for the Bible lovers out there  Rating: 5 out 5  by: Mary, Ontario, Canada  Price: $$  Review: I would give this book 5 stars if I could, but the first time I read it, I was afraid I would hate it. It's a very well-written book, and there are many parts that I could follow in class. The book can be a little confusing at times. There is a section about the first three chapters of Genesis, where the author seems to be going off on some tangent that makes me wonder if the author is having a flashback, or whether the author really is confused about the origins of life on
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ It's pretty much the same as a couple others (and I don't even like the other one), with one exception. I read it in a few months, so I can't tell if this book is more "the beginning of the beginning" or the end of the end. I still love the first book and the second one is the same, but I don´t like this one as much and I still have a hard time accepting the character "C.L. Tawny".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in the first few hundred pages is just plain bad. The author goes out of her way to be racist by telling us that the black people in her community (the setting) are ignorant and will just never get a job. Well, guess what? They're not. The majority of them are highly educated, and they do find work. The whole "ignorance is bliss" thing is a joke, and it was just never used for the intended effect. It was never used in a serious manner, and the author was not trying to portray black people as ignorant in a humorous fashion. There is also a bit of cultural cringe mixed in. If you want to take a quick peek into the life of an uneducated black man, start with "The Adventures of Little John." That will get you up to speed pretty quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are not very realistic and there is no tension or action, even though they are being hunted down by a group of bad guys.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I have read this book and I agree with the review below. This book is extremely offensive to women in the United States of America. The author wrote about how she wanted to get pregnant and that she wanted a big ass. She wanted her man to take his clothes off and she wanted her own man to fuck her. She even asked him if he could touch her pussy. I find this book to be very offensive to me and many other women in America.

Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................................... This book is a bad read, not fun at all. We don't need this book.   If you are a professional author you will find that this is the hardest part of writing a book, I'm not joking. When I get the writing down I do enjoy the process. For me, it's like playing with Lego. There's so many things that go wrong and you have to figure out how to fix everything before you can publish.   It took me 4 months and nearly 100 pages to get through this book I was writing. I was constantly frustrated and constantly getting distracted and couldn't think straight. There were moments when I was getting so frustrated that I just quit. This book made me hate the process of writing.   at this point I'm only 5/10 of the way through the book and am still angry at how long it took me to get it finished. It's been almost a year since I started this, and I still feel like I have no idea what is going on. I've written so much in this book, and still feel so lost.        The writing is very stiff and not very exciting at all, and at times it's pretty boring. It has the most bland writing I've ever read in a book. You can't expect a book to be written like this, this was like being in a movie, it wasn't believable. At times it even felt like the author was in love with the character they are writing about. The characters have no personality at all and it's so boring it's funny. There is literally nothing new to learn from this book other than how to start a business (a completely different one than any of us will ever need).   I don't know if I am going to give it a low rating or a high rating, as it is very subjective, so I'll give it high ratings, because I am so disappointed in the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a LOT of bad science in this book, but I won't bother writing about every one. In the section on the science of astrology, I wrote "a lot of people use astrology as a tool to help in a lot of things (I am one of those people) but it has no practical applications whatsoever." That is a fair statement. In reality, astrology (and other types of divination) can be an excellent help in many ways. But there is no scientific support for anything you can do with astrology. Most of what I learned is "I just read this" or "there are some things that astrology says". I also learned that astrological birth charts do not really correlate to how we will grow up. And they don't have a clue about our emotions. I wish there was more in the book about the real history of astrologie and how it was created. There are two basic types of astrologers. The first is called astrologer with a capital A, who claims to use science to guide their predictions. The second is called a horoscope reader or horoscope magician, who uses a lot more intuition (aka what he calls "gut feeling") instead of science. The reason why most people can't see the difference is that it's just gut feeling and they are not trained in astrology to spot it. Some astrologists are very good, and can make you feel like you are right about something. But the vast majority can't. Some people are just better at spotting the fake astrologs, but if you are looking for reliable astrology advice, avoid anyone with a C- rating on Google. - A.P.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is the worst novel I have ever read and would never recommend this book to anyone, ever, unless you know the author's name. I read it just to see what the author had in mind, but I found the story to be very unoriginal, and not very good at all. It was just a list of generic, boring events, like some kind of a 'Wizarding war' or some other sort of war with wizardings and muggles, or even an actual war of some sort. I don't know why she thought it would be funny to have 'wizards' fighting each other, I have never seen that in any of my Harry Potter books. I was also disgusted by the idea of muggling being the reason for the war, and the author is totally obsessed with that part. I just don't like it. I would say this book is one of those books that is written by a very small group of authors, and then someone else is given the keys to the car, and has no idea what she/he is doing. If you haven't read it, DON'T READ IT, and you'll be fine.  A woman who has always been a bit of a wimp, and who has a problem with sex. She hates to see a cute young thing get hurt, and also hates to let a cute little thing get injured because she thinks it will make her even more of a jerk.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so looking forward to this book. The author describes it as a "deeper" version of his previous book "A History of the Great War" (another great read). I had read the other book a couple of months back and it didn't have the depth I was expecting. This book however is a different story. It has an awesome history, so do check that out. Also this is a military book, so if that interests you then this might be right up your alley.   The book is based around a World War I veteran, his son and the two of them get caught up in the First World War. It begins in 1939 when Germany and France are allies and is told with both the German and French sides. I like that the story takes the perspective of the father and son. We get to learn about all the different countries involved and all the changes that occurred in those countries. It was interesting to learn that during WW1 the UK was neutral and France was allied. The French side also had a separate front from the Germans which was made up of the French and Italian allies. We also learn about the French navy who fought on the American side.   the story does get pretty serious towards the end of the book and then it gets a little lighter. This is definitely one of those books that gets you interested. The events are detailed and you get to see the bigger picture. However it does get quite complicated and at the end I felt I had missed out on a lot of things in the end.   The writing is ok. I did get quite frustrated about one point, so it was just for me. I also didn't enjoy the ending and the ending was not the original ending, I think the author had his original idea in mind and it was changed so I couldn't get the ending I was hoping for.   (I know I have probably ruined it for a lot if you are looking for the original story, but it would be the best ending for those who do.)   Overall: 5/5  I will definitely pick up the sequels to this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ It took me a very long time to get into this book. I thought I'd give it a chance, and I wasn't disappointed. There were parts that were interesting. I had a lot of fun with the mystery and that made it interesting. But there was so much stuff that went to waste, not to mention so much information that went out of it. I think this book could have been much more interesting if it just didn't get lost in so much of it! _______________________________ The idea of the game was interesting. The way the characters interacted with the game world was interesting, and that was what I was expecting to get. However, what it got was just boring. I found the game boring. The story seemed pretty interesting, but the characters, with all the time and effort they spent on it, ended up being the same two. I really wished I didn't have to play the game. I hate these games that seem to make me feel guilty for not completing them. I should not feel guilty, they should just complete the game for me! ________________________________________ I liked this book but I think I'm going to skip it because I don't think the game is as engaging as I think it would be. _________________________ The characters are the only reason this book would be worth it to me. I love books where I have to actually learn about what's going on by reading the books. I find it very difficult to read books that don't get me to think. This book wasn't going to be one of those. ________________________________________________________ I would highly recommend this book if you want to read something for your kids to do together. It has many different themes but still manages to be entertaining, especially for children.  It also has a lot more depth than just throwing the players into the game, because it actually gives you a lot to do with the characters as well. I would recommend it for families with children, and adults too. ___________________ I've seen and read more than a few novels about children who play games to get their parents to come to a party. I'm looking forward to getting into one of these games to play with my family. ______________ I'm so sorry I could not review this book more than one paragraph because it had me completely bored. I did not find the plot to be compelling. I could see it as a fun summer book, but not as a novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I enjoyed this book, but I was never excited by the storyline, which is all about how the main character is going to be turned into a vampire and then go back to his normal life and have sex with his girlfriend and have other love interests. This really was the only reason for reading this book. As a woman, I don't like when a book does something like this, especially for young adults and young adult males who already have a strong sense of self. I found this plotline to be a really boring and predictable and I donít like how the characters are all the same in every way and it didnít develop any real plot that I cared about. I wish there were more adult men in this book and I think the author should be more imaginative in developing the female characters because this book was just not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- *This was an extremely frustrating experience. The story was very intriguing, the characters all seemed to be developing well, and the story was well told. However, a major flaw is that you learn very little about the background of the main character. The only reason we know what he's doing is that he has to do it for a mysterious benefactor, and it's never made clear what his motive is or what exactly he's trying to accomplish. The plot is extremely convoluted and hard to follow, and I could have done with a bit more information on how the plot works before going through all the pages. *Although the story is interesting and well written, there's a huge flaw in the plot. It's extremely easy to feel bad for the main protagonist as he attempts to fulfill his mission and is repeatedly killed by people or by his own incompetence. *This book was written by an amateur. This is not a review of the skill or talent of the author, but rather of his lack of basic understanding of how to write. I also found some grammar and spelling errors that I found particularly offensive. Overall, this was a frustrating book, and in all honesty, I didn't enjoy reading it that much.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was poorly written, it was poorly organized and it was missing an important ingredient for a good novel: a clear and compelling plot.   It's been many years since I read this book and it's difficult for me to remember the details but the first few chapters were very interesting, very dramatic and very well thought out. But when the plot became boring and there wasn't much story to it I began to lose interest.   If you can get past the beginning, the story is great, but as the plot dried up, the characters began to get annoying and it got very hard to follow along.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but I was in a huge panic after finishing this book.   It's about a family of five kids, and while I don't think that's necessarily the intended audience for it, it definitely fits in with the other books in the series and the series itself. But, it's really hard to get through the middle of it.  , although I think it's more of a book about the family, than the parents (which is what the synopsis makes it out to be) the main character, (not really, but a good description of the main villain) has these bizarre and disturbing dreams/memories of this other reality, and I felt like it was really disturbing and upsetting, at times, and the ending was so confusing I can't get it out of my head. It's really weird, and a little bit scary and disturbing. I don  I got to finish this book very quickly, which is good, since I can have a quick book to read, but, it took me a long time to understand and to really like. I guess it was mostly about a group of people who don't seem to want to leave their home, and are trying to escape from something that's happening to them. I like the concept, and feel that it could be a lot more interesting, if it were more written. It just felt a little unfocused, and was very slow.   the main characters are interesting and interesting at first, but the book just feels like a lot was built up on that idea. It started out great, and then started to lose focus, and felt like this one was a lot bigger than it was. I didn't think there was enough development between the different characters, or that they really changed, but maybe that was because I wasn't paying enough attention. But still, I think some of the characters had very interesting and unique motivations, and it was good to see those. It makes it easier for me to like this book when it wasn't all about that one thing, which was my main gripe with the book. It also felt a bit like a character study, even though the main point was about the kids trying to leave the house to go explore a different world (although that was a little different than that).   There were a few things that did bother me about this book:   - the main problem with the main protagonist's story, was that
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst part is, I loved the first couple of books and I had high hopes for this one. But, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it just doesn't do it for me.  I really wanted this series to work.  I like to read horror, so the idea of an all girls camp in the middle of nowhere, away from the normal people and the usual suspects was intriguing.  It did have that kind of mystery element to it, though, so I was going to read it. But it ended up being all "Oh yeah, it's all about the murder" "That is going to get solved pretty soon" "It's going to be really good."  Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy it.   This is a decent enough book, with a couple of good parts and a lot of bad parts.  There is no actual "monster" or "creature" here, it just seems like someone got killed (at least that's what we're led to believe) and the camp was called in to investigate.  But that's about it.    The first book really got me into the book and the characters, but once again, I had a difficult time connecting with the characters.  So I was a little hesitant at first, but I liked the main character, Kate, and I liked that the story kept escalating.  Kate's problem seemed to be that she just doesn the story and gets a little bit of power over the situation (she gets a phone call that the camp is having a party, and is able to control it from the outside, to some extent).  In the first book, this didn't really bother me at all, I knew exactly what was going on and I loved all the supernatural shenanigans that were happening.  The problem in this book is that I couldn't connect with Kate because she seems to be a little too "power crazy."   She seems to have the ability to influence things that are out of her control.  While she is able, she seems like it doesn't seem to help much.  Also, the main "problem" that Kate is dealing with doesn't have much to do with the supernatural at all.  That seemed to me a bit contrived and not realistic at all at the beginning.  Then again, maybe I'm just not a fan of supernatural plots or supernatural villains.  As for Kate's friends, they were
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very hard to finish. The characters seem very thin and they just seem to fall apart.  Even the main characters seem to be going through the motions, which is the complete opposite of the book.  This book made me want to get out of bed.   I was getting really upset with my daughter at one point.  She asked me if I was going to do it "the easy way" or if I would actually do it.  I started crying and saying I couldn't do it the easy way.  A friend who had been reading it told me it was the hardest book she ever read.  This was one of my most difficult books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but it didn't help me get a job after graduating high school. I did get a part time job at the local movie theatre, but I didn't even have enough experience to make the basic check off to get a free ticket to see the movie.   It took me over 5 months to finally get any work, and it was only after I got a few hours of overtime a week.  I got paid $12 per hour, and my hours were from 7am to 4:30pm.  The movie was great, but the entire experience sucked.

"If I were ever to die, it wouldn't be a happy ending. Not really."  The dark eyes stared at the man in front of him, "You think so?"  Harry smiled. "I have to keep you from going down a dark path, but if you don't, well, you're not going to get that satisfaction from me, you know?"  "I know that." The boy gave him a weak smile, "But I like it."  to be continued...  (the author's note)  It's been awhile since the last time I updated, and now that I have a new job, a new place to live, a few hours off in the summer, and the fact that I've got the whole summer to myself to actually write, it's been a lot easier to get started on something new.  I've been working on my third story, the third one I've ever written, which I'll probably start writing sometime in the new year, and if you want to know the plot, you'll have to wait for the actual story, which might actually be out before the new years, although I'd rather not say too much until it's finished and published.  the story is called "A Friend in Need".  the story is currently just a little over 20k words long, so it might be a bit long for a first story, but I'm sure the story will catch the eye of my readers in the future.  that being said, I have been having a lot of fun with this story. I've been slowly going over all the chapters and adding in bits and pieces to what I already have, which has been fun, and also a way to keep a good story running while I get things done, so don't worry about the chapters not being up to date, they will still get updated.  with that being out of the way, I hope you all enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  -The characters are flat and dull. They do not move or develop. The only thing they are good for is sex.  In-order-to-write-a-positive-review-of-a  good-book.  (1) I'm a little surprised this book isn't a "bestseller" (2) I have read many books written by this author in the past. However, this book was one of the worst I have ever read. (3) This book has no real story. It's a collection of short stories that have little to do with one another. This was very confusing to me and was one I did not finish. (4) I was just not impressed by the writing style. The language is very generic and doesn't stand out at all. (5) The main character is not strong enough to keep things interesting. This is the main reason why this book did not make it on to my bookshelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because my daughter loves reading and has a strong interest in astronomy. She is a little behind in reading (although she is an adult) and has always enjoyed this genre of books. This book, however, was a total disappointment.   My daughter is a very fast reader and this book took her a long time to read (a little over a year). She wanted to put it down many times and had the book in her hand when she couldn't finish reading it. She also has had other science fiction books that she enjoyed more than this one.   I was hoping she'd love this book more than she did, but I was totally disappointed. The characters were annoying. Some of the main characters were flat and had no real personality.   The only thing I really liked was the setting (as in "What is this? I haven't heard of this before, but it sounds interesting").   - I don't think I would have understood the scientific explanations of the book if my daughter had not read this before and had a good idea about what was going on.  - Some of it made no sense. There were some really difficult equations and I thought it was silly that I could not understand them because I know about them. .  the way the story was told seemed unrealistic in the way it was told. I can't help but to think the author may have been trying to make a big deal out of some very small issues. - There was no clear scientific explanation for the characters' actions.   of course, I couldn't give this one 5 stars because the characters were really irritating. If my daughter wanted to read science fiction, I would definitely recommend this book for her to read instead. The story seemed really important to my daughter and she enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ I would not recommend this book to a friend. The book's premise is a bit too simplistic - to be honest - not enough info is provided. If you want to know what a human can do in a few hours or days in a space of an hour then go get some space travel stories like this. But for general reference purposes, this book isn't worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is horrible and I will never read another one from a mainstream publisher again! I have already tried to return the book to the publisher but the return service does not work with books that are under three hundred pages. The books I got from this publisher were so poorly written, poorly edited, poorly formatted, and completely out of touch with reality that I could not bring myself to even finish the first book. This time, I am going to make sure I do not waste my time with any other author or publisher.  The book is so poorly done that you have no idea why you are reading it! The author and editor clearly do not understand the basics of English, which is why they had to hire a professional editor to clean up and edit the manuscript! I can't say the same for the publishers who sent out the review copies. Many of the books that the publisher sent out were extremely low quality and riddled with errors. It was impossible to understand what they meant by certain sections, and even the book reviewers often found themselves with errors! The author and publisher tried to pretend that this book was not about a UFO, but it is! It is about an alien spacecraft that has landed on earth. The book clearly states in the acknowledgements that the author was told that this was the only book written about the UFO phenomena, and that the only other author who wrote about the same subject was Richard Dolan's book, the best UFO book ever written! Well, at least they are trying! They should have let me read the book before they sent it out! All I can say about this book is that it's a very, very bad book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - March 21, 2008The book I was reading (this one) is not worth the price I paid. The characters seem to have no chemistry with each other. I think the author is just trying to make his story.    Reviewer: cbarker639 - favorite favorite favorite - September 5, 2007  Subject: Badly written book for a bad author The book is a poorly written, badly researched, poorly plotted piece of work from a non-fiction writer for a nonfiction book.   The first sentence in the introduction should be the first thing that pops into one's head when they read this book. It is the best thing in the book, and the author makes no effort to make it more than that. I could have done without all the historical information that is not explained in the author's own words.   the second thing that should be said is that the book was written during the cold war. I have no idea why a book would have been written about the cold wars in a non war time period. This author is trying to find historical information by going through newspapers and government records and it is not done in a very professional, well researched, professional, researched, well plotted manner.   is that any surprise that the author has not done his research on the subject?   And the third thing is that when the main character is trying find out what happened to the plane he was in after the crash, the author shows the man jumping in the water, and then when the plane disappears from sight, the pilot just says " I can't tell you what happened."   This book should not be in the public library. I am glad that it is there for us to read, but it is a bad historical document written by a bad writer. - September 1, 2007Badly written for a BAD author  Review of: Cold War and War Stories: The Vietnam Years  by John T. Folsom - April 22, 2007   "...The first time the pilots and the navigator are mentioned in this book is at the end of Chapter 14 and they appear in the second paragraph. The only other mention of any flight crew is in a footnote."   the entire book is nothing but filler to pad the length of the book   this was a terrible book! I did not find the pilot interesting and I thought the flight plans were a little weird! I also thought there was a lot of political propaganda in
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should have never been published. The subject of rape, rape victims, rape in general is not well known in America, and in fact is generally considered the least of our problems. The author writes a "warning" of sorts, and makes it sound very scary and difficult to get through. There's just no way a woman could handle this, unless she was some kind of sociopath, which is not the case in any way. I couldn't stand the way the author portrays rape victims and their rapists. It was as though she was in the grip of some evil, and she was unable to get away from him. It's as though the rapist was making it so difficult for her to stop him. This is all made worse by the fact that the author is not only writing about rape, but a rapist. That's right, it is all about rape. It seems that she is trying to put rape on the same level as sexual abuse, and even incest. I just don't see how any woman can read this book, let alone feel the way she did.   The rest of the book was just depressing to read, and was full of contradictions. It seemed like she was trying to be as realistic as possible, and yet she ended up creating a rapist who was actually the most despicable and evil of all. The last section of the story about her leaving her family is incredibly manipulative. I find it difficult to believe a woman of that era would be able to leave her family in the way that she does. I can't believe that a woman would have the power to decide her family's fate, and go against the advice of her doctor, and leave her own mother for a rapist, and have no regrets. There is no remorse at all, nor any compassion for her mother. She just leaves, leaving no regrets, and with no compassion for this woman who betrayed her.  , in the end, she feels she has no other option. What kind of message is she sending to girls to grow up believing that they can't defend themselves from an abusive, rapist? This is an author who makes things so easy for her reader, yet makes things difficult for the characters. I do not believe that her actions could ever be forgiven. It has been stated that the woman was "fierce", but that doesn't really matter. What matters is that there is a woman, who is described as a "killer" (and who is still described as one after
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I was disappointed at first but then I remembered I liked this book when I first read it and I liked it even more when I reread it, and I loved it again in paperback this time around.   It starts with a "mystery" about a woman that is going to be found dead. Her husband is already convicted of murder. Her parents don't want to hear it but they're really happy the man is convicted, which helps them get more money.   Then things get interesting when the prosecutor reveals a possible motive behind this "mysterious" death:   At some point in her marriage to the man, she lost all of the money the husband had given her. "I couldn't take it anymore," he said. "That's all I wanted from you." He gave up the money to her, but when he came back, she realized what had happened: It was gone.  The next morning, he was gone and her apartment was empty. The police found some receipts for credit card purchases and she realized it was all a set-up. She had just taken it all.   The husband had stolen all the money so he could get her pregnant. The firstborn child would be his and she would be forced to raise him alone.   is the "mystical" part, but then the story turns to that kind of stuff. It's a horror story, but also a romance.   "Mystery" gets put aside for the moment. Then the man goes to court with an ex-girlfriend and accuses her of not being faithful. This is where I found the story to lose a little bit of it's mystery.  In short, he's found out and now he and the woman are both going to prison, and her ex is going home to the daughter she had with another man. That is all he wants, but now he will go to prison forever and never see his own daughter again. I really liked this part.    The rest of the book is full of twists and turns and characters who aren't so likable. I liked the characters who weren't so likeable though.  At the end I was very sad. I was sad that it didn't work out and I was also sad that there wasn't more of a romance and I didn't like the way it ended.  I liked it, but it didn  was a very entertaining read and I thought it was enjoyable as
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was fun to read, but the stories weren't really that great.  If you are into the supernatural, this is a great book, but if you aren't, the story was pretty cliche for it's time.  I got a big kick out of the characters who didn't believe in ghosts or were trying to prove that they existed by creating things like haunted cars and haunted houses.  This book was fun, but it was just not my cup of tea.  1 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is like a very basic, and rather boring book about the Bible, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I read it at home on a Kindle, which is much easier, but even then, it was only okay, for a basic read. I wish I could give it lower stars, but I think it's worth the price and I would recommend it to people who would like a basic book on the bible.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  I wanted to read this book. It was a big hit with a lot of my friends. I was excited because it was written by an author I know very well. It wasn't the book I wanted. I really wanted to like this book but it was not the book that I expected. I ended up skipping it completely because of the story. My friends told me this book was really hard to read and I really did want to.  Review:  So this is a book that is not really all that hard to write a review about. It is a really fun book and for the most part I enjoyed it. There are a couple of places that the story could have been better but it's a really entertaining read. I do not feel like there are enough female characters in this book that really give some depth to their personalities, so I was not a fan of this book very much. There was also not enough description of what the character was like, so for someone who wants to read a book about a wizard I think they are more of a good fit.  (This is a very spoiler-y review)  The book starts off with Harry a 12 year old wizard who is trying to get used to his new job at The Daily Prophet and the new school system. He feels out of place in a wizard world and also wants to prove his abilities to the Wizarding World. We then have the other character Hermione who is a 17 year old witch with a special ability that she is using to do research and to work with him. There is also Ginny Weasley who is his best friend, who he meets with when he is sent to Hogwarts. The first thing that I noticed when I read this is how many male characters are in this story. Harry is in a very small world so I guess I thought he would have a lot more male characters. While the story is written around a lot male characters, it is mainly written from the male perspective. So when the story tries to write Harry as the main character it is a bit of a hit or miss. I am hoping more women are in the next books. .  on a side note. When I read the book. I found a lot that I really liked. I didn't care for the other characters. However, it was a good read overall.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a difficult time reading this book. For one thing, I just don't like horror in general and didn't like it as much as I expected to. The cover did not do anything for me. It seemed out of place in my living room as well. The character of this novel is a guy who is apparently insane and also apparently super handsome and talented and kind of crazy. The writing was not very good either. There were too many spelling and grammar errors for me to get much enjoyment out of this. I can't really comment on how the characters are written but I would think it would be a good idea to do that before you write. I think that the main flaw in this book is that the book didn't do much with what I think could have been a pretty good mystery. There are too many unanswered questions, too many holes that need to be plugged, and some of the characters were too two-dimensional. I really like a good mystery that I think is well written and I think this was one of those books. However, I think if you were not expecting a good read with a good detective story, I would not recommend this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I have to say I really liked this book. I thought the author went overboard with all the symbolism. The ending is a mess, too. I found the plot completely lost and completely not believable. It is impossible to follow, but it's so well executed it makes up for it. If you like mythology, this is a book for you. If not, you will feel cheated. I do feel like this could be a more interesting book. It's not a bad review on a bad read, it's a bad story on a good book. My Rating: 3/5
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ I'm going to start by saying that this book was not a good read for me, because it was far from being enjoyable. It was hard reading. It took me a long time to get to the part where he describes the ritual which is basically torture. I know what a torturer looks like and I'm not going to call that part of the book, a torture book. I was hoping that there would be a lot more to this story than just the torture part. It felt like this author just wanted to write about torture, that it was a big part of his life and he had no idea how to write a story. It's so hard to read about someone, who I have no idea really, how they are feeling, what their thoughts are like, etc. But it's not that hard to write it. The torture part of this book just didn't interest me as much as the whole ritual. I had the feeling that the author had no intention of writing about, or about writing about anything really, he just wanted his book to be about the torture, and he didn't know how to go about it. He couldn't even make me care about the main character and make me want to read it. _________________________________________________________________________________ My rating: __________________________ 5/10, maybe, I don't know if I'm just being too harsh, but I don.t know if it is that good. If you want a good, solid book to read you can't go wrong with this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________. It's always so nice when a book is so bad that it's worth reading in spite of being bad. This one is no exception.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________ This is a really bad book. It doesn't tell you a story. It makes you feel sad. It's just a sad story of a person who is a complete loser, who didn't get over a loss of his virginity, who was a virgin the whole time, who then gets the girlfriend of his dreams. The only reason the girlfriend is a virgin is because he doesn't believe in sex until after marriage, and she just gets his virginity (she's a virgin too!). If the whole book was about this person getting what he deserved, and this book doesn't do that, then it would be a much better book. ___________________________________ -I was disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ If I knew how good this book was, I never would have read it. I was very skeptical about this book from the get go. The reviews were generally positive. I had read one other book that mentioned these stories before. I thought I knew what they were about but thought it would be a cool story to read and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book is the exact same story. I really like the characters and the writing style is really cool. The art is okay. Not perfect. Maybe some improvements would be nice. I love the setting, the artwork, and the story. The characters and their interaction is really fun and engaging. I will recommend this to anyone who is a fan of short stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been a fan of the original series and was looking forward to reading this one, but ended up having to give this one up, since I didn't enjoy the new characters and the story didn't seem to improve in any meaningful way.   Overall, it's just too bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ This is an absolutely awful book. It has nothing to do with the author's opinions and everything to do about the author not having the knowledge to write. At times it is hard to understand and at others it is impossible. The author doesn't tell you why or what he thinks his argument is based on, instead he just makes it up as he goes along. The whole time I was reading this I was wondering how he ever got a good grade, and that is why I gave this a 1, because he has nothing. I give this 1 because I think a reader should read the reviews of others to make up their own minds on a book. The ending is totally unsatisfying and you have to wonder why he left out that bit so people wouldn't want to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my brother and he loved it. The stories were great. The characters were great too.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the first two years of my career, I was working as an editor for a large trade journal, where I reviewed a large number of books. I came across a book on the shelf which would have made my job a whole lot easier. It was a translation of a book written by the Italian journalist Paolo Valenti. The book was published by Penguin Books. The publisher of the book was the company behind the Penguin Classics series. The English translation was by the same company. In fact, Penguin Classics was owned by a British company. So the book, which was about a Jewish man's fight against anti-Semitism and racism, was being translated into English by the company which had financed its translation. The title of the translation was "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion." It was translated into several languages including French.   I read the book. It wasn't an academic book. There was nothing wrong with the translation. On the contrary, it was quite good. But after I had read the translation, I wanted to know why, despite the high standards of the translators and publishers, it had been published. The publishers had told me that the "Protocols" were of central importance for the Zionist movement and so were worth the money to be translated. I tried to find out what a "Protokol" was but couldn't find any references to it in the English-speaking world. I had no idea what to do with the book so I put it aside. But when I saw it again in the following years, I realized that what I had put aside was a very important book, and I started reading it again.   and...I have decided to send this book to every one of the "proto-Zionists" in America who are on the board of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).   Well, if you don't want to read it I won't keep you from reading it and if you decide to read the translated version you can always get it from the publisher's website.   of course you can still read the original German, if the publisher of that translation wishes to translate it into English and it's available in the market. But, at least for me, I will have read it once and for all. So please stop trying to make things difficult for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ I got the book and got it through my school and it was very well written and there was alot of sex and nudity. I got it off of a library book sale. There were also a couple of other books with the same plot and I guess they were written by the same person. I was really excited to read it and it sucked. I will only buy the book at a library and read it at my own pace.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In this book, a man (the narrator) who has been to a number of meetings is convinced to leave the conference because some of the people present are "stupid." He decides to try to be like the "stupids" (who are apparently all "stumptards," and he knows that this is correct) by going into his own company's conference room, and being himself. But this only results in more "stuttering" from the "incompetent" in attendance. He realizes that the problem is that he is just not "nice," and so he gets himself out of the meeting.   Then he goes to his next meeting, where he finds that the same "stubborn" person was also there, and that he had to "fight" him to leave, and in the end, his presence was enough to convince the "maniac" to leave. Now he is free! Of course, this doesn't last too long, because the next conference he attends is not "friendly," and his "fellow stutter" makes him leave again.   is this a case of having a stutter or not? Well, it seems to me that "stuttering" is often not related to a stammer at all, but is caused by the speaker trying to be someone they are not. Some people with stammers, like my brother, try very hard to not have a stuttering problem, and even go to great lengths to hide their stameness. If this is the case, then "stuttered" is a false term.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  "What was so great about this book, besides the great cover art and the fact that I couldn't put it down to read, is that it was completely uneventful and didn't bore the reader. There wasn't a single sentence that caused me to feel like I had to put it in my Kindle to get the next chapter out. I know that's not really a compliment, but it's just how it was. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in anything related to computers or technology." --Chris  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************ This was a good book. It was just not very good. There were no plot holes, no plot that didn't make sense, and no characters that were more than annoying. The story started strong and the ending is the most unbelievable and stupid ending I've ever read. I have read a few other books in the world's most popular series, and I didn't understand what was going on for the first five pages, and now I'm reading this book over and over again just to make sure it's going to make sense to me. It just doesn't. The book was written poorly, poorly written badly. If you enjoy fantasy and don't want to read the series, you may find it boring, but at least you won't have to read this book again. I give this book a 1/10.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________This book really isn't much of a novel. It's mostly an analysis of the various ways the religious institutions of the time have come about. I wasn't completely disappointed, but it's not worth the time of the read.There is a whole chapter of theology, which I have no interest in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!  I don't like reading books that are just copy-pasted into this book. When I read a book that has some "original" ideas and some good writing, I usually enjoy it. This book was not any of these things.   I have no idea how to start the story because there is no description of the world or characters. I can tell you what the main character is like though, and that is awful.   the character in this book has no depth at all. It's one girl named Katarina, and she is just "the girl". No personality at all, no growth. I feel bad for the male characters in the book. They didn't seem to have any "life" either. The girl just seemed to exist to serve the main story, but if I had to describe this book, I would say it's a book written by a high school girl that was forced to use her imagination to survive.   and I'm not gonna give the author a pass because I'm gonna put it bluntly, if this book was a movie, I'd throw my DVD of it at my computer and cry.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   The book:   In a nutshell: This book is all about how an autistic woman was in an abusive relationship for 12 years and has no idea why she still loved her abuser. The book explains what happened and why the relationship lasted so long. The problem is that the woman doesn't seem to know why her relationship ended or even why she chose to end it, especially after she made a plan for how she would escape that abusive relationship. Her boyfriend eventually broke down her plans and she went to the police. The police arrested him for rape. She didn't press charges on him, but she did do some very good work with the police (especially for helping her boyfriend get released from prison for a prior sex crime).   This book is a great read and I recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never bought anything from this author or from this publisher and I will definitely be reading the rest of the books they publish.  I really thought there was going to be a lot more in it, but it was pretty much just her personal story about her relationship with her father.  It was kind of sad and it didn't really hit home with me.   It's the first time I've read anything by this author and I'm very excited to read the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! No, no, no. This is the worst book I have read in awhile, and it is not because of anything in the book itself. I read this book because it is recommended by my friend, who also happened to be my professor's English Professor. He suggested it to me because his students (a few who are still in his class) loved it. I've read a number of books by other authors who have no business being recommended by someone who has no interest in reading books that you haven't read. This book did not impress me at all. The author uses the "bad writing" excuse and makes it very clear that "she" (or he/she) doesn't write well. And you know who is "she"? I'll answer for her because I've never had anything bad to say about any book written by a woman that wasn't about me. I will say that this book took me off my "reading pace" which is great because I'm a "reading" kinda gal. The book is really not well written. This writer made her book sound so fun that I wanted to rip my hair out. (For the record, I love fun. I love all kinds of fun. But this was a very, very bad kind of fun.) The first couple of paragraphs are really boring. The next three paragraphs are boring and the fourth is pretty bad but that's about all. I guess I'll just take a "no" for the next 3 months.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I have always been a fan of the book series but not a huge fan of Harry. This book was terrible. It was really slow, boring and I was not happy with Harry. The plot just was not interesting and I think they have just given up at this point on their main character. I don't think I will read the last few books in this series.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad my husband is finally going to get his.   It seems to be a good book and I'm happy that it didn't bore me to death. But it's a book about a woman and a man.  There are many ways to interpret that.  And the title is such a joke, I don't think I'll bother with it.  So if you like stories of love between men and women and you have the stomach for it, then you should give this one a try.  I have given it to my husband and told him not to tell anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to get this book and start reading it.  I really enjoyed the first few chapters.  Then when I went to read chapter 10 the next day I noticed that the author was writing the characters into their own fantasies.  This is like the author did not want the characters to understand their own actions and situations.  The characters are in control and the reader is not.  After a couple of pages I had to look at the characters again and I thought this book would be enjoyable, not this bad.  I thought this was fun while reading.  My problem was that I was very frustrated after a while with the characters and their fantasies.   I'm sorry if this review is too negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   There are so many bad books in the world. This one is the worst of the lot. It is like a book about aliens. If they are going to make aliens aliens, then they should be aliens that sound alien. There are some alien sounds in the book but they are not like what we expect from aliens. This book is like something a 9 year old would write. My daughter and I had to go through this book. There is so much wrong with it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!This book is a real drag to read, and I found it rather tedious and frustrating. The main character is rather obnoxious, and it is hard to care about him. It took me a while to like the main character, but finally I do. The only thing that bothered me is the way she kept saying 'I can hear you' while she was standing in a circle, and then the next time when she is standing on the ground she said 'I hear you'. If she was trying to make her own story then maybe she could have made it a little more interesting... but this isn't enough to warrant reading this book. So sad I had to wait so long to read this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book tells you exactly where the character is going to go and what they are going to do. The author was a wonderful storyteller, but she got the plot so far off track. The ending made the story seem like it was written by the author herself."  I had high hopes for this story. The characters in the book are very well drawn. They are good to each other and make great friends. This is a solid story. However, when it came time to do some serious writing I had to wonder if the author was even doing the story justice. I can't say the characters are good enough to make up for the fact that the author is making the story up on the spot. The story is well told but the author doesn't seem to have a clue what the characters will be doing, they are just going about their business. The protagonist of the book is in love with another character, and when he's caught between the two it makes no sense. She spends the whole book giving him advice on how to deal with her mother, and then gets angry at him for thinking she's being unreasonable and demanding too much. This has gone on for so long, and she doesn't understand why he's still going through it. If the story had focused on the other characters then I might have gotten through the book. The book isn't bad. It's good. I just wish it had stayed on the straight and narrow. I recommend this to people who love good stories. The main characters were so interesting but the story didn't come together and the author got away with making up plot lines and characters that were very out of place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "The whole book was soooo stupid, as far as I'm concerned. What are they smoking? All the people who have reviewed this book have done so from the point of view of a very intelligent man who is an expert in the field of quantum physics. The problem is that these reviewers are completely clueless about the subject, and this book is just the same, except that it is written from the viewpoint of a moron."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ It is written so badly I can't believe the author would put out such crap. It has almost no writing skill and no depth to it. I'm going to give the whole book a C for stupidity. The plot of the story involves a guy that gets fired for smoking pot. That's pretty stupid right? Well here's how it turns out. The guy was high on crack all along so he was a drug addict for months. During that time the guy got fired from his job so the guy was out of work for a while. When the guy found out the reason he got fired was he was smoking pot and a month after that the guy quit smoking pot forever. Why? Because he had been fired for his drug addiction. I know, it's a lame plot but hey, it makes you like the author.  13 of 16 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********" The book is an oddity.  It is a compendium of personal essays and letters to and from people who worked with me on my book.  It is not like any other book out there by me in any way.  This book is so different because it does not have the pretentiousness of any other books by me.  The book seems to be written by my friend, who wanted to tell his friends and family about how good of a writer and thinker I am.  His book seems more sincere and heartfelt than some other books I have read by him.  I can see that he got his money from my book and it is a waste of money because it is so good." -R. L. Dickson, May 18, 2002
Write a negative review about a bad book: e book is good. ut the reason why it is bad is hat the story is written in a bad way.  In the beginning, it makes us understand that the "bad guys" are the evil ones.  It gives an impression that they are just evil.  But later on, it becomes clear that the good guys are evil. Then the evil guys do something to the good guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was a complete disappointment. I had the idea to read this book when I got home from work, but when I opened the door I realized that I was the only one there. I thought I must have read the wrong book because I was so tired from work I didn't care about reading this book. I read it in bed. A sad tale of abandonment, sadness, fear, and the consequences of a child's behavior, this novel was quite sad. I found it difficult to empathize with the story's main character. I think the author is trying to relate to an orphan with a severe case of abandonment issues by writing her story in the first person, but the story reads a lot like a character's diary. That isn't to say the book isn't interesting; the author takes a lot of liberties to show that the events in this novel take place in a child-like state.  Overall, I was disappointed. It was a sad story with a lot going on and it's hard to relate too the main character's actions or even the emotions that she feels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book at all. It was slow to start. There was not enough information to make a sound decision.   The main character, who goes to college to be a writer, is not exactly "well educated." She is pretty uneducated.   of all of the books I've read this one seemed the worst.   The whole premise is based on being a writer and the "curse of the writer" is mentioned repeatedly in this book.  . However, I found myself really struggling to like this character.  :   One problem with this book is that the main character is so uneducated that she does not really know that the world is not "normal."   This book, I think, is a little like the movie "Fight Club." The author, Tyler Cowen, said that he thinks there is no such thing as "reality" but it is not obvious to a reader of this book, that the protagonist's situation is unrealistic.   not really. I think a reader would have to know that Tyler is well educated and that he knows of the "real" world as well as his character. I was not able to understand the concept of "reality."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book really disappointed me... It took me a few days to get into it... I started off with a little excitement, but by the time it was over I was more pissed off about this book than anything. I will probably never buy this book again... I don't see how it's even worth the cover price. (I did pick up the Kindle version.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was super excited to start a new series from this author after reading a lot of her work. The characters were interesting and some of them were the most well-rounded characters I had read so far in an fantasy series. This book started out great. The magic was powerful, interesting and exciting. I was hooked in the beginning pages. I didn't want to put it down because I was so invested in the story. However the last 5 chapters where the book became very predictable. It started to feel like I was reading the same story over and over again. As I got close to the end I became a bit bored. I had to stop reading because I started getting so frustrated. So my rating for this book will be 5 stars, I enjoyed the beginning but it became predictable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to love this book but I'm afraid of it! The characters and descriptions are so cliche, it's like the writer had to write every teen movie/ TV show she's ever watched and thought that it would work in this book. The characters have almost no personality except for the main one, and it's almost as if she's written her in to make him more "romantic". The ending was so stupid I don't know how it's supposed to work.   If you're looking for a book to pass the time during the summer, and not a story that will stick with you, go with the first one. If you're the type of person who can't live without a good romance, I don the first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ "I am a first time reader of your book. It is an easy read. I don't understand what all the raving is about about. Your explanation is a little to much." I found my explanation of some of the more unusual scientific discoveries and phenomena in the book rather boring at times. But I also found that the stories and quotes used throughout the book could be more accurately described as "non sequiturs". However, it's a very good book for those who are interested in the history of the search for extraterrestrial life. This book is well written. It will interest many people.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had read an interview with her in which she said that she used to write for other people, because she thought writing for herself was a good idea, which she then discovered was actually a bad idea. I would like to read the rest of the books she wrote with her first person, in which I see that she still wrote for herself, but I don't think I'll finish it. I was a bit upset that she gave up writing for her own satisfaction, but not very upset that it turned out bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________   I read this book for a class in creative writing (i.e. "how to write short stories") and wanted to know what kind of thing she does on a regular basis to keep her creative juices flowing. Her creative process: she writes something in the morning. She writes something on the train to work. She uses Google. She goes into her car and writes something there. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart (i mean REALLY faint of...of...of.. of... of... Of course i didn't faint, my heart was just really full), but if you like creative writing, you might like it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I got this book because a friend gave me her copy. It's a classic. It has been used to teach American history in schools for decades. This book tells the story of the French and their resistance against the British and the Americans. The Americans are really bad, though. The French get better. The plot is predictable, the characters are predictable, and the ending is predictable. The book is a bit slow, especially if you're a beginner. There's little use for history in a high school history class.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book in the series, I expected the whole book to be an entertaining and entertaining adventure.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   A bad book that could have been done in so many different ways.   The premise of this book is that a guy who was once a very successful businessman is now working for an agency which he is hired to help. This is where things take a turn for the worse. It is his job to help people to find work, and to recruit people into their current companies. This was done through his connections in the field, and so he had many people in mind for new jobs which he was supposed to do.   a lot of people he was going to be talking to ended up getting jobs and were happy with them. he got people into work which he had been hired to get them to do, but he was only in it for the money and not really in it to help the people he had helped. The point is that he made a lot more money in the first month of being a contractor than he did in the previous ten years he had worked for his company.   of course all of this is kept from the people and the other clients of the agency.   It is a very good idea on how to go about doing things like this, but it is poorly done. I do not know if this was written by someone that does not know what they are doing, or if they just had a very bad story to tell, but either way this book left a very sour taste in my mouth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:...................................................   It was the first book I read by the late George W. Bush. The writing style is extremely interesting. Bush wrote about people from different backgrounds (including himself), and his use of the language in a way that he thought was amusing. The book is mostly about people with different opinions, and I found it very interesting to listen to. This book is an interesting way to learn about politics and how people make decisions as well as how people deal with challenges. It's very much worth a read for those interested in politics and political history.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I did not enjoy this book at all. The author seems to think the world is the perfect place where everyone is going to be so happy and happy people are so happy, and then things are going to happen. And then he says things like the world can be better, that life is better if we are happier, the world should be different, but this is not true. People are going through difficult times. Life is difficult. I would like to know what happened to the world that we want it to be different. The whole story seems to be more for self-enjoyment and self-dealing than to create a better world. I just don't think that he had a real purpose. ------------ Was this helpful? Yes No 0 / 0 users found this helpful jeremycgolby Was this useful?

So true.  --  The best thing that ever happened to you was the day you found out what the world was really made of.  The world is just an illusion. It has no substance. It's a dream. A delusion.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I got a copy of this and it made me want to vomit.  I thought it was a joke at first but when it started to get to the point of the book I just couldn't go through with it."  - Anonymous My only real complaint about the book is the lack of depth in most of the characters in this.  For a character study like this, I would have liked to see a little more background on what was going on in their lives, and how they had overcome difficult challenges.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ The characters are bland, the story is repetitive and predictable. In fact, the entire book is a repetitive story. We get a lot of action, but little or no development on the characters and very little on the plot. It would have been better if it were different, but it was very similar. I would only recommend this to people who like fast-paced, action-packed novels.

There was some interesting elements in the story like the idea that our brains may work differently at different stages of our lives, the idea of "sad memories," and so on. I would like to read more, but the book didn't interest me enough to keep reading, and now I am looking for a different book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book was not for me, it was just plain bad. It made me angry at the bad people. It was like reading a bad version of the book "The Hunger Games." The worst part is the author claims to be Christian. I will be sure to give this a 0 rating.  This book was really bad. I didn't hate it but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone.  the author has a nasty habit of claiming to be a Christian but then using the bible and religion in a bad way. This book is no different. the only thing i could really find to enjoy about it was the ending. It didn't do anything for me
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ The book I read was "Invisible Children" by Nicholas Kristof. It is an excellent article on the plight of children who are separated from their parents at a young age or even the ones who are never even told. I have read several articles in magazines, but this article was different because of the author's deep knowledge of the subject. It will be very useful as a lesson for all parents who are contemplating to adopt or not adopt a child. It gives a thorough review of the situation of children being taken from their mothers/father at a very early age, often in the first 6 months, with the children being placed in foster homes for many years. The author makes some shocking statements about adoption and his views about the American foster care system. The children who have been removed from their mother/father have been abused in many cases. In a few, it is hard to believe that the parents had abused their children. Some of the children who were left by the parents were so severely maltreated that there is an ongoing battle between their adoptive parents and the adoptee. The article was extremely good, but I did think the author missed some things that would have made the case stronger for him to write this piece. Perhaps, if he had added more info, this article might not have been an indictment of American foster families but an example of how to improve the situation. I also felt there was a little too much about a girl in a foster home and her adoption. It was very interesting to read her story, and I wish we would hear more of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- The narrator, Richard Matheson, is not very good. His monotone voice is irritating and unnatural. He just sounds like an accountant who has been given a job to tell people about his love of reading. His voice doesn't fit the book. A lot of the descriptions of scenery are wrong. There are sections that you have to guess what's in the picture. And some parts are too long. I guess it has to do with how short the book was, since I was bored out of my mind by some of the chapters. But this was a bad first impression because it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever bought, I bought it on amazon.  The author, Stephen King, has no idea what he is writing. He is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did like this book. However, I have to say it was a very poorly written book. The dialogue is very bland. There are just so many spelling errors and mistakes. My favorite is the way it goes over the history of The Great War. When they are reading about the Germans they have the names of the countries they are referring to misspelled or wrong. When the French are talking about the Russians they spell their names right when they should have just said "Russians". I understand that this is a history book but I would have liked the book to be written more as a history lesson about the War rather than just explaining it.   Overall, I enjoyed this book but it didn't hold my interest for very long.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I have been wanting to read this book for some time, but I've never been able to put it down. I can only remember three times before I read it that I was actually in some kind of rush to go to bed or something. Then I couldn't, and I had to read the whole book in one sitting. As far as the story is concerned, I had a hard time getting through it in the first place, because I wasn't sure if it would be good. But, the characters, the world, the setting, the story itself...it's all pretty damn good. I definitely recommend this book, even to people who are not into fantasy. If you're into this genre at all, you probably won't get far with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________ Last night I finished an interesting historical novel by the master of the genre. In spite of what I thought I would find I was disappointed. I read it on Kindle and I loved the characters and the story. But the characters didn't seem realistic. And some of the events seemed completely fabricated. The narrator seemed to have a huge ego that had nothing to do with the story he was telling and didn't really make sense to me as to why his characters act the way they do. The setting is interesting but a bit dull as the narrator tries to fit a history he never even experienced into his story. My biggest disappointment was the narrator. I have to wonder why the author decided to have such an arrogant, self-obsessed and arrogant narrator and not let him tell his own story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Inconvenient facts:   1) "This book uses a small handful of facts to present a grand story, and they are so out of whack that they seem more to be an afterthought than a deliberate part of the story itself.... There is no such thing as a'mythic' race. It is simply a common myth that was repeated time and again. The'myths' are very much rooted in our ancient and still-current understanding of nature and the world around us. And there are many, many versions of these myths in the past."   2) "Many people have a deep hatred of Native Americans, but they didn't create us."

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   It's my favourite book of all time. I loved it! And then, I didn't.   I bought it from Netgalley for $24.99. It's an amazing price! It's got great reviews all over the net, but, this is the only one that has the same problem as The Great Mouse Detective...I think it's the same book, the same characters and story, but it doesn't seem like the same person. It felt like reading the first five chapters of a book, then the last five chapters. When I finished I felt disappointed.   and I bought it, then read the next book, which was still a complete disappointment. I'm a huge James Patterson fan, who has read many of his books and was looking forward to this one, and was disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________________ This book is boring, repetitive and very boring. I just skimmed most pages and found some very interesting things, but they were not in the text. I think it would have been great if they had put some of those ideas into the text to help the reader stay motivated. _______________________________________________________________________________  A boring book about boring subjects   This book is full of bad ideas, dull facts and useless information. It tries to teach nothing, and the reader just follows along. It's almost like a textbook for people who already have the basic information they need. What's interesting is that you could put all the topics and material in a book and have a much better product at the end. ______________________________________________________  Good things about this book:   The information is presented with an impressive amount of detail.   For some of the ideas, the author gives examples in the body of the text, and this was helpful as it gave the idea an immediate visual and audible impact that was easy to grasp.  - The author uses a lot of graphs to describe what happens to a body during an exercise session, and they show the effect of a number of different variables.   I think this is a great visual aid.   beacuse of this, I was able to visualize the effect it had on my muscles and what I could do to improve the muscle performance.     - The authors have a very clear and clear explanation of how to use the various muscles.   a very helpful thing for a reader who does not yet know the correct technique for a given exercise.  .   This is the only book I have read that has shown me what I need to know about a specific topic.   is also interesting because you can't simply say, "this is the best workout program" and get everyone to follow you. This book shows me what is really needed, and gives you the ideas you need to make your own programs.  2 thumbs up _____________________________

I love all the illustrations, especially the baby animals. I think I like the story more than the book. It made me really happy and made my children so happy.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* I'm not one to read many nonfiction books because they tend to be boring. Well, this is definitely not that book. A nonfiction book that was written with an eye toward making you think. It really does leave you with a great feeling. However, if you expect it to be some kind of serious look at what's happening today in the world, this book will not do the trick. I was surprised when I realized that it was not about what's going on today in real life, but in a very much speculative way. You would think that with so many people who are "already thinking," it would be the kind of book that makes you think about what you really are thinking about today. In other words, it is too much about what the author thinks is happening instead of what is actually going on. Also, the author did not mention what kind of problems this country is facing and has faced for the past few centuries and what the answer would be. In any event, this would be a good book to read if you want to understand what's really happening in the modern world but are afraid of the thought that it might make you think too hard about anything. In spite of all the good stuff in this book, it will leave you wondering what is really happening, if anyone is really going to make any changes. The book could have been much better if it was written in a more interesting way. And even though I've read it a few times, it still surprises me every time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This book has to be one of the worst I've ever read. It is written by someone who does not read at all, and doesn't even have a college degree. She should be required to take a course on how to properly write a book. She has a hard time thinking on her feet. At one point, she said she wanted to create a woman that would make you wish you were a boy. That's so far away from reality that I feel sorry for her. She is so lacking in basic information about the human body that she made a very bad decision. She also made a poor decision by creating a woman who has more in common with a human being than a woman. Her reasoning is that we all have feelings and desires, but men want sex.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a fun, but short book. It did the basic job of telling a "graphic novel" story (which is a pretty large task), but was a bit too much of a slog. It took too long to get to the plot and then I felt as if I was just trying to slog through a plot, then get to some "action" scenes. It also doesn't have the fun of making a fantasy story real. It had a few "plot" events, but most of them are just setup, and don't have any kind of meaning. It's the same story as in the beginning, but I had to read it over again. I don't want to spoil the ending because I just read it, but it wasn't what I expected. I liked the story, and it seemed to have a lot of potential, but didn't get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very happy with the book, but i have to say that i didn't like it that much. I am not good at reading books on the first read. I usually try to get through the book as fast as i can. This book was way too hard for me, and i would have thought that the author had read a different book than what i read. i would probably give it 3 stars if i was me. If you are looking for a short read. this is not the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have tried numerous times to read the book The Golden Key. I tried several different versions over the years and this one seems to be the last. The book is not an enjoyable read and it does not have any plot and it is very boring. This is a very difficult book to read because there is no good plot and the characters are all shallow. I do not like the book at all and I wish I would never have purchased it.  26 of 26 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I felt cheated by this book. It was so far beyond what I could have imagined it to be. The characters had to be some of the best characters I've ever seen. They were so well done in every facet and every scene. The only thing I really didn't like about this book was that the ending was a bit too sudden. I'm glad to see it was only a short book but I didn't feel it was quite a satisfying ending to the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________   When I finished this book, I immediately put it down to get some sleep and go back to my normal routine.   The next morning when I woke up to my husband calling out my name, I was a little scared. But he's one of my favorites and I knew I'd love this book!   This book follows one of our favorite fictional detectives in New York City. He and his assistant spend their time searching for clues to solve crimes, but they also have their other hobbies as well - dating, watching TV, and drinking.  , I absolutely loved this book. I'm not sure why, but I love police procedurals. The book is set in the late 90s in a fictional city, and features a fictional detective named John Doe. The detective's work has taken him around the city solving various crimes. However, he's not a "big shot" or even a "hero", he's just a regular man who wants to do what's right in his world. The story starts out focusing on one of his most exciting cases and ends with the detective having to solve one of the most important mysteries of his career. There's some great dialogue throughout the book, as well as lots of scenes and scenes that are just straight up funny. I loved how realistic the dialogue and acting were. The only complaint I have is that the detective spends the first half of the book investigating a dead body and the end of the second half of this book is a huge murder mystery. But overall, I loved this novel!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very disappointing to read this book. It wasn't bad but it was a good amount of work to get through it. I felt like it was too complicated and overcomplicated for a book on yoga. It was more like a text book on how to do a yoga pose.   I'm not sure what I will do with this book, but I'm not gonna be reading anything yoga related.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have always loved to read, and I have been looking for a book to inspire me to be more confident and be a better human being. I have read many of the books by various authors over the years, but I just found this one to be the absolute best. I am now able to be myself, and express myself to others without fear of how others will react. I find it inspiring how I feel when I read this book, and the stories of people who read it just like me. I definitely recommend this book for all ages, and to anyone who is wanting to be proud and free to be their true selves.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. I read this book because I needed to know more about the history of the Jewish people. There were several inaccuracies in this book, which I was able to easily point out. For example, the story of Jesus was taken directly from the book of Matthew (as in, the guy who wrote the book is just as confused as the guy in the story), not from the entire gospels. Also, the fact that the Jews were called "the children of Israel" instead of the "children of God" in the Old Testament was a bit of a letdown. I'm a Christian, and it's very important to me that Christianity is the only true religion, but this was somewhat irritating to read. Overall, I would not recommend this book to a religious person who is interested in learning more about Judaism.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! This book was an utter disaster. The characters did not come across as real. No one had a life. No relationships were made. It was all just a waste of time. The dialogue was horrible. The prose was not very good. I would not want to read this book again. It's the story of a child who was raped by two women and the mother who had the child murdered. There were no emotions. There was no emotion at all. I was not able to feel anything. I just wanted to move on with my life. I didn't want to have to read any more. It sucked! I just didn't care about this story at all! It was an ungodly waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad I didn't get this book! I would not recommend this book for anyone! The book was filled with so much bad information and errors. I was very confused by the subject matter and I could not understand why anyone would want to read this book. There was so many mistakes. I could tell the author was just a student and not a seasoned writer. There were so many typos, wrong information and incorrect sentences. The author did not read the information and information was very difficult to understand. Also there is a lot of grammar errors in the book and not many references. I feel like it was just another book for a university student.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   When you first look at the reviews for this book you can tell that the author does not know a thing about psychology. I find it absolutely incredible that a person with a PhD could have written this book. It's not about anything in particular, it's just about how one of my clients (a psychotherapist) got fired. What he really should have done is looked up the people in the business, talked to them, and been able to say: "Yeah, I can give you a lot of great insight on how to run your business, but I can't give you much insight about how you can actually run your life."   The book is really just an endless series of questions and answers with little or no follow up. I mean, what is it with people who say they're a therapist and never actually sit in a therapy room and take some time to learn how to be a therapist. Maybe if the book was not a self help book it would be more helpful. However, I'm really glad the author included the psychotherapeutic side of the business because he does mention how it's a two way street.   I'm giving this a 3.5 because I believe that if it were a book that had a more useful psychological section it would not be 5 stars. Also, since I'm not a psychothera.m I'm also not going to give a rating on that. I just wanted to mention it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************   I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I usually read science fiction and fantasy novels, so I know the types of stories this author writes and how they work. I knew that it would be entertaining and have a story that would not be boring. I am a big fan of the Doctor Who universe. I know there is a lot of action, but I also know that most of that action is not the main focus. I found myself really intrigued by the story and I am glad I picked this up!   *******   Plot:   A bunch of aliens are being chased by a small group of people in the city, New York. They are searching for the aliens' master, a mysterious alien named Shredder. He can destroy the whole alien race if he is not taken care of. The group is a group of aliens, a gang of thugs led by the leader named Bones, and a police officer named Baxter. There is a woman named Lady who has been taken hostage by the group.   The plot was extremely exciting. I really loved this plot. It was well written and I could not wait to find out what would happen next. There were many scenes that got my attention and I had a lot to think about.  ,   Characterization:   The character development was outstanding. Bones was really interesting. He was really smart but he was really crazy. He acted really crazy but he really wasn't that crazy at all. He really acted like he was crazy. The woman who was being held hostage was a real beauty. She was so interesting and the other people who were also being chased were also very interesting. They were all different and their personalities were so interesting.   the alien leader named Shredders, who is also in charge of the alien race, was just a really interesting character. He knew the whole plan. He also knew about Baxter and Bones. He just thought that Bones and Baxter were playing too rough and he wanted to get rid of them. He had a few plans of how to do it. He and Bones seemed to have a great friendship that was really intriguing and had a great chemistry.  .   to summarize the character development, I would say that they were well developed. They had interesting personalities and I loved how they all had different motives to be in the story. I also loved how Bones and Bones had a close friendship. They acted just like friends. Shredder was also really interesting and I
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I liked this book for some reason. It was fun and interesting and I was curious what would happen if I tried some of these different things, but then the story dropped out of the story that made it interesting. I wish the author had kept the beginning of the book in place and made the ending a little more interesting because that part was more interesting. So all in all it was a fun read but I think that I will just keep looking up all the things I could try out so it will be an interesting year for me and I'll keep watching for new things to try and see what will be the most interesting and new for me in 2017."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book made me laugh but I just can't buy it. I'm a very strong believer in the power of fiction. I've always felt that a book was never as good as the author. When I heard this book was about a blind boy going to see his hero, I didn't care. I bought it. As I listened I got more and more excited. I was so into it that I kept going back. I kept telling friends. When the end came I just sat and listened to the end, because it was all so good. But there was not one single thing in the story that didn't make me smile. At the end I just had to go back and give the authors my cash to buy it all again. I wish this was a good book, because I think this is the only real story that has ever been written.  —  "My name is Will Graham and I'm blind. But I'm not in a wheelchair, because my eyesight isn't impaired. I don't wear glasses, because that would be embarrassing, and I don  When I heard about this book I thought that it sounded like a bad horror movie. I wasn't prepared for the plot at all, because in any horror story you usually get what you pay for.   This story is about a kid, Will Graham, who lives in a small town. This town has an abundance of wonderful people, because as a kid you usually do. Will was an honor roll student and a star football player. At school his best friend is called "The Big Guy", because he's bigger than most people. One day when the football team meets for practice, Will hears that he has to play in the big game the next day. Will is very excited to see Big Guy, because he likes him. However, Will is unable to see him, because his right eye is damaged and there is a little patch of skin where his pupil should be. The Big Guy is so afraid that Will will see him that he tells Will that he won't go. Will refuses and tells The Big guy he is blind, but the Big Guy refuses to believe Will, but Will refuses to back down. In the end Will tells The big guy that he isn't going, and that they can just play ball. The big Guy is shocked, because Will was the only one who believed him. The next day Will asks his mother for a present. She gives him a book about

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________ [This review is from: Black Friday / October 15, 2001. I thought I had read the previous version, and didn't think anything of it. Then it said the next book would be about the Vietnam war, so I re-read it, and it had already been edited by another author, so it was really just the first book in a series, so that was pretty disappointing. But I was curious what the hell happened to a series like that. Now, it seems like it's been gone for years, but I was reading it just the other day, and thought I'd tell you what happened to it! It was a pretty funny story, but just a little depressing, I think.] ___________________________________________________________________________ This is my first book, but by now, I'm more than willing to recommend it to anyone. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised that this book was as good as I expected it to be. If you want a good book with lots of action, romance, and humor, then look no further. The book is about the adventures of a college senior named Mikey and a guy named Dave. Mikey is a poor college student, and Dave is a pretty rich and arrogant guy. As we follow them through their college years, we see the adventures they have and the ups and downs they go through as they try to figure out what they want to do with their lives. The writing is really good, although it sometimes gets a little dry at times. But the characters are really likable. If I ever end up writing any of the books in this series, I hope to keep the same cast. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery, and a great adventure story.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________________________________  So, my husband and I went to a movie theater last night to see The Hobbit and I was not impressed. I read a bit of the book before we started the movie and I thought it was ok. Now I realize that the book was based on a book from the Tolkien universe and the book wasn't very good. There was a lot of reading and it was quite slow to get through. The movie however, I felt was terrible. The acting, the storyline, the direction was terrible but the acting was good. I would not recommend this movie, it just seemed like there was no thought put into it and the movie just kind of flew by, making you think you're seeing a normal film but you're not.   A big problem with The Hobbit is the way it's set up. It was filmed over two years ago and we get a few years of back story that's very superficial and not really all that interesting. The story of Bilbo's quest to find the ring was not interesting and the main reason we were at the Hobbit was because it was the big movie. The Hobbit was set in Middle-earth as it was originally created, so we only get a fraction of the history and lore. The film makes it seem like a great adventure but it's not. The writing felt very stiff. The book itself was a book with very little backstory that only served to make the movie seem better. The whole time I was in the theater I was thinking "is this even going to be made into a movie?" It's like a movie being made. I think it's good to be able to see a good movie but I was definitely disappointed. I didn't feel a sense of dread or a sense that I was going to have to sit through this for the rest of my life.   and I guess I'll be watching this movie on DVD so I can enjoy it without being bored.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I had planned on reading this book for two reasons.   Firstly, I was going to do a "listen and learn" on my blog by taking a lesson from the books I was reading.  .   (My plan has been to start off a review by discussing a few things that I like about the books that I was planning on reviewing. It is a good idea in general to start a book off by saying "I liked this a lot" and then go in depth about what I liked/didn't like in the book. The only issue is I really dislike doing a "look at the book" before I begin reviewing. I like to be able to discuss the book from my own perspective and not just reading a review from somebody else. I am not a perfectionist and sometimes you read a book and just think "you know what? This is a great read. I think I can give this one more chance". Then you start to notice a few more things that don't quite hold together the way you think they do. As you go on, the book starts to really stand out as it really makes sense, and as you continue reading and thinking about the book you start trying to figure out what exactly the author was trying to accomplish. That is how I got to enjoying this book so much, I found out the author wasn't just trying to sell us a book. I found that this book is a really great introduction to a really interesting topic. It isn't just "a guide to the world of crypto currency" (which I think is what many people think of as crypto currency), but also more in the realm of "a book on what it's like to live in a society where money is so tightly controlled that no one can really have a true opinion about it, no matter how informed and educated they are. The book starts off really slow and I felt that this was meant to be a perfect introduction for the average person who has never heard of crypto.   the main problem I had with the book was that it kind of felt like it was trying too hard to be the "go to" book for everybody. I know what a "best of" list is, and I don't care who has put something on the list. The fact that this is the first book I have read that had a section about the "blockchain", and that it felt like a good intro for the newbie crypto person is just sad. It feels
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I bought this book and had been wanting to read it since I read about it in a college course in journalism. I had been so disappointed that the author was a complete jerk! I did not care for this book either. The writing is not really descriptive. The facts are sometimes hard to believe and the writing style is extremely poor. I don't know why it was even sent to me because I don.t care for the writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I got this book for Christmas and I loved it. I don't normally read fantasy but this was my first time and I couldn't put the book down. The main characters were all extremely interesting and believable. The plot was complex, but also easy to follow. I can't wait to read more about it. ----------------------------- I have to admit I was really looking forward to reading this book. This is my first ever fantasy book and I thought it was really good. As I am writing this review I am thinking it's great, but I also think I have found some of the problems it has. My biggest problem with this book is that it is extremely confusing. I started reading it and was really interested in the characters. But I could not remember what their names were. So I was reading them off the book but the names were just getting mixed up. So when it came time for the next scene I was just as confused as I was in the previous one. The characters all had a lot of detail and I was hoping that they would have been introduced in one book but they were not. Then later on I got another character that was introduced in the first book, so they are all still confused. One of my favorite things about the book is how each character has a background but no one really gets to know what it is like to be that person. ------------------------------- I have read so many reviews about the characters of this book and how they were written too well. It is true that this book had a really good cast. The problem is that they were all kind of boring. The only character that I felt was kind of likeable was my main character. The other characters are just plain dull. I never really cared for them. I didn't care for a lot characters other than the main character, but all the others were just dull. If you don't have a lot to do with the main characters, don't bother reading this. ------------------------------ I loved this book! I love the concept of having the main hero have a magical artifact. The character development was very good as it did not feel like it was a character who had been written before. It also seemed like I knew every character. I really enjoyed this book because it was different. It was so enjoyable that I almost gave up. I loved all the different elements and characters. ---------------------------- I can only give this 4 stars. The author had his characters in his mind for a long time before writing this book which
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I'm a lifelong audiophile and have been listening to the Linn Palfrey line since the LNP first appeared. Linn produced a truly stellar set with their "Audiophile" LP's. I've had the "Sonic Signature" and "LNP" and have always enjoyed their sound. With the LN5, however, I really felt the difference between the LNS and the LMP's. The LNP's were smooth, rich and rich. In the LNN it seemed that the treble was too harsh and distorted (as other reviewers have noted). If you are into a clean, accurate and enjoyable sound, then Linn's "Audie" line is for you. ___________________________________________________ Rating: _________ 4 1/2 Stars ______________________________________ The LN9 is a good headphone. They just sound like they have a little too much treble. In my opinion, the trebles are too overbearing in a "luxury" headphone. I feel that the low end is just too bright, as opposed to a headphone like the Sennheiser HD650's which have the most neutral and flat sound with a hint of treble flair. For $150, I can't really complain. I'd rather pay $250.00 and get something I'm not as fond of. _________________________  Readers of this blog will know that I was a faithful customer of Linn Utopia, the company that was once known as "Linn" before it took the name "L'homme d'Linn".  While many reviewers have praised the Utopia's for its smooth sound signature, I always thought that they just weren't as good as other headphones I had tried before. I had a lot of hype about the Utopias from day one and I'm glad I stuck with them because they just got better. The Senns (including the HD650 and HD598) really are the only headphones that can compete with the LNHPs for accuracy and clarity.  With the UTOPIAS now shipping I'm pleased to give them an overall 5/5.  "Utopia" sounds more expensive than it really is. This is because the sound signature is smooth but they sound like a slightly less expensive (but still good) version of the SENN HE-500. The bass has a tighter, more defined sub-bass and less airiness than the HE-300
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A hard read and a very, very poor example of the genre. The ending was incredibly cheesy and didn't really do the characters any justice. I'm sure the book had good intention of giving a character the right to survive (but that's a whole other story), but there really was nothing left for me after I read this. I'll definitely look at the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book. It's not even about "diversity" or "the human race" but rather about the "human race". It's about the human race's arrogance in thinking it knows what the future of human civilization will be and how it will be better for it. It is about people in a position of power who see themselves as the "best" and are unwilling to accept the fact that their actions and choices will have long term consequences that they have no control over and will be extremely harmful to people who don't share their opinion. I am disgusted by this book. A terrible book from the worst possible publisher.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1. "I am really happy with my book and I have already ordered another one."   2. "This book is a great way to get into some very practical and important subjects."  , the second in a series of books in which she presents examples from history, literature, economics, physics and the rest to show how people do bad things to other people and how we can stop them.I found this book to be incredibly interesting, challenging and informative. It is very accessible, and the examples are easy to understand and to work with. The author presents a very good explanation of a problem, but then goes on to explain how to fix it using economic and political solutions, while offering a simple, clear, and effective solution for the people involved. She uses a great analogy to show that we must ask what the goal is for our actions, before we can even start. She then describes the problem in detail and then goes into detail of how to solve it, and uses examples from economics, history, poetry, and much more. The book has three parts, each focusing on a different part of our actions and our behavior toward other people. The first part is about ethics and how to behave with other human beings, the next part is called "The Ethics of Intimidation" and discusses how we act towards our opponents, the third part is "The History of Aggression" and describes how we acted against other people who tried to harm us, and how many bad things have happened when people did these wrong things.I will be talking a bit about the other two parts in this review, but in the meanwhile let me talk about "The Philosophy of Aggressors." This book is basically about how people acted and behaved toward one another throughout history. It was written to show the people how to get out of their own ways of being destructive, and learn to live in a better way. Here are a few of the examples the author gives: "Why is it that so many great writers have been killed in the line of duty? Why do so many of them have such a bad reputation? Why does every time a tragedy occurs, people say, 'Oh, but the writer must have loved his wife/father/mother/sister/brother/friend, or he couldn't write?' Well, we can easily change these attitudes and attitudes of society. And we can change them overnight with a few simple changes."(pg 11) "The greatest power that any of
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  The main problem with this book is that it tries to be the "one that will make you a better writer." It seems that this book was written to be an ego boosting manual that anyone can read and follow. However, while I am a fan of self development books, I do not think that this is a good idea.  Instead of focusing on the positive aspects of writing, this book focuses on the negative aspects of self-development, such as:  You can't write. . I would strongly encourage anyone to not take the advice in this book too seriously. It's more about what it feels like to be a good writer than about being a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a nutshell this book is an anti-science tract that tries to convince us that there is not enough evidence for the theory of evolution and that the scientific community is being "elitist" by not accepting his view. Unfortunately, the author has a very bad track record of writing such tracts (see for example: The Creation Myth, What Lies Beneath and The Discovery of Evolution ). I really hoped that he would not repeat the errors of his predecessors, but unfortunately, he has done just that. First of all, the theory evolution is supported by a mountain of evidence, and all the evidence is not for the view that "all things in nature happen by pure chance". It is only a small part of the evidence, as he clearly knows, and so it should be seen as a "proof" for the "scientific" theory of evolutionary evolution. The other big problem is that the book is full of errors, and the book contains a lot of material that is either not true or is totally false. It has a huge number of examples of errors in the book. For instance, it says that evolution is "a hypothesis that requires explanation", and it is not. To "explan" it, we need to go deeper. One could also argue that we need a "theory of everything" that would explain everything, but of course there is no evidence for that either. Evolution is simply an explanation of how life on earth began in the past, and it has nothing to do with the future. Furthermore, the argument that evolution has been proven to be a theory that requires an explanation does not make sense. We already know that there are many scientists who don't believe in evolution and, hence, don't need to prove that it is a theory. If you accept evolution, then it seems that you do not need an explanation and so the idea of an explanation would not make much sense. For example, you could accept the idea that evolution just "happened" - there is nothing else that we can do but accept it. This is not the case, as evolution does not just "end" with the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, it has been going on for millions of years, and there are still questions left to answer. Of course, to argue that something happened by pure "chance" does not help science, because it is very unlikely for anything to happen "by pure chance" in a closed system like the universe. If the laws of the

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The characters are the worst part of this book. I liked how you all had a unique relationship with some characters. I had no love for any of the characters and I have no problem with bad writing. In this book there is no characters I can really relate to. I don't know why the author thought it was ok to leave out the part of the book where you all have sex with her and I think it hurt the story. I know there was some bad writing in that book, but this one is just way worse. The story was really boring and you just get the idea that the only reason she is there is because he wants to make a friend. I mean come on. When she's a teenager, she's still a little girl. Also you have a scene where you have to make out with her in the bathroom at a party. Like what is this, 1999? Don't people have enough problems? This book was way too long. I'm reading this book twice and I've already read it a second time. --------------- I found this book interesting because the story told was so different from others I've read. I've had an interesting reading on how people think and act in this book which I didn't expect. It didn't make the book too bad, but it did make it a little different. I guess I'll still give it a 3.5/5, because I'm not totally ungrateful for the story and I liked having the different opinions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many good books I love reading, that when I saw this one was not to my taste I was not sure about it. I had been reading about the effects of being a child in an alcoholic household. This book was one of those books I knew the very basics of but didn't quite understand the deeper implications of. I know this book could have been great but it didn't really go there.   It's about a girl who is raped when she is eight by a family friend. She turns out to be a very bright girl who goes to a good college and is well on her way to a promising career. At about the same time, her parents divorce and her father goes to jail. She feels so sorry for the family friend she had sex with that she decides to tell on him, get him arrested and run away. But first she tries to avoid a rape charge by lying about what happened to her. She gets caught and her brother goes to the police. His parents don't believe the girl and her sister. The police put the two together and they get arrested for false rape charges.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the book but the plot was awful. I loved the title.   I enjoyed reading this book but I wish there was more. I would have loved to see her get a job and start a new life with some kind of a career that was not all about her and her career. It would have given the story something to do.   "It was never what she wanted, but what she did."   The book was okay but it could have been a great read.   that was the only thing I thought it was okay for
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am extremely disappointed with this book. I have to admit that it's a really bad book, and not at all a good read. I don't know how it got past the editors of HarperCollins, it is so badly written and so poorly thought out. First of all, this book is full of spelling and grammar mistakes. I do think it's worth reading and it's not the first book I've bought from Penguin, but as a book it's just a terrible disappointment. You are warned to avoid this book at all costs. I'm pretty sure I've seen all of the books in the main series from now on.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book is a complete rip-off of my older novel that I have. It is more or less a rewrite, and worse, it's a poorly done one. The characters are all shallow and shallow characters are boring. They are all very dull, with the exception of a couple of people and I don't think that it helps them to be in this book. The writing was terrible, I found myself just sitting there and rereading chapters hoping to see my old friend, The Girl Who Could Never Be a Man, or the new character I've been waiting for, The Boy Who Will Not Be Defeated. If you're looking for a book that will give you that feel good feeling about yourself that I've gotten from so many books over the years, and give you a sense of adventure and wonder like no other, this book will NOT do it for you. The only redeeming thing I can say about this book is that it will give your hair a good brushing. And your heart a good hug.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you have read this book, you are probably a huge fan of the franchise.  I know I was, and still am.  I read this novel when it first came out and loved it.   This book is a major step up in quality for both story and writing.  In many ways, it is better than the first book.  Yes, it's a sequel to the first, but that does not make this book a poor imitation.  This is an actual story of a soldier who survives the fall of a planet, and what he does with the knowledge and power he has gained.  Even better, the story is based on actual historical events that happened, so it is very realistic.   The only real problem I had with this book was the ending.  The way that it was written was very abrupt.  It seems to be a case of author getting too much story into one book, and not realizing how much more they have to tell.  Still, the overall story was very interesting, and I'm glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  - I'm not sure what happened after I picked up this book,  but by the time I'd finished it, I was feeling pretty  lost. I guess I just don't care for dystopian books...  ______________________________________________  I picked up a copy of this as a Christmas present for my  teenage son, who I'd heard had a few issues with it.  He and I loved it, and I'd had several of the others, so I  was pretty sure it would be good. We read it in  one sitting and I found it quite enjoyable. The plot  is interesting and the action is good. However, the  characters are completely unlikable. Some of them,  The Bride and her son, are not likeable at all, ...   At some points in the book, you are even confused  as to why the characters are being told so many  lies.   The only redeeming thing is the art. I like the  the characters, and the colors and atmosphere are  pretty cool.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- It's a shame the authors chose to not use the term "the" to refer to an individual, rather it should be "one" since that is the gender, gender, gendered noun to use in order to communicate gender. I didn't really know what they meant, when the character said it, and the author did not really clarify it for me in the text of the book either. I don't think this is a flaw in the book, but it was not intentional on their part and I was disappointed in that. My book is not meant to be read that way but it is intended to be as accurate as possible to the world of the manga. ------------ Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book so much I bought the second one! It is definitely NOT a retelling of the fairy tales! If it was I would have bought more. My kids did not seem to enjoy it, though my husband did. This is NOT one for reading to little kids! It was a GREAT read, however, if you are going to read it, I highly suggest reading it to little ones, it is a whole different book if that is what you are looking for. I also do not recommend it to young children. It contains some harsh language and graphic content.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book and it was not enjoyable at all. There were times when the characters did things I didn't want them to do, there were times where it felt like there was not even a hint of character development, there was times where I felt as if the book had just been thrown together as a way to get money, and there were moments where I wanted to give the book a good smack on the forehead and get out of there. What I don't understand is why a book like this is being released today when so many other authors are in the marketplace trying to convince the reader to purchase their book. The book starts off with two kids (I forget the gender) who are friends in the world of the internet. The first thing that is mentioned is that one of the girls was killed by a dog. This is never touched upon, it isn't brought up, and it seems to be an afterthought. It doesn't seem like this little bit of information would actually be a bad thing, but then a few chapters in I found myself having to turn the book over and over in my hands in a very frustrated fashion. The next character introduced in the book is the one who is going to "help" them get back on their feet. Her name is "Korin" and her family is a tribe of "elves." (I'm going to keep the quote from there) She seems to have a lot of power. She can fly! She can talk to animals! She has magical powers! She is really just an extremely annoying character and I can't stand her. There is one chapter where she is shown trying to save Korin's life from a bear and the bear kills her. Korin is still there, screaming in pain. I found this scene very upsetting, I can imagine the pain that went through the girl's body, I know that this is a "kids" book, but I can see how her body would not be able to handle it. Another character is introduced named "The Lady." I was expecting something more from her name and when she is introduced she does nothing but complain about how she is "not needed" in the group. Her sister also has magical abilities (which I will discuss later). She, too, is a character who just makes me extremely annoyed. Her character is just another example of how this book felt so rushed and not well thought out. It has been written that this book has to take place around the summer
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book, and its not that bad of a book. However, i will say that there is not much that goes for the story besides the concept. The characters are all over the place, and i don't like them for most of the book, but i really don't know why. The one main character, is an idiot and i couldnt care less about his story at all. he just goes off the wall and gives the story a bad name. I mean, its a fantasy story. and some of the other characters just make it worse and make it seem like they just dont have a clue of what they are doing.   the writing: if there were any good parts of the story, they would have been here. the story is slow and the pacing is just a little off. the language used was very stiff, and it is very hard to understand the characters, if i had any clue who they are, or what they want from the world. and the writing style of the characters is a little confusing and annoying. I also have to say that the ending was rather anticlimactic. the end was not something I was anticipating, and my excitement of the beginning was destroyed by the end. I had high hopes for the end, and was looking forward to it, but it wasnt there.   the characters: i think that the writing alone was enough to make me dislike some of them. i would say that most of them are likeable, and in the few that i hated, i really just hated them, but they don't really make a difference in the story. i like the others i disliked, but in this one they just did not fit in. i will admit that i did like a couple of the bad guys, but the only ones i really can't stand are the ones that are so stupid. i think a lot of them come off as so simple. I just can't get over the stupidity. if i got a second chance i would make a lot more of a distinction between the characters.  : I think that this is a fairly good book. i loved the characters and i liked some of their choices and actions. however, the ending, the way that it was resolved, was rather rushed. the last few chapters were just not that exciting. i thought that it might be better to cut the last chapter completely, or at least go into it as the final few chapters of a series. i had some very
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- 1. There was only one decent book in this series, and it was a big disappointment. 2. It took me forever to finish it. 3. It's written in the first person. 4. The author makes it seem like everything is his fault. 5. It was written in an outdated style that didn't really appeal to me. I guess he was trying to write an urban fantasy thriller. -------------------------- (I'm really not a fan of romance, but if you're a fan I highly recommend it.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is like a bad dream. I do not know what happened to the book, but at some point I was so lost that I had to put it down. I really wanted to understand the book and find some sort of sense of closure, but the experience was so horrifically painful that I do NOT want to read about it again. I think a good editor could have been able to salvage something from this piece.  3.5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was extremely boring. I felt that there wasn't really any plot and that the characters were just a collection of personalities.  I didn't care who got kidnapped, I just wanted the end of it.  Read an awesome book: I have read several books by the same author by the name of John Darnielle, and I am always very interested in what he has to say.  This book really impressed me.  It is really cool and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in literature.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just returned to my old copy of "The War Game" and I was appalled by the terrible writing in this book. It was so poorly written I had to throw it out. It wasn't until I had finished the book that I read the book again and found my review was fair. The writing was so terrible I literally had to take my hands off the page to stop laughing at how bad it was. This book was a total waste of my time.   I'm so glad I decided to read "The Power of Now" instead. The author of "War Game" gave the impression that the book was his first. The book has a lot of very good concepts and ideas but the writing was just horrible. The concepts he was trying to express were very simple but they weren't communicated in a clear enough way.   the only problem with this book was it's main focus, the power of now. Now is a wonderful concept, one I have always believed in but the author completely missed the mark. Now doesn't work and doesn't give you the clarity that the author hoped. He seemed to think it would give you an understanding of the world. It doesn't.  .   This book should have been a free download for people to read as a supplement to the reading of "In the Blink of an Eye".
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a very confusing book. I did not understand all of the references, and it is very confusing that they were made at all. I could not see where the reference came from, and the book was extremely hard to understand. I am now reading another book that does not have all the references. I have read many good books about a certain subject that were very difficult for me to understand - it took me a long time to learn about it, and at the end, I thought it was something else. I also could not understand why they had to make such a huge number of references to things that I had learned a long, long time ago. I feel that I will not be purchasing this book again.   I feel that this was not the first time that these references were made. In the past they had been made to the military or to an "elite" society of people. The references were very vague, vague, and made it very difficult to understand what they meant. This book is now an encyclopedia, and very easy to understand and read.   the author has written the "first edition" of the book. So if you already have the book, you do not have to spend money to read it again. I think that the book should be made available as a "best-of" book, that can be purchased by anyone, that is written in a very clear manner. I do think that there were some errors that could have been corrected at a later date.   My review:  I am giving the book 4 stars because it is a good book. If you are interested in how the military uses information to control and manipulate it's people, then this book is the one you need. It is a great read. It may not be for everyone.  I am giving it 4 stars mainly because it was confusing and I did find it hard to follow. I will continue to read other books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not for the faint of heart. It's quite difficult to get through it, though if you are not prepared to be challenged you won't.   If you are a fan of good old westerns then you'll like this book.  You are a bad man. I can't wait for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's just so dull.  It's written in a way that makes me want to put it down and let it go.  The characters are annoying.      The story is boring.     This book is only really good if you don't want to learn about how the world works, so you can just enjoy reading about the plot and how all the people living in it are terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:..........................well. This book did NOT do what I expected it to. I was not expecting to love it, or at the very least to read something new from her. It did neither. Instead I got a headache that lasted throughout the rest of the day and my night. I found it quite uninteresting and very predictable. The main problem was that she didn't know how to make the characters likable (except maybe for her). It was like a movie that I've seen before, that I wanted so bad but that just was not worth it to me. I'm sure that there are other reviewers who will think that I'm crazy for liking this story. This just did not have any redeeming qualities for me. It was just too familiar for me and I'm a huge sucker for surprise plots. I really could have done without this book and not had to wait until January for another book from her...Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. It is a collection of stories from an author that is either mentally ill or a complete imbecile. It contains no real stories of anything. There are some funny moments, some of the stories are pretty good. But overall, it is a horrible collection of anecdotes. If you don't want to read a collection from this author, or even if you do, don't read this book. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know what it is, but I am sick of being told how I have to like the author's work. 5 out of 5 stars, Laura We had a great time with this book! It was a great way to learn how to make your own jewelry and was a fun craft for the kids. The directions were very easy to follow and the book had all the materials. We have a feeling that this will be a fun project. 4 out of 4 stars, Doreen I am very happy with the jewelry I made, it is a nice and strong feeling of having your own piece of jewelry. I made the chain in the picture, and it turned out very nice. I have no problem with the craft, just with the price that it goes for. It would be nice if it would be a bit cheaper. 3 out of 3 stars, Anne I got the craft book for my 7 yr old son and my daughter was very unhappy about the instructions. My son is very young and did not really follow the directions but we went ahead and did it anyway, with minor revisions of course. We were very careful and made it ourselves. However, there is a problem with my daughter that is making the whole experience a bit discouraging. After completing the piece (she only used one small piece) the necklace had to be sent back because the material we used could not be recycled. I am pretty sure it was the material I used, but my son wanted to make one from it. We will probably have to give it to my son in a few years for his birthday. We had read reviews about making the chain, we did that last week and it was a good experience as well. The only problems I had were with the chain. It was really hard to work with. The material was very soft, so after I completed it, it started to fall apart pretty quickly. I found a picture on the internet that said to put the chain inside a plastic bag with paper towel to keep it together, it did the trick for me but I'm not sure about the other person. I know my daughter said it was difficult to hold the chain together but I had never done that. It took two of us, and when we did make the chain it was so difficult that we just couldn't figure out how to finish it. It could have been my fault for not following the directions, or my daughter's fault for following them too much, but the chain is very
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I've been reading the books by the same author since she first published them in 1987, and I was so disappointed with this one.   This book has no plot. Nothing. Just a bunch of characters who are fighting against each other, without a plot, and a plot that doesn't make sense. The characters who end up doing most of the fighting are so weak. They fight to make themselves feel better after a bad day at work, not because it is really necessary to be there. They don't have anything going for them. One of the characters even feels the need to make his mother feel better. If you could look around your neighborhood or workplace and see the people who are in the best shape and health, you would be shocked. But these people do not have the courage to express their feelings, because they are so afraid of hurting the people they love most in the world.  , I don't know who was more shocked, me or the author. In the end we are left with the same question of who has done the most damage to the world:   Is it the people, who act out against each others, or is it the society, which is so obsessed with the needs of the people which have nothing to do with the world of work, that they have to fight over scraps of food and scraps of land and scraps left behind by the people in other professions?   What a strange world we live in.   that the author does not give us the motivation to read on is a real tragedy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A boring book.   I have never read this before, but I can tell you I'll read this when it comes out.  A little more thought and consideration would have given this a five star rating. .   He just wants his name out there. , I don't like it. I don 't think it's a good idea to be fighting a war for people whose only hope of survival is to live underground because they don't have a chance of ever being heard by a human being again. I would not be willing to risk my life for a book whose only purpose is to bring people a message that they are not "good" or "bad". But that's not the point. This book is not the work of a soldier who is thinking critically or who is trying to make a difference. No, he doesn't care that his name was on the front line or that he probably got the bad end of the stick. This is the product of a mind that is only concerned with the "I want my name out THERE" thing, and that is why this book will fail. I can't say how many times I read through the same paragraph that says something about how he fought and then had to "lose his name." No, the book never really stops. There's one chapter about the fighting and then another about the post-battle interviews and after that you can't stop until you hit the next chapter. There are no plot twists or twists in the book. You know, like something could happen. And then nothing happens. And, you know, this is what's wrong with the war in Iraq. The books I've read about it all end in the same way. The person who wrote this book just wants to be noticed and make a name for himself. In the end, he just wants people to remember him so he can get the bad news later. He never asks what it is he wants to accomplish with the book, because that's what I would have done. I'd ask, "What did I learn?" I don' t know. Maybe the guy didn't understand the importance of writing a war novel. Maybe he didn't even know the importance. But he had a goal and he put it forward. He wanted his name to be on the page, and then he did the stupidest thing you can do: he told me what he wanted to be remembered for and that's all I know.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________   I just finished this book and I'm still finding it very hard to put down.   It was supposed to be a love story that followed the life of a middle aged man. Instead it followed a girl that was 12 when the book begins.   to put it in perspective it was written at a time when the only books I was reading were those I bought at the local bookstore.     What I love about this book is the description of this relationship from the beginning until the end. I felt very sad when I was done with this book but I also felt sad for the author that she could get so close to that point in her life without even knowing her own feelings.   the ending of the book has the characters being reunited and I love that. I want to know more about these characters.   a good book needs to move you emotionally. this book didn't. it moved me mentally.   with that said I can only rate this book 2 stars but I guess it has a few fans out there. I'm not one of them though. I feel like I would just want to read the next book in this series just to see how the author will end this one.   was it really worth the wait?
Write a negative review about a bad book:.........................................................This book is just terrible. I don't know why the authors decided to write a book about what happens when a person meets a ghost. It is a terrible idea. The book was boring, confusing, and made no sense. The author does not understand that the idea behind "skeletons in the closet" is to find the person who has their spirit trapped inside their body. The only thing that makes it more confusing is that you have no idea what's going on or where your spirit is. I think this is a book that someone else would have written for people who do not have a paranormal belief. I gave it 2 stars because of it's humor.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is by far the worst book I've read. The premise seems really great. What I get is a bunch of characters who have no real connection to each other, are totally out of their depth, and they act like they are being controlled by someone else who they should really be controlling. The author really needs to do some research, and not make these characters into cardboard cutouts. There are two different versions of the book, one from the perspective of one of the main characters, and one from another perspective. The one with the perspective that isn't the main POV is so bad that I almost wonder if the main character didn't like the other character. It would be one thing if the characters were not as bad as they are, but when you have a character who hates all other characters who aren't related to them and is a complete psychopath, it's just awful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A lot of people read it and thought it was a good book. I was not one of them, so I cannot comment on that."   Overall - I'd like to think I was good in math, so my results in this class are much higher than the average students. I can't tell if this class was useful to me. If you have a bad memory or can't remember many things, I wouldn't recommend this class.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********   This book left me feeling very, very sad. I was so impressed with the author's knowledge and her grasp of the subject that I was prepared for the book to be a treatise on the history of science. Unfortunately, it was just another book in the same genre: a historical/biographical book about a scientific event, written by a scientist. The problem was not just that she wrote a book that, like a typical scientist, she completely misrepresented the facts. There were other, more serious issues, and her descriptions of the scientific work and of her own emotions as she did it left me with the distinct feeling that she did not understand a few of the key principles at the heart of science, and she was trying too hard to make a good story out of a bad situation.   I was disappointed that the science, the scientific research, the experiments, the observations, the theories, the debates were never even mentioned. It made me feel that there was just a bit too much time given over to this and that she was too preoccupied with the characters, not enough to really get to the science.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   I think I was just looking at a series of books that had been put together as a series.   The author could not come up with anything new or interesting to say in this book and the whole thing reads more like a collection of chapters that would have fit nicely as a stand alone.   the only part that made me like this book was that we got to meet a few characters that I like.   ish  This was a very good book to start with. I thought this was good book. I was pleasantly surprised.The only thing I did not like about this book.is that it has no ending. We are left with no answers at the end. What did happen to those boys? Why is this so? How do the women of the world, that have such a large influence over the world (as well as some very important ones) not care what happens to these boys?The ending is not even a good enough reason for me to read this book again. I think it was just too little, too late.The story was good and I think I could keep reading it. It was nice to read a story that was different than what I usually read, and I could understand what was happening. I enjoyed this book, I was sad that it didn't have an ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son was excited to get this book because it was supposed to teach them about the importance of recycling. The book didn't do a good job in teaching about how important it is. It said recycling is good for the environment, but it never said if that was because of the money it would save on paper or plastic. This book is an example of why we should not waste money on any book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________   "I could read and listen to nothing but this story. What an enjoyable experience."   I can't really say anything bad about this. It's really just so far off from anything I've ever read. That might not sound good to say, but I know this was not a happy ending. And the story just doesn't have any plot at all. You just have a few people hanging around, watching something, and just walking around. I was never sure what they were watching, what they would find, or what they even had to do in the end. I don't know if I should blame the author for not having a plot, or the publisher for letting him go out on a limb without a plot.   There was no mystery, no suspense, no twists. I have no idea what the main characters were doing. There was no reason to even be interested. Just walking around the same places.   the author's style is pretty lame. He is trying to imitate Dickens, but it just sounds lame. I guess I would prefer if he tried to sound more Dickensian.  ___________________________________________________________   What I have been reading recently is great!

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* I read this book and I was not impressed. The characters were all so stupid, so the plot could not have been much worse. The author is only good at writing terrible books that nobody wants to read. I just found the plot and characters boring. I don't see how anyone would want to read this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had really high hopes for this book. It had been my favorite series for several years, and I had been looking forward to it since the beginning. I had my doubts, however.  When I began reading the first chapter, I was skeptical that it would live up to the rest of the series, but I persevered. The story was fast and exciting, and the characters were very well developed, even with some parts that were extremely cliche. However, after the first few chapters, I found myself reading the whole series.  I can't say that this novel is perfect, and if you read this book before the series was finished, you might be disappointed. However it was an interesting take on the series. I recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ This book is a waste of time. This book should have been called "How to be a lazy college student" or "How not to study." I can't even read the first chapter because I get a headache and my brain hurts. Why did you write a book about being lazy and how to be lazy. I thought I was going to be bored out of my mind trying to do my homework. I got to the end of the book and my eyes popped out of their sockets.   This book does not teach you how to use the computer. You have to read every chapter for about an hour before you actually use the software. It's just a waste, and it doesn't help you learn.     Do you know anything about how to code? I just want to know. I am a high school student, so I don't have a lot of time to read the books. I just go in and look at the code to see if I can figure out what it does and then make my own programs to do things for me.   and what does all of this stuff do?   it teaches me how to write code   and that's it.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I've read a lot of books and read this one on the first day. I hated it. The writing was sloppy, and the characters were terrible. I also had a hard time understanding some things that I had read. I was very surprised to find that there were many things I still didn't understand. This book was also really hard to listen to. I have never had a book that is as difficult to listen too as this one. It was really painful, but it was even worse in the end. --------------- (I found out that this is what happened. I will not mention any names but if you're reading this I will give you all the details. This is an amazing story but it didn't hold up to the book. The ending sucked and I think it's a waste of time. I found out a guy was involved in this.) This is a story about a boy that went back in time to try to save a girl he loves from some other kid's fate. I never actually knew anything about the story other than the first paragraph and some pictures. I thought this is a really cool idea but I was just bored by the story. I'm a fan of time traveling but this just wasn't it. My favorite part of the story was the ending. The boy was still alive so he could still change the past. But the guy's daughter wasn't the way she was supposed to be. She was a girl who wanted the guy to give her an apple. I wanted the girl to change but I just couldn't accept that. Maybe this was an attempt to show something. I wish they would have explained more about the kid and the girl's parents but I didn't feel like that was important to the story anyway. It wasn't very well thought out and I thought it could have been better. This might just be my opinion but I really wanted to love this story. ------------ (This is an awesome story and I loved it. It is also great! I'm going to read the other three books in the series to see how they end. So far I really loved it! This is the best book so far from the series and I will be buying every one from now on.) (This review contains spoilers for the first three books.) The boy in the story didn't want the girl in the past to be an apple in his mom's apple tree so he went back to the future. In the past he was in a dark cave with an ancient
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~This is a terrible book. It is an extremely biased and one sided story with no fact checking and was extremely boring.~~The author goes out of his way to try to prove the author is the victim and was unfairly blamed. She goes on to tell of a girl who was raped and was a victim all her life. She had the courage to come forward and talk about her situation. But the author then goes on saying all the wrong things to her, and how all men are horrible. She then goes over her attacker's life and is a good person for reporting this rape to the police. This is all an excuse for the author to paint a picture of women as all evil and bad people. It was the exact opposite of reality. In this entire book the author paints a picture that is full of lies and one-sided reporting, and just seems to be trying to make a case to get more money out of it.~~I don't get how the author would think this is a positive story and that it could be used as a positive example for women to look to.~~Overall: I think this book should have been labeled a fake book and the author should have had the honesty to admit it was a fake and take responsibility for her actions. ~~~~~~~~~

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. The best I have ever read.   5 out of 5 stars, Amy. This was really well done and the story kept you intrigued from start to finish. I found myself really liking and relating to the characters and I loved that the plot kept getting interesting and the pace never got slower. The narration by Kim Manners did a good job as well. The book is not too lengthy but you will be glad you read it. I will definitely read more of Kim M'Nanners works.   and... i think the author could have done with a bit more detail in the background of a few of the characters, but other than that i would highly recommend this book.  28 of 29 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ The Girl in the Road is not a book you should have read just because you are interested in the history of the Irish independence struggle. It is more likely to make you cringe than to inspire you. The book is filled with several factual errors and some false statements. A review for an Irish book on the Irish struggle is not likely to be popular, and the book is full of such mistakes. _________________________________________________ The Book is, however, one of the more interesting, detailed, and well-written Irish history books. I think it will be helpful to many of us, especially those who are not involved in the Irish National Liberation Movement. The title alone suggests it is for this group, but the book would be more at home as a general history of Irish nationalism, which may be very useful to both sides of this Irish conflict. This book, while being very detailed in its historical details, does have a bias. It portrays the Irish movement as being mainly made up of'sane, peaceful, and law-abiding' people who were fighting for the right to self-determination. I personally would have preferred to hear about what happened to people who took a different position or were involved in violence, but, that is just my own personal taste and does not reflect on the book itself. The Irish movement, as portrayed by this book, was a political movement that, when compared to the political movement of the United States in the 20th century, had much less violence and political involvement. As for the political aspect, the author makes this very clear. In the book he explains that, from the very beginning, the British had some problems with the Irish for wanting to secede from the United Kingdom. When the British tried to remove the rebellion from Ireland, this was not just to punish the Irish but to deter other people from following the example of the nationalists in Ireland. _________ If you are a student of Irish history, this is a great book to use as a reference to help you learn about Irish history. ______________________________  Review by: Gail Johnson on May 31, 2007 :  An excellent book. The author has researched her subject thoroughly and presents her facts well.   My only complaint is that the subtitle is misleading, it seems to imply that The Girl In The Road is a'mythical' account of a true story, which it is not, at all. In fact, this story is very real, although not much
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book. It was supposed to be a book that would help children and adults understand what happened to our country during WW II.  I have two daughters who are in their mid-20s now, and I have taught them the story of the battle of Normandy and how our country fought it.  They are still very young and are very interested in the war.  The story of Operation Overlord was not presented in a very logical manner, and the information they got was just too different than what I remember.   It was really hard to relate it to my own memories of the war because I know it is a completely different story.  After reading the book, my daughter asked me why we did not kill so many Germans and I told her, "because you do not know what the German soldiers were thinking". I wish I had been able to include that bit of info. The other problem with the information is the fact that most of the Germans were captured in a short time.  The Germans did not want to fight the Allies, and they all died.  There was no chance for a lot of soldiers to escape.  I felt that the information the book had was out of date, and it was disappointing.    Review from Amazon.com:     " It's a well written book that makes the reader feel like the soldiers and officers did.  Some of the book's stories could have used more details.  It would be nice if they had more of the French soldiers' memories.  If you know anything about World War II and Normandy, you'll want to read this book."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ The only negative review I have read that really deserves a 4 star rating is by a woman who found this book on Goodreads. It was a "one-time" purchase (a single copy) and she had read it in her spare time after working. The reason why she gave it four stars, was because her husband said it would be a "good stocking stuffer" as he would read it. She did not want to give it to him for the "good reason". In my opinion, this review was so very poor that I thought it deserved to be thrown out. But, I cannot give out bad reviews, and if it makes her happy, I am happy for her. It has nothing to do with her reading a book, as I'm sure it is a book with a different purpose. Her review is just so bad and so insulting to anyone who reads books for pleasure, I'm glad she threw it out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My opinion of this book is that the author made a lot of mistakes during the writing process. The first chapter was very good. I think that it shows what it is to write a book. I love that he had a lot to say in the beginning. But then he starts writing the chapters, which are all about character development of the characters, that make no sense to me. He is also very repetitive in the way he has put the stories together, and does not write much action. I guess he did not have much time to write the chapters. So, this is what I got from this book. The characters are not very original, there is no character development, and the plot is just a repetitive action-filled series of events. Also, there are lots of spelling and grammatical errors in the book. And then the last three or four chapters have a lot in common with the first two chapters. You know, one chapter is going on for a long time and another one ends with a big twist. There was also a lot more confusion in the last part than what is already in the first part, and I felt I was being cheated on. I felt this book was a waste of time. I do not recommend this book to people who want to be entertained with a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book seemed ok at the start but I felt it lost all its punch very fast.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received the audiobook for The Book of the Unjust in a Kindle edition. I had to listen to it on my computer on my way to work, as there was no way to listen on my portable player, and as I've read the book and the reviews that I had done, I knew I would not enjoy it. I thought the audio was quite bad for a self-published book, because there were a lot of errors in the language. I heard a lot, and there were lots of errors, even though it wasn't my first audio book.   The narration sounded pretty good, but I can tell I'm not the target market for this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________   This was an awful book, but I bought it for my husband for a birthday present. I liked it very much at the time, but when I was able to get it out of the package I had a very unpleasant experience. The first two pages were so bad, it made me want to throw the book out the window. The book contained so many mistakes, and so much bad information. I was very upset at the beginning of this book. When I started the book I was expecting to be blown away by the facts, but this was not the case. I had hoped that at least the authors would be truthful when describing the past. The author claims that the Cherokee were civilized. In reality they were a savage tribe and probably never lived as civilized a life as most whites. Also the Cherokees had to deal with more obstacles and problems during the 1700's than the American Indians ever did. The Cherokee also were constantly under attack by the English, Spanish, French, and even the Russians during their wars for dominance of the land. The Cherokees were able to defeat their foes by their own actions and the strength of their warriors, rather than their superior technology. The warlike behavior of the Cherokee was quite amazing to me.   The fact that this book is based on a single subject was a bad thing, and the lack of any information about the Cherokees from a historical point of view was also very unfortunate. The only thing the author had to support her views was the fact that Cherokee people had no written records. However there are many things which historians and archaeologists believe to be quite certain about the history of the Cherokies. The most important fact to consider is that when the English first arrived in the Cherokee Nation there were thousands of people and not only people but also animals living in these areas. We know now that this would be impossible because if there were so many people and animals living with the Cherokee there would have been no need for their ability to speak English. The fact that many Native Americans had to learn English, even if it was a simple language such as that spoken by the Cherokee, is something that many historians, archaeologists, and Native Americans would be hard pressed to accept.   the book states that the Cheroks "lived on the edge of an expanse of flat plain, dotted with tiny villages, and surrounded by vast forests, their crops of rice and corn were the property of white traders and planters." However the great plains of North America
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like it, and I'm a writer.   This book is about a high school student (a lot of her life is spent in her high school) who finds herself in a relationship with a new guy in the school who seems to be a lot smarter than she is. It doesn't last long. I think it's kind of a cheap romance; the author uses a lot of the same cliches about high school students being into younger guys. It was so bad it's funny. She makes it sound like some girl that would give up her entire life for some hot guy. Well, that's not what the book is really about at all, but that's how the author makes it seem like it is.  ... But at least she's good in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! Not a book I will read again. This is the first book by John Steinbeck to be published in over 80 years. It is one of the worst novels I've ever read. The writing is terrible. I don't care who says it's not true or is just a book for children. This book is a waste of everyone's time. The dialogue is not even interesting. I cannot get the characters to talk. There are very few parts I remember. This was my first time reading a book written in the 80s. I expected it to be better than the previous book, "This Land Is Your Land", which was about John Steinbecke's trip to Mexico.   There was a nice reference to the John Steinback's "The Pearl".   If it were a movie, this book would be at the bottom of the pile. It would be considered a movie "failure".   (The plot of "The Big Parade" is based on the events in "The Little Piano").
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------  "I read this book after finishing the book and after that I had not read the first book, and have only heard good things about this series. This book did not impress me. I am a fantasy author and I was never really into this genre. So, even though I had been looking for it, I never really wanted to read it, and was so disappointed when I did. I did enjoy the story of this book, but I'm sad that I have to write this down in the first place. I'm sorry that I found this story so boring."
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ 1. I felt like I was reading a book that I would not like because it was not interesting or even enjoyable for me. ____________________________________________________________________ 2. If I had not read the book, I probably would have stopped reading it. I am in no way anti-porn. I love porn and I feel like it is wonderful. _____________________________________ 3. I read it and my boyfriend says I must have really bad taste if I enjoy it so much. ______________________________ _____________________________ 4. The author was a great writer and the subject of this book, human sexuality, is really interesting.  "If you are a heterosexual person, you will never understand.  And if you are not, you need not try. If you are interested, read it." –from the back cover So I read this and it is a good book, it just isn't enjoyable for all readers. I will say that I do have a few good things to say about the author. First, he is really nice.  He knows what he is doing and he knows what to say to his readers. He is not preachy or angry. He makes it easy to understand and to learn. He doesn't just talk, but walks you through the book.  Second, he clearly wants his readers to think and read critically. He uses some really interesting language.  Third, he has interesting ideas about the nature of sex.  Fourth, he uses the word "sexual" in very precise ways, but only in very specific contexts, i.e. to describe what is going on in the sex act, not to describe something that is happening to you sexually.  Fifth, he makes his points with lots of references to his sources and also, in an interesting way, to literature.  Sixth, he doesn't shy away from making assumptions about his readers, or readers for that matter.  Seventh, he isn't a fundamentalist Christian, he just is an adult who wants to be a writer.  Eighth, he gets into the nitty gritty of writing, both good and bad.   Ninth, he addresses some of the social problems surrounding sexuality.  Tenth, and the most important reason I will rate this book with a 4, he does what is necessary to make his point clear.    Here is a list of my criticisms:  1. He does not tell you what sex is like until the last chapter (in a very
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________ I love that the books don't suck. It's just that some of the books in this book series are really crappy and the author should know that. The first book, I bought to have a book with a good protagonist and the rest of the series, I got because of the premise of a female protagonist. I was looking for a character that didn't have superpowers and I thought she was pretty well written. The book, starts off strong, but it eventually turns into a boring series of books. The beginning books is pretty good, but the later books in the series have some really bad plot. I will rate this series for one thing; it's pretty fun to read and I would recommend it to anybody that likes books and science fiction.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book! I loved the way he told it, how he told you how the world worked, how it's all interconnected, how every thing that has a name has something to do with someplace else, and how a little piece of the puzzle, an isolated detail, can bring up a whole new picture of what happened. It was like watching a movie with subtitles, with a little dialogue at the end that explains a little bit of the story and helps you get a clearer picture of how the whole thing fits together, instead of having the whole story explained in a book.   He explained it as if he knew, because he knows things, and he told a story that was very well told, and as I said before, it was one of the best books I have read so far this year.   a story told like a movie.   I got everything I needed to know from this book. The story is told like if a film director told you the whole plot of the movie, and explained each scene, the characters, how the story went and how it was all connected, and you got it. And in the end, it made sense! The ending was very satisfying, and I loved it!  The characters are realistic, and the plot is real! A movie like this would never be made if it was just some guy telling it as he did. You have to know the whole picture. It wasn't the way I expected this story to go, but it turned out so great. It made me feel like I was there!
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   The writing is absolutely terrible, even the good parts of the book. The plot is nothing new, with some elements of old vampire and werewolf stories, but this one takes it to a whole new level. This is one of the few books I read that was not bad from beginning to end, even though I have read way worse. If the writing could have been a little bit better I think it would have made this book worth it. Also, I can't help but note that there are many other vampires that I never saw coming.   It's really hard to find books like this, but if you love vampires and the supernatural I highly recommend this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book: y  I read the book with an open mind and I was not disappointed at all.

There he meets and falls in love with a woman there.  .     He lives in a country that was the same time as Rome, the Roman Empire. I found the historical accuracy and the description of the places in this part of the book interesting and believable.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I was expecting more from this book. My son has autism, and I think he might have autism-related memory problems. We've read books about memory. It's not like he can't tell the difference between objects. But he could barely follow along in this book (and the story didn't get very far into his memory problems). My son's memory was always excellent. He's able to put a book down. But this book is terrible. I think my son was supposed to just think he had autism-linked memory problems and it was just a matter of him not being able to remember it all. Instead, it was a mess that he couldn't make sense of. I have high expectations for this book for my son's sake. But I am really disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a waste of my time and money. This book is nothing but a drivel that contains absolutely nothing of interest, not the least of which is the fact that this book has been described as "incomprehensible".   I'm not sure if I'm one of the few reviewers to get through the entire book or if others are not seeing it. It's really a non-story but the story isn't good at all and there is no character development.   The author never shows or reveals anything of interest. Nothing new is learned about the world, the characters, the plot or the characters' motivations. It is all the same old nonsense about "unlocking" the true nature of the "God," the same as the rest of the books on this list.   "The Story" consists of a "diary" of an Indian girl, Jeevan, who was taken from her home at the age of ten and brought to America. Her diary is a mixture of poetry, memories, anecdotes and other bits of useless, worthless, worthless fluff. All this has been written down by a "mute Indian" with a broken English. (There is no Indian writing in this book, not even a whisper of a native speaker.)   Jeevan tells the diary as if it were a true story. There are no errors. She doesn't change anything. She tells the story as it is, with the same names as the previous books on the list. Jeevans words were never changed. (In fact, there are many changes.) She writes "I remember that once I heard the drum and the call of the wild horses as I walked with my father in the wilderness, and it felt like a very old dream." But the same line is found in the previous versions of this story written by different Indians. "I can't remember it being that way," she writes in a different version. There is not the slightest hint of truth in this "diaries."   "I heard the call in the night" is from the previous version of this same story. This time she writes "but I also heard the old call." This changes nothing. The same line exists in the earlier version. This one is almost identical. It changes nothing but it changes nothing in my opinion. This "journal" should have been rewritten to "old call," which would have been more accurate. (I know, it's impossible to change

Write a negative review about a bad book:.................................................. 5 of 5 stars  I have listened to this book at least four times now, and each time I have been moved to write a review. The book is a very emotional read and the message has touched me many times. The story is one of an alcoholic and his wife, who suffers from drug and alcohol addiction. The wife is trying to take her life, and the husband is trying so hard to be a good father that he is driven to drink and do drugs and lose all reason. It is a real tragic story, and I felt it was not a happy one. There are a few moments of humor, but most of the book is just a heart-wrenching tale of a broken marriage and an addict trying to make a new beginning.   I am giving this book 5 stars out of 5 because I am happy the author was able to get the message across through his work and how it affected me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so far from the book I was expecting it to be that I'm not going to pick it up or read it at all, I'm going to wait for the next one.  I expected it to have an extra chapter of description of the setting (since there was a whole book about it, there was nothing new in this book) but it didn't.   I just want to know what they did with the setting in this next book, I want to see that they tried to give it a unique feel and didn't just repeat the ideas that they had already (I wanted the world to look different, not that they gave it a similar look)
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ My review: -------------------------- This is the last book I read from my father before his passing. This was a heartbreaking book to read, but one that really had me reflecting on the end of my father's life. My father suffered from alcoholism and a host of medical issues for a number of years, and although he was in and out of rehab for the last ten years, he never really recovered. During this time, my mother had his care, but she could never quite take care of him as much as I could, and she often found herself depressed, angry, and depressed. This book was a very tough read for me to follow. It was also a very difficult book to review, as my emotional responses were very different. This could have been a wonderful book if it had been written by someone else, but I felt that my father needed to be able to share his personal experience in a way that people who have dealt with this issue could understand. It is certainly an honest and truthful book about his own personal experiences. His struggles and feelings are the only way he can share them, and they were the only words that came to mind when I read this book. I recommend this book to anyone with a family member struggling with these issues, but especially to those of us who do not have the benefit of family or friends who have suffered with this problem. It does not get much more personal than this. Thank you for this honest account and for sharing it with us. This is a very powerful book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt this was an inferior edition of the first book because of all the errors and the formatting of the text. I found the errors so annoying that I had to stop reading. Also, the story felt rushed to me, and it didn't feel like there were any twists in the plot. The characters were really flat and didn't add anything to the plot besides their appearance and personality. I also found it hard to relate to the characters because they had no personal lives (which I agree with) - they're just a bunch of characters that appear in the story.   Overall, I didn't like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The last half of the book is just more of the same crap as in the first half.  This part of the story is boring.   It goes on like this for pages and pages:     I am going to tell you what happens next.  There are so many different characters.  They are all so annoying.  I mean,     I can't even tell you how many times they make comments that I know have nothing to do with the plot.  Then they have another scene which is just the same.   and yet again there is another comment.  The most boring part of this book.  It's not like the author is in any kind of a hurry.  She is just writing the same things over and over and expecting a different result.  What a waste of time.  Even if you read this in the last half (or the first), you will still be bored by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! A very good book, but there are some serious problems with its presentation. The most serious problem is that the author has no idea of how to present an argument (or a story). I've been an academic for over 35 years and a professor for more, and I have never read a book that made me doubt the validity of its argument in the way this one did. (Not that the arguments are weak, but the presentation is not good.) And this book is written at a very high level of scholarship, and its arguments are often so complex that they are almost mind-boggling. The author even discusses a couple of the theories of quantum physics in a very clear way (as do other reviewers) and this made me think "Yes, he is really a professional scientist and can do science very well." I did not expect a book in this genre to be written in such a way.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  it was over priced. I thought I was getting some real book! This was an old copy that had not been read in many years.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~This book was an absolute disappointment, I really wanted to like this book, but it was so poorly written, it wasn't fun at all. In the book, there are several main characters, one is the evil witch and the other is a little boy and they are forced to team up against her. I have never seen a worse villain ever, so much of it was written in an extremely stereotypical way. It had several characters that were completely different from one another, some of the characters were in the wrong place, they were never the main character's friend or loved one, they always had their own agenda and they were just there to be used. I would give it two stars, because the characters in this book are different from each other. The characters in the story in general had very boring dialogue, it was only used for the main characters to act silly. The best thing about this book was that the book didn't have any magic or anything magical, so it didn't make the world seem like a crappy and horrible place to live in. In my opinion, this book should have been one or two stars. So, to sum it up, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody, even if you are looking for a fun adventure, you will not find that in this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********   This book was absolutely useless. It was written by a guy who wrote the bad book that inspired me to start writing my own. I am going to get a real life job. It is very difficult to find a good writer with a book like this. The only other book about what I went through is the bad books by the author. I read this book because I read a good book by the other guy and I was looking for a good one. I hope this book was helpful to those who have been through what I did. It has helped me out a lot. The guy has a good story. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has gone through what the author has gone though. This book can not be a true representation of how to end a relationship.   If you have gone through divorce and you would like a real advice book about how to survive the hell of divorce, you should give this book a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book: y bad. It was a very boring book, the author is very lame with the way he writes and is very unprofessional, so this book sucks.

It is like trying to listen to a bad radio show.    The voice and the content are so off putting it makes me want to skip it as quickly as possible.  I tried to get the book out of my head but I just couldn't get the mental images out of there.  If this was a movie this book would be a 1 star movie, a 3 star movie and a 6 or 7 star movie. Rating for this book is a 3.5 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is too confusing. It makes it seem like a book about a child with a heart condition. I wish the authors had focused on the child and the family and how they cope with the child's condition. It is all in the middle and a bit hard to follow. Overall:    It is a very interesting book about the effects of heart disease and the impact on family members, even though the family's main focus is the child. It could have been a great story, but as is, I found it hard to like and didn't care for it very much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It took me several hours to finish this book. After an hour of reading I became very frustrated, my mind was still reeling from the last couple chapters. It's a really bad book. I read this book to learn how to use the google translate feature in my phone to translate anything, I figured that it would help with my Spanish and I really hope it works. I guess it does, but in the end it just made me feel stupid."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title is a perfect description of this book! There are no real surprises that I can think of. You do get more information about the background of what is going on but only if you want to, and that's it. It's the kind of book where it really doesn't matter what your reaction is. I couldn't see this book being very interesting, but it's actually a very disappointing book. This book is actually a "How To Get In" kind of guide that is only interesting for some of the people who read this book. If you want the real answers from someone who has made a career out of selling what the market needs, this book won't do anything for you. It really has no impact on the way I work or approach any of the things I do. The only reason I keep it on the shelves is because I'm curious and it gives me ideas. The main problems I have with this book are that it's so wordy and is written as though it's a pamphlet. That's the best word I can come up with to describe it, although I think that would be a bit better. If I was a real writer and I had an entire book written about a topic that interests me, this is what I'd call it. A more interesting description would be that it was all a big hype. There's a lot of bad advice and you're basically reading the same advice over and over again, except in more technical terms that you may not be able to follow. I don't know why it was put together, but I think this is a terrible marketing ploy by the authors who thought that people would love the book but that they'd read it anyway, because it's the only book written by someone who sold what the marketing is selling.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!I love the story of the character, especially the way she comes across and how the author writes about her in an incredibly relatable way. I also like the description of the people she meets in the city that seems like they could be a good fit for her character.However, the way the story is told is frustrating. It's just sooooo slow and the pacing is just so slow and it's so slow I want to know what the plot is about and why it's taking so long to get where it needs to be.I mean, I get it, it's very obvious, but how can you just keep telling me about the character? And why does it seem like there's so much going on that doesn't make any sense? How many people is she meeting with and how is it always mentioned that it's because she's a foreigner? And what's up with the whole love triangle with the people that have a hand in her situation? I mean, if it's all to make her come across as relatable then the story really needs to stop and just get started and get going.I can't believe the author didn't even think about writing a non-love triangle-like plot that would make it less of a slog. Just tell me how the character is doing and how things are going and I can go from there. I'm not going to feel like I'm being spoon-fed because this was just the first book I read, and I just didn't feel like there was enough information to go on from this book to the next one.I think that if I wasn't so attached to this author, I would have given the book a 1 star rating and tossed it into the bin. I have a bad feeling about this book because I'm pretty sure I'm just going to forget it ever existed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I think most of us at one time or another have felt that a particular book didn't 'click' with us. When it doesn't we have to stop and re-read the book from beginning to end to find out if we had any good things to say about it. However I don't think that is the case with this book. There were many things about the novel that I loved, but the character writing was the biggest thing that was annoying me, not that the writing itself was bad, just the characterisation. The only character I didn't like, but I don' t really care for her, was the villainess that is in this novel.   Overall I will probably read more of these books but in the end I felt like I was being taken on a ride by the author.   and I thought I was a bad person for giving this novel three stars because I think I will try and read the sequel and see how the story turns out.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   When I opened this book, it was so bad that I had to go back a second time to make sure I didn't get the book wrong. It was just so terribly written! It was boring, it had no plot, and it had absolutely no depth. The main character was totally one dimensional, and there was not a single character who did anything interesting. The writing was absolutely terrible, and the entire thing just made me want to throw the book away and never give it a chance. The reason this book was so badly written was because of how bad the book really is.   It starts out by telling us that the world we are in is called the 'Land of Magic'. It is a land that is very small, and has some very odd people. The people in the Land of Magic are kind, kind, good people, but the Land is also full of danger and mystery. As you read, the more you find out about the Land, the bigger the danger becomes. The Land is constantly in danger, and its people are constantly being hunted. The way the story is written, it becomes a very slow and boring story. The characters are extremely one dimensional and have no depth or personality. The story never does anything to change the tone or change the characters. Instead, the story starts to become a long boring story that just doesn't do anything except make you think.   (I did not finish this book in one sitting)   I am completely confused. The book was not at all what I was expecting. This book is a very bad book, and I didn`t like it one bit! It did not have any plot, no characters, no depth, and not one character who was interesting. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's a very boring story with no substance and no depth!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book several times. I have finished it several times and the same thing happens.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading this book for several years after I got my first hardcover copy from a bookstore in a second hand store. I'm now in the process of getting a third paperback copy of it back.    I read this book in 2006 when I was a high school sophomore. I think the fact that it is the first book in a series helped me fall for this book. I really liked this series though, especially because I think it really did a great job of making the main character feel real and not just a stereotype or personification of something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was okay, if you can't handle the subject matter, just leave it out of the reviews and just skip this one!   I've been doing a lot of research on the history of the Bible and I just couldn't get past the fact that the God of the Old Testament was a misogynist. If he didn't believe in women having authority over men, why would he appoint women to be high priests and make the Israelites walk through fire on Mount Sinai? This book is basically about one of the last prophets in the Old Testament, so a lot is taken from him. I also found this book to be a good historical look at what God really thinks about gender roles.   So, the book was interesting, if I didn't have any prior knowledge about the topic. It was short and had a couple of chapters about the history before the Bible was written. The author also did a great job of making the author feel like a character in her own story.   the story is told from the point of view of the Prophet, which is a really interesting move for a book about the Bible. The book isn't boring at all and I did get the sense that there were really interesting lessons to be found here.   (Read it, but skip it if you're looking for an unbiased history of women in the Bible)
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read this book and thought it was one of the best reads of the year. I would recommend this book for anyone. It's a very nice and well written novel, with a good plot. I did feel as though this book was rushed, as it has chapters that are about 20% of the total book, as well as the fact that the character development took place very quickly. I also did feel that the plot was a little rushed, and the author tried to rush it out. This novel does contain violence and it does contain drug use. But it also includes some very positive things, such as a strong character (the woman), a wonderful sense of justice and empathy for others, and a nice ending. And even though this novel was a first time reader, I found it to be enjoyable, and I would definitely recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************* My daughter read this book back in the 90s but since it was all over the internet, she never finished it. I'm so glad she finally found it and read it for me. I found the main story boring at times, the characters are not very likable. There are times when they are so self-centered, you can't sympathize with them. It's just not funny or enjoyable. So I gave the book 2 stars only because I am an easy going person, if you don't like it, just don't read it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ My wife read this book in a week and a half and loved it, but she was very disappointed with it. I am a very skeptical person when it comes to things like this. My husband likes science and he has no problem with science fiction, but the way this book was written was very confusing. There were times when I was just a bit confused about what was going on and I could not understand what was happening. It was difficult to understand how the different characters were connected to each other at times. I did not understand who exactly the main antagonist was and I also could not figure out who or what the key player was in the story. One of the major themes of the book was about what happened to the people that fell under the spell of the demon, but who was responsible for doing that to them and why. I don't really know what this story is about, and it didn't take me very long to realize that. One thing that I really did like was the characters. I really felt sorry for them. I felt like they did have a lot to overcome, but they were determined and they were not afraid. I also felt that there was something wrong with their father. He seemed very old, and he seemed to have lost a lot of himself. He was very stern and very harsh. I could definitely relate to him and I really enjoyed his character. There was another character in the book that I had trouble with. She seemed like she was being used by the antagonist. It made me very nervous for her and I thought that she was going to die at some point. I do not like to be manipulated by the book or by movies. I like to do my own research. I have never read anything like this before, so I really had no idea what to expect from it. The book is set in the year 2012 and is set around two major events. One is a war between the two religions in the world, one is a massive explosion that is going to destroy a large portion of the planet. I will leave out the rest of the details, but you really do not need to know any more about the plot. I think that most people will be able to enjoy the book if they can overlook the bad parts. I can say that I enjoyed the book, but my wife thought that it was really annoying and a real waste of time. She did like the first half of it, and I did enjoy the second half, but I found it
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I have been a fan of the author since she wrote the first book, and I was happy to see she had kept her promise.   However, I am very disappointed in this book, because it doesn't live up to her quality. It is a very bad book. I feel as if I have read all of her works, but I am not happy with her.     The main thing that annoyed me is her use of the word, "it".   I read the book to her and we discussed, and she said, "no, the word "it" can come at the beginning of a sentence. I thought she had fixed the problem, but after the book had been read to me again, I thought it was still there.   the second main thing is that the plot is poor. We get a glimpse of her story about her past and we find out who her father was, and it is obvious that there are secrets. So there is a plot, but it is not a very good one.   This is one of those books that needs to be reread and re-read.   in short, this book is rubbish, and if you like horror, you will like this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to get this book in the mail today that I tore into it before I even got it opened. I know, I know. I am not in the mood for a romance story. I was in the book though. I loved the romance, the character development, the storyline, and the humor in this book. I felt like it was a great book. It really is. This book isn't just about the romance. There is lots of fun in the story. But when it comes to that, I am sorry to say that I am having an issue with the romance of this book as well. I feel like it's not good enough. Not really, it isn't. It's the type of romance you can enjoy by itself, but I am pretty sure that many others out there would disagree. However, it is a fun book, with fun scenes. I think that it's just that there are two characters (Jill and Jamey) that I don't really enjoy, and they keep bringing each other into this romance. And this romance just doesn't work for me. It isn't because they are different characters, it's because the romance doesn't make sense for them. Jill is a very serious, very logical, very mature woman. She has a really good job, a big family, has everything going for her, and is very happy. She is also not a very romantic woman at all. She isn't wild, sexy, or anything else that I can see the appeal in. Jill's character doesn't have many things going for it either. She's not a fun person, she's not adventurous, and she's kind of plain, and dull. Jame and Jill are a couple, and I feel they are a good couple because they're together, but there's just something about their personalities that keeps me from liking them much. Jad (Jamey's husband) is a nice guy, and a bit of a goody two shoes. He's a hard worker, kind, and honest, and he is a good father. He has a nice home with a wife, a daughter, and two nice dogs. Unfortunately, Jad doesn't really seem to like Jill much, so there's little romance to it. And that's ok with me, because I actually don't like Jill very much. But they're a good pair, so it's ok that they have their romance. The story is very fun
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ I loved the story line. It was very well thought out and told. I am disappointed in the lack of detail of the author in how she had it written. It's obvious that she didn't have a high school education. She also used many terms I have never heard of. And I don't think the people she describes are real. The stories were so well thought of and told that I was really interested in what happened to the characters. I had high hopes for this book but I am pretty sure the characters and story are just going to be thrown away in the last 2 chapters. That is a disappointment. I will not be reading another book by that author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a huge fan of the X-Men (yes, yes, I am a huge X-Man fan, so I know how much I love it) and X-Factor (yes I do like X-factor, I just do not have much of a problem with the plotline, for which I am grateful because I had to look for my copy of the original in a bookstore once or twice) I was extremely disappointed that these books are just an exercise in writing, characters and action set-pieces. I really enjoyed the Marvel Universe and had hoped for some actual character development, but it all was just a series of set pieces. I'm pretty sure this series was the only reason I kept up with comics for awhile! Maybe it's because I'm the worst X-Writer, but the book was a big disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to read this book so bad. I had already read this one. It was the only book that I wanted at the time. I tried for a few years to get past it.  I loved the book.  The idea of using technology to make your world a better place was appealing, and I even read the book before. What I didn't like about it was the writing style. It feels rushed.   One thing that bothered me was the constant need to add info to the back of the book when something else happened in the book that was important.  There is too much "just in case" information that is not needed.  If you are expecting the usual books you are getting now, this is NOT for you.

I loved it when the book was about Kitty's escape from the asylum, but I just didn't think this book was as good. I have heard that this book may be re-edited or rewritten, which may make this an even better read. I'll update this review when I know more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book and was very disappointed by the book, it was very difficult to put together.  It took a great deal of time for me to put it together and I got distracted very easily.    My only saving grace was the description, I found it a great description of what we're going through in these last days of our life, not an unpleasant one at all.  I recommend this book to those that like a little spiritual advice in the evening and don't like the feeling that they may not be living in a true spiritual way.  I was really happy with the story and the description of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I got this book to read with my 11 yr old son for a story time. As a family, we like books to be fun, so we always read and write reviews. As my son read the book, he kept stopping to comment about how bad the plot was. I was able to find a number of reviews where people rated the story poor, but the plot poor was just not the issue. After all, it was only a kids book. As I started to read the actual book, I was so upset that I could not stop thinking about the plot. The kids in this book had to live with their parents, and their parents were all evil. I also thought the dialogue was terrible. Not bad, but just not at all. I ended up putting the book down and walking away from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!It was not good, but it was good enough to leave in a hard drive without my wife ever knowing that I read it or anything.It was like watching a movie I can only imagine how long it took. The narrator's voice was pretty nice and I think there were some funny moments.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the whole thing started to get really old real fast, but that is just me thinking of my other books and that is not the point. It was not a bad read at all. I will definetly pick it up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ I did not enjoy this book at all. It is a very dull, boring, and slow novel and it doesn't seem to be set in the present day. You really have to read it slowly to understand much of what is going on in this book, and the slow pacing and dullness of it is very annoying. The book is also very confusing because it tries to explain a lot of things, but not all of it and seems to be trying to tell more and more about the past and the past people as the plot continues. The whole premise is also kinda weird and doesn't work at all, in the end. The author seems to really just want to tell her story and doesn`t care about having anything to add to it whatsoever, she just wants to write and be famous. She just tries to use old and unknown terms for things because they are 'cool' but it doesn`sn't make sense or connect to anything, and I don`t understand why anyone would use these things unless it was really important, and it still doesn`'t make any sense. But, I don't dislike it at all because it is only 4 chapters long. It`s a very boring and boring novel. I`m not sure how much I liked this novel, but I really didn`t like it at the very least.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................   I don't normally read any of these books, but I found this one interesting, as I don't think I've ever read about a human being being who is so willing to take part in the most extreme human rights violation - and not even in the middle ages.   It's quite interesting to see how much he cares about other people. Not that he was willing to help a lot of the people in his family, but it's very interesting to read how his actions impacted a family.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________ I tried to give this book 3 stars because it wasn't as good as I hoped. But, as I read the last pages of the book, I just sat there and screamed "WHY CAN'T YOU STOP DOING THIS!!!!". There are so many stories about this woman...she is so amazing and so kind and so funny that I thought her story was so sad. She is a great example of a woman who's "job" is to do something for someone else. I'm sure you are reading a story like this on the internet and you are feeling guilty about helping somebody out. That is where I had the hardest time in this book. I can't say this is all of the stories about her but it's so many. There are other stories about the time when she helped a woman get a baby for her...that was one of the best things I've ever read. If you want to make somebody else's life a little easier or help them make their life a bit easier, this book will help you...in so many ways.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~~ I was given a hard copy of this by a reader for my birthday, and I was not happy with this book. I have very little to say about this book, other than I enjoyed it so much I actually have to say I was upset about the bad review. ~~~~   A book for people who want to learn about "what it's really like to be in the room with the top men in music" or "what goes on in the studio with the big-name producers and musicians."   This book is full of stories about recording sessions and studio meetings with various producers and the artists who have had a hand in their creation. I especially liked the section on producer-artist collaborations:    "There are two reasons for this: first, because most of the collaborations I've heard about are just that: they happen. They can be wonderful, but they never last. The other reason is that most of these collaborations are really bad. They're awkward. They come and go, often with no real payoff to anyone involved in them, and they often happen over and over again. These are the sort of collaborations that, once the music is finished, the people involved in the project have to decide whether they want to continue on the same road or if they want something different... [The producer] might have the idea of mixing a song, then record and cut another track that sounds a little different. And so on. But the person who works on the song, having heard this new mix, is likely to feel like he or she has done better than the original version. He or she might take the two tracks in and decide to record and release the new track in its own right. The person who's doing the mixing and the person working on the new version may come to some other decision; but the idea, for the artist in the end, is to create something completely different."   that's from chapter 13. i loved it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was very bad. I think that some things are written as a joke, which is funny. I don't think that many people would be that upset about a book with a few jokes in it, though. But this one was very different.  I don't know why the author decided to include all of those jokes.  I think he is making fun of all the people that read this book.  It just seems like the author is really bitter towards the readers of this book, so that was really annoying.   The writing was horrible.  Even for me, it was very hard to read.  There are some people that say that this book would work in a high school setting, but for me that was not true.  For me it did not work as well because I am a high-schooler, but if you are a highschooler you probably would not hate this book!   I had to keep turning the pages to see if I had missed something.  The only thing I liked about the writing was how the author did not forget anything.  He wrote the whole book very fast, like he had to write the whole thing in one night, but he did not.  If I have to pick a winner for this one, I would say that I liked the author's humor more than the writing.  What was your favorite scene of the book? 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I read this book a year ago in a group at work. Our boss said we had to do a paper in the library and I told him I couldn't get through it because the book was too old. So he made up a list of stuff I didn't like. The only good thing about this book is that there is so little. I couldn´t find anything else that was similar to it but I don´t know how to put it. ********
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character doesn't have a life. I felt very bored and frustrated by this book. The last chapter felt like a rehash of the previous chapters.  I didn't really like it at all.   The next book in the series is called "The Book of the War."   
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********This book was a waste of money. The content of the book was extremely poor and it just seemed like a poor attempt to make a big name for themselves in the field of psychology. They don't seem to have read any of the literature on their subjects, which was bad because they weren't good at writing. I got a bad result in the test and was told there were no answers in the book. The author didn't really explain anything and seemed to be just looking for an excuse to teach his class what he thought was the truth about what was going on. The book just wasn't a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book more than I did. It was full of good things, but the only good thing I found was the "tribute" to a well-known film. I loved the cover, and the "movie" it was "tributing" to is really interesting. But I found the "plot" less interesting than I thought it would be. It is more of a "detective story" than a true-crime story, but it doesn't really solve a mystery for me. The writing was ok, and I like that the writer is a college student who wanted to be an investigative journalist. And the cover does make it look like an actual detective story. But other than that, it is just boring, not interesting at all, and not very well thought out.   It is the "pumpkin spice latte" of crime novels, the "coffee shop" of a crime novel, and that is not worth your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This is one of the worst books I have ever read, and my friends think I'm a weirdo. I can't get the gist of it and don't feel the need to keep going through it as I'm already sick of it. This is definitely not a book for you. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve his or her reading ability.

If you are in the same situation and don't want to be a loser, buy it.  Read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I don't know if I can say the title of this book is a negative, but I think the entire book is. If you have never read a romance/seduced/humped a woman who was NOT into you and who you're just NOT attracted to, you will be extremely disappointed with the results.   The main character has a great, powerful, beautiful, intelligent, beautiful and handsome man who is trying to woo her, and who was rejected by her the previous year. Her boyfriend at the time has been dating a guy for a year and a half who is actually a MUCH better looking, more confident, and much funnier person. And the two of them started talking and making out and stuff... They have a lot of fun together. The guy eventually leaves her because he feels she didn't give him enough attention, even though she always gave him attention and she was the one who convinced him to date her.   (And her boyfriend is very happy because he got a date, he got to have a great time with a great person, he also got to date a girl who really liked him.)   So here comes the part where she is forced to choose between the good, handsome, good looking guy she had been dating this entire time, and the guy he had been talking to. She has a lot more friends who are very interested in her, she has never told anyone she was looking for a relationship. She decides to ask the boyfriend out, but before that, she wants to see if her friends really do have any interest in her. It turns out they do.   and they actually give her a lot MORE attention than she had gotten from the boyfriend, they all had a great big party for her, they said that she should take off her dress, and all of them complimented her. And there was even a picture of her with them and she laughed and she said she was pretty happy that they treated her nice. She was also told by her girlfriends that she looks pretty cute in her dress. But her ex did not, she said, he was wearing jeans and a T shirt and he looked hot in both of those things.     At the end of the party, her ex and her other friends all come over to her apartment because they have to talk to her about things... and she tells them that she is in love with him. And they say, no, you're not in love and you need to go home.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a travesty of the art of book reviews. It reads like an ad for the author, and it is. It is an advert for The Book Of My Life, a book about a woman, with a lot of details about her life, and how her life has changed because of a stroke she had a few years back. The author's first book, a biography of a great philosopher named Marcus Aurelius, has not one but several sections that are about how the author's life was changed by the stroke, and also her relationship with her beloved husband, who died of the same stroke. The same goes for the second book. I can't tell you how many times I had to stop and say, "What?!?". So, yes, she was really the greatest person that ever lived. Also, her life changed after that stroke, but that's not the subject of this book. Also... there is no way I could put down this book, as I have read a lot about her and I really love her!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The first hundred pages are just horrible - it goes into the characters and their backstories with absolutely no development at all - and then it does a 180 and spends all the next fifty or so pages in an in-depth story that makes absolutely no sense."   I really liked the first 100 pages of this book, the first third is interesting and well-done. As I mentioned before, though, this is all thrown away in the middle of the book.   A bit about the author: He was previously a graduate student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I didn't know this at the time, but I am so happy that I got to know him when I was getting ready to write a review. He's really smart, and has a very good, clear writing style. He seems to be very intelligent, but this book didn't have anything to do with him being intelligent.   the main character is a kid, but the author seems to think that it's okay to have a kid in an adult's story.   in chapter two the main characters have a conversation that has absolutely nothing to do the characters.   of course, they had to set up the characters' backstories.  's main character spends the entire book trying to get her parents to accept that her brother is gay, to no avail, and then her parents' lives get wrecked because of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review of The Last Kingdom - A Novel  by John Guy   It seemed like a great book when I first started, and I found myself rereading it over and over. Unfortunately, after several rereads, I found that it fell apart. The writing style is not very interesting to me, and the story starts to get more complicated as the novel progresses. The characters feel very flat and forgettable. The ending left me disappointed, and it also left me with questions as to the true ending. The author does make some great points in his own worldbuilding, and makes me want to go back and find out what's going on, but in the end, his story just falls apart.   I think I can say that I won't be reading anything by John Guy.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I really wanted to like this book. ******** It was supposed to be a novel about a soldier returning from war.  The only problem was that it didn't come off like one.    The writing style is very stiff.    It sounds like the author has never done any work in a real book.   In the beginning of the book the author states that he wrote the book in three hours.  He states that the writing style was "like the most perfect writing on the walls in the world.   The "words" of the text are also very stiff and not readable.  It looks like the writing is "written in stone."       The characters are also extremely stiff. They were written with as much thought as a car mechanic would put into putting in a new engine, but the author never used any of that in his writing.  They had no personality.  The character development seems to have been done so that they are perfect just so that the author can have his character's death in a way that makes the book easier to read.  This is not a good way to go about writing characters that have to die.    This book is also very confusing.  In fact, it took me the better part of my first night to find what happened to the characters.  And even then it was hard to figure it out.  There was a section where he described how a "strange and very violent death" had occurred.  But when I read it, I understood that this was just a description of the death of one of his characters. So the description of his "strangeness" just did not make any sense to me.  I think he should have included more in the description.  If you read this book, just remember that there is a lot of missing information.  I really wanted this book to be good.  Instead of it being a good story about a man who returns from war, it is just another book that has a lot in common with the "Bestselling" books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read all of this so far, and I love the idea of the book. So many people seem to love this novel, so I want to see where it goes from here. The problem I have with the book is that there is no conflict in the plot, no drama. This story has no meaning.   When this book was released, I thought it would be some kind of dark comedy, but then it gets dark, and then it is funny again, and a bit darker, and suddenly it is a bit ridiculous. I'm not even sure that this is supposed to be a dark comedy. I am also not sure what the big deal is. All I can see is that this book is very derivative and very generic.  In the story, two characters, a girl and a boy, have to take care of their brother who is stuck in a mental institution. The only problem is that they cannot understand why their brother is in that institution.  There is an issue of abuse, and this is the real cause of the mental institution's existence. They need the child, but he does not want to go to the institution. So he does things to the child that is not good, and the mental hospital is just a bad home.  The two characters have no connection with each other except that they love the child who is being abused by his brother, so they both do the best they can to help the child.   But it is not until they learn about the institution and how abusive it is that their relationship develops. Then things go from bad to worse and the story just becomes ridiculous.  For me, the story went from bad, to not so bad, and now, I don't know what to think.  I wish that the book would have been a bit more original. If you like this book, then I suggest you check out other books by the author to see if there is any more to this story.  A good way to keep this book interesting is to reread it with different characters and with different settings and so on. It is a lot of fun to read a good book, but this one was just too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can only give it three stars. I will not be buying any other book by this author and hope she learns her lesson in the future.   My kids were absolutely bored the entire time, and when I was done they were so upset.  So I decided to give this book a pass. I'm sorry I waited to see how the kids were going to react, but I'm sure I'll be watching the book on TV instead of reading it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mmahmahr from Great story for kids! The teacher in this book is so sweet and funny. She has great things to say and she tells her students the best parts of the story. She gives us some great examples of the best and worst things in life, but she keeps it to a level. The teacher also gives us a few facts about the Bible and teaches them how to read it correctly and understand the word. The book also makes fun of God and Satan and the things they say and do. The kids are so excited to be reading this book. I recommend this book to any kids out there. It was fun to read with the kids. My 2 1/2 year old son absolutely loved it!  Loving the Bible, but the Bible gets a B+ at best. I wish the book had a different theme or story to keep things interesting. .  of 6 kids found this review helpful.  is it really just a story? i think so. is this an accurate depiction of the world as it was in ancient times or are you just trying to get kids to pray? is it true what they say that we were the 'new world'? does that mean that the children's story is accurate? no, there's a lot of contradictions in the story about where our land came from, why we had to live in caves and what they did to us? i would be very surprised if the stories were true.  you're using a different setting than where the bible actually came from. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________   I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I was excited about the possibility of reading this because I love the world of The Lord of the Rings. I love everything Tolkien, and this was definitely a perfect fit. The story started off with a prologue that set up the story that followed in the middle.   In the prologue, we meet a beautiful lady named Amys who is in the company of an elf. He is named Foul-mouthed and arrogant, yet he can't help but be attracted to Amys. Foul has always seemed to be the most important person in her life. He takes her everywhere with him, even when they go to the city of Mordor, the land of evil and where Sauron's army lies.   this is the second chapter I've read, and it was the weakest of the story. It's really just filler from where I was at in the story, and didn't interest me at all. I don't think I'll read this chapter again, not even for the book itself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book from the library on loan. I don't have kids and didn't expect it to be entertaining. I thought it was just another kids' book. I wanted to like it but it just wasn't that interesting. And it's just too bad that the illustrations are terrible and the story itself was a bit too long to be read in a week.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is a bad story with no substance to it. The main character is very stupid and a very stupid person who makes mistakes that lead to disaster. He can't do anything right.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- --------------- It's very strange to read a book about a man who died on a rock that is in the middle of a river in Canada. I like that a lot. The book does not answer any of the questions that you had about the man or his story. --------------- How can a book such as this be worth a dime? ---------------
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************   A good read, but one that I couldn't get into because it's a lot more focused on being cute than anything. I was disappointed.   I know they said the characters are all "sexy" and "hot" and such, but they are still just characters.  , as far as romance goes. The characters do grow and develop over the course of the book. I think the author did a really great job of keeping things from getting "messed up" and the character development is really well done. I don't think I could relate to the main couple all that well in person. I could only relate to them in the novel. I would be surprised if that relationship didn't go beyond the book, because of the way the characters react to it.  :)   4 stars: Aww yiss! It was a really good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:.............................................   "I could not wait to read this book. I was extremely excited to give it a go and was excited to read it by myself, without a reader friend, or a friend that was also a fan.   It's a little boring at times and the characters are one dimensional. I would have preferred to read more about the characters, rather than the book itself. I really felt that the author had little to no understanding of her subjects. She also used the "she" a lot as an afterthought, which caused me to think of the author as a female version of the male author.   on to the main points...   There is a lot of racism in this book and the author, being a black woman, probably did not want to write a book that did not deal with racism. It's not just that racism is present, but also that it is presented as part of the story, which makes the racist attitudes less interesting. I think that a lot has to do with the author's own experiences. She was brought up by a racist mother, and therefore did not really understand the experiences of other races. It also felt like she wrote herself into a corner by writing what she knew, and by writing about herself. The characters had the stereotypical characteristics of being black, and because of that I thought it was necessary to give them the stereotypical names. If they were more diverse, I don't think I would even have had problems with them.   and the worst part about it was that it was very hard to not give it three stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________  The Book: I read this book because of a recommendation from a friend, and it was just so disappointing, but not for the reasons that she recommended. I wasn't excited about this book, and I didn't really enjoy it. The plot of this book was really boring and I would never read this, although I really do think that this book could have been better. I got it because I thought it was a book about a guy named Paul, who had an ex-girlfriend, who was trying to get back together with him. But she eventually ends up with the other guy, and at first the guy wants Paul to be happy, but Paul says no, it doesn't matter how many girls you have or how nice they are. I mean, it's not like he actually doesn't like them or anything, but he still wants to date them. So yeah, this guy ends up getting into a really bad relationship with this girl and that's pretty much the only thing I had to worry about, because the story ends up becoming very predictable after about half the way through. So I really don't want to get into it too much, because it's just not that good of a read. The Characters: Paul: Paul is kind of an average guy, you know, maybe he's really pretty and a little crazy, but it all depends on who you ask. He's very nice and caring. He has a boyfriend who he knows is only pretending to be a girl, he gets along very well with him, but as he's getting older, he starts to resent this boy who is getting close to him, who he really wishes he could be with. As he gets older and gets into more of a relationship with the girl, the guy starts to realize that Paul is actually really nice, and the girl is actually just the girl he used to date. That's when he decides to date her. Emily: This girl is also a little weird and weird, but also kind of nice, just like Paul. She is very shy and seems a little awkward around guys, but at the same time, she has great body and likes to go to clubbing every chance she gets. She likes to dance, but she never makes a guy like her for being a good dancer, so that's the best way for him to show her how much he likes her, she gets to go out all the time and have sex with guys and dance for them. This was
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most frustrating of the genre and a waste of time. It was a waste for me not because of the bad writing but because of what it offered. The story was all in the "what happens next" category. It felt as though someone were trying to do everything in the series in order and that's not the case. The pacing was slow, it was very repetitive and the ending was an anticlimax. I am no fan of the series but it was good enough for me to see that.  Makara was the best and I am glad they have it back! If you want a good mystery with well written characters, you really have to go for this one!

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I was really excited to read this book, because I had heard so many good things about it. But I found it to be really boring. The story is really simple, but I didn't really care, because this story has no real meaning. It doesn't have any sense of direction and doesn't really build anything. It just kind of plods on and on. Also, the plot was just not very interesting. It seems like the story was just written to make me want to read it again.   If you're like me, this is not the book for you. I would recommend it for those who already have a few books in their library, but would not recommend it to those who are new to reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  - A really boring and uninteresting story Review by Michael E. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger that doesn't bring the story any closer.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book and it wasn't. I was looking forward to reading it but the author has no idea what he is talking about and tries to cover everything but misses some key points.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ I tried to read this book for the first time in September of 2017 and I did not like the book. The plot of the book was great for a fantasy/fantasy world, but the plot was not well thought out. The main character is an elf with an almost impossible personality, and the story revolves around her trying to find a way to make friends and find a family, but even after the last chapter, I still don't know if the ending was a good or a bad decision. The elves in this book were very good, but their interactions with other races were so stereotypical. I really hated the story of the main character and her friends for the most part. There was no development in this story and only the characters were real, not the characters around the characters. I felt like I was reading a fairy tale book. _________________________________Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It wasn't a bad read, just didn't leave me much feeling. I didn't really care for the characters, or the plot. It was boring.   Read an excerpt:  "The first thing I did when I came home was make my bathtub look like it had once been a pirate ship. As I scrubbed it I found myself thinking about all the things that had been lost in the war. Things I had seen, things I had loved, the places I had been, the times I had fallen in love. It's a little hard to believe that I am standing on the shores of the American dream in my bath."   I wish I had read more of the book before I had to make a comment, but it wasn't as bad as the trailer made it out to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't remember where I first read this book (it was probably The Man in the High Castle), but I loved it. I have a deep love for science fiction. There's something about the combination of high fantasy and modern day technology that I've always loved. This book had everything I love about that genre and more. The author does a great job of describing the world in a way that even a non-fantasy book reader can get it. And I loved the characters, who are just as interesting as the story. So it was a great book to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It's the story of a young man who, when he turns 12, leaves his childhood home, and moves to a small coastal village to spend the next 7 years growing up, learning to become a fisherman and a man, all without knowing what it is he is looking for, or who he wants to become. He begins to question who he is as he does this, but not in a bad way. It's just that the truth about the place is hard to find there, at first, so what he really has to go on is what he's told to believe."   This book was written so poorly, that in the end, it did nothing but confuse me, and confuse other people who were trying to figure it out as well. The entire "story" is completely pointless. All it does is lead the reader through an endless series of pointless questions, which the author seems to just throw in there.   There were a number of things that bothered me, the most obvious being that the "villain" who is supposed to be trying to steal his soul is a "saint", and that the whole town is "spiritual" in some way. All of which lead nowhere.  , which makes me think that he is trying to imply that the person is just trying to fool everyone with their lies? I find that hard to believe, as there are so many things wrong with this book.   "It's not that I hate God, or the Christians in general, or any religion in general. I just can't believe in them"....so why is it that when this happens to a Christian, and they can't be trusted, or even just have an honest and open mind, that it makes it all OK for the rest of the world to do the same? In other words, why does this have to be so bad, so very wrong? Is he trying to say that all people are flawed, flawed human beings, and are just trying hard to do what they think is right?   The fact that he's not being upfront about what the "truth" is, and what he is talking about, is just too weird to even write about. He doesn't seem to want people to know what he believes in. He seems to be implying that people just have to believe what they are told, as long as it fits into the narrative.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no plot and the characters in this book are nothing special. The author gives them no personality.  The story and characters are just a bunch of stupid people talking to stupid characters.  The only good thing about this book is the author's use of a "Reverse Flash Fiction" style.   I have to give the book 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* ***** ********** ****** ***** ****** ******************************* * *  This book is a joke. It's not funny. It is not a good book.  I would highly recommend this book for people who want to be educated about a specific group in history, but it will not educate them to be a good person who will go to church on Sunday, read the bible and make their family proud of their faith, or someone who will make the world a better place by being a good friend to others. There are so many things wrong with this book. I did not care for it and I cannot get over how bad it is. There is nothing good about this book that anyone could want from a book to be read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! This book is bad. The first 2 or 3 chapters are quite exciting but once that happens you don't see much of the characters progress until they are in the middle of the "action" sequence. The third or 4 chapters don't really provide any interesting stuff and are just kind of filler. The only thing that really interest me is the ending but that is because I wanted to know what would happen next. If you don`t like suspense and/or action scenes then you will not like this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________ I've always enjoyed reading books about the US, or at least that was the case until I came across The Road to 9/11. While it's a good read, the ending is not what I expected and I'll never be able to accept the book as true. It is a highly fictionalized account of events surrounding the September 11, 2001, attacks. There is an underlying plot to the book, and the book has an anti-war theme. There's also a lot of propaganda in the book. For example, an example in the beginning of the book is: "Bush had a habit of saying the only thing he had to say was what he had already said. It was almost as if Bush felt as if he were speaking for someone else. He said that he'd been waiting for an attack like 9/ll." Then in the same chapter: "It was a war the United States had to win. It could not be lost, no matter how good or how bad Bush was." And finally at the end: "The only thing that mattered was that the United states stop what it was doing and stop pretending it had anything to do with a war with terrorism." While it might be a good book to read on a plane ride to Iraq, as an American I can't see myself getting very far in it. It's just not a story that I can believe and even if I did, it wouldn't convince me I was correct in my opinions that the war with Iraq is not worth the expense and the lives it might take. As a reader, I don't need to know the truth, and it's very easy to dismiss an antiwar author as a propagandist because he doesn't want you to know what really happened. I don.t think I have much more to add to the above review other than to recommend anyone reading this book to be on the lookout for propaganda. Also, I've recently read a book by a woman who was a reporter and her book was about a group of soldiers who went to Afghanistan and discovered the truth about what really occurred there. ______________________________________________ [I would appreciate it if you'd tell me where in your book I can find some reference to the movie "Wag the Dog" and its connection with the book]

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* "The last book I read by John Scalzi was The Broken Earth Saga. This was an extremely well-written and entertaining novel. The premise is a great one. A group of earth-bound astronauts from the future, who have traveled back to the present day to stop an alien invasion from destroying earth, are sent to the past to kill the leaders of the alien civilization. However, when their attempt is made, they discover that the leaders were not evil but were being manipulated by other beings. The main plot is a simple story, but it still manages to be entertaining at times. Overall, a great read, but I recommend you do not read it if you have not read any other of Scalzi's novels. I also recommend that you start with the novel before beginning this one, which is probably the most interesting of his novels. Highly recommended."

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This book sucks!!! I hate to write this because I wanted to like this book. I'm going to read this book again to see if I did learn anything from it. It's really boring. The author seems to want you to know what to say to his daughter about her father's abuse. She doesn't talk about it. He has a son so I expect the book to be about the father and son and their experiences, but it really wasn't. There are very little pictures. It feels like an extended, pre-packaged child's book. It was soooooo long. I was so tired by the end. I don't even like kids. I can't wait for it to end. ______________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I thought it would be the best of the three I have read about the French Revolution. It wasn't. It was awful, full of bad translations, very poor writing, and a terribly biased viewpoint. Not that I am trying to be biased about it, just trying to point out that it was not a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This book is horrible. It's like a badly written, badly edited novel. No story, no plot. There is no character development, no suspense, nothing that keeps me reading. I've been following the book for months now. I'm trying to finish it. I can't put it down. I don't recommend this book. ****  More disappointing reviews: _______________  This is a book I didn't care for at first, but once I got over my initial dislike, the book became a little more interesting. I just felt I couldn't get behind the main character, or really care about anything in the book other than seeing this girl finally have a happy ending. I think this was due to the fact that I read the first 3-4 chapters of the book with my eyes closed and then took off my eye-glasses to read them. Then after my eyes were open again I was left wondering if I was reading a story or just reading about the same girl's day. The only thing that kept me reading was the fact the book ended with an extremely long cliff-hanger. The cliff-hang is extremely poor and seems to be missing a cliff-hopper. I was really hoping to find something to tie up this story. I mean, if a book is good enough to make the list then I don' have to bother with reading it. But sadly, I think I'm going to stick this book in the "just don't waste my time" box.  _________________________________  I have the most difficult time putting this book down. The heroine has a very dramatic and somewhat unrealistic ending. Although the story is somewhat slow, the ending has everything and is well done.   Overall:   4/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been a long time fan of Steven King's writing and I have not read a bad one in a while. I found this book to be very disappointing. I have read reviews from all over the place stating that this book had something to do with the books of the same name in the King's other works. I am a huge King fan so this didn't bother me but it is a small thing that doesn't help when the novel is really good. There are a lot of plot holes and contradictions throughout the book. In fact I had to go back and read through a lot more to make sure I had gotten the gist of things. Also it seems like one chapter was a few chapters longer than the other. I would have loved to read the sequel but I will not be picking this up.   I can understand wanting to have this story set in the 1980's because it makes for a good jumping off point but it really does ruin the book for me. I can only assume that it is setting the stage for the first King book that is not titled The Stand. I don't know how long it would take for me to read but if I had been reading this when it first came out I would not be reading this now. The main point of the book is about a father trying to help his daughter survive her father's drug addiction but I could not help but feel that I was reading about two different people. There were many different characters, one a father with a young daughter to care for, one the daughter and her drug dealer friend, one an older man who tried to help but was never able to save his daughter and one the father and daughter, both drug addicts who tried their best to survive their situation. There was a lot going on but it was not well done. One point where it seemed too convenient was when I found out that the father was in a coma at the time the story began. Also I thought it was funny how in the beginning the daughter did not have a tattoo on her left shoulder and it was just mentioned in passing that she had one. If I am not mistaken that is the tattoo that was on her mother's shoulder. The tattoo on the father's shoulder looked like it was there for a very long time but was not ever mentioned.   in all there were so many things I was confused about but that was really not enough to keep me from finishing the book but that just added to the confusion and I never could figure out what the main
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is horrible. I didn't like the protagonist much. I mean, I don't like this character at all. He seems to me, like I have read other stories about him and it is just... Well, this guy is boring. I do not like how he acted and how he thinks. This book also gave me a "no hope for humanity" look. I felt that there is nothing I can do. I don´t have hope anymore. There is no hope for the future, I feel like all people are going to go into a deep slumber. It made me feel sad, like people are dead and are going into oblivion and that is what I wanted for humanity, and so, I did not like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was a good book, but when I read that the girl lost her virginity at 18 with a guy who'd been sleeping with her since the age of 9 I was horrified. The first 3 chapters were good, but then the girl got pregnant in the third. Then the guy got married and he was cheating on her. I wouldn't want to do that. This book should be called Sex With Teenage Boys.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________ I read this book last year when it was first released and loved it. I was so excited to read it again. So many of these things have been mentioned but never mentioned so here goes!   Plot:   This book revolves around the character of Lillian, an innocent woman who is in love with the main character of the story, a man named James. When he discovers she's pregnant and that she's only had sex once, she flees with her children, but James won't leave her behind. Eventually he manages to track her down after finding her house. He's not happy that she has two children with him, but he is determined to protect her.   I feel that this book focuses on one character too much. It's almost as if the author was trying to show how the author is in touch with her character, even though we know that he is clearly not. He constantly gets into her head and seems to know what's on her mind, but she still has to face him on an emotional level to get to know him. She doesn't feel safe to just go to the police on her own and he's too concerned about what she might say to the child welfare authorities. She gets very angry and feels responsible for James.   the entire book is her trying to reconcile with him while he tries to protect himself from her anger. He has to be a lot of strong for her. There are several other female characters in this book who are only there to act as his accomplices and protectors, but never get to say a word.   this book would have been much better if it were broken into three separate parts.      Characters:       The character of James is the main focus of the book. I don't feel that the character is explored in depth or given any development, but at least he has a lot to deal with. The other characters, especially Lillian and her children are much more interesting. Their motivations are pretty complex. In addition, they are all extremely strong and I love the fact that it shows them struggling to do their best despite what others may think of them.  , they make me feel very connected to the story and they all seem like they are connected to each other as well.      , I enjoyed all of the different characters and their differing opinions on how to do things. In all honesty, I did have a little bit of trouble keeping up with them
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending was a complete let down. The book has been around for more then 40 years. I have never read any of the author's other books, I am a real fan of the TV series. I was hoping that this book would live up to all of the hype, and I was so excited that I started reading the first chapter and it gave me a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. This book was written to be a light fantasy story that was filled with fun characters and exciting plots. It really was a great start to the series. The author did a great job at writing. It was entertaining, and it was different than what we are used to. I love a good twist in my fantasy book. I thought that the ending was so lame. The characters were all so whiny and spoiled. They got no respect. I think that the book was better if I didn't have to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________ Rating: 1/5 I do have a lot of patience, but this is just a terrible book. It has too many errors and is written like it is in first or second grade and is riddled with grammar and spelling errors. And the content is way to simple. There is nothing interesting about the characters, the plot is so weak. It is just tedious reading and doesn't deserve a rating from me. It's not even worth mentioning because there is so many other books that do the same. Rating: 4/5 (2/5 stars) (2.75 stars) Reviewed: August 23, 2013
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This was a bad novel. I got into the first 20 pages and was very interested, but then it was clear to me that I was being bamboozled and that I had been misled. I can not recommend it. This is a horrible novel that has no concept of romance, and it gives the readers the sense that the two lovers are just going through the motions. It would have been better if it had a romance that lasted for about 6 pages, then it would have made sense. I give it 3 stars instead of 4 because it was not bad at all, but it was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This is a book about a small child whose mother takes her to visit relatives. There is no reason to worry, because the child is so good that she can explain everything to them. Unfortunately, all her explanations are wrong. She is so clumsy that when she tries to tell the girl's relatives about the time she went to the bathroom to pee, she misses. This little girl is a natural liar. She thinks that she is really clever and has many friends, but she actually has no friends, and all her friends are older than her. The book begins with the parents visiting her relatives. The story is that when the little girl saw them, she told them what she remembered, and they believed her. But the parents were very angry with her for telling them such a thing, so they told her they were going to take her and send her away. That was when the book changed from good to bad. The parents say that she should stay at home, and she should grow up in a proper home, so she will be able to go to the relatives without worry. This is very unfair because she has never had a proper family in her life. It is not because the parents are bad parents, but because they are not good parents. The little girl has never seen anyone with a family, she has seen only the people that she has made friends with, and these friends are all older than she. The child is told that her relatives are only people that make her smile. When the relatives show up, the little family is really happy that they can spend time together. Unfortunately the parents don't get that. They tell her that she would rather go away to live in a house where there are other families, where everyone understands her, than be with other families who are rude to her. They keep trying to teach her to be a proper person, but it doesn't work, and then they say she needs to learn respect. So the little one learns to do the wrong thing because the people around her can be mean to her, and it makes her happy. This book makes me sad. This makes me feel like a bad person for believing in this little girl. This reminds me of a kid I used to know who was told by the teachers that she could not do any work because she didn't have a family. But this little child was able to explain how she did things in the house and got credit for doing them. The poor little one was so unhappy that she had to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first time I read a book about a war in which there is not a single person who died. I have never read a war book where the cause is so arbitrary. The book is about the "The Battle of Gallipoli" (I have never heard that name before), which started with an invasion by a group of Ottoman Turks (the Ottomans), a small number of French soldiers, and a few others (a few British troops, a British General, a Dutch officer, a number of American soldiers, a Norwegian, and other civilians and military personnel). As a result of this invasion, a large majority of the soldiers of both the Allied and Turkish armies died. This book was a quick read. There is no real plot to it. The author makes the reader feel that it has been a long time since the war, but I can't really believe it. It's almost like we're being led to believe that the war in this book has already happened.   What makes this book a real disaster is that it's presented as a classic story of courage, sacrifice, bravery, and glory (not in the sense of glory as we understand it now, but as it would have been to those of us who were there). It was the first book in which the "Glorious" tag was used, and in many ways the "Tories" portrayed in the book were not at all that noble, in fact they were probably worse than the Turks. I was wondering why the book was called "The Greatest Story Never Told". The book starts with the soldiers at the front saying that the Turks will have to pay. They were not expecting such a large number of soldiers to die, and they could not understand why the Turks weren't doing anything about it. In the beginning, the soldiers were in good spirits and had a lot of fun. I thought that the Turkish soldiers would get a lot more enjoyment out of it, but they were pretty much in tears by the end. The Turks just laughed, cried, and laughed some more.     The author is obviously biased because he says that he got his information from the "Western" side (American side), but it is obvious that the information he used was not that of the "westerners", but the ones who had to deal with the Turks on the ground. The westerners didn't understand the soldiers' suffering and the hardships that the soldiers faced.  - The book has a
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ = 1 out of 5 stars _________  Rating: 1.25 - stars  Review: I purchased this book because I needed to learn more about the early life of Christ and what it was like for him as a young man. This book is a good introduction to the subject.   The main problem I had was that I wasn't a Christian or the teachings of Jesus. I wasn`t born into that world so it was really hard for me to connect with anything in this book.   the author did try to use Biblical sources as evidence for the claim of Jesus but in the end it seems like that is just more evidence that Jesus wasn`s life wasn`  I purchased this one of a kind book because in my early twenties I lost my faith, as I am an agnostic, I did not know if I was going to be a Christian.  .  's main point is that Jesus was an orphan, grew up in a household without a father and his life was really rough, there were times that he was sold to be sold into slavery and other times he was abused as a child. The main problem with this book is that he does try to make it seem like Jesus had a normal childhood but it doesn`t really match up with what I have seen in my own life, this book would be a good starting point to learn about Jesus and some of the things that happened to him but you have to read it to be convinced.  This book would work better if there were more references to stories, I am sure that many of the quotes and stories used in the book have been passed down through the generations and are used to illustrate the points made by the author.   not only that, the author tries to make Jesus out to be an angel by using some metaphors and images that can be seen in other religions, and that is fine. Just like God can have angels in his hand or not, we can have angelic beings in our lives. But this does not make the story any less true.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________  This book is so bad that it makes a good book better. It is just boring and I would never recommend this book to anyone, ever. It really is an awful book, and there are only a couple of sentences per page that are even interesting. The characters do nothing more than to say how horrible they think people are and there is really nothing to do in this book that actually matters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book.  I'm an adult female with two young daughters (ages 8 and 6) and I feel like I've learned that it's important to have children of my own when I'm in my 20s.  As a single mom, I really didn't have that experience.  But in spite of my personal issues with this book and the ways it fails to capture and relate to me, I enjoyed it very much!  The story is told in the first person, but from a first person point of view, in the form of a letter that I received from the mother of the young daughter in this book, about how she's coping with her daughters' emotional challenges (and of course, their behavioral challenges!).  This novel is filled with action.  There are scenes of people who are doing something, or getting something done.  The characters are not always fully realized in their motivations, but are not caricatures either.  And what I really liked was how I could relate to some of the characters, because they had similar experiences in their life and/or similar experiences that I'd gone through (in other words, these are human beings and they get things done).  The stories are told in a chronological order and I loved reading about what happened to the mother and her girls as she coped with them while they were growing up.  In the book's final section, the mother describes some of her past trauma and her own coping strategies, how they became better mothers and how they are raising their daughters to be better people.  This book is also highly relatable.  Many people who have gone through grief, abandonment and abuse will find something here to relate to.  These women had a hard time and they all faced their own hardships and overcame them in some way or another.    Overall, this was a book I thought was a lot of fun to read.  It was also well written.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something a little different, but who also wants to feel empathy for others, in particular for a mother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The book should be called, "Why you shouldn't do this with your kid!" If you want to play with your kids but their parents won't allow it, don't bother. I was really annoyed by the time I finally gave up on the game and got a job so I could do it. Also, it's not fun for any child who isn't really into it, or who thinks it's lame. I really wanted this book to be a fun thing to do, but it is not. If you are looking for something cool to play around with, this book may fit the bill. But, I won't get another book of this kind.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ I would have given this book a 10 out of 10. However, as a result of my reading I have experienced more bad things since having read this book.   Firstly, the writing style was not very interesting, and not very funny either. At times it felt that he was trying to be poetic and poetic he wasn't. I really don't understand this style, as the author made it seem like he was writing about something real, but it was just the same style he used in his books.   on to the bad things. I did not like that in the book there were people that wanted to die because they were afraid they were not a fit and they shouldn't live, and they wanted to kill themselves. This was very unrealistic to me and I am not ashamed to admit it. I was shocked and ashamed by this. I find it extremely cruel that he would have to make such a character like that so bad. Why would anyone like to die? This was an old fashioned idea that was really painful to me.   The book was made so horrible to read by this horrible writing style that I cannot recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************* I loved the first book of this series, but I have to say this book just wasn't for me. I've read the first 4 books in this series. I loved them so much that I ordered the next 5. I was going to buy all 5...then I looked at the reviews and they weren't much of a help. So, I stopped. It was just me and the book and that's that. Don't read it if you want to be entertained. It didn't do me any good. There were a few things about it I liked, such as the description of the main characters' house in a nice, realistic manner, but the rest was just annoying me. The book wasn't a huge disappointment for me because it was a good book, just not for me this time around.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read through a lot of good books over the years. Some of them were bad and some of them weren't. This is one of those books. I wanted to love it. I'm not sure if it was because it was so short or the story was so confusing but I really had to reread part of the book just to figure out what was going on. I could not put it down and it took me three days to finish. So in summary this was a poor choice of books.  This review is from: The First Five Years of the Civil War by Stephen A.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ "The end result was the most unsatisfying book of my life."  If I had to rate my relationship with this book, I would give it a 1/10.   First of all, it's not a book. It's a compilation of some of the worst books I have read, written by people who obviously have not read any of the good ones. As I've said before, it has a terrible premise and it really doesn't matter if it makes any sense. I could go on and on about it.   with this premise, all of the author's ideas about romance (from what I've seen, the author seems to think romance is the only form of love there is, and has only ever heard of monogamy) are completely debunked and destroyed. In fact, if I was really honest, I'd say it's even worse than that. All the romances are ridiculous. They don't add anything. In the case of the romance about the "hottest virgin on the planet," she's a 16 year old girl who spends her life in a tiny bedroom with her best friend (she's never had sex), and it's portrayed as this is a horrible thing to do. This is the type of "romance" I have never seen in real life, and I would be amazed if anyone actually read this book. In my opinion, this author should never write another book.   of course this book isn't the author, but I'm still not happy that this happened. I was going to read this with another book but I couldn't do it because I don't feel I'd have the mental fortitude to handle what she's saying, and to be honest, it felt really forced. Also, I don of course give this book a 1 out of 10 because it is such a horrible idea and it does not add anything to the plot and it doesn't make any sense, but it's the only thing I can say that I hate about the book, and it is a lot better than any of my other books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was just too depressing for me to get through. I had to put the book down after about two chapters. I think the story is a little too depressing and that it is supposed to be lighthearted. I do not know why people are so excited to read this. The book is not easy to read, I did not want to read the book. I did find it interesting that this book is set after World War I.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________" This book is so bad that even I couldn't read it and I'm going to have to call someone at Barnes and Noble to return it.   I didn't like this book. It was written in such a way as to keep me in suspense. I didn't know the author, but I did find her description of the events and the characters very interesting. That's why I wanted to see the final book in the series. But the story is all about the characters, who are all not so interesting. They all fall for the same people in different ways. One girl, for example, falls for the rich girl and a woman who is so beautiful that her father, a king, wants to marry her. He gives her the royal handmaiden (the one who gives kisses) and all his clothes and gold. She falls in love with him and is going to marry him because she loves him. So then, how does she get rid of him? She has to get rid not only of him but of everything that he owns. The book is like this. I wish the author would have started the book by writing a nice little story about a normal girl named Sophie and her family and life and not about the people who fell in love and got married and all the other crazy stuff that happened in the book. This book should have ended when Sophie got married to someone and didn't have to deal with the people anymore. Instead, all the problems, the problems with her father and the people, are never mentioned again. She keeps on falling for all the people she wants to love, and they fall for her in their own way, so she has to continue falling and falling and finally she has no choice but to be a hooker and prostitute.  -No love triangles, no interesting or interesting characters. Sophie is an interesting, normal girl, so you want to see what will happen to her.  's plot was interesting and had many twists and turns. But, I have to say I felt bored by it all. There are many parts in this book, that I would have liked to have read over and over again and I don't know what will become of Sophie in the future, but it never seemed like it will happen. She is all talk and she doesn't have any personality, no feelings. I'm sorry, but this author should have stuck with the first book. I also feel like this was an adult book written for an adult audience.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I found this book to be the worst book I've ever read. I will not read another book by this author. She's too lazy to write a good book. I was disappointed, because I thought she's a very smart author. Why is the book so bad? Well it has no point. The characters are boring. She tries to write romance, but all it has is sexual innuendo. The romance is just to give more readers some more book, which I guess, is the main goal of authors. I guess they are afraid people will go out and buy their books. Not me! I will continue to read the next books, but I'll do it better. The book is not worth it, but for the fact it was free, it was ok. I don't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This is a bad review of a bad novel. I'm not sure I've read a bad short novel that was less like a bad comedy or less like bad historical fiction. It's a story of a man who has lived alone in a cabin for ten years, but has a mysterious past he needs to uncover before he can live comfortably with someone else.   It is a short novel and it's not that hard to follow - if you don't want the story to be too complex - you will just find yourself missing out on a lot of the fun, and if you are like me, you are never going to get to the end of it because it's too easy to get bored of reading. It would be a good story to read on a lazy Saturday evening, but if you need to read a short book, this is not the novel for you.   I do not think the author has much to say about the cabin, but that is the point.   at one point he does mention that there is no phone in the cabin; and I would like to say that this has been fixed in a later edition. If you want a novel to read during the day, and don't like that there are too many rules to keep track of, it is worth it. If this was written as a book, with its own rules to remember, it would be much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  So, I'm not the only one who reads a lot (and it can become a real addiction), but even I have an issue with this book. First of all, I thought the idea was brilliant from the cover. The idea that our past and present can influence what we will be doing tomorrow, if we choose to change that behavior. The cover of the book is a real eye opener because it has all sorts of different images for each of the different people portrayed in this story. The first time I read it I was amazed that it was written by a woman and not a man, because that kind of "diversity" in the book (and in life in general) is what we all need more of (as long as we can still get along with one another).   The book is full of very clever things that I learned on my journey. The book shows you what people do and then shows you how you can do the same thing. Some of the things people do could easily be described as a way to make money off people that are not in your "target" demographic. For example, there is a couple of very smart men who are not trying to get laid. One is a high school drop out and is trying to do the best he can to be successful and not be a liability to the family. The other is a rich man with a big house and all the girls. One could argue that the rich man would rather be an old man and a widower, while the dropout would rather still be in the game and be seen as a good provider. I agree that the "money in the pockets" thing is pretty stupid, but at least the money in the pocket does not come from a person that you are trying to cash in on. So I don't have a problem with the fact that the people I am looking at on the cover are trying not to embarrass themselves or their families.   Another thing that I did not like at all was how the main character is presented as an example of why we should not be so judgmental. The guy who is portrayed as having a "poor" childhood was quite frankly a complete jerk to everyone around him. He has an amazing ability to not only figure out what a girl is feeling (especially if it involves something she is doing wrong), but he also gets a chance to make her feel what he wants her to feel. It is very similar to how a child treats an older person (
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a very bad book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It really is boring, uninteresting and it's completely pointless.   The characters are uninteresting, one is an asshole, another is a complete idiot. The author does not know what he is talking about, it is not relevant to the story and I couldn't read it more than five minutes.  The review is written in such a way that the author seems to have had a stroke and has decided to write down some useless information about his experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I'm pretty sure I gave this book a bad rating. This book was not that good. It wasn't bad. But it was so slow and boring that it was like my brain couldn't concentrate at all. I could not believe it took me almost a month to finish this book. It started out great, I had high hopes and then it slowly went downhill. It did not take long to figure out what the author was trying to do, but there was nothing in the plot or characters to back it up. I got confused at times and thought there were too many questions to answer. The ending left me with a lot of questions and then I was left confused on what to believe. It was a total disappointment. I didn't feel any satisfaction or hope from reading it. I did not like it at all! It was boring, I'm afraid.   My rating: -------------- 3 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I am an active member of the church and have been in church meetings at least every other month for the past 10 years.  The last book I read in this series was "The Power of the Poo." I read this book with the knowledge that it would be full of lies and falsehoods, and after reading this book, I'm pretty sure the author doesn't know the first thing about his religion. .  is another in this wonderful series.   The whole point of reading these books is to expose your beliefs and make you think. While this particular book did do this and I found it very entertaining, it is not what I would call a good book. The author, with the best of intentions, tries to explain the LDS Church to a person who is not Mormon, and in so doing, it gets a little preachy and preachy. It also gets pretty preachy with its "facts" and what it is teaching. There is also a little bit of racism thrown in as well. This was a very interesting book that gave me an interesting insight into what the LDS church is teaching to its membership. It is not something I would consider to be a "good" book, but if you want to get an idea of what the Mormons believe, and are looking for a great introduction, I'd suggest this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I just finished reading The World Turned Upside Down by Richard Morgan. The story was ok but I was disappointed in how the author described certain things that happened in the book. He made many things to be wrong or were not important to what really happened. For example, the two main characters, one a 12 year old boy and another 18 year old girl, get stuck in a cave and need to find a way out. They do and when they come back, the girl seems to have died, and it is not explained how they made it out. Then it is told that they went through the cave to find more books and when that cave got flooded, they made their way into the woods and ended up in a swamp. I would like to know what they did to make it back to the cave. It seems like the book should be ending at that point but the author keeps dragging the story on for pages and pages. Also, while the two characters were both very young at the time the story took place in, I thought that they were young enough to have some sense of adventure but not in a way that would be unrealistic. I am not against teenagers or anything, but I would have liked to have seen the girl take charge and run away with the boy if they made such a huge journey alone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book! The story was interesting and the language was realistic. This book also had some good jokes, a great character and a very good story. It had a couple of plot holes but overall, a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: aI don't like that you have to be alone to make this book good, the last half of the book was boring and it was really painful to finish the book because i wanted to know what happend. This was one of my favorite books of all time and i will re read it but this book is very disappointing. This is the story of a man that is a serial killer but he is not really a killer. He was born in a very bad situation and his parents raised him badly and his dad left him when he was born. It was in the very worst kind of situation. He did not get even money to survive so he was a very poor kid. But he loved people very much and he got the opportunity to go to a college where he could meet a girl he really liked, but after his parents divorce and he left the college he started to kill again in order to take revenge. When he was 15 he was sentenced to death by hanging but he was really in a bad situation because of his parents but he still wanted revenge so he decided to take a bullet. He killed a police officer and later on he killed his own mother. He felt that he got his revenge and that was the end of that. He left the island and he was not really successful as a serial murderer, but he continued to kill in order for him to have that feeling again and for revenge. He found a new kind of girl and he found his revenge again. After killing his mother he started killing again. He got a lot of attention and money but he didn't care because his mind was still very messed up. He knew that he was going to be punished with hell, but somehow he got away with it. He made it out of hell and was at a highschool to find his girlfriend again. But when he found her it turned out that he never loved her and that he only killed her because he wanted to take all his anger and his hatred towards others and destroy them. Now he was free to kill and destroy the world. Then he got in trouble with his teacher and got sent to a psychiatric hospital. It became very interesting to read this novel because it is so realistic. When the author mentions that this is his third time to enter this hospital he really made me feel the situation of this guy in the hospital. Now the story really started in the beginning of the novel. There were a lot more details to this book and you can see a lot why this story is
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************ *I had read a few good reviews on Goodreads about this book and was very excited to read it. Then, after finishing the book, I re-read the same paragraph about each of the characters over and over and I can't put it down. I don't want to spoil what happens with the ending so I'll keep this short. The ending makes me feel really bad about myself for feeling like this about the book. It is really a pity because I really liked the book and I'm really glad I bought it. I hope it helps someone else enjoy it.* (October 6, 2011, 4:41 am) ***Anonymous said... I read this in September on a plane to China and my friends and I had a great time. We were on the plane for about 3 hrs. then I put it aside to get over to my friend who was visiting me in America for Christmas. That's when the book became my #1 thing to do on holidays and weekends and holidays. So I decided to get it and it is so so good. I recommend it. It will definitely make you think. The only bad thing I can think of is that there is a big part about an American woman in the book that I didn't understand since I'm in China (I don't understand the relationship between the two women) It would have been helpful if she talked more about this subject. Otherwise I enjoyed the book so much. Thank you so much for this wonderful book. (September 28, 2011) *** Anonymous said...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this on Kindle and read it quickly, like I would read any other book. I enjoyed it, but it is written in an annoying way.   The characters in this book seem to be "living on borrowed time," they're only given a few short chapters each to tell their story and we only learn the important bits of the story as it comes up. This is a great book in that you read a bit at a time, and then a lot at a bit, then a bit more, etc. and you get to know the characters. That's what a good story is like. You learn something new and interesting from it. I'm not saying that this is a bad way to do it, just that I enjoyed the story more when I read it slowly. Also, sometimes you just want to jump right into the action.  -The title is a bit misleading, because it doesn't actually tell you anything about the book. The main character, Katerina, and her friends are not actually "sick," they are sick. They're just experiencing a lot of the things they see around them, and they can see that the disease is spreading, but they do not have the power to stop it. Instead, they must struggle to stay alive until the disease kills them.   the reason the title of this book says that the characters are sick, is because the main character is. The rest of the main characters are not sick, they have a little bit of time on their hands, they just don't seem to want to be around each other. The whole book is really about the main, Katorina and her best friend, Eina. We learn that these two girls have gone through so many terrible events that they've become extremely sick, and their lives have to be taken over by others. I really liked Katerinalia and Eina, I would like to have seen more from them. I thought they were extremely likable, though. I wanted to keep them around a little longer. I don't know if I would have enjoyed this book a whole lot if it were a little less about them. It's just a little depressing that their lives are over.  The main thing I thought that bothered me the most about this book was the author's use of long, descriptive sentences. I would've preferred that she used some more descriptive sentences in a lot more situations. I know the sentence structure can change a lot from book to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book. There is no reason for the author to have to be this horrible.   It is not even close to being a good book.  I'm just so disappointed in it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   This book is just another piece of crap. The entire book was just too long, and not even all of the "story" was interesting. There was a lot of talking about it in the beginning that made it sound more like a story than a real life experience. The "storytellers" didn't even seem to have an interesting story themselves. I don't think the author had any idea what he was doing when he was writing this book. He made me care about the main character, but he was just kind of annoying. The fact that he was a complete loser who lost his money and ended up in prison really ruined it for me. I felt sorry for him. And he wasn't even the main hero in the book. A girl who was kind of like his daughter came along with him, so I really liked her. But the author didn't give her any good qualities or traits to really make me like her. I can't remember how much I was supposed to like her either, but she seemed kind of evil, just like the main villain in this book, although she did have some qualities. Overall, this book was so confusing, I'm not even sure what happened. It just sounded like a lot like a TV show or some story told to a child.   If you are looking for something "cool" to read for a little while and have nothing better to do, or you are just bored, I would recommend this to you. If you like fast paced books that make you think, this is for you. But if you have nothing else to do and you are reading the same book over and over, this won't be for you, either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending of this book made my head spin, so much for the optimism of being taken to a place of hope. The ending didn't even make sense in its own right. I don't think that this book should have been published, because of all the things that it does wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book I bought off of Amazon.com to read for the GRE. I'm an undergrad who takes the GRE very seriously and I wanted to take this test as preparation to prove that I can be competitive. Unfortunately, the writing, grammar, and content in this book is atrocious. The writing is full of grammatical and spelling errors and I had to look it up in the dictionary because it was obvious from the very first sentence that I was not going to pass this book. For example, in a sentence "He is my best friend" he wrote "He can be my bestfriend." My first sentence would have been "He's my best buddy" but this makes things so much harder. The grammar is so bad that I felt like I was going to cry during this book because it wasn't as bad as the grammatically incorrect writing in a book about college students.   The only redeeming thing about this book for me was that the writing is better than the grammar.   (hide spoiler)] This book is about the GRE and its tests. The author gives great details about how the test works. The sections that you will take on the test are called questions. The questions are made up of words and sentences from the authors opinion. However, many questions were questions from different tests that they took. They are given several different tests to choose from so they had to select from various different kinds of test questions. Some questions were a multiple choice and some questions were true/false questions. There were a ton of test answers in this section. The sentences in this part were very poorly written because the writer just copied and pasted sentences from different books that he read. You will have to go through the questions and find the correct answers on your own. Some of the test answers were very, very wrong and it was very hard to find the right answer. Some examples of test incorrect sentences include "She thought she had it bad because she couldn't get her ex boyfriend back." which is a false sentence. "When he went out with her he always had an excuse" is a true sentence because you can't be an asshole to your friends. "They weren't friends, but they were close friends" is not a correct sentence because they are not close friends. However it is correct because they had a close friendship. The test questions are also confusing because there are more or less correct answers to some questions and wrong answers to others. In one test question the answer is not
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "Lolita's story does not come across well. There are no actual 'love affairs' that actually happen, which leads to my first objection: the author had to go to the trouble of inventing those to get the book published. I think the reason she went to the bother of doing this is because of the success of Nabokov and it is obvious in Lolita that she didn't want to risk making this story 'too popular.' "   I was under the impression that Nabokova was, like her friend, a novelist. I can't say that I liked this book as much as Lolita and I can understand why it is not as well known. If you like Lolita, you will probably like Nabokovsky's work too but I think that Naboka's novel would work better if she had just focused on that book. As it is, I think Naboka has taken her influence from Nabokovy but she has not gotten to the point of plagiarism.   There are some good characters in this book but I was not very fond of any of them. I liked the main character, especially the way that she came to realize her destiny. I didn't like her at first but once she gets going, I can see why she is called the'most beautiful woman alive' and 'the most beautiful young woman of the 20th century.' The main character was interesting and it was interesting to read about her. I did wish that there would have been more development of her love interests but I don't think that was the main reason why I didn,t enjoy the book. I thought that Nabota did an amazing job with the cover.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________"After reading this book, I am now convinced that all my other books on the subject are all lies and I can now see why they were written." –Sue C. of San Francisco, CA I am currently reading A Girl Like Me by Roxane Gay. The first page of this book says, "There is not a single reference to the original source of the word 'hottie' (short for 'hortresser'). It does not appear in her book, The Bed Book (published in 1974), although this word did make it into an article she wrote in Harper's Bazaar in 1966: 'When I say 'I want a hottie,' I mean that I am not trying to be modest. If my dress is too modest for my height and my height is too long for my dress, then I am just as likely to be wearing a low-cut shirt as I am a high-cut one. I am going to have one of those 'naturally high-hipped hotties' on my hands—and not just any high-waisted hottier, but a big-nosed, big-mouthed one, with a nice high, long, rump-and-leg-line and a high waist.' Roxane, you are a genius."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so terrible that you have to go to another book to read the "good" parts. A waste of time, and not worth your time. The characters are very bland, boring, and unoriginal. It is obvious that the author has no real idea how to write a good character. They seem to be made up to fit his or her role.   My favorite character, The Boyfriend, was the worst. He was the most unemotional and dull person I've ever read about. You just know he has done something so terrible, that everyone in his world has to be scared of him.  When you are writing a book that has "good people" and then the protagonist who is the most boring and unlikable person in the book, you have failed.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________   The story was okay. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, and this book is very similar in the way it is written. The story takes place in a world with magic, but it is just magic for the most part. Harry is an outcast because he has a "magic-loving" grandfather, a bad life because his parents were murdered, and he is also teased by a bunch of girls. Harry, Harry, and Ron are just ordinary students with magic powers, but some of the students start getting involved in the more sinister side of the magic. At first, it was hard for me to connect to Harry because he is a very ordinary person. But I kept reading because I felt as if I was supposed to, because he had a destiny that he just didn't seem to know was his destiny.   Overall, the story was fine. I was glad that it took place in the wizarding world, but I really didn't understand the point of it. It didn't have much to do with Harry's wizarding life, and it seems to only be the basis for the stories of Ron and Hermione, who were also in Harry's class. The characters felt weak, because all the stories that I read about them seemed to have a deeper purpose than Harry's. There was little reason to care about them besides the fact that the world they were in is more interesting than Harry Potter.   the author never really explains what is going on with these magical characters, or why they became involved in this war or the war in Iraq. There is a lot of magic going on in this book. The book feels like a very long and boring chapter.  ,  I don't know what happened to Harry, but the plot was really weak. There were a lot more questions that needed answering. For example, Harry's life is very different from Ron's. I know this is Harry's story, but if this was Ron's life, it would be different. It just seems that Ron is in a really bad situation, but he's able to overcome this problem by learning magic.   (hide spoiler)   Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville were all pretty much the same. I think that it is easier for an author to make a new character from the books than it is to make an existing character new. I feel like I had seen the Harry Potter characters before.   - I didn't really care that much for anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________  I was expecting more from this book than what it delivers. However, I've had this book in my library for about 10 years and I've read it many times. This book was just soooooo much less interesting than other books I have read. It had nothing new to offer, was too self-congratulatory and lacked substance. As I said, I have had it for about ten years and it just doesn't have any interest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:..........................................................I was looking for a new and exciting read. This book did not satisfy my expectations at all. My main problem with this book is the way they write about homosexuality. I believe this was due to the fact that the author knew nothing about it himself. They wrote a lot about how gay people live their lives and then they say things like, "Well, he has the wrong idea about homosexuality." Or, "If he could change, he would never have such a problem." So, if you can't change, you have the wrong ideas. This really annoyed me because it is extremely difficult for a gay person to change their behavior, especially if they don't want to be a part of the gay lifestyle. It is no wonder that many gay people have an extremely hard time with their relationships. As for the author being gay, he should have told the truth. If he were gay, there is no way he would have put in all the effort he did. When he is gay, all he cares about is sex and what he can get away with. He can't even admit that he enjoys sex. He said that when he was gay, sex was the only time he had to look forward to. He also said that his ex-girlfriend, who he had been with for 9 months, is his second love. This is very sad because he has a lot of potential with a woman. I could not get over the fact he lied in his book. Also, some of the things he said in this book are so insulting to gay people that I felt embarrassed. The book said that the reason why gays are so promiscuous is because they are weak. This makes no sense to me. I don't think gay people are weak in the least. When someone is promiscuity because they want to please their partner, it means they are not very much of a man. I thought that this is how a homosexual feels. I also thought that the fact gays are promiscious was due only to them not understanding the attraction of a woman's body. This idea that homosexuals are weak has no foundation to it. The authors are also saying that gays are too emotional and can't control their sexual urges. Again, I have a hard time believing this. It does seem that some of these homosexuals get a kick out of their sex, but again, this doesn't mean that they are emotionally weak. They are strong and powerful people that have made the choice to be sexual with

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "In the end, I found the book to be nothing more than a list of things to buy, a list that was as easy to read as a list with an agenda of buying all of the items on the list." "In this review I really don't want to criticize the author's choice of books, but when it is all over you have come to the same conclusion that I've come to: I really dislike all of these books and the author chose them. My guess is that they are all really bad books that he chose because they were all available at big box stores, or because he knew that everyone in the world who owns a computer can read his book. No matter what he wrote, the book will be bad because the author didn't understand the concepts he was trying to present."  So I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I really like this book. When I was reading the book I was looking for a really good reading guide because I'm starting a new job on Sunday and I wanted to get some reading done before I started. This book is perfect for me. I love that it's a mix of real books with real people. Most of the time I'm reading a novel in an e-book form and I'm not really paying much attention to the person's speech, but in this book I found myself really paying attention to who was talking to me and why they were speaking to me. When he reads "The Power of Positive Thinking" I found that I was really interested in learning more about what he was saying. So I think the book is great and I would recommend it to anyone, especially anyone looking to start thinking about the things they want to do or just make the decision to do something about the problem. I give the book 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________   I liked the story. But the characters weren't interesting. They're just not likable. I wanted to hate them, because they are so mean. But I didn't. I thought they were annoying, just like a toddler. It's so obvious that the author didn't care. It wasn't like she was writing her own story, so I had no idea how bad it was until I finished it. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks of the story, I just wish someone had told me she was bad at writing. It felt like she just typed out a bunch of sentences and added a bunch more. But then again, this is the author who wrote this book. She just needed some help, I guess.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     A review written by a reviewer who loves her book. I had read some reviews before I purchased this and I liked the ones with good reviews, so I was excited to get it. I read it and loved it, but then I read some more reviews and they were more negative. Then I saw a review by a friend who had read the book and hated it. And so, I decided to take my chances and buy this book.  I hate to say this but the only thing that bothered me about this book was the ending. It didn't seem like a happy ending to me.  My boyfriend was a great reader too so it wasn't just me. I think that the author needs to do a better job writing a good ending because it seemed that he was too lazy to do so. And that's really sad because I really liked the way it ended.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my daughter, as she enjoys reading horror stories, and I loved the little horror references that would creep up in the story, like when someone tries to stab a cat. The problem is that this book is a complete disaster. There is no suspense, no tension. It is just mindless, boring, stupid-fucky.  Why I did not like it:   In the end, I was disappointed to see that this story is so poorly written that even I, a horror fan, was bored.   It was like reading a bunch of horror stories by the same author, written for a different age group. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book with my money. I've read many books on human psychology, but nothing quite as poor as this book.   It is an incredibly bad book. The author has absolutely no clue of what he's writing about. He does a bad job at explaining the concepts he's describing.  He has nothing new to say. He has no answers to the problems he's trying to solve, and the answers he gives make absolutely no sense.  His "answers" are either completely wrong, or make no sense at all.  I cannot believe this is a best-seller, and I was very disappointed.  It's simply boring.  This is an excellent example of bad writing that shows just how poorly the author has been prepared.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~I was on the fence about getting this book. I heard it was a wonderful memoir by this author, so I looked it up and it sounded awesome. What I learned in this book was that she had a traumatic childhood where she was abused, but still was able to love and be loved by her family and friends and friends' children. Her life as a child and growing up was a roller coaster and she eventually overcame the abuse, but the thing that made it harder for her was when her step father died in the 1990's. She felt like she had lost a family member when he died. I have to say that this book really made me want to read her memoirs, because the experiences she went through were very intense. She also had the luxury of growing up with a very loving family and that is what really made her feel like she got what she wanted out of life. She had to overcome the abuse and pain that was inflicted on her and was able grow up to be a beautiful woman. But for a guy that reads this book, it is kind of hard for him to accept this. She gets hurt by the abuse that is inflicted on herself and her family. There is a lot of shame that comes with the abuse. I read a few comments by others that said that the book made her realize that she was being abused as a kid, and that she can't expect the same type of treatment from her own children. I don't really understand this criticism of the book, because she is a child herself and I believe that she should have been taught that she shouldn't be so hard on herself for how she was treated. I do agree that she wasn't taught that growing up and living with a narcissistic mother and stepfather isn't something to be taken lightly. I felt that this was a really tough read for me. I was in tears several times throughout the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited to get this, but as expected I was a little disappointed in how long it took to read. After reading all the reviews about this book, I knew it was not a book for me. I could hardly understand anything he was saying, and the story itself is completely unbelievable. He says he has a doctorate and that is why he is a doctor, and then he uses it as an excuse to write a book that is 100% unbelievable. The book itself is very short, and although it seems like it would be a long and boring read, it is actually very short because it does not have any "big ideas" in it. I think he could have used more story and less unbelievable stories.   Overall, I still have not finished the book, but I know I will read it sometime in the future because it was so good!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It's very difficult to get a good book out of a bad writer. The story is predictable, the characters are predictable, and the writing style is predictable."   I'm afraid I had less fun reading this book than I expected to. The plot was predictable and the characters were also predictable. I can't blame the author, though. The book was so predictable that I actually expected it to start out much longer than about 70 pages, which it did. I think he was afraid that he would be taken to task if it were too short, but it was fine. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they'd like it. It is just not as good as it was supposed to be. It's not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best way I can describe it is that it is very slow and it is really boring. The entire book is the same plot line and it takes so long to get through it. I feel like this book should be rated lower than it is and should be 1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** The story is about a couple who live in a remote town and have a daughter named Katie who just turns 17 in July. After her father dies unexpectedly the wife loses her job and it is up to Katie to find a job that she can support her family and herself. She tries at various places but fails. She gets into some trouble with the local police. Katie eventually gets fired from her job at the local pool and has to find another one. Katie has a very low opinion of the people in the town. After a few weeks of this the local news has an article about a new drug called "Tylenol." It is said that it is the "killer in the bottle" and can help ease pain, nausea, and insomnia. Katie tries it and says it has saved her life. Soon it turns out that there are many Tylenols around. A few days after her attempt at Tylensol she is attacked by two men, who put a vial of Tylencol in her purse. They rob her, but when she wakes up and sees her purse empty, she realizes it was her vial. This causes her to lose the two men and the two women that were with them. After Katie is rescued she tells her mother about the men. She tells her that there is a man called The King who owns some of the pharmacies in the area and that he is a drug dealer. There are many more, but one of the men and Katie's mother end up becoming the two drug dealers in town. There is a whole city full of these people and they are not very nice. ********* A few of the things that bothered me:- Katie was the only female character in the story. She has no friends and never talks to anyone else in the book. Not only that but she is totally selfish and doesn't care about anyone else. She is the only one to take the blame, as it is clear from the end of the story that she was the one to do it and she is the one that goes to jail for it. She also seems to think that it was a mistake for her to get into a relationship with one of them. I guess it would not have been too hard to think before you get a girlfriend or boyfriend. They make you nervous if you think about it. They are a reminder of where you came from and who you are. I don't think I can go through life without someone to talk to about the
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________" It was great for the time I used it but now, I can't put it down. I don't know why they can't make it even better." I really like the book! I can read it in one sitting and never get bored. It was very well written and has kept me busy while I work. I was able to keep up through the beginning of a full blown cold and am still reading it. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem with this book is that its primary argument is based on the premise that our human beings, because of their evolutionary past and evolutionary potential, have no reason to take pleasure in the things of nature, the arts and crafts. This premise is not true.  Many cultures throughout the world have developed highly developed art forms and crafts that are highly pleasurable and interesting to people.   In some cultures, people would rather watch birds, water, trees or people die than to engage in any kind of physical activity.  And the arts are highly important in certain cultures where they are essential for maintaining and building strong and stable family bonds.  For example, we live in an age where we are surrounded by a rich array of movies, television programs and music, where it is easy to discover and listen to various kinds of musical and artistic work.  When we live with our children, we are more likely to let them choose their favorite music or watch the videos of their favorite cartoons rather than let them play with guns, shoot each other or ride motorcycles.  The same is true for movies, books and music.  This is not to say that we can never develop hobbies, but rather that we should develop them by choosing them.  We should engage in certain activities for a certain period of time, and only after that time period do we begin to see them as something that we will enjoy over and over again.  It seems a good time to write this review, because I recently finished watching the documentary The Great Brain by Michael Sandel about a famous brain surgeon who found that our brains are designed to enjoy a wide variety of experiences.  In the film, the surgeon describes one of his favorite activities to his patients in which he would spend a few hours with them, and ask them what they found to be the most pleasurable thing about the experience.  He would ask questions about what they thought they were doing and they would describe what they did as the most satisfying thing in the experience to them.   The doctor then spent hours with the patient doing activities, and in the end the patient would describe their experience as being as pleasurable as they had described it to the doctor.   I am writing this review for two reasons.  First, because the brain is clearly designed for a wide range of experiences and a wide array of human activities.  Second, because this kind of research helps us to understand the relationship between our evolution and our nature as a species
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ The Good - a well-researched and well-written book which shows how the various types of people who came to be known as modern historians are not always at odds with each other. _________ - I find the chapter on "History as a Game" to be one of the most interesting and helpful chapters I have read on the topic of the relationship between science and history, and this book certainly gives the best example of what such a discussion is all about. _____ - This book shows how scholars and historians are actually working together to learn more about their fields and about the world of our ancestors, and it shows how this is actually good for both people in the field of history and in the world. The Bad - - The second book of a two-part series "Famous Historians: A New Look" - I am very disappointed that the first book was the least interesting in this series. This is the one that should have been the first, as it is more interesting as an introduction to a different group of historians, but it is also more misleading in its assumptions and uses of the facts about the lives of these historians. The history and culture of some of the historians are covered in the first part, but this book is almost as much an advertisement for their work, and for the importance of their work to our knowledge of the past. _______ The first book does cover most of the key figures of the group, but does not do a good job of explaining why they were important, so it does not really give a good picture of who they were. _________________________________ I think this book shows what the historian can do, but not necessarily in the fields of history, but rather in the social sciences. This book covers a wide range of topics, from the history of science to the history and sociology of medicine. The topics covered are all interesting, but are covered much more thoroughly in other books. _______________________ The author does a great job explaining and explaining the different types of historians. This was the book I wanted to read, but had to wait until now. _____________________________ Posted by Paul F. Knopper at 9:15 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "Lacking and poorly written...this book could have been so much more." 5.6 out of 5 stars I was really looking forward to this book. I have read a few good books in the Harry Potter series and this is a good one. But there are a few things I want to point out. First, I don't know who wrote this book, but I would love to know who. I can only assume that it was one of the many "experts" that wrote books about it for an academic market. That said, I have found the books about Harry Potter, to be quite helpful and enlightening. For example, the Harry James Potter book I have is a very good introduction. In that book, I learned about the things I didn't know about Harry and his adventures. If the author had written a book about the experiences of a typical Harry Potter fan (someone who reads the books daily and has an extensive library) then it would have been quite different. I could see why the author wrote the book as he did, because in the end he came up with quite a few ideas to expand on in his second book. The book was mostly well-written, but had some errors. These errors were minor, but they were enough to frustrate me. One issue I have with the author was that he included all the names of the people that appeared in the books, even though he clearly knows that the names change. It was very distracting to me when he was discussing the Quidditch tournament, but if he could have included a little disclaimer and stated that those people weren't actually in the Quaffle he would have done a better job. In the end, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the details of Harry's first year. But for me, there were too many errors and inconsistencies to be an entertaining read. 3 out of 4 stars This book is a collection of essays by Stephen King on his experiences as a teenager in the Seventies. It is an excellent read for those who wish to learn more about those who made King's success possible. I think it is a little dry for the average reader. For someone who is a fan of King's novels, this may not interest them too much. However, for a young adult reader, it will be an excellent way to learn about the early days of the King experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ _______________  I did enjoy this book. It did not have the effect I had hoped for. I thought it was interesting, and the story did have some good parts, but it was also frustrating. I felt like I had been there, I had seen all of it, I should have known better by now. There were also some things that were made up, and then made worse by the author. I know the author is a good storyteller, and maybe she was trying to make a point, but there are some things in here I had no choice but to agree with my girlfriend, "This is just a book, why do we even care about it?"   The story of the book is one about a boy, Sam, who had a strange experience where he goes to a place, a place that he calls the "House of Leaves", in a book. In the house of leaves there are clues to the meaning of life, and things that make us realize we have been wronged. Sam is told by his father that he has done something that is terrible, so that he might be punished. This is what Sam is called to do, and it is a punishment that he must go through.   I really enjoyed this book, because it was a good mix of good writing, and good story telling. The writing, it was very good, and I thought the way the author brought up emotions and emotions in the people that Sam is around was really good, too.   the ending, it seemed to me like the book was telling a great story, and what ended the story was a huge disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** It's very disappointing and sad to read about this book as I was waiting for it for so long. The book is full of all this "old world" knowledge and knowledge that should not exist in our day. The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars is because it does have the right to be written in English. Other than that it's just a terrible book for a teacher to read for their students.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________This book will be useful in teaching the history of the US Civil War and the US Navy.It tells a pretty good story with a few issues. The story focuses primarily on the Navy, which was in the forefront of many battles, particularly the Gettysburg battle in 1863. It's a good story that will be of use to students of the conflict. But for an author that only seems interested in telling a good history (and he does try a few times at that), the book was pretty much useless, and almost the whole time I was reading it I was getting more annoyed than entertained. The problem is that he takes a long time getting around to telling the story of the Navy's involvement in some of the larger battles, or in any way even remotely connected to the ones that matter most to students. It is a good enough book to use it as a starting point for a history of that period. __________________________  "As the tide rose, all that was to befall the Union was a cataclysmic loss. It was the war's Waterloo.  On May 25, 1864, the United States Army attacked General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, just as Lee's army had invaded Maryland earlier that spring. The combined forces of the North and the South were about five million men, about two million of them from the Army of the Potomac. The Confederacy had a population of six million, about the same as that of the City of New York. Lee was outnumbered nearly four to one by the Americans, but he had some advantage: the Confederates had a strong navy, and the Confederacy possessed the only land army in the War."   ___________________________  Read more about:
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was awful. I really liked the other books they were publishing, but I've read quite a few of those already. This book had a very different vibe to the rest of the books I'd read before, and I really hated it. The only way I could even enjoy it was to read it again and try to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. I don't know how many people actually read a book twice, but this book was one of the few times I'd actually done that, so...
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________ I'm always one of those people who doesn't really like the same books twice. But I just couldn't resist the urge to read this one. I'm not exactly sure why I got it. It's not one of my favorite books, although it's good. The characters are all well drawn and the world is beautifully described. I got hooked from page one on the book I wanted to read. But when I finished it, I found that I didn't like it. I think I found a really nice story to read instead of this one which was just so boring. It made me think that I really like these authors, but for some reason, I don't enjoy their books, so I'm stuck with them and that's too bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I liked this book and thought it was a good book with a good message. It was a very emotional book. This was a book that I needed to finish. The book was very confusing at times. At first I thought I was reading about someone that was in a car accident. Then the person was alive and it was the "accident" that made the person die. It's very difficult to understand at times and that bothered me. I think that if it was easy to understand the book would have been 5 stars. But I still think that it's a very good book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a message to remember.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I just finished this book. I like the premise but this is just a poorly written book. The writing was atrocious, the plot was convoluted and stupid, the characters were dull and unlikable and the story was so-so. I hated reading this book and I'm sure many others will too. I would not recommend it at all to anyone. My only consolation is that it was free.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********  As I was reading the story, I thought 'why is this so bloody hard to read?' Not just because the writing is so bad, but because there are so many mistakes, it would be impossible to read more than one or two pages at a time.   You're the hero of the story. You find yourself in a world where every time you want to save someone it's like trying to get your arm back. Every choice you make is wrong, every attempt is made, every hope is taken, because the world needs you and you are the only one that can save it.   is where the plot finally falls apart. It begins with you saving your friend from the villain's minions, which involves killing an enemy. Then it's a long time later when your friend has gotten himself and his wife killed. You are not there for them. It seems like this was a plot point you had to follow as a matter of course. The book starts again and this time it's your turn to do what the villains did for you. You go and help the girl who needs your help, but it turns out the world has changed a lot since the last time you were there. There's a lot more war in the world, and the world is full of monsters and monsters are taking over. And the world doesn't need you.   a lot.     That's not the only problem with this book. The characters are the worst part of it. They are stupid, they are unrealistic, they're annoying and they don't have anything in their life. This is a book about a man named James, and it takes place in a medieval fantasy world, so it's not hard to come up with ideas for characters to be like. Most of the characters have such flat personalities that it's hard to even understand what they want, they just want to be loved, have the best life and to be happy. The only thing I liked about them were their names, which are just like my own names:  Kris - 'kris-kris'  Lloyd - 'lloyd'  the only other character in the book with any depth.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I wanted to like this book, but it is a big, muddled mess that is a huge waste of the author's talent. The characters are just plain uninteresting and the plot is way too cliche for my tastes. The book is full of ridiculous names (Dwarven Battlemages, Dwarven Battlebards) and random characters (The Green One, the Green One's wife, The Red One, The White One) that are just flat-out unimportant. The story is set in a time before a time-traveling character goes back to stop some kind of war and the action scenes consist of mostly the main character running about in a fight with all sorts of creatures, including some who are half-human half-beast races. The world building is poor and all the history and characters are only tangentially related. I would have rather read a non-action book. If you like this type of book and want something to take your mind off of reality, pick up this book and get rid of it fast. If not, save yourself a lot of time and money and find a better author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks.   "This book...  has some of the most tedious sections. I would have thought that writing a novel would have been less boring. There is also a lot of unnecessary dialogue, which is not only not exciting for the reader but actually feels like you're just reading a conversation. You could probably have used a few extra sentences, and I don't know why they are there.   of course there's the plot, which just follows the old plot of all of the greats, the story of how "THE CURIOSITY" took place. It's a boring plot, just like all of these books. If this book was written in the 70's, like in the 80's, then it would make sense. There's nothing new, only old clichés. The main character is a smart, funny, sexy female assassin. I know what you're thinking, "but she's a sexy assassin", I am sure that's true. But it just feels like she just happens to be a sexy female. This makes sense for the book, but I would of thought that would of changed by the end of the book. You've got all these characters from the "THE CRISIS" doing all of this sexy thing's. Not to mention the whole conspiracy thing, but it just seems like it's unnecessary. It makes the book feel like there is something else going on, like it has some kind of theme. It isn't until halfway through the book that I really started to feel like I've got a clue, and it starts at the end where a character talks about the past and what happened. And then the story just gets boring. It wasn't until I read another book from this series, and realized that it wasn't that great, that I realized I was really stuck here. I was expecting the series to be awesome, but instead it's just... boring."   The review does not say it all. The characters in this book are boring. The writing is annoying. There isn't enough development. The sex scenes are boring and not that great. The plot is confusing. The ending is unsatisfying. The world-building is confusing and sometimes you can't tell where the hell the hell you are. The way this book is written is a complete waste of my time. This book is absolutely nothing.  , I recommend this book to those who want to read a slow paced fantasy series where the main character isn't
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________ I had heard about this book before, and had high hopes that it would have some redeeming qualities. This is a very interesting, if somewhat disjointed, story about a man who has a strange and disturbing past. It starts out by showing the origins of a little girl (about 7 or 8) named Laura. She had a strange childhood, but she appears to have been cared for well by her mother. She was taught to read, and was also allowed to go to the movies, and to go on dates with friends (even if her father made sure she never returned home). So, by the age of 12, she has had a normal childhood, which she is shown enjoying. Then we go to an episode that is described as being from the day of the accident. In this accident, the man who struck Laura was driving his car at high speed, and hitting a tree, before continuing on to hit Laura and his child (her mother) again. As far as I can make out, this is a fairly typical car crash, involving a single-car crash, and the driver of the car was probably a drunk. But he gets away with it, because nobody would report the accident, because it wasn't a crash. That doesn't work for Laura, who starts to learn about the accident and the man involved. The story then goes on to tell of some years later, when Laura is 17. Her mother has died, and she has remarried a man called John. She seems happy at the wedding, and goes to live with John. Unfortunately, things soon change, and Laura begins to doubt everything she has ever believed in. I am not a huge fan of mystery fiction, and have read a number of good mysteries, but this one doesn't seem to have quite enough meat on its bones to sustain my interest. The ending of the book does leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Laura seems to have fallen for a boy named John, who also seems to love her. It may just be a coincidence, but I'm not sure. I had also thought that the man she fell in love with was her father, but it seems that is not the case. I will say that the ending of this book is not without its merits, however. It left me with the feeling that there may be a few clues to be found somewhere down the line, but that the answers will not be found immediately. I might give this book a
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________   The story is so unoriginal that it's hard to believe this guy made it all up. There's a couple of good stories in there. The main character is named David and is a man who's lived his life as a man, but since he has a son that's a girl, he decided to change his name. The boy's name is Charlotte and he is a girl.   There's a scene where Charlotte is on her period and the woman who's supposed to be her mother is mad at her for having a period. In the old days, when you had a period, the whole family went into a frenzy (except for the man who was still fertile. The rest of the family were all pregnant) and they wouldn't stop laughing and laughing and making up reasons for why they were mad at Charlotte.   a family of women all laughing because Charlotte is a woman. This is so weird.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********I love it!!I loved the fact that I didn't read it until last week when I found out about it through a friend's book group and I'm already hooked. If you like the Lord of the Rings series, this is for you! Great world building, character development, and an amazing story, I loved it! My only complaint is that I wish it was in e-book form and that it was longer and that the writing was a bit off. I just wanted to read it over and over and now I can read it right now at work!Thanks so much for sharing!
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!   "I wish I had read this book in its original edition,"   I've been wanting to read this series for a long time and now that I finally have it, it took me an extra half hour of reading because I was trying to remember everything that happened in all the books before, but even then, I wasn't too pleased with how much I had to go over it, and I feel like I've read some other reviews about how hard it is to get all the little details right, but my problem was that when I was writing this review, it just didn't seem to be that important. So I won't waste your time trying to make you realize how important it is!   Anyway, my review isn't so much about the story itself but rather how difficult it is for me to not get the "wrong" character or the "incorrect" interpretation in the book. I was so confused as to who was who all the time. For example, I thought she was a man, and then I saw a photo of her, I looked at the photo and it turned out it was a woman, but then again, I had never really seen the picture that well before (I didn't have the photo with me all the way). I don't remember anything about the rest of the book besides that the girl and the guy were very close in age (which I had no reason to think were different sexes), but then at the end of the novel, there's a scene where the girl (as in, the girl I thought was a guy in the beginning) talks to the guy about the fact that she had never seen the girl she thought she knew as a man before, and she thought that this was not a girl at all, but that the guy who she thinks was the guy was not at all like the guy she thought was her boyfriend.   My only other problem is that there were so many times that I got the wrong idea and it bothered me and kept bothering me. The only other thing that bothered me is that this book doesn't have any happy endings to it. It just seems like the author just wants the reader to forget about all the problems that come from her crazy characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a lot of respect for authors and I believe that people are entitled to be upset by bad writing, so I understand why people would feel that way about this book, which I found incredibly boring.  This book was so boring that I read it only because I wanted to see if I could beat the computer at the game and I didn't care who won or even that the game was a bad one.   This is what I would expect to find in a crappy paper book written by a student who's only interest is making money off of a crappy and poorly thought out book.  I read this book when I was a freshman in college.  It had an awful plot that I had to struggle to find good in.  In college, I was always more interested in things that were real, that mattered, and that would actually affect me.  The book doesn't have a purpose.  To me, the whole thing was an excuse to show how good he is at making money.  Instead of trying to make this book interesting, he decided to make the book boring and write the book so that I wouldn't like it.  So I wasted my time on this book.    "I'm just going to say it: You're the best computer I've ever met" I can't believe this book is being promoted as a classic, I've been searching for this book and I can't find it!  This doesn't deserve the honor!   I love that this is considered a classic by the college class that created it, even if it doesn't fit the criteria I set for my favorite books.  If you read this you will probably hate it, which is sad because it's not a bad read.  Unfortunately, he makes it sound like this was a really good book that a lot people enjoyed, but I just didn't like the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________   The novel takes place in a very bizarre setting. There are a couple of major characters, and a bunch of supporting characters (the rest are minor). There is a major plot (with lots of twists) that revolves around one of the main characters, who happens to be a vampire. The novel is very dense, and I really enjoyed it. It's funny and it's dark, and it moves along very quickly. It also does a great job of describing the vampire, and his world. I liked that the story had twists in it, and there were several character deaths. It did a very good job of not turning into the typical vampire novel that is out there. The main character is a bit slow to get around to everything, but he still manages to do a good job. The ending was very satisfying. It was a very dark ending, and gave a nice bit of closure. I'm very happy with this novel and highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************The plot is the usual story of an eccentric but well-meaning man who must struggle with his father's death and his own, and come to terms with the fact that in order to make sense of his feelings he will have to learn to not use language that is a bit inappropriate at times. But even the plot, which has some good moments, has its flaws. The fact that all the main characters are described as being mentally ill isn't entirely believable. The whole "being a weirdo is one of the things that has kept me coming back to this book" was also a little silly. I mean, it's a short book, and I don't want to read a book that's about one main character's attempts at a romance. But I've read other stories where the main character is in a relationship with a character who's a mental patient, and they don't have to go to college to get their PhD. It felt like an odd thing to include here, even though I've heard a few other stories about mental patients and romantic interests in the same vein as this one, and it didn't really hold up. And I mean "hold up" as a big negative. One of the most prominent themes of this book is that being unique is often more rewarding than being a typical, boring person. This book was a little too obsessed with showing the "unique" things that people have (like a strange obsession with a certain type of pizza) rather than trying to explore the actual theme of the book.I think this is one book I could probably read multiple times. The characters are interesting and the plot is fast-paced, with plenty of action and tension, but the book just feels too long at times for me to be invested in it. If I had to write a description of this one book, it would be "well written, but a little long".

You got the feeling that this author didn't give a f--k what his characters were thinking."   —Joanna (reviewer from the review at Amazon)  I have never seen so many comments as I did about this book, with so much hate. I agree it was very hard to read. I think the plot in the book was ridiculous and not believable.   the characters are a huge mistake   The plot was a complete waste of time.. I don\'t get why the author chose this as a main character. He is very stupid but he has to do whatever he is told.. why can\'t he just take a hint and follow his own conscience. I felt sorry for him but there was a total lack of logic and logic went right out the window.. he should have listened to himself when he was in prison. I was frustrated and disappointed because this book was not interesting and I expected more from my favorite author. This book was a joke, not a good book.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disappointment because it is a poorly written novel. There were so many characters and there are so many storylines that it becomes hard to keep track of the plot. Each character has an interesting story line that makes you want to learn more about them. There is one character in particular that is the highlight of the book because of how well she is written.  The characters had me on the edge of my seat and it felt as if I was listening to someone talk through all their thoughts and experiences. There was a lot of heart felt moments, some of the greatest I have ever heard in a book.  The ending of this book was a little disappointing because of the abrupt ending of the previous book. It was also a little frustrating because I wanted to know more about how these characters would be able to change the situation. There are a lot to learn about the world that I will be exploring more in the next books of this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is awful. The prose style is very clunky and slow. The writing style is the same, clunky, and slow as the book itself. The story was very uninspired, and I found the characters to be very flat and uninteresting. It was hard to care about them because the plot was so thin, and the main characters seemed so unoriginal and dull. I found myself constantly feeling bored as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      by: jen m. on 8/23/2014 byon 8/13/2015  Very poor quality work on both the writing and the artwork. I'll give the story points for that. But on the artwork, there were obvious errors in the shading, and the lines didn't do their job to the best of my ability (which is not high at all). I was already disappointed by the terrible writing when this came out.  View all my reviews
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________  This book should be called "You are not as beautiful as you think you are".   "I'm not beautiful. I'm not even pretty. I am so ugly that you are jealous of my flaws and my awkwardness. My skin is uneven and I have wrinkles on my face."   I'm so glad I read this book, because it gave me a deeper understanding of the struggle I have. I wasn't looking for a way to become a model but I have spent more hours in the mirror than my mother ever did, so my self-esteem is so low that I felt like I was never good enough. Now I understand why.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I just finished reading this book and it was a disaster.  It took me 5 hours to read and it felt like an hour and a half.  The characters were so weak and I have never understood why you should put a child through this book.  I felt like I was watching a bad sitcom.  If you want to read a childs book that is not too graphic but not too light please do not buy this book for your kids.   It is not a good idea to read this book to children.  10 of 11 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________"I am sorry to say I have finished the book and I am sad to say it's not for me. The only real joy was getting back home from a long and tiring day in a car. I knew what was going to happen and as I was going through each scene I was getting so depressed I couldn't stand it, so I ended up just closing the book. There are so many things that don't work in this book and the story is too long for it. I will just be sorry to read it."
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________ ___________  The main character (whose name escapes me at this time) is a child with a learning disability. We're told that he has trouble keeping up with his own words and has to be guided through his life by his guardian angel. His guardian angel is kind but, alas, does not come in handy until the end of the book when the kid gets into trouble. She seems to get off very lightly and the child ends up being put in a foster home with very old, cranky, and cruel foster parents. (I think they didn't like the kid's poor mother and father. They seemed to care very little for the kid.)   The book was too short. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star is that I did not like the author's style of writing. She seemed to go back to the style of her teen novels.   I would not recommend this book to a child whose main problem is having trouble with words. It was not really suitable for my son, who has a learning disorder that makes it difficult for him to understand and express himself, much less make friends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author was on to something when he wrote this book. However, the story has all the characteristics of the type of book that will get you to read the next one. The character development is a mixed bag. The male lead is a whiny little prick (though he's only in the first few pages), his wife is not into him, and his sister-in-law is an asshole. Also, it starts off with a scene involving a guy who's a bit too big for his britches.  The ending is great but the story feels like a trainwreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book because I knew it would be the first book in a new series by the author. It was great. It had great characters and great dialogue.

However, the ending was rushed, which I don't really like, especially for a first book in a series.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ I got this book for a birthday present and I got excited thinking that it would be good but I was disappointed. I expected a nice, light, funny, entertaining book that I could keep on reading throughout the night. Instead I found myself in a book full of angst, no plot development, no story lines, just angst, but with a twist and a story line to be continued in a next book. I guess I'll have to check the other books, but not sure if I will.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I have been waiting for this book forever because I am reading this one for the second time... the first time I got a bit sick of it, but the second reading made me so mad I had to write a review because it really was an absolute trainwreck. I cannot believe the author can't make a single mistake in writing this. She just keeps writing the same things over and over again. The fact that she writes books to kids is just beyond me. She should get the kids involved because it just does not work. I have given her three stars because I feel that there are a couple of good scenes and that there is one great story but the rest is garbage. If you read this book to kids it is a great read but not for kids. There is nothing for kids about this book except for the fact that it is very childish. I do not recommend this book, except if you want a little action. It is a waste of my time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********The book is so poor that it almost made me stop reading. It is the worst thing I've ever read. The author doesn't know where he is going or what he is writing. All he does is tell a story and get his words across so poorly that you think this guy is a bum who got a lucky break. I hate to give this a bad review because it is just so bad that I can't look at the back of the book and not see how bad it is. I read the book cover to cover and couldn't finish it. There is nothing good about this book. It's terrible!********  So you want to start a business. You have a good idea and the tools to go along with it. You are ready to go to a market. You decide to get some money. The market is a large and growing one. You need to get in there and get your business off the ground. You start to look around. You find a few other business owners. You talk to each of them. You learn their tips and tricks for success and they also teach you some tricks of their own. You think about it. What can you learn from this? You think to yourself if there is anything that you have ever learned in the last five years that you can use in your new business. That was it. That is all you need. You take that information, that piece of knowledge and you go out and put it into action. What else can you do? So you have a decent idea. You know what to do next. You make the first deal. You set up your shop. It works. You hear from others. You go on to do deals. You see that you are doing well. You realize that you could make a lot of money in your next business. What if you had a little more knowledge on how to do that, but you had nothing to show for it? That is what is wrong with this book and you have to realize that. This book is nothing more than a bunch of worthless tips and no real advice on how do you succeed in business. There are many other books out there like this one that teach you how to succeed in life and it is not the one that I am reviewing here. This one is bad and you should take your money elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sure this would have been an enjoyable novel, except for all the problems that come up when you try to describe people's minds in detail. There is nothing else but blather on. And it all comes across as amateurish writing, as if a writer had gone and read a lot of psychology or neuropsychology.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book is about a guy who was at war during the Vietnam war and had a lot of PTSD as a result of that. There was a lot more conflict in the Vietnam War and it had the same kind of war effect that the US is having now. I thought it was a waste of time and read other books by the author. ***********   I wanted to enjoy this book. I did. I loved it. I liked the characters, and enjoyed the story. I had to put it down for a few minutes because it was just too long. I wanted to go back.   The story has a good amount of action. The characters are the main focus. I really liked the fact that we see the Vietnam guys go from being angry and angry with the war to actually understanding why they did what they did. They were in the war for a good reason. They had to protect the country, and they did their best. The war changed them and I don't think they ever really got it back. I didn't like the guy that goes back. He is like the son of the guy he killed in a war. I think that he went back to that guy's home just to get revenge. He was like an angry kid. He killed a lot. He went back and killed a woman in front of her children. I couldn't get over how sad it was to read that. I understand that it was for the greater good, but I still don't understand how people could behave that way. The Vietnam guy should have gone back. That guy deserved better than what he got.   and the war is just a part of life. I feel like I read about one bad war a month in history class. I don the Vietnam and the Vietnam-like conflict a lot and I'm still in the process of figuring out how to deal with it.   "I wanted, for instance, to understand what life in Viet Nam was really like, and what happened to the people who lived there. If I were a kid there now, I'd have to say that life was better than my life back in Vietnam. I'd say that the people were nicer, and the food and clothes and houses were nicer. And the soldiers weren't as mean to us, or that there were a lot fewer guns."   Well, I liked that. He didn't want to go home. He wanted to stay with his family in America. He wants to be
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I read this book for the first time last year, and have been rereading it. In the beginning I was expecting a very "sketchy" story, but it didn't live up to the hype. The characters have little depth. The plot was good, but the details didn't really stand out. The author does a good job of keeping the plot moving at an interesting pace, but sometimes it can feel a bit contrived. This book may be worth a read, but I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I got this book because I am currently a pre-med student. I already had read the author's previous books which was very informative and enjoyable. In this book he is a little off on the science. He also makes some really wrong assumptions. For instance he states that some of the best foods for you are from fish. I know for a fact that this is wrong as salmon comes from the fish. This is the first book I have read where the author gives out wrong information. The book is very long so I have decided to read it in chunks. After reading the entire book I realize I made a major mistake and the book can be changed. I would not recommend this book to anyone.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for my daughter. The book didn't work for me. It is just another book, with a new name. Not a good book. The characters and plot are just too silly. I don't understand what he's trying to do. I think the reason that people like the book is that they get the sense that it is very serious. But it doesn't have much going for it in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ If it was only a few pages, I could have easily forgiven it. But it was two-hundred pages of boring exposition about the importance of family, the importance that "we are what we repeatedly do" (and, as a result, that "what we repeatedly are" (in our minds, our family) is a better thing than what we think we are) and a lot of advice to try to be happy (in the end, not much of it worked). The worst was the advice to think about "things that really matter" or to "look for joy" or something like that. The book was mostly about feeling bad about ourselves, about not having been happy when we did things, and about what makes us happy, and nothing could have made me happier, not that I need a book to make me feel happy. It was all basically about what is wrong with my life. I was always a happy person, my family and I, but I guess that is not so much of what is important to me. Maybe the point was to be better, more happy, but that is a really hard goal to keep up.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********   This book will not hold your attention. It's boring and not worth the time or the effort to read. The author is very slow to explain or develop. There are some details that are missing and/or the details given are vague at best. The pacing was all wrong. I was waiting a very long time for the climax to happen. But, it never did. The ending was not satisfying, I thought I had known what I wanted all along, but instead I was left disappointed. I had a good sense of the characters, and it's hard to imagine them as they appear in this book, but I had no idea how they fit in with the other characters in the book. This book would have been better had it been a single character in the story, the rest would have had more depth. I guess the book will be best read while sitting in your car or by yourself in front of the tv while you are waiting for a big event in the day to unfold. I don't think the story can work as a standalone unless you really are looking to read a book about the aftermath of some large disaster. I'm sure some people are going to love it, I certainly didn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was fantastic. It is very difficult to compare the first half of the book with the second, which is how I thought the book would end. The first half was a well-done, darkly funny romp that was almost a bit too bleak and tragic. Then, the second half was so dark and bleak that it was almost unbelievable. I think that was because the author had to make sure that the reader is very very scared at the beginning, and is so frightened by the end. And there is a big twist at the end that is the ending the story needed to get to and I found that it worked.   Overall, this is a great book. I don't know what makes people enjoy it so much. I have no idea why the author kept writing. The story is simply too unbelievable for people to buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've been reading this book for nearly 5 years now and I can't understand why so many people have not given it an honorable rating. I'm a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy but I really can't take it seriously anymore. Here are some excerpts: We should remember that the earth was formed by a supernova that struck the young sun and created the moon and a great planet. So for us to think that this event somehow somehow created life is just ridiculous.  There are millions of star systems in our galaxy that would still be there if not for that supernova.   For the first billion or so years, all the habitable planet systems were in one place, with the habitable ones all on the same side of the sun.   If you had no way to travel through space in the first few hundred million years of the universe, life would not have developed as it does now.   This theory was the most common explanation back then but has been abandoned because it was just so obviously true.  We now know it wasn't true.   No intelligent life would have stayed in one particular star system for a billion years if they could have just gotten there quickly by jumping into space. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first and possibly last book from the publisher was a bad one. The author has a bad habit of creating stories that seem to come from the mind of a fictional character and not from the real world and this one was no exception. The main character, Harry, was a very well written and likeable guy but his story was not that interesting. His wife, the wonderful Mary, who has a daughter in the book was an awful character and I didn't care for the story much. Even if there was some romance in the story I could only find the love interest to be a complete waste of time. After reading this book I have to say I would not go back to this publisher but I do hope that they are not around much longer.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   - I read this book to be on the same level as John Dies at the End, the movie. Unfortunately, I think this book falls way behind. I think the author was overzealous in trying to cover every possible topic with the same treatment. He didn't just pick a few topics and then throw in several tangents. He did this in all the chapters that dealt with the topic, as if he was saying that if you aren't reading his book, you aren 't paying attention.'   - The "facts" he gave were so wrong and so many of them were just speculation without any supporting evidence, but more than that, they were completely false.  The movie takes place in an alternate reality where the American government decided that the world's population would need to be controlled in order for them to stay alive. The government started out by doing this by trying to get the world to turn off the lights, which worked, but then they started to experiment with various other methods such as creating a pandemic, and other means of mass genocide.   He just didn't have any supporting facts that could be verified to back up any of the claims made, and I didn't feel like he tried. There were a few specific things in this book that were just downright stupid. For example, one of the topics that was mentioned several times was that you should "keep your distance" from other people as much as possible. I remember a guy mentioned that he was friends with his neighbor and that his neighbor started out as a friend of his friend, but ended up becoming an enemy of his. I was able to guess the names of these two guys based on what they looked like, which is the only reason he could have mentioned them.   for a start, my neighbor and his friends are just as much enemies of my friend as they are my friends. The only difference is that he has his own life that is going on right now and he could be a murderer or whatever the hell is going to happen. His friend is also just a friend, he doesn't even know how he is going in life. This is just so weird, but it's also true in real life. It is not at all strange to have friends that are good friends with each other, and to not know what the fuck they are doing in real world life right now. Also, if you just go into any restaurant and say hello, that doesn't mean you know who
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************** I really liked the book and I'm glad I got it for Christmas. Unfortunately, the book did not do justice to my enjoyment of it. There were two things in the book that really irritated me. The first was the introduction of this guy, who was in the hospital when the book was written. I did not like his introduction and it was really boring to read about his situation. Then, I thought it would be funny if it was the other way around because he had already met the main character by then. I found the whole story about him not knowing who he was to be very strange. It was all a huge mystery and he did not know who he really was. There was no point to his appearance, he was there to tell the story about the "mystery man" and all of a sudden I did know who it was. Then I started to laugh a lot. I felt he was very boring and not interesting at all. The second thing I did NOT like in the story was the fact that the other main character did not see him in the end. I thought the "other main" character was also boring and boring. This other main character was there for the whole time the book started and then disappeared again. If it had been interesting for him to meet the main characters, it would have been nice to know he was not going to survive. This was so bad because I had been wanting to see this character meet the other characters and then go to see him. That would have made it much more interesting and exciting. I was really disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not worth it.   There are so many lies in the book that I didn't even bother to read it. The author is a big liar.   to the very end of the book the author is bragging about how he's never done a book review before, yet when it's his book it's really a very informative and useful book that should be read by every author that works with professional artists because it's the real thing that they can use. But it was such a cheap book and so very inaccurate. I really hate when authors are just trying to make a quick buck and the information that they give isn't factual at all. It was very obvious that this was written by someone who is very passionate about their book, and I was disappointed.   (This review was taken from an email that was sent to me by a reader)
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- "A story of love in the world that it tries to create." I've read this book 5 or 6 times now. It's terrible, just terrible. It starts off with a great love story, but the author tries to pull the story out of it by telling the wrong love story. In the story he is telling, it says the guy is in love with someone who is never even mentioned, which is not true. He's not in love in reality, but it's really hard for him to accept that he's in love anyway, so he just decides to be in love and not be in reality. Then later in the story, he realizes he has a girlfriend and he's not really happy with it, so the girl ends up leaving and leaving him too. So this is what the author is doing. He tries to tell the love story to tell why the girl left him, but in reality it was the wrong thing to do. The story is completely and utterly unbelievable, and you have to do a lot of work to understand it, because it is so confusing. This book has all the wrong message for teenagers. You can find out about sex, drugs, suicide, death, and so much more. But you really want to know about love and how to deal with it. This is just wrong. It makes you question what it is about this book, and what kind of person is writing it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I thought this was a very well written book. I really liked the information and the information was well organized and presented. I think this would be a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about the Church history. I like how the author didn't just tell us about the good and bad and tried to explain things from both sides and was not just bashing. I am so glad that we have books like this that not only show that people are not all good and not all bad, but show us the good side as well. I highly recommend this book. It is my first time reading a book from the LDS church and this one was definitely well worth the read. This book was very easy to understand and to be honest, I didn't need to go to school to learn how this church came to be. So if you are looking for some information and a balanced view about what the LDS Church really is I would definitely give this book a shot. Thank you for putting the time and effort into this.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This is by far the worst novel I have ever read. The only good thing about this book is that it is an "origin story", that the author wants you to think he is a "pioneer" of the concept of the story, as it is based on actual facts, however it just feels out of place to be able to tell the story of a man, who was raised in a primitive community, without any formal education, to be a slave, who is then able to save his family from slavery, and make his way through a new world with the knowledge he gained, in an epic storyline of almost 900 pages. However the ending is really weak, it is not surprising at all that a poor man like him is able to survive in the new world, to make it to the age of 50, and to eventually save his entire family, and the whole of this book was just a waste of the author's time. The author should really start writing "real" historical novels, and just leave his "origin" story at home.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I had high hopes for this one, but it's a waste of time. ---------------  This book is a disappointment.   The author fails to provide any real insight into the topic, just enough to provide the necessary info for the reader to understand the topic and then move on.   I have no idea what he means by his claim that "It was easy to go from being a slave to being an equal."    The main reason why I decided to get this book is because of the book club that it's recommended. It is also an excellent source of exercise for the mind, a way of learning and learning well.  I was so excited to get my copy of this book because it was recommended by a fellow reader who had a book club and this is an interesting read.  But unfortunately this book does not live up to my expectations. I was interested in learning more about the topic but instead it turned out to be a dry and boring read. I had to put it down because the last few pages were just not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, this book had me hooked right from the beginning. I was blown away by the idea and I was very excited to see where he was taking this. I thought the plot was brilliant, and I think the ending was satisfying.   But this book has some pretty glaring errors and inconsistencies that make it a complete waste of time. This first one is just one:   There was no description of what he actually did to get the crystal. He never explained how he got it, and he never gave a description of the "thing" in his hand. So, when he's explaining to Harry what he saw, why he had to do it, how it was done, how he escaped, etc. you don't get any of that. Instead, we're treated to this...   He had a pair of tweezers, a black box about the size of a small suitcase, a knife with a serrated edge, a glass ball the size and shape of a fist, and a very small wooden box that looked like a suitcase with no lid. He opened the box. Inside, he found a blue crystal, the most beautiful crystal he had ever seen.  It was so clear, and so pure. It shone from the inside like a gem. He put it in his tweezer, took it out of the box and held it in one hand. He thought about it for a second, then placed it in the other hand.  was there anyone who could have made such a beautiful thing out of a crystal of this purity?  He knew, he had known, he would be able to make it work. "I can do this," he said to himself, "I am so very strong." Harry opened the other tweezery box. "See, this one has a black bead on top, and it is a different kind. The top is different because this black bead, when spun, creates an effect." He pulled the black bead out, and, when it was set down on the table, it created a different effect from the one it was spun. He looked at it, but it didn't make any sense. He spun the bead in the same way, and the effect disappeared. He couldn't explain it either. "You are so very clever, Harry," said the old man, who, it turned out, was a wizard. He had been a wizard before Voldemort destroyed his world, so he could
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was so bad, I can't read it anymore. I thought the first one was okay. Now I realize why so many people love it! The book is just like this one - you don't get what you pay for. I'm sad that I got so much for so little. It will take years for me to be happy with this book, but it's sad to see that many people like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had hoped that this would be a great book that would show me how to do something great. It was not. It's not even a very good book.  I was disappointed with a book that I really thought would make me a better person and help me with my self esteem. I feel like I'm back to the days when I would get a good deal on a book and then try and re-sell it or take a discount. It really just did not do anything for me and the price was really expensive. I know it's hard to recommend this book, because I thought it would be worth the time and money, but I couldn't recommend it as anything but a waste of my time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed reading this book, but the main problem was the lack of a plot. I liked the characters in the book but what the characters needed to grow into is something they could develop over time and the main character, Terese was never given that. The book doesn't really have an overall plot and that is a big problem in my books. The only problem with the main characters in this book was the main love interest (for the most part) and the two time traveling characters. The story just got boring after about the second or third time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes romance and doesn't like the main romance characters, but not the two other characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this one at all. It had some interesting ideas and interesting characters. However, it was written in such a way that you would expect the worst from the beginning, and that's exactly what you would get. It was also very short. I found myself skipping ahead, and I'm usually a fan of reading to the end of a story. There were some good ideas in it, but the story was just so bad.   I didn't do this review for the story, I just thought this was one of those weird ideas you might have to read a couple times before you start getting a grasp of what's going on, or what exactly the author is getting at.  I got a free copy of this from a friend, it's definitely not an accurate description of the book, it did not help that my friend sent it to me in an email that was totally out of character for him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't love this book at first, but I've learned to trust it's abilities to be very good. I loved that it was written by a woman. It would be nice if more female authors wrote about women, or at least books about women that aren't "romance" books, and aren't marketed at young girls. I wish we could see more and write more books with female characters that aren the main characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high expectations for this book. I knew this one would be a difficult read. I had been reading books by this author a few years ago. This book was the last of those books. I was expecting a book filled with complex themes and intellectual depth. I expected her to be a brilliant writer with complex ideas and stories. I didn't expect a book with plot holes and bad ideas. The story was poorly written and she couldn't think of any way to make a story interesting. I just felt like I had to slog through this book to get to the interesting parts. I finished it before finishing the other books in the series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:........................................................................ 1.5 stars (1.5)  I had been thinking about buying the book for a while before finally buying it. I was worried that it would be a dull, dry, and not interesting read. What I did not expect was that it was boring, dry and not particularly interesting. I have no doubt that there are books out there that will not leave you wanting more, but this one did not strike me as one of them. I would give this book two stars and would still like to read it, but I don't think it's worth my time and effort. I found the narrator to be quite distracting and I found it difficult to concentrate on the story because of his tone. I'm going to give it two stars because there are some good moments in this book, but in all honesty I'm not sure they would have been enough to carry the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   The Good:   * a very enjoyable story.   This book was good for me because it was the first book in my first fantasy series. I enjoyed the story and I learned some of the terminology. It also had a decent amount of action.   This book was fast paced and had a lot of action and adventure. The author has some good descriptions in the first section.   the last part of the book was a bit confusing.   in the last section, there was a huge battle, and I didn't get it. The ending was a surprise and I was glad I read it.  -good world building-   the world building is solid. The story is interesting and the characters are interesting. The magic was not as good as I hoped it would be.  , the writing wasn't really good. I think the words were a little hard to read at times.   and the action wasn't very exciting for me.    -characters felt real-   He has the most well developed characters. There is a sense of humor. The characters weren't as interesting as I thought they would be for a fantasy series like this. The only interesting characters are the protagonist and the one who has a very dark history with him. I would have liked to see more of the other characters as well.  It was hard for me to read a book like this because it wasn't easy. I didn' t like how the writing style was not easy to read. It seemed a little slow to me. I don't understand why the author didn't keep the pace better. I did find that the ending was unexpected. I wish that the author had started the story with the character that has the more interesting background of the story. It is hard to keep a steady pace.   of course, there is a chance that you will hate this book. That is why I said the author has a lot to learn.  P.S. I am a beginner at fantasy. I like the fantasy genre, but I will only write about books that I enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I've read The King's Legacy about a hundred times over the years, since it first came out in 1963, and every time it's been the same experience. The story takes place in New Zealand in the years between the First World War and World War II. Our heroine is Jane. She's just about to embark on her marriage to an old English landowner. She has a child and wants to settle down. But then the war breaks out. I'm not going to go into details, but I think the book's plot would make for a more interesting book, but the plotline just isn't there. For example, a few scenes have her sailing around New Zealand on a ship. There's also a bit where she talks to a man in a boat. There was some other very minor bits where she's in some very rough terrain. It's not so bad in the book, when she's not at sea. However, when the ship goes down, there's nothing left, and the only things left in it are her and her child. It just didn't seem right for her to be so miserable at sea after such a long and successful life. There were other minor things. But it's not like she has a whole bunch of friends. It takes her quite a while to find her way around. So when her ship finally sinks and she's found by the coast guard, it takes her three or four days to get back to the land. Then when she does get there, she doesn't seem to have quite enough money to keep a roof over her head. She tries to make friends and is rather lonely. Then she runs into a friend who says, "I'm a sailor" and he helps her find some money, and that's all she has. I know that the story's set in the first half of the 20th Century. That's what the author was trying to do, but he really hasn't done that at all. The rest of the book seems to be all set up for the second half, but then the plot just doesn't work for the book. It doesn't even make sense that it would make such a big difference. I can only conclude that the book was originally intended to be about a wealthy New Zealander who falls in love with a girl in the backwoods of Australia and gets married to her. I think that it's just too silly to do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is NOT worth the price it's $16  It's a book written for adults. The sex is not hot. The plot is weak. I had to put it down and go to bed at 2:00am after finishing this book. I couldn't take the fact that my fiance kept asking me if I would read another book so I read this one because it's supposed to be in her favorite book club. I'm going to do this for her so she won't get upset when I say this book is not worth the $16 it's about the price of a book from a local book store.   I'm sorry to say it but this is not good reading.     Now, this book was really written for people who like romance. I think it works with this but I would never want to read this to my child. If you like good sex and are looking for a story that is sexy but not too bad, then this may be for you.  ....  I had to read the beginning, and I didn't like it so I put it back on the shelf until I could find a copy.   (I'm not sure why this book wasn't worth the money it was $16)   "The story is about the love story between a young boy and his stepmother. The stepmother loves the boy too much to let him be with his father. A tragic accident happens to their daughter that makes it hard to see him as a son. Her mother then turns to prostitution to get the boy to love her as a daughter. The boy has to choose his loyalty to his stepmom and to his daughter. He has no idea what to choose. The son, who loves his step mother, becomes a criminal. The daughter has to make the choice between her loyalty to her stepmother and her son."   (I think this book could have been made better by making the mother a bit more likeable. I know she's a strong character but she's hard to like. She's always yelling, and always trying to control others. I didnít really like this. I hate it when the author takes a female character and makes her look like she's always getting control of others. Like, how can the woman be controlling people when sheís always trying so hard to control everyone. (I think that would have made the mother easier to like.) The son is a bit hard to relate

This was an experiment, which has yielded some interesting results and is still worth reading. I thought that it was a good idea to let me do this experiment. The plot seemed to me to have more of a plot to it, but I don't think I was able to follow it through. The way the characters' relationship developed, and how they reacted to one another were very well done. However, I feel that I got more of an understanding of what the author was going for. Overall, I have enjoyed this book, and I'll keep on trying new ways to read the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters have an unbelievable amount of depth and this book is the perfect example of that. The main character is a young woman named Grace, who goes through a series of events that almost tear her life apart. There are a number of other characters in the book, and I would have liked to know more about them. However, the plot is interesting enough to keep you interested. There is some very dark themes in this book and I was afraid I would be upset by some of the topics discussed. However these themes were still very interesting to read about. I also did not enjoy the way in which Grace was presented in the story. I found her to be overly perfect in many ways, but I think that is more because I am not used to the idea of the perfect person and how it works in real life than the story itself.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing sucks.  It's a very slow, one-sentence, long story that goes nowhere.      It's a book of the "where are they now?" genre, a book where we know where they are now and how they got there, but we don't have the time to learn anything about them or their current status.  So, you can't tell much from a book like that.  A few characters and a few plot elements that are not important to the plot.  The writing is not very interesting.  There's no depth.  It's an odd way of writing.  I'm not going to lie, the writing was kind of fun while I was reading it, but as I went on I felt like I didn't want to continue reading it. "Worst of the Worst" was a fun read.  My only complaint is that there were so many stories, all written by different authors.  This is the most eclectic list of books I've seen yet.  Hopefully I'll be able to post some of my favorite books.  If you're a new author, I can't wait to read your next book!

It lacked the sense of direction that I would like from a story like this and it was hard to get into. So I gave up on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really don't understand this book. I think the author is missing a key component. First, she has this really bad habit of going on and on about her personal experiences of living in an oppressive and sexist society. I have experienced that. I also do not agree with her assertion that the sexism in Japan is more severe and pervasive than what I have encountered in the US. I do not see any gender issues in Japan as far as I can tell, in that I have lived in a few male dominated cultures as well. Also, she does not seem to understand that Japan has changed since I went and lived there. She states that she is from a more conservative time in Japan, but that she never had to deal with sexism or have her personal space violated as much as I have. That is simply not true, at all. I can count on two hands the number of times I have had someone touch me in a non sexual way and it has not been the men, in fact it has been women that have done it. If the only things a Japanese woman needs to keep her from being assaulted are to not wear short skirts and to be a virgin, then the country needs to take a hard look at what it has gotten itself into. I am still trying to figure out why Japan does not want women to be feminists, but I don't think this is the issue here.

The author was also well written and I liked all the different points that she made. ------------- 5 stars: ------------- The book took me to different places: -------------------- The story was well done; I was able to follow it well because it kept me from knowing what I was doing wrong or right.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My son and I had trouble getting this book. We were at the library, and asked the librarian to check it out. I wanted to see if the book was a hoax, but after a few minutes, the librarians told me that it wasn't. We decided to go and buy a book called, The Devil in the White City. The man behind that book was James Van Praagh, who has been writing and publishing books, including a book, The Last Days of the Roman Empire, for decades. His website and his books are well done, and well researched. The book is, for the most part, accurate, although there are a few parts that don't seem to be. He is well researched, and his presentation of the "true history" is excellent. I don't know why so many people don't read his books, but if you're going to read them, and you've already read Van Praag, this book will be right up your alley.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This is not a bad story. It is a poorly told one. This has the same problem that most modern day fantasy has. The world building is not good. The story revolves around an elf that can talk to horses and can teleport, and an elf who is a wizard and a spy for the elves. I know nothing about either of these, or their origins, and have no idea what magic is, or why a wizard has to be a spy, or even how that elf is able to speak to horses. And it doesn't help that the protagonist is a female elf. I thought she was a good protagonist for the story, and the book was well paced. But by the end of it, I felt that I had read a bunch of filler. I would not recommend it."

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I didn't enjoy this book. I didn  I'll preface this by saying that I was really enjoying the first part of this book, but I found myself feeling the need for a shower after reading this part. I really can't put my finger on why, and I have never been so disgusted by any book, written or not.   For anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about, it's an example of how poorly written an author can be. I can't even think of anything to say that hasn't already been said about the book in other reviews. It's the type of book that leaves the reader questioning why she/he is reading it in the first place.     I did read the following synopsis for this book which read:   When the world is on the brink of total war, the greatest minds in the world join together in a secret alliance to stop it. And if it's anything like the past, they might not survive the conflict, never to set foot outside of their bunker.   I have to agree with this synopsis. This book has everything: super heroes, super villains, secret alliances, and the main character is a Nazi.   the book takes place during the last year of WWII. The book follows the exploits of Dr. Heinrich von Kleist, a scientist who uses Nazi technology to create a weapon that will destroy both sides. But Dr. von Kleists research is being corrupted by an evil German scientist known only as 'The Doctor'. It seems that the Dr. and 'The Agent' are trying to create weapons that will kill both sides, and they're trying to keep their research a secret from the US. The plot becomes a lot more confusing in the latter half of the book, and it starts to get harder to understand as the book goes on.   (hide spoiler)   The book goes to great lengths to describe the effects of radiation on humans, especially in the later sections. The descriptions become less and less believable as time goes on, and you start wondering how they got away with all the radiation. The author never seems to know when it's appropriate to use terms like "toxic" or "disease-producing".   Overall, I didn?t enjoy this one at all.   a quick synopsis for the book. A scientist comes up with a way to kill Hitler and his forces. However, because he's working for the Germans, he's going to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would recommend this to a friend who is looking for a new science fiction story. However, that friend is not me. The story does not take place on Earth but in space. We find out that this is only an accident, the ship was abandoned, and there is a lot of confusion and bad weather. A lot of the story was taking place in the sky over a very bad looking city, the one with many skyscrapers. The only reason I can think of for this was the writer was not thinking about the planet. She really needs to think about the world the Earth is living in.   I do recommend this book to the science fiction reader who is a new reader and is looking to get into the genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a book that I really loved and read. But as the author has stated, this is not a traditional epic fantasy book and it was too long for me.

If this is your first epic fantasy and you like the traditional epic, then I would not recommend reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************ This book is the WORST book I have ever read in my life. I could NOT finish it, because everything about it was disgusting. I've never heard of a book like this before, but this book has it all. From sexual abuse to incest, from sex to rape. I don't want to give away the whole story, but the ending was disgusting and not at all logical. I was upset about it from start to finish. I just couldn't understand why the book did what it did. This is one of the biggest problems I have with this book. And yes, I am disgusted that this book could exist and people are still buying it. I hope the authors of this book get some serious mental help, because this book is completely horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is the most poorly written book I have ever read. I found it to be an almost completely incoherent mess. I had to re-read a few chapters several times.   The first chapter is an example of incoherence. The main character (the author) claims that her mother had a stroke in 1977, and she died. She also has a son (the narrator) who's now the leader of the city's drug cartel. Her ex-husband died in a car accident in 1978, and her daughter's son died in an accident in 1981, when the narrator is 24. In the first chapter she tells her grandson that his mother had been shot in 1977. Then, in the second chapter, she tells him the same thing. So now the narrator believes that his father was killed in 1977 and his mother was shot in 1980. Then she tells the story about how his grandmother was a crack dealer. She was killed the next year, in a drug bust. That makes sense to me, since the drug cartel she belonged to was busted in 1982, the year before the events in the book. But then, the narrator goes back in the third chapter to 1984 and says that her father and her mother used to sell drugs. So maybe she had a drug-addicted grandparent. No, wait, maybe not. The narrator's mother died in 1988, when she was 31. She then has a friend (the drug dealer) die at age 26 in 1990, and then the narrator was born. So the narrator, who was born in 1988 is, in effect, 27 years old at the time she is writing her memoir in 1984.   the narration doesn't help, either. The way the narrator speaks (he sounds very young) and the fact that he is also a drug dealer makes me think of a young Christopher Walken, so much so that I wonder if the author ever saw his movies. So in this sense I am a bit baffled. I just can't believe that the author is 28.   was the narrator really 28 years old?   So that's why I gave the book 2 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was disappointing that the authors did not follow through with their plan to tell the story in a way that would give it a more interesting, exciting, or dramatic feel. In particular, they failed to give the story of how the character of Harry Potter became a wizard; which was not well received by many people (myself included). I was hoping for something more along the lines of the books with the added dimension of the magic. I think the first book in the series (the first chapter of which can be found here) did a better job of conveying that dimension. Also, the characterization of Dumbledore was less than perfect. He seemed to be more concerned with the Harry Potter of his past. His actions felt like he had forgotten how Harry was feeling or acting. I am also a big fan of Harry's family, particularly his mother, but I would have liked a little more of a feeling that they have a connection with the reader. This is not to say that the characters themselves were bad, but that they just did not do the characters the justice they deserved.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most boring and uninspiring book I've read in a while. What was the point in writing it?   I would read it again but I'm not sure I'd like it any better.   It's just so empty and predictable.   and I hated how the author never gave a clue how she was going to get the character to change their perspective.  It was as though the story was constructed as a joke in the last ten pages and the author just dropped that bomb without a hint of foresight.  a very bad book, don't read it.  and i never heard of this author, she seems to be an unknown author and her books are mediocre.   of course it is also a work of fiction, that's the reason why it is such a waste of time. It is uninsightful. It does not provide any sense of mystery and just makes things boring and repetitive.   with a better author I'm sure this would be one of the better books. But unfortunately, she is no better than many other writers with an inferior plot. There are times when it is just too much and she doesn't have the time to put any sense into it. If the book was written by someone who knew what she was doing and was actually skilled at writing, this would have been a 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I wish I had read this book before I started this course. I'm in my late 30's, have been with a guy over 20 years. I wanted to settle down and get married to this man for the rest of my life, but he has been unfaithful every year for the past 8 or 9. I had been through counseling and therapy, and I was determined that things would work out eventually. I never thought anything bad would happen. I kept trying and trying, he even took me to a counselor after the first time. But it was never enough. He wanted to have a child with me, he wanted a family and he always wanted me to be his perfect wife. But he's been unfriendly to my friends and my family, he has never spent time with me because he was always busy with work and my kids. I was miserable. It's been 8 years and he is still with another woman. I know it's not his fault, but still, the fact that he is a horrible person I could care less about his wife. I have already taken so much from my marriage, but when I found out my husband was cheating on me, I had to get away. I thought it would be easier with him, that he'd have a hard time cheating because of me, but it hasn't been that way. And it is still not better than what he did with that other woman. When I asked the therapist and the counselor what they thought he would do if I did find out, the counselor said to have an affair. And the therapist said if you did that, I would believe you when you said the guy was unfaith worthy. He said I'd be happy with him. He says I need to divorce him so we can finally start a new life. I don't know what to do. I keep trying, but I don not know what else to do anymore. He's going to cheat on me. And I don  "The worst part is the loneliness, knowing I have to take care of my baby's needs because I know he has his own."  Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was interesting, but too short. It didn't have a good enough payoff to keep me reading past the final paragraph. The author did a good job of describing what went on in the first part of the book. There was one point where the story was described as a man and a woman being chased by a giant. There were no descriptions of their physical characteristics. The description was of their "fighting." I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be impressed with the fight or be disgusted with it. The story is interesting and the fight was fun.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********   I was expecting a great book with a good plot, but I got a book that sucked all the fun out of the book. The author claims to have invented a language. However, her language is almost as unreadable as the plot is. Her ideas seem to come from the most random sources like a teenager's thoughts or a dictionary entry. It is so obvious the writer is writing as she types, but she is a terrible writer.   The author is the most unoriginal character ever. She never really connects to the characters. She was always on the same page and never changed her mind.   is my least favorite book I've read in a while. This book isn't just bad, it's boring. It made me want to stay up too late and watch TV. I can't say this enough, I hated it.   the review: I read the description for this book very quickly and I thought this was a very entertaining and well written book. My wife and I both liked the book, but we didn't really think it was all that original. However my brother said that this is the first book he has ever enjoyed. He said that he has really enjoyed reading books that he feels were well written and the plot was interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to my daughter when she was 10 months old. It was the first book that she'd ever had an interest in reading and it wasn't long before she was reading all the classics. But as an author and teacher, I found the text a bit frustrating to read. The book was written in the 50's, which was around the time when most children's books were written. There was no real attempt made to convey any sort of depth to the story which seemed to follow the same plotlines from beginning to end. I found it rather boring, especially the middle sections where the author tries to create drama. I would recommend this book if you have a child of 10 months or younger, but that might be a hard sell with older children. This is a great book for an infant and a toddler who has a curiosity for history and a love of reading, but don't expect anything serious or thought provoking.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********I did not like this book at all, as the story of the first book was fine. It is not very enjoyable to read this book as well, as it is really slow. So slow, that if you are not the person who can read fast, you can't make any progress in the book. You will really struggle to even finish the book before you get bored with it and have to start reading the next book from the beginning. The narration and writing style was really bad in this book. There are many times, when I would think to myself, "is this a bad voice??" and other times, "are they trying to get me to think that the main character is stupid?" so many times. If you don't have time to read the book, or have a bad time with it, just give it a chance to end. I really thought that this book was just bad. However, I didn't mind the fact that I had to wait till the next one to read it. It can be like this, but if you have read the previous book, you'll be able to get the gist of it right away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this book is a mess.   First, it is not "science".   Second, it claims that the body is a system and that the brain is the driver of that system.  It tells you that your body is designed to have specific functions in specific places.  There are no definitions of "specific" anywhere in the book, but I do not need to know what "specific means" because I have done my job and have made up my own.  You can't have a "specific system" or "brain" and also think the body works on purpose.  So it is really more of an idea than a science book.  I think a great example of the author's lack of understanding of what is going on in the body can be seen in this excerpt from the book: "The body can create a lot of different chemicals for a lot different things in the way the body does it, such as digestion, or the immune system, or hormonal balance, or even respiration. But the body's purpose in all these things is to get energy. It's designed that way. Your body is constantly working to get the energy from food you eat to fuel your activities."  The author says that the system is designed, and it is, but the fact of the matter is that the human body can not use energy for all things it was designed for.  The brain is not designed to do a lot more than make you feel good and get you through life.  Even when the brain does a lot, it has to get oxygen from the blood to run.  To do that, the brain has to burn fuel and it does so by burning fat and muscle.  I have an idea what the author is trying to say, but to say it with any accuracy would require a degree of knowledge or insight that the author does not have.  One can also not argue that the mind is an independent entity that can only be controlled by the brain and it can have no impact on the body.  This is the definition of a brain dead person.  What the author needs to realize is that you can not have an independent brain and you can't get the benefits from an active mind without an active body. The book also tries to tell you that you should not worry about the quality of the food you are eating or the amount of exercise you are doing.  If you just let go, you will live a long
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________ This was a wonderful read, but I didn't feel like it had much substance to it. There is no true plot. No real emotion, or tension, or anything really to think about. Instead it is just there for the sake of plot, and for showing what different people think about a certain subject, and some of the things that people say. It would have been great if they had gone into more detail, like how there is a world of difference between believing in the truth and the truth being in your mind, and being completely delusional, but as is this was good enough for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise, as I mentioned in the review, is that when a girl was born, she didn't know how to walk or talk. She was thrown down the stairs and survived because the woman that took her care kept telling her that if she fell, she'd die.   Now, that's an amazing thing to hear. A girl was told that if a fall was to happen, she would die, but she survived. Amazing. In the beginning, the writer seems to be trying to say something really important about the human condition. She is trying to tell you that people can do some really amazing things and that when you fall, you need to get back up. However, the rest of the book gets to be a mess.   the character's names are... odd. One was called "Chloe," and the other was called Chloe. And no, the author was not consistent about how the name Chloe was pronounced. Chloe is "C-i-k-i," it's not the same as "Chl-a-y-n" which is "Chi-lo," and "Ch-i" is a feminine and not the masculine.   The story of the girl that lives with her aunt. As a child, the character gets into some trouble and has to live with her Aunt and her cousin. The Aunt tries to make the character do things in a way that the character is incapable of doing them. Her Aunt gets all "naughty" and "prude" and tries to get the character to have sex with other people and go to school. The character is told that she can't do it, but it doesn't really matter because the author doesn't want the reader to get attached to this character because this is her aunt and the author wants us to hate the character. She gets "nudged" until she gives in. She even gets to have her own character killed. That's all okay for the author because the reader will be "nagging" her to kill the character, but then she has her character killed and the reader feels very upset.   The main character and her friends, while they don't do anything wrong (like the aunt did to her), are constantly being bullied, which is why they feel alone and unhappy. They go to a school where everyone is different and that is why we like them. They are different. We don't like them because they are different and we want them to be like
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an awful book. I got it for my boyfriend, who is not much of a reader. He is not a big fan of fantasy, but he really enjoyed this one. The main character is a girl who was raised to be a warrior, and she has grown up in the wrong gender role. It takes the reader through several stages of her being turned from that role. When she first starts, she is just an average girl. But she has a very powerful magical bond with her animal companion, who gets killed. She then gets a new animal companion and starts training her again. But the new animal is a boy. This is an odd thing, but she has the bond to him, and has never felt the desire to go back. She finds herself attracted to him though. After they start living together, it becomes very obvious to her that she is his wife. After their first child is born, they have their second child, and then they have the third child. After the third, she starts looking for a more appropriate role for her in her marriage. She decides to take the animal with her, so the animals don't run away. She starts going through the process of becoming a woman. She has a few issues along the way, but eventually realizes that she really can be a woman that she was meant to be, in her gender role that she grew up in. Overall:    The main problem I had with this book was that the author doesn't know the proper gender role of the heroine. He doesn't have her do the things in the book that should be done for a woman in this role. She could have been a warrior. Instead she just goes through the motions. It also makes me upset that he doesn't teach us how to change from being a woman into a man. I would have liked to have seen him show us how the heroine does that through the series. I also found that the book could have done a lot better with her backstory, but I think that it would have been too much to ask for a sequel. It just seemed like too much stuff to be added too quickly, as it did seem like he was trying to add in some things that were not there in the first book. So I guess I don't really think that I will be picking up more books by Mr. DeCaro, but at the same time, I can see myself giving him a try when a new book comes out that he is more comfortable writing

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  I bought this book because I wanted to read about this man, I did not know who he was, who he worked for, what he did, what the book said or what the author of the book says. It was like going to a museum and trying to find out about some person you don't know. I found out he was a very wealthy man who had lived in the west. He lived in a house built in 1868. He owned many different properties and I think that would be why he is in the book. I saw an ad for his book and thought it was a good idea to buy the book just to see what the man was all about. I am so glad I did. This book does not give any information about who he is or what he does. There are a lot of other books out there about him that I read on the subject. This one gives very little of the history. It is mostly about some of his wives and the time they spent in the woods. He did have a house in New York. I have seen it and can say it has a lot more to do with his wife's family than the "wilderness" in New Mexico.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- -------------------------- The premise of this book is fascinating, yet the story suffers greatly for it's lack of detail. The characters are also bland, I never got a feel for what the characters were thinking and feeling at any given moment. Even the protagonist himself, is just a blank slate, he had a plan of how he would end the war, yet when it came down to it, he seemed like a weakling. The only character I liked in this book was the protagonist's love interest, which is unfortunate because he was a complete ass. Other than this, I was bored to tears by the characters, plot, and the whole thing.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   This was my first book. I read it because I was so excited to read about a new book by a new author. I got the paperback copy because I wanted to read this on my own.   However, I have to say that I didn't enjoy this book.   for one thing, the first 5 or so chapters are absolutely horrible. I started this book thinking it would be interesting, but it was actually a complete mess. The author's prose style was absolutely terrible and so was the way she put words together. I kept having to restart my book to make sure I understood what she was saying and I couldn't understand a single sentence. If this were a movie, it would have been horrible as well. It was too bad because the author seemed so eager to give a positive review.   the only thing I can say for the writing is that it didn't sound or look like anything written by an English teacher. It sounded like the author was writing in her own language and that she didn't care about making the words sound real.  .   of course this is all based on my first reading.    That aside, I'm still a huge fan of this author. She is a wonderful story teller. I was really surprised at how much I liked it.  's books are usually very good but this one was not. I would recommend the book but I definitely won't be reading it again. It is just not worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was the worst book I have ever read by someone with no training as a professional writer. It felt like it was written by a child, without the ability to write professionally, because it was very rushed to get the story told, and it was the wrong type of story to write. This was the first book I've read by a teacher that has made me feel very depressed. This book makes a teacher out of a 10 year old girl, and makes her sound like the villain. I found this book extremely disappointing, and had little sympathy for the author because she is the main reason I dropped the class I was taking.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book. I felt like this book lacked the depth to be compelling, it was just about characters that were all a little bit shallow. This book was basically about characters talking about themselves and their issues without offering much of a back story or actual plot. I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in the 1980s and didn't like it at all. The characters are silly and the dialogue is terrible. It wasn't until about a decade later, when I stumbled across the book online, that I remembered the fact that the characters had "died" in a shipwreck. They had been killed. The narrator of this book had a really weird sense of humor that is almost annoying. He was so bad that I stopped reading this book at about the first 20 pages. I think this book is one of the worst books I have ever read. I'm going to have to give the rating 2 stars for the fact of having read the book when I was younger and liking it. 2 Stars for poor grammar, and 1 star because of the poor book. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very expensive book and I would never buy a book that was overpriced like this, especially for a book I read for free through one of the freebie sites. I tried to get into this one since I didn't have to buy it for a few bucks, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. It was all over the place. It went from a book about the power of prayer to a book by some crazy priest or something. The prose and the stories were not really my cup either.   I could understand if the writing were good, but I really was looking for something that was more in the nature of prayer books and other spiritual books that talk about helping the person and finding out what they need to do to get to heaven and all that sort of thing. I didn a want a real prayer book that would help me get to know my God better and help me find peace.   with that said, the book isn't that bad and I think I can recommend it for people who want a book to read if they want to understand God or just read it to help them get to that place they want.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some good points and some that I disagree with. It is the type of book you can't put down. This one I read in a few days, so there are lots of places that I would like to fix it. The fact that the protagonist and her friends are "the best" (at what) is very interesting. The reason she wants to leave them, even though they do lots of good for her is not explained and her actions seem a little stupid to me. I don't know if the author tried to make it as realistic as possible, but I think this is a good idea because this book is full of problems.   The characters are not explained very well either, so it is hard to feel for them, or if they are real, how real is it for them. I found the way the characters are written to be really stupid and annoying. They are so unrealistic and unbelievable. I just hate them, I hate how unrealistic they are, and I can't find any reason for them to have such strong feelings or actions.  -The author has a strong anti-war feeling and does not want the world to end in the middle of a war. I really wish she would explain a little more about why she has this feeling and why she wants the world not to end.  .The idea of a "harsh" world where everyone has their limits and can get a little too intense for comfort are interesting and I like them a lot.  , I love the idea of the friend of the protagonist. I am surprised she got along so well with the others, and the fact that she is so kind and considerate is really cute. I wish the author would try to add more character development and not leave these characters for dead after a while.   in fact, there is a point where I want to kill every single person in this book. There are too many things going wrong, there are too few actions for each of them to be interesting, and they all hate each other. I want the author to make the bad guys more interesting (this is just my own personal feeling), and add more development to the world.   the way this book was written was a bit annoying as well. There is a long section where the narrator narrates all the events, so the readers get used to the story and don't understand when she is narrating from the point of view of the main character. It was also hard to keep the
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________This book is poorly written, and has very little in common with the series and characters. It's a typical epic fantasy set in a fantasy world, and it's been done many, many times before. A few of the characters are interesting, such as Senna and Tariel, but the rest, including the dragon king, are boring. It is clear that most of the writer was simply copying from the source material, which is really lame considering they are both written by a different author.I would have liked to see some more originality in the story and characters, but I guess I was just too tired at the end of the book, so that isn't really a good reason.Overall: ______________This was a terrible book. I am so tired of the same old, same old from epic fantasy books. I had never liked these types of books before reading this one, and I found myself getting a little irritated by the characters in it. I didn't give the book a chance and gave up after the first chapter. If you are a fan of epic fantasy and fantasy novels, you will probably like this book and I encourage you to do the same, but if you're looking for something different or a good, good read, just skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not one for the'reading' of anything, but this book has some good points, and is worth reading.

Also, it helps that the book's ending was quite happy.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The only good thing about this book is that it was free of hype. ******** The book is basically the story of what is going on with the team at the beginning of the year.  The entire story seems so boring to me that I have no idea how the book even got published in the first place.  The team is the worst  in the history of the league with the exception of the 1996 season.   It is so bad that I find it hard to believe they make the playoffs any time soon.  The reason I don't like them is because the players on that team are terrible.  That team also has two players on it who never played in the NBA, so you have to wonder why they are still on there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really hard to read because it is filled with mistakes. The author has written several books that have the exact same format as this one. I am pretty sure that if he had written it as he wanted it, then it would not have been such a slog. The first half is really annoying, because the author does not explain his premise or story line, and does not get into detail on anything. It feels like the author was trying to make a good novel, but just could not think of a good story. The last half of the book is a slog to read, because he goes into some very detailed detail. If you are like me and can't stand reading a novel that is boring, then don't read this book. I don't know if I will buy it again, as it seems to be a book I would read as a one off or to give it to a friend.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I did not enjoy this book. I was not looking forward to reading this book and I expected it to be more exciting or engaging. When I opened the book it seemed like it was written by someone who is not in a good mood. I think the characters had too much going on in the book and there were many times I was lost about what the character was trying to get across. I also did not understand what was going on with the characters and their relationships. They seemed a bit random. I just did not have a lot of interest in reading the book. It seems that many people who enjoy paranormal books or are interested in this sort of thing may be disappointed with this book, although I have seen a lot written about the paranormal in the past. I'm a little disappointed because I thought the book would be different but the characters were not all that compelling for me.

It is filled with a whole bunch of horrible mistakes and contradictions, and I am sure many people out there are going to be put off by all of the errors in this book. Also the author claims that his book is based on a true story and he even includes a photograph of a man that was in the original book that he claims is his character. There are so many obvious mistakes in this story that it will have people calling you out for putting so many different stories into one book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a joke. First the author tried to use it as a plot point in a story that has nothing to do with her character. That's why I wrote this review. She tried to make the reader think that she's an evil person because she was so mean to the little boy that she never really loved. I read it because it's a parody of all of those horrible books about a little girl. The writer is so good at using the worst parts of the books and making it a parody. I love reading such a book and then seeing it was just an excuse to write a crappy book. I also didn't realize that there was a real child in this book. What is wrong with children? This book was just made for adults. The author just added a creepy ending.

Write a negative review about a bad book:............................................................. I read this book in the 1970s when I was about nine years old. It's quite a difficult book for me to read now. I'm only reading the first half. It is an account of a group of young children and their parents. I feel that the book is very emotional for the children, which is good because the author does a great job of giving them all a different background. They are all different races, nationalities and religions, so it adds to the believability of the story. The way that these characters speak in this book is just wonderful. I think I read in some of the other reviews that the author didn't write very well. I felt that the story wasn't very well told. I would have liked to have seen some more interaction between the adults and the children. It was somewhat slow paced and sometimes it felt that there wasn't enough explanation. I guess I will read it again in a couple of years, but I was hoping for more from the author because it wasn't a very emotional book for my young mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that I didn't enjoy. I was really expecting to enjoy this book because it is very educational in many ways. But, I just didn't like it. I've already bought another copy and have a book club meeting tonight so this will be going back into the stacks. I just wasn't that interested.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________ If you are the type of person who enjoys reading books you'll probably enjoy reading this book. I liked the story but it didn't get to me the way I would have liked. The story was told from the point of view of a young girl as she grew up with a father that worked in a small warehouse. She was raised by aunts and uncles who were married but she felt that it wasn't right. In the last couple chapters she's given more of a chance to express herself and learn the truth about herself as a result of her decision. I wasn't interested in that part of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've only listened to one book in all my years of reading.  A friend gave me an audiobook of a book I didn't like and didn't finish.  And I didn, despite reading some of the bad reviews on this site.  It's a book that I have to explain why I'm a bad reader.  Because the book is so bad I'm going to tell you why I hate the book, and why that doesn't make any sense: "All of the books are written by the same author, and they are the same characters and settings.  (Yes, it's a lot of information for a single book, but this one is so long, that you're going to lose interest in the story if you can't follow every detail.)  The story takes place in the fictional world of 'Eberron'.   A plane is stolen by the thieves, but the plane is being piloted by the planes' mechanic, and there is a mystery involving the theft of several different planes.    The planes were lost because a group of people, who call themselves the 'The Guild of Calamities', have been manipulating the plane.   They believe that if they can manipulate one plane for long enough, they will manipulate all planes for good.  When the planes start to disappear, you have a group that are very powerful, that's not going to rest until they have their 'ultimate goal' and they can bring the world to its knees.  The main character of the book (yes, this book is about a wizard, he is the main character, that is, he has more than a mere book and an army of undead to defeat) is a wizard named Rhalgr of the House Ghastwood.   He was a 'normal' wizard until his brother was killed.  That is when he 'turned'.   He is one of the most powerful wizards in the world.  And he is one hell of a strong-willed guy!  So, what happens?  What is the 'ultimate' goal?  How do you get there?  And why should you do what he's about to do if it doesn't work?   So, let's do a little analysis on this story.   I won't give you a summary, because there are a lot more details to get to, but I'll give you the basics.   Ghast's army (as described in the book) are
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________ This book is really bad. In fact, it is the absolute worst book I have ever read. I don't think I will ever read another book from this author again. It is filled with blatant errors and nonsensical plots. The characters are dull and generic, and the story lacks a true sense of mystery. The ending was horrible as well. I feel like I am being forced to read another "The Haunting of the Dolls" for Christmas this year.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************* This book is really bad. In fact, the only thing I enjoyed in it was that the characters seemed to all be friends of a sort. The writing was horrible and the story didn't work. It seemed so random and forced. The author had no idea what she was doing when writing the book. I really thought that if she didn't know what she wanted to say then she could have done some research on her own.   There was some writing in this book about a boy that's trying to become a girl, but he's trying really hard. He's having a hard time even trying to be a girl. It was so unrealistic.   at times the author would get really upset, and then start complaining about her writing. The only thing that seemed to be working was the characters. I could not care less about the characters, though, because they were really stupid.  :-O This book took about 100 pages to get from beginning to end, and it was pretty uneventful. There wasn't really much going on. Not enough character development. I was kind of shocked at some of the things that she wrote about. I don't really know how I feel about this book. It's just not very good. I got very annoyed by this book, and I don't even know why. I just don't know how she's doing it.   "This story was written without a single original thought in her head. It took three years of effort to write this book." So...she didn't think about it at all? She wrote this and didn't even think about the book? Why? "This novel is not for the faint of heart. It is written in a very high pitched tone. But I promise you this is not a rant. " What a joke, how could she have come up with this title?   This book took a really long time to finish, but it wasn't bad at all. There was a lot of people to hate. I hated every single character in this story. I hate every character in every book I read by her. It seems that her story keeps getting better and better. But my only hope is that I can get through this book and that she can get finished in her story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I didn't really like this book. It was really just the usual mix of "he goes on a quest to save his wife" (which is the usual pattern for many adventure novels, although it seemed the wife was a bit more important than in most) and then he encounters monsters and gets defeated, and he comes back and tries to save her again, but this time in a different sort of manner. It all came out really slow and didn't get any more exciting or exciting until the very end. I also found it a little cliched and predictable. It had a lot of similar themes as other novels in the genre I have read (Dawn, the Sword of Truth, etc.), and if it weren't so predictable I would have probably found it boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I liked the book and was really looking forward to reading it, but it turned out to be an interesting look at a lot of different aspects of the human condition. I liked what was written in the book, but I was bored out of my mind with the chapter titles. It was boring. The writing was good, but so was the rest of the book. I didn't like the ending either, but that is my opinion of a book. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but a bad one. It's just that I found myself bored, and that I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to read a depressing book about a bunch of characters struggling to get by on low wages and low expectations.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book reads like a "How to be Evil" guide. The author describes what he believes is a powerful set of rules and techniques for becoming evil. Unfortunately the rules and methods he explains are not very well thought out. There are too many rules that seem to only apply in specific situations and not in general. If you want to be a good villain there are plenty of good villain books out there that you can borrow. My advice is to stay away from the self-published versions. - The Evil Within (2008, 1st edition) by Peter S. Beagle A collection of horror fiction stories. This collection is a bit overrated. It is a collection of short stories, most of which are good, with the odd great story here and there. It's not a collection you should read if you want a complete horror experience. I also would recommend this collection to horror enthusiasts but be forewarned that the stories are very different from the usual fare. It does have the same tone as a lot of Peter Beagle novels and is worth a read for anyone that likes his stories but is not into the genre he writes in. - Evil Dead: A Novel by Robert E. Howard (1989) by Robert A. Heinlein I'll admit it. I was a huge fan of Heinlein and enjoyed many of his books. This book is not one of them. Heinleineser is known for his hard sci fi novels which I prefer, but this book is a complete farce, a thinly veiled attempt to cash in on the popularity of the slasher films of the late 1960s. The story follows the author's creation of his very own Slasher in a small small town. It ends as the Slasher is killing more people and there is nowhere for the police to turn to for help. This is not a great story, but it's not horrible either. It just comes across as very out of place to a reader who enjoys the "hard" Sci Fi genre. The only story in the collection that really stuck out for me was The Dead (also known as "The Devil in the White City") about the life of a witch, this story is also a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I was very disappointed. I did not think I would find a good way to deal with a difficult situation as this book does. It is a story about a teenage girl in college trying to figure out what to do with her life and who she is. This is a tough read. Not for the easily distracted or for kids who will be bored after a few pages. The author takes a very long time to explain the situation and why she is going through this, but then she starts to go into the real personal issues. It just isn't worth it. I'm not sure how I missed the first two books in this series so I might wait for the third to finish it before reading it. But I won't be surprised if this story turns out to be an interesting story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ I have been looking for the book for over a year now, and it has been on my to read list. I finally got around to reading it, and I have to say, this is the most dreadful book I have read in ages. I can't begin to describe how awful this book is. The language is crude, and the book just has nothing good in it. Even when I was reading, my mind was reeling from the language. I was so appalled by what I was hearing, that I had to turn the page and get back to the beginning, just to read the next page. I tried to find a place to put it, but every time I picked it up, it would fly from my grasp and fly back down to my mind. When I finally sat down to finish reading, it was very hard to finish, because I just couldn't put the words down. I'm not sure what I expected, but I was sorely let down. The author does a great job with the descriptions of the characters, but the character's actions make no sense at all. I could barely understand what was being said. I didn't understand a word of the plot. This book was so horrible that I can not even bear to read it again, even though I had read it so many times before.   Overall, this book was beyond bad. There are better books out there, but at least they're better than this one.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ My favorite book, the writing is amazing but I didn't like it. There are too many people that have problems with how the story is written and with characters in this book. They are all very one sided and don't seem real. Also, there are no happy endings for everyone. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I would read this again, except that it was over 50 pages long, and I got so bored that I ended up just reading it. In fact, I don't know if I would even bother re-reading it, as it's just too boring and tedious. The characters, while somewhat likable, are really boring. I had trouble with some of the details that seemed to come straight from Wikipedia. So if you're looking for a book that is well written, that doesn't have to be re-read over and over again, then give this a shot. It's very short, so you have time to just enjoy the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I started reading this book after going through a traumatic event that was related to my own family. I thought it would help me, but it has not. I don't recommend this book to anyone. The fact that this book is written by someone who doesn't know how to write, and has never read an English book is even more disturbing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________   I have always been a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, and I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up, hoping that it would be just as good as his other books, which are among my favorites. Unfortunately, it was not. It was not very good, in fact, it seemed as if a group of different authors had been given a book and were trying to come up with something to use it as a platform to showcase their skills.   The only real thing I found interesting about the story is the idea of the black dog.  , with a bit of tweaking (or maybe not), could have been used to great effect. But I don't know that I will read any more Lovecraftian books, unless I want to read a new one (and this one isn't any good, IMO), in which case I'd just read something else.   "The Black Dog" is a rather dull story that will only interest the more hard-core Lovecraftians.  : )
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ __________________________________________ My review : It took me over a month to finish this book. As you can imagine, I was not in a very good place. I was at times angry, at times sad, and at times frightened for myself and my family. I kept hoping that I had made the right decision and that the information would get through somehow. I even found myself looking up references to the book at home as I read. I ended up on a site with people who had also been through the same ordeal, just to see if they could help. My husband even came home at night, and when he told me what he was reading, I felt as though I were looking at someone that I didn't know and would never know. What I ended reading though, is just so so. I have a feeling the author may have felt similar. I wish I could have shared more, but I can't imagine what I would have had to talk to my children about.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I just purchased this book for a library book club. The book is really good. The reason why I gave the book a four is because I have not had a chance to read the other books in the collection yet. I will have to see how it does once I have read other books and have them read to me. The author of the book does a great job of describing the things that are involved in the war in Korea. I hope that this book gets into the hands of the troops because it was well written, and I would like to have it. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that there is no good picture available. It appears that the author had a very limited knowledge of the people he was writing about. He makes a point of explaining that the North Koreans did not like the people of America and they were all about a military. I think he did a good job of explaining this, but I would have liked to have seen pictures available. This is a tough one to rate, but the fact remains that this is a fine book, and hopefully, other people will get a chance.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ The story is good and it follows the arc of the main character, but the last few chapters where the author takes a page out of Tolkien, try to change it up, make the story more complicated by introducing new concepts, and the author never really goes into the world enough, so the world feels like it is there, but it isn't there.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I'm sorry you had a bad experience with this book. It was a book I didn't even finish and I already know how the end turns out. The only thing I liked about the book was it gave a different take on a book that I have read many times and really liked. And it's not as if I have any interest in the story anymore after reading it, I finished the book and I really like it now as well. Just a bad story with bad writing and characters. I don't know why I'm giving this 3 stars, but I was hoping for more, just because I think the book is enjoyable.  Helpful as a primer.  and a very good introduction. I was looking forward to this one but it ended badly for the characters.   I have to say that I didn´t think I could finish this book, but here I am.   to be honest, the book took a bit too much of my time and I ended up feeling cheated. So that´s why I gave it 3 stars.   on the other hand, it was a good introduction for me. I hope that this book is an excellent introduction for people that already know a little bit of fantasy. It gave a nice overview and I would have loved to have spent more time in this world.  in short, i think the writer did a pretty good job of portraying the world of the book, although I found the main character a bit cliché and repetitive and the story a bit boring at times.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   There are 2 reviewers that have rated the book below 1 star:   The first reviewer gave this book a 1 star rating, but I found this a highly enjoyable read.   I liked the idea of a girl who is a "good girl" and loves her mom and dad more then her brothers and sisters. I liked that her mother never made her go to school. It shows that even if your mom is a saint, you should have your own thoughts and opinions of her. Her parents are good enough that she doesn't need to listen to the way of the world. She doesn't have to do what her mother says or think the way she does. She will just do it her way. I also liked that she would always listen to her dad when she wanted something.     Another thing that was interesting to me was that it showed that her parents had had a divorce, but she was so close with them because of how much they have been through in life.   on her dad he is a good man who does the best he can. He never did drugs or drink and he was always nice. He is an "old soul". His mom is "old" and in a wheelchair but she would be an amazing mom. Her dad doesn't drink and if he did it wouldn't be that bad because he has a wife and kids.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very bad. I was so sick of the same old stuff that I bought from the library. Now, I can get that stuff online at my convenience. I just found out about the author and she has no redeeming qualities. I don't know why she kept writing this book. I got sick of reading the same thing over and over again. The author should be ashamed of herself. I think she is just a con artist. If she can't write good books then she should quit trying to do so.   Helpful for me:  I can not say enough good things about this book and its author. In this book, a few pages into the beginning of the book, there is a list of books that you can find online for free. So, I bought it for free which really helped me find this book online.   A lot of people complain about how difficult it can be to read a book online but there is always a book for you. I did not read the book the first time I started reading it. I tried to read it again on a different computer and it took me a lot longer. That is because I wanted to go back to the book that I found so helpful before reading this book for the first and second time.  : There are certain passages in this book that are so bad it could be classified as plagiarism and not a true novel. I do not care about this but if you are looking for a good novel that has nothing but good material, you would be disappointed. But, it is a good book, I would recommend it to people that are not sure what to read for their Christmas list, that want to read something other than the Harry Potter books, or for an alternative way to learn about science and science history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole thing is a complete mess of badly worded sentences. Even though this book contains many stories about real life events, these tales are poorly organized, and the language is just awful. Most of the stories were written in such a way that any attempt at reading them would make you want to toss the book and start over. If this book was in a different genre, such as fantasy, the writing would have been much better, but there is no fantasy genre in my life. The author did not have any success in his life, and this book only shows the depths of his despair. In my opinion, he was the first to be written that had nothing good to say about anyone, and that includes himself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book sucked. I got this book because I was on a hunt for a good story for my son to read at bedtime. I wasn't disappointed. The book was fun and I enjoyed the book. This book had little to no plot. There was no action, no plot, no nothing. The author gave the story the feel of a true short story but it wasn't. I had to get the other books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I loved this book. I read it back in 2005 and it was the first time I read a YA book. It wasn't too long and I liked it. I just have one big problem, it was WAY TOO LONG. It was a lot of book and a lot too much for me to read at once. I guess that's because I'm an average reader so I don't like to read too fast and not too slow. Plus I thought it was really long and had no time to read it all. It felt like it took forever to read. The book was about a boy named Ben, and his friend Ben, Jr., and their dad who was a cop. The main character had to deal with his mom and brother not being around due to his dad getting into drugs. It all started when he was in the third grade and his dad was in prison. The story continued when he went to college. I found this to be very relatable to my childhood. The way the boys were portrayed were just like me. It's not very well written but it was very well paced. I like the idea of a boy and his brother who want to be police officers, but the main character was so much older than the characters that they grew up with and were afraid of. It made for a very interesting read. I did have a minor complaint that it felt like the story was going on way too long because it was that long.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a huge fan of books that are basically like children's stories that go on to become children's tales. However, this book is such a disappointment that I have to say that I almost gave up reading it in the first third. As a matter of fact, I read the first four chapters and then put the book aside and gave up completely. I could have finished it and then just started it again, but I just didn't see how the book could be made any worse. Then I realized that I was expecting so much more from the first book. The plot is so stupid, the plot twists so confusing, and so many of the characters are so shallow and annoying that I just gave up at the fifth chapter. This book should have stayed in the children's section at the grocery store I also thought that the writing was so poor that I had to read the whole book without any breaks because I couldn't do anything else. But, as I said, I found myself coming back to this one. I think the main problem with this book was that I thought it had so much potential, but it simply did not live up to my expectations. I do give it 4 stars for the humor.  The rating is just my opinion, but my rating is way lower than what my friends and family think.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just a horrible book, and I hate that I have to read this. It has a lot of negative reviews on it but the reason I put them up is because the book doesn't stand on its own merits. If you want to write a positive review of a book just read the positive reviews and you'll see that most of them are from people who actually enjoyed this book, especially the ones who praised the book's writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed the first book by the same author, but found the second one a little much.  The story is very well done and there's lots of action, but then it jumps all over the place, sometimes getting confusing.  I think it would have been better to stick to the first story.  Overall, a really fun read!
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________   "I read the first book, The Golden Compass, in one sitting. I didn't have any trouble staying focused on what was going on, but this was the first one where I couldn't tell if I was supposed to be following it or not. It seemed to me that there were lots of different stories going on all at once, each with different characters, who were all working against each other and that there was no rhyme or reason to it. I was like, is it a book about some magical person who uses a hat to travel the world, or a book where magic exists, but the magical people that we know never use their powers in a negative way? Was it supposed to sound like a book I can put down and come back to later, or was it supposed for me to just sit there and read it until it was over? Either way, I just couldn't follow it, because it didn't sound like my usual sort of fantasy.   So I decided to start over, and I went with the second book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It sounded a lot more like the series I enjoy, with a little more magic. It didn't take me long to figure out what was happening - it was going to be the same story with a few twists added.  -The main character, Sirius Black, starts off as a very good guy and a loyal Death Eater. However, when he returns home to be reunited with his father, he starts losing some of his old values. His father was a Death Eater who turned himself in and tried to get Sirius to do the same, and Sirius goes along with his plan. This story is about Sirius's descent into darkness.  ... and then there's Harry Potter, who has not just a normal childhood, but a normal, happy childhood with his friends - who also happen to be his friends.   that's about it for my first reading of the series. I'm a bit disappointed in it, but I'll give it another go, as I'm still looking forward to this book (which will be released tomorrow, I believe). I'm thinking that this is going to continue with Sirius's fall from the Light, and his quest to find his mother. I'll keep you guys posted!
Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................A good book with a major problem I was hoping I was going to like it, and I am sorry to say I didn't. I know the guy's been in the business for a long time, and he's definitely in the right place, but I really didn't feel a connection with the characters or the plot. They all sounded like they were just throwing things together. It's an intriguing concept to get a sense of what a "time machine" is, but for the most part I couldn't get too invested. I think the story would have been more gripping if it wasn't so predictable.   So many books are like this. I've read some great time travel novels over the years. I read one in high school called The World of Time and the Future and loved it. I had another book called After the End about two people who traveled back in time to change history and end wars, but it had a big problem: the guy who invented time travel was an idiot, and if he hadn't had some brilliant ideas he would have just left history the way it was. I don't know what it was like with time travel, but my favorite book about it was the movie Back to the Future, but even though I really liked that movie, I didn`t want to read that book. So, I bought it to see if I can make sense of it, but what happened was that I couldn`t.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book so many times I lost count. When I finally got it right the first time, I was excited to hear that it was in the public domain. The only reason I didn't buy it right away was because it was $60 from amazon. And the copy on amazon didn't look any good. I've since read the book twice, and I must say that I'm not a fan of the title either. But after a long day at work I can't do anything else but read something.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not do what I thought it would. It was boring and unenjoyable. I was not impressed with the plot at all. It just felt like a chore. The author didn't write very well either. The ending was also not all that special. I would not recommend this book at all but I will admit that I would have bought it if I thought I would like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I was given the chance to read a book by the author and I thought I might as well. I thought it was a nice read, it was long, and it did get to some good points. But I feel that I had to work hard to get to those points. I was not a huge fan of the book, the first half was kind of boring, with most of it being some "feel good" story about the characters and the setting, and the second half, well, it just was so depressing. I really wanted a happy ending and so I tried to work my way through it, which was really difficult. This book was really depressing to read and when I was about two-thirds of the way into it, I could not even care anymore. I just gave up and gave the book a bad review. It is not as bad as it looks from the outside, but it is definitely a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has a lot of issues with what he's writing and the ideas that he's trying to explain. He writes things off as some sort of logical deduction, and he comes up with explanations for the things that he wants you to believe that make absolutely no logical sense, and in a way that would be insulting to people who are logical thinkers. But I'll go ahead and say that the explanations for everything that happens in the book are so complicated that they would be pointless if he were not a writer that knows exactly what he is writing about, and so has a very good understanding of the book that he is trying to make and why it is important to him, so that he can write about it intelligently.   I think the reason he says things that way is because he's attempting to convey some sort to you in a very direct way that the logical deduction of things that happen in the narrative has absolutely no place in fiction. He has a book in which the characters (if you can call them characters) have absolutely no ability to solve any of the problems that he has created.  When I say he has a'very good understanding' of the 'book' that he wrote, I mean that he comes to the book with a very clear idea of what he wants to say, and when it comes down to writing it, his ideas are so wrong that they are just ridiculous.  I was actually shocked when I started reading the book, and I can't imagine why, because the explanations that he gives you are so convoluted that you have to wonder why he thinks that people will read them.  The 'logical deduction of what happens in fiction' is something that people seem to be fascinated with. If they're fascinated, I'm fascinated.  They love it when writers come up with elaborate explanations for things that you should know in a moment, and then, when you try to solve a problem that they have created, the solution doesn't actually make any sense.  At no point do the characters in the novel do anything to explain that they can't solve the problems.  And, at no point in the plot do they do anything that gives any indication that they know anything at all about the world that he created, about the people, and about what they need to do to solve the problem that he writes about.  He's a 'good writer', and he is a bad author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was just a really boring book that really sucked me in.   I wish I could give it an "F" but that would be a lie.  A bad book for every occasion.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. The book is great and I love it, but it has several huge holes. This includes, but isn't limited to the fact that the book tells you nothing about the other characters or the setting, and it completely ignores the fact the characters are the only ones who can actually affect the world, and that the setting is basically just a giant, empty desert. If you have any interest in medieval fantasy, this is a must read, but if you're just looking for a "cool" setting, then you'll be bored, which is not a good thing.   Story and world-building: _______. The main character, who has been called "the Chosen One" because of his abilities and role in the world is the sole redeeming part of this book. He is so relatable and real. The other characters are interesting, though I didn't really care about most of them, as they weren't likeable. I only really found out about them because I had to read the book at the end of the series.     Character development and development: ______________________________. The author is so great at showing how the Chosen One's character changed as the series went on. It was really, really good, and at times it actually felt like the author was writing for me. I didn the whole thing with the death of a loved one, and the other character was devastated too. He was also the main character in his own books and didn't have as much time to grow as the rest of the characters. It's all too bad as I really liked the other main character and I wanted him to grow and become more likeable and interesting.  . The plot is a bit predictable and predictable is a word that comes to mind. And yes, I get why it would have to happen but that doesn't really bother me as the story was amazing. I also liked how it was set during the height of the Mongolian invasions which is kind of cool too.   that is my only negative on the book, but you can probably tell I'm not a big fan of "filler" and other things that didn't serve any real purpose, but there were some really great ideas in there. Also the fact we could find these ruins was an amazing thing that kept the plot moving, and this kept me interested for a good part of the story.   of course, the fact there was no love interest, which was disappointing, and there was never
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you buy this book, I would recommend reading it on your computer instead of your phone.  I was reading it online, and there are some glitches.    When it first came out I was going to go to the bookstore and read it there.  "My parents took me to an art exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City this past weekend.  The exhibit was a little depressing.  It's a retrospective of paintings by the great artists in the 20th century: Rothko, Warhol, Duchamp, Monet and so on.  But all of the pieces were very much from a pre-internet age, where it took a lot of money and time to get something like this to people." This book is written in a way that's easy to read, although it has an art history slant and there's also a touch of philosophy as well.  This book is a good read, but I'd recommend trying it on a computer first.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. __________. __________________. It was a fun read but it was just so boring. I know there's nothing wrong with writing a book. But this book was just a complete waste of time. It just kept repeating the same things. I would not recommend this book unless you enjoy reading the same books over and over again. That is not fun. If you want to hear a story, listen to a radio or television show or read a book, this is the book for you. But if you just want to learn how to play the guitar, read a novel or learn how the government works, then you might want to look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________   This is a very entertaining book, but one I couldn't get through. It contains a lot of information on what to expect in a marriage. It also talks about what you can do to make it work. The author seems to be an intelligent person, so it makes it all a little difficult for me to believe she's being a bimbo here. I didn't agree with a lot, like, I didnít agree with the idea that there is a difference between being physically aroused and being emotionally aroused, or that sex is just an act that happens in a relationship. I found that a little hard to believe for some reason. I also didn't find any mention of the role of communication and how to negotiate boundaries.   I'm sure the author didn't mean to be offensive to those who believe that they can have a healthy sexual relationship without sex, or the idea of the "normal" marriage. In her attempt to present the "perfect" marriage, the book is extremely biased, inaccurate, and condescending.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********************I am so sorry to say that this is a bad novel.The plot is predictable and so is the characters, because most of them are morons. In fact, I could have read several million more novels by this author about other stupid people.I don't know if it's the author's fault or the fact that a lot of authors don't write this sort of stuff.The characters are dull and dull. Their motivation is boring, their plans are boring, and their dialogue is boring. The romance is boring and there is no chemistry between the characters.There's a lot to be said about how stupid the plot is. I was expecting an epic battle between good and evil and I got nothing but a boring, unimaginative story.I will never buy a book by this book.This book is so boring I feel as if I'm watching a comedy show.The worst part of this book is that I could easily have been a moron.There are a lot more interesting things to do than go from one town to the next and meet stupid characters.The author is just plain boring and makes his characters out to be more interesting than they actually are.As an ex-student, I know what happens when one of your teachers goes out of town. That's all I need to know for my day to be over. I don't think this novel had anything to do with my class, but I suppose it is the only way a writer can get away with writing an excellent book about boring characters and boring things.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________ My son is now 13 years old and we haven't read anything else from this author yet. He's reading a lot of horror right now (Haunt, Deadgirl) and has told us of his fascination with the old books that haunted him as a child. The title of the book is very appropriate because he is obsessed with the haunted old houses in which he grew up. The book is a little slow, but very engaging. If you are a fan of creepy/spooky books, or are someone who finds a lot in books and bookshelves, then this is a must buy.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This is an excellent book and I would recommend it to anybody that wants to find out a lot about human behavior. The problem was when I got it, I found the book to be badly written and not very interesting. My wife told me about the book and then I got the book itself and started reading it. It has a lot of facts and information that are very easy to understand but it just wasn't very interesting for me. I do not think I have ever seen anything in any book that is presented in this way before. I am very much looking forward to the next book to see how this book does in the same genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that is full of misinformation. I don't know if this was the author's intent, but it has the potential to give false hope to many people. For starters, it was the first thing that this author mentioned after the beginning of the book. I've already read this book several times and I've tried to look up the various studies, but I was unable to find them. Also, this book was published in 2013. The information it provides about the body, weight loss, and cholesterol was way over a decade ago. The book states that the American Heart Association has a guideline of 1200 calories per day and the amount of cholesterol to eat increases dramatically with age (especially in women). However, most diet books I've read state that the most effective method of weight loss is 1-2,000 calories per week. Most other diets I've seen state that you need to eat 4,000 to 8,000 total calories per month. When you look at the body of evidence in regards to these different recommendations, it just doesn't make much sense. The authors have even made a link to a study from 2008, which shows that "eating more than 2000 calories per breakfast or lunch per day is associated with increased waist circumference". But the link to that study is removed from the article. Furthermore, if you look up how calories in/calories out relates to weight loss or weight gain, this study doesn't really fit in with anything other than that eating 2400 calories per morning is bad for you. However, I guess they just found the "worst" research that fit their agenda. Another interesting thing to mention is that this book doesn't state whether or not eating 1000 calories of protein per day increases your lean body mass and whether or't consuming carbs per day increase the lean body (fat) mass. I'm sure that this isn't a big problem because a 1000 calorie serving of protein would contain no carbs. However if you are trying to lose weight, this seems to be important. Also if you try to calculate the amount calories needed per day, the average is 1500 and the highest is 2650. However in order to lose 1 pound of weight, you need 2500 calories, not 1500. This isn't the most important thing, but if you can get the average 1600 calories, I would suggest keeping your calories higher. This is one of the most outdated books I have ever read in my life.  The Best of the Rest:  This is a great
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ My Santa had some pretty awesome ideas and they seem to be really good at putting those ideas into the right books. I'm not quite sure how this happened but they went to the trouble of finding books about space travel that were actually written by actual space travelers and included some really good information on the subject. My gift included several books by Neil deGrasse Tyson which were a perfect pick-me-ups for me while I tried to figure out how I would convince my husband to let me take his place on the next rocket trip into outer space.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!   This book was a complete waste of my time.   First, the book started off well enough. I was interested in seeing what was on the other side of the door when my wife left for her trip to India. At first I thought it was the ghost of an Indian woman that haunts our house. I thought about the fact that my kids would be in school in a few days and I would miss the kids but my wife would probably go to India herself. But after I read the description of the woman and followed it through the story I was disgusted.   in my opinion, the author made it out to be the Indian ghost that comes home and tells her that she is going to miss her kids so much. The book makes it sound like she is a ghost that is just out to destroy her. She is an evil person who wants her kids to be happy and never come home. Then, she goes on and on about how she is trying to do it. And if you are a parent you can imagine that the horror starts when you realize that you are hearing this woman talking about your child. This is not something you want to hear.  . She keeps going on about her plans to take away your kids and they should be happy, but at the end of the book we find out that she never takes away their joy. They are still happy and you can tell it was a great experience having her come over.   the author even tries to say she is not trying to hurt you or scare you but she is just telling you how you should feel. Then at the same time she says she loves you and wants you to be proud of your children.   I think that the author was trying to scare the reader. She says that she comes to your home when your kids are asleep. I never thought to that my child was asleep when I read this book. She also says that if you stay in your home that you will lose your life. I have been working so hard to save for my kids college funds. I worked really hard to put a few months aside for them and I didn't think she was going to come and take that away from me. Then I read another book that said the same thing. I guess I just can't believe that she said it. I really hope my kids are happy. I want them to grow up healthy and happy. And I know that my wife won't be doing the same. I am just trying to keep

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________ My 2-year-old daughter, as a rule, cannot tolerate the book of Psalms. After listening to some and then to "What a Difference a Day Makes," she sat down on the floor in front of me, and demanded to know what happened to the other Psalms!

She got the same reaction when I showed it to her last night, after reading the reviews.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My wife and I really liked this book. However, we would have rather read another novel, such as a horror novel, and we felt that this book was better for being set in the Middle Ages.  Our only complaint is that the author uses the same technique to make the world and events more frightening for the reader.  " I'm a man in my 40s who's lived in London for years. I've fought against the city and won and lived to tell about it. I can't think of anyone else who would want to live in this city, as a child, or as an adult. My favourite story is 'The Battle of Dunhill,' when a young boy runs in to the house of the Earl of Mar, a wealthy and powerful man. The boy's father was killed by the Earl's son. When the boy asks what he has to do to become Earl, the Earl asks, 'Is there something you can give me? I'm not asking for much, just a piece of land. If you can take a piece or two of my land, then I'll give you the name of a great man in this land, who'll make me a very rich man. Your task is to go to my land and steal something for him, while I am away from London. What do you think?' The boy says, 'I'd be happy to.' The Earl says, "It isn't going to be easy, I know it. But what you have to do is a great thing, for yourself and for the Lord Mar.' And he walks out of the room."  At first I wasn't sure what to think, as I've read some of these types of books before (i.e. Brave New World, 1984, 1984). I don't know what to expect when reading a novel set in an alternate universe, but in this case, I was taken aback and disappointed by how the author presented it. It really made me wonder how an alternate version of London would work, and if the books in this alternate London would be any better or worse than what is currently known to the public. This is something that could be examined more closely later, as the book had several very strange and surprising twists that I felt could have been avoided if the author hadn't so blatantly taken from the books.  My wife and son really enjoyed this book as well. It would be interesting to see how this altered London (with its changes to the

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for fun at the library. It was about a young man with the power to control the weather, who decided to use his power for good. So far, so good, but he's been arrested by the police, and now he's going to be in jail. And his only way out is to make it rain, and get more people to donate to his cause. When he starts his first rainstorm, people start dying. This is so unfair. This book is too long and it really goes in the wrong direction.  A book with two amazing characters who were meant to be best friends!  By a girl who loves all things spooky and scary! 's a ghost that's been haunting a cemetery, and the owner is a psychic, so that's the only person who has any clue what's really going on. It is one of the best paranormal suspense novels I've read in quite a while, because it's a great blend of science and fiction. The story is told in first person point of view and there are several very spooky scenes, and some really beautiful, haunting prose. The narration is absolutely gorgeous, with a very realistic voice. It's not an overly dramatic narrator, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I also loved the fact that there are some scenes which are just plain creepy. So, it's really not like it's super scary or anything, but it has this really eerie feeling to it.The story is very well done and well told. I enjoyed reading the book, and I look forward to reading more from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I read this book in March and I have not read anything from her in a long time. However, I will say that this book has been around for a long while now and there are several reviews in the comments about the plot and characters, which are all true, but this was not my favorite book. My main problems with this book are: 1. The author writes like a teenager, or maybe like an 8 year old (or more) because it was hard to keep up with the characters and because I think she has a hard time writing a romance or not. 2. I do not get the point of the characters. They are all super cute and pretty, but I don't get them and the book doesn't really make any clear points as to why these characters are different. They just seem like random stereotypes, although it makes sense for them to be because the characters are so similar. For instance, there is one character who is a big meanie (or whatever) and he seems like a typical villain, but then later you find out that his name is Paul, which makes perfect sense, because Paul is a villain with no redeeming qualities. I would have liked to have been able to understand more about Paul's motivations and how he came to be the villain he is. 3. This is an extremely depressing story, not even a little bit. I was sad to read that the hero left the heroine because he was in love with another girl. I don.t think this is something the author was planning and she does not handle it well. There is a great deal of jealousy between the main heroine and a secondary one. I am not saying this is wrong, but it was just depressing to read. 4. It is hard to understand why she did not break up with Paul when she was in the same town as him. This should have been an easy decision. 5. Overall, it's a really disappointing book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________ ____ ___________________________________________________________________  An excellent book about a little-known group, the 'Outsiders', who have been around since the dawn of time.  The Outiders are the first groups of people to leave the Earth, the first survivors in the history of the universe. Their story, their existence, and their future, have been carefully covered up by the forces of the old order. 1. In order to survive on the planet, the Outsiders built many outposts which the humans called "colonies", even though the Outsider's colonies were far from the "colony", being in fact the same universe. The Outsiders are a secret society of "monstrous humanoids". This is a term that is used to describe a different race than the 'humanoid' races we know today. In the beginning they lived as a "people", living in a peaceful society. Then one day, their peaceful society was broken by a war between the "humans", and the "Outsider" race. A lot of things happen between these two races, such as the first humans living in caves, the second humans living on Earth, and the Outsiding humans. This book explores the life of the Outsiders, and how the war led them to develop a very special technology, the "Cave of Souls", which they use to communicate with their allies from a distance.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book before I started taking this course. It was a good read until the last few pages where I felt the author did not give a good enough description to what it really means to be a soldier. Not just any soldier, but the very brave soldiers who risk their lives and families for this country. They do so while doing their jobs and sometimes even when they can not.   That being said, this is a great book. The subject is interesting and the author is a good writer. The main character is very well done. If the character wasn't written well before this I think that the writer might have written better. That being said I still enjoyed this book and will be purchasing it for the series I'm reading, which is very different from this book.   of 1 magicians found this helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ * First of all, I must admit I'm not very impressed. The writing is mediocre at best. It takes several turns before the story kicks in, and even then it doesn't have much momentum. * What was originally supposed to be a fairly straightforward "history" novel that chronicles how a village that was destroyed in the First Punic War was rebuilt by the sons of the people who fled the city is quickly turned into a love story between a Roman soldier and the wife of the first soldier he encounters. It's not a bad romance, but the ending leaves you a bit unsatisfied. * The narrator also spends a fair bit of time describing how the characters feel about the people they've met along the way. He is never very convincing. * Even worse is the portrayal of the characters as being "dumb" and "uneducated." If a book is meant to show the lives of the Romans from the point of view of their lowest classes, I'm sure that would have been better written. I didn't mind, but even a casual reader who knows their history will be surprised by some of these things. _________________________________________________ "For all of its shortcomings, The Civil War offers an insight into the lives and experiences of ordinary people in ancient Rome.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________   "We can now say we can see a future of a world without war. And I believe that tomorrow's world will be a very different world than our own."   I was expecting something like this in this book, and it was a little more than I expected.   At times it seemed like there was some kind of post modern philosophy being used to justify the atrocities that are being committed, in this case the war on Iraq, by using an analogy of what is going on with some "evil dictators". But when you think about it, isn't this what the Nazis tried to do? It isn't as though Hitler is the only one using the "evil dictator" argument, by any means. And to that I say: if you are using an evil dictator to justify atrocities, then maybe that is what you are really doing, but I guess what Hitler had going for him was his being in a powerful position, which made him able to take whatever actions he wanted and not have to fear for his life.   (I don't even think the idea of war crimes applies in Iraq, it is not like the United States is a country that has never committed any war crimes. I think that this book was more geared towards the military industrial complex.)   In the end, the author does make a valid point. Maybe the Bush administration was right. Maybe there is nothing we can do. We cannot stop these horrible atrocities, and I don't know if the people that are running the United State are so stupid that they cannot see what is happening, but they sure are doing something that is not very good.   and to that, I say "fuck you", because I am not going to support that government and give them money. That is not what I believe in, I believe we should leave people alone, do what we can to support our friends and not give a shit about whether or not they want us there.   of course, that does not mean that Bush is always right, he has made some mistakes, but in the end I don the author's point.   to me, the problem is that we do not even know what is being done in Iraq. I was expecting this book to be more of a critique of the Bush regime, but it really turned into a very superficial critique.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This is what happens when you have a bunch of smart people with nothing better to do. ********   I've always loved stories about the dangers of trying to change someone's mindset. As I recall, this book is one of the first (in any language) to do a great job of describing that process.   The book starts by giving a brief history of what is meant by "attitudes" (of the kind that have long been a part of our culture). The author writes that attitudes are "a set of values we hold in the direction of which we aspire". Attitudes are what people think are right about you, and what they think you deserve. They are what we value about ourselves.  .   and that is just part of the story.    One of the things that makes this book interesting is the way the author explores attitudes and how they evolve over time, and the way that some attitudes are more likely than others to be transformed.        This story has lots of examples that make it clear that attitudes evolve from attitudes, not vice versa.  The reader will find that the attitudes he describes are actually not all that different from the ones he encountered in his own life, though he comes at them with a more skeptical, questioning, and cynical perspective.   That is not to say that attitudes don't change over time.  A lot of them do change.  But in my experience, a lot of these attitudes can get transformed when you think about them differently and use them in a more constructive manner.  I can say with certainty that if you start to change some of your attitudes, the world in which you live will shift to reflect that change.   And that is a wonderful thought.  And if you're interested in knowing how that transformation can happen, I recommend that you pick this book up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry for the low rating, but this book is garbage.  The character development was terrible.    Most of the story revolved around how the father was portrayed and there was no backstory or backstory of his past.  I didn't find the storyline of the main character convincing and his character was flat.  The other characters were bland and stereotypical.  I felt as though the author wasn't fully invested in the main characters because I felt like they were only given one personality trait that was portrayed badly and then they were tossed in to act as an antagonist and that's it.  It was awful and made me want to quit reading it as it felt like the author put all his energy into writing the story and then just threw the characters in and tried to make it "complex". My review:   4.5 stars It takes guts to write a book that is completely out of your comfort zone.  This story was an absolute mess and I'm not sure how the author did it.  The main character is one of the worst, I've read, but I've never read an author who wrote a story like this one.  He seemed very weak and his relationship with the father felt completely forced and did not feel authentic at all.  There was also a lot of racism in the book.  You have to wonder why a story about a white couple would have an actual black person as an enemy.  Another problem with the story was that it seemed to focus on one aspect of the father rather than all of the issues that led him to be so harsh on the son and his father.  Although the character development in this story was awful, I felt that the author attempted to write the story in a way that would make the readers interested in the story.  If you are looking for a good story and a well written book, don't read this one, it's definitely not worth your time.

I thought I was going crazy after I finished. I was just so impressed by the story. I also liked the fact that there were some parts of the story that I wasn't completely happy with. It was a little frustrating at times. If you enjoy horror and thriller I'd suggest giving this one a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   As a kid growing up in the 80's, I adored the movies and the music. As a teenager, I read an album cover by an artist who was one of the artists on the soundtrack of my favorite movies. When I started writing, my favorite writer was Robert Penn Warren and I loved his books.   While I loved this author's first book, "The Secret" I was a bit disappointed that I felt the second book was a "reboot" and didn't really take off with me like I thought it would.  , my only complaint about this book was I wanted more from it but it was hard for me to feel the "sense of connection" between the characters. I wanted to know more about each character and find out what made them tick. The book did end up getting dark at some point, but this dark scene just felt unnecessary and took away from the experience of the book.   and I was excited when I finished this book. I've been interested in paranormal romance for a while and have been following the genre for awhile now. This book blew me away and I can't wait to read the other books in the series.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- The worst book I've ever read. It is not funny, it's not interesting, it has no plot and just goes on and on. I hate reading non-fiction about anything at all. Why should I spend my time reading a non-story about the weather? I read a few articles about this book in the newspaper and I think they will give me an idea of the story. It's just as bad as the book written by the guy that does "The Art of War". I'm a pretty good judge of fiction and non-fictions. I thought this one was really bad. I'll be writing to a school for an Advanced Placement exam next semester and I'll see if they have this book. They may try to pass it, but I don't think I'll buy it. I was really disappointed. -------------------------- I am still waiting for the next installment of this trilogy. I think it's really boring and repetitive. I really wanted to like it. ------------ (reviewed 16 days after purchase)
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________   I have seen so many reviews about this book and what a lot of them do not understand is that while writing, I read what is coming out of his mouth, and I know the kind of person he is. This book was nothing but a thinly disguised rant by someone who has been on the other side of the fence before. He was a person who was bullied, I can say that without a doubt. He has a chip on his shoulder like a bulldog that is waiting for his next victim. But his "victim" has already been taken. If this book did not have such a bad cover I might have given it a higher rating. I could just see him with his gun in his hand and his girlfriend on the way to the police station. This is not a book you will want to read, but if you have a burning urge to hate someone, then I think you should definitely read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand why this book didn't make it onto my list.   In my opinion, it was the best book written by a child psychologist that I have read in years. She really understood kids, they loved her. She was a great teacher, and her book would have benefited from a new chapter or two written by the mother.  , I think this book could have been better, but I don't know why. I really think the book's not really about children but about adults who have been children and have been abused, who had a sense of guilt, and they need to feel good about themselves, but their feelings of guilt aren't going to get them anywhere. They need a professional to help them, and she didn't have enough help in the book for this, but she did have help for the parents in this book. I don`t think she had the right perspective. The parents in the story really didn`t need help. In fact, it seems that she thought it was a very good idea to help the parents with their guilt. She should have been more sympathetic to the kids, especially the kids in the early chapters, who didn`T need help because they were in the same boat, and if they`re the only ones that feel guilty and like they have something wrong with them and they don`T, then they will continue to suffer. The kids need someone to love them, they need their mothers and fathers to love their children, they don't need a therapist to help fix their problems. I think she could have used the kids more in the later chapters, because their problems are going to escalate and they won`t learn anything until they come out of their shells. But it is important for parents to have the therapist with them at all times, and I don�t think that the parents were doing that in this case. I liked how the children were brought in to the therapist so they could be helped. I didn`ts feel that her book was really about the kids. It felt more like a personal book about the therapist, and the parents had to be so miserable and so confused about what to do that they just went on and on about their problems, and their parents needed their help. I just don`td feel that the book was very good, but then again, I don´t have to read it to understand the story, and so I guess I am not so much reading this book as I am

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been trying to figure out why this book made me want to throw up. I thought that it would be fun to read, but it was not. The characters were uninteresting and the story was badly paced.   My daughter was more interested in the story and in the plot than in the characters. She loved the main character because she was such a "cool" character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was reading this book after taking some philosophy classes on campus.  I'm not sure why I was interested in it.  If you are interested in philosophy you probably won't enjoy this book.  The first half of the book is filled with a lot of useless "philosophy".  You can say that I'm a "stubborn" student who just doesn't like things that don't make sense to me.  But I don't like philosophy that doesn't make any sense either.  In the second half of this book, the authors say things that sound good and make some sound like good ideas.  Unfortunately, they end up saying some that sound even worse.  They don't seem to understand any of the topics discussed in the other parts of this books, and they spend most of the time saying things that are either irrelevant to or wrong about them.  There is also the constant "philistinism" in this book and the book seems to be written by a man who does not believe in it so it doesn't seem like it would be relevant to him.    I feel like the whole of the first half was filled with "philistine" things that didn't really make sense.  When you can't make a simple example or point of the problem, why are you bothering to argue about it with a "philander" if the problem isn't worth your time to discuss it with him.  This part of the study group was not a bad study group, but they couldn't make use of this material and it seems like they didn't care enough to do anything useful with it. I don a lot about this topic, but I never did a great job in my classes and this is definitely not a good source.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________ I don't usually read YA. But I just got this book and I couldn't put it down. It was fun, entertaining and even educational. I was impressed with the fact that the author was able to keep the main character and their story moving without any character development. I'm still learning as I go along. I do want to read more YA, but I can't put this one down. I've already got my next book in-hand and can't wait for the next book. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entertaining book with interesting characters. It will be a fun read!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************* This book just doesn't seem to work for me. It's written so badly that I just can't get into it. If I do, it's because I'm so engrossed in the story, and I'm not interested in the plot. There's little to no depth to the characters and the plot is really confusing, though it is at least engaging to read. I'll never be able to read it again.   I'm sorry to say that this was one of the worst books that I've ever read in my life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I hated this book. I felt like the author had no idea what a story is supposed to do. She didn't even tell the story. I was left with no sense of what happened or why, just that the man and the woman had been together for a long time, and that she had left him for another man. Not much of a story, and the ending left me a bit sad.   Overall: This is a very depressing book and is really hard to put down. I feel like the authors have tried to give a "true story" for the whole story about how the man had a child with a woman he loved who then ended up dead. I am sure the whole thing is very interesting and that it has made him very bitter, but I really can't say it gave me a sense of happiness. I had a hard time finishing this book, and am sure that my feelings were not shared by the other people in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________  The story is okay but the ending makes no sense  Overall, a good book, but not much more  ___________________________________________  This book is just about the main character going through a very painful experience, as a result, she falls into an extremely dark place. However, it is well written and has a very happy ending. It is about an abusive family and the character grows in her faith as a direct result of her experiences in her life. I was very affected by the events in this book as I found it to be quite heart wrenching. The story was pretty good though I felt that the ending was not very positive and that the main protagonist was in way over her head and had some serious flaws. Overall, I enjoyed the book, it was very well written, I liked that the author used a lot of psychological ideas and used them in a positive way.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________   I have enjoyed this book very much. I have read books that do not impress me, and that does not mean they are bad books. This one is good.   A short story.   I found it interesting. I really liked it. I could see myself reading this book. It was an interesting story. I found myself wanting to know more about this couple, and how they felt about each other.  's story takes off in a way that made me feel very excited, as the girl was a great read and the boy, well. He was a little strange.   It all came to a close with a little twist that would be interesting to hear more about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author wrote a good book, but it was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My book on this subject was purchased at a bargain price, I am so glad I went to the bookstore I would have never found anything like it in the library. It was the first and only time I ever purchased a book on a particular subject.   In it I found some good information and made the acquaintance of many knowledgeable people, but it's all too long for me.   Review was helpful to a friend:  A very informative, well-documented book on all aspects of UFOs.  It contains the research I've done for the past 6 years.  -B.

I highly recommend it for new and experienced writers alike.  and other helpful reviews
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. It wasn't that it was bad, it's just that my expectations weren't that high for the author. The writing was bad for two reasons. First, there was a lot of bad editing. The ending really wasn't the book I was hoping for, and that really disappointed me. The second problem was that the characters were just so flat. Not every one was a jerk, but most of the characters had some sort of flaw or flaw that I could point at and say, "Oh, that's what she's been dealing with." And it wasn't even really that the author needed to make up a character or change their character in the story to make them a more realistic person. You could easily write some realistic characters and still be a jerk as well. I felt like I could have done a lot better on a book that's supposed to be about a human being dealing with something hard to deal with.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I recently read this book. I got it from a friend of mine, who also got a copy from me for free, and I don't remember the first page or so. But it was very interesting. So I'm going to read it on my Kindle, since I just started it, in the morning on my laptop, and also at my office computer, since most of my work involves books. I'm really surprised that it isn't better in the audio version.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- --------------- I don't know who is responsible for this horrible book, but there is something wrong with this book from the start. I had some difficulty even reading this book. The story is told by an unnamed narrator who introduces us to a character in a very mysterious way. It was too much for me. He begins by showing us the character and the situation he is living in. But after this, he never shows us anything anymore. No description of character, background, actions, etc. Nothing. We are just shown his situation. And it is not the most interesting or gripping story because it never gives us anything to think about. I really don't get why this story is being told by this narrator. He is so bad that I would rather read this in a journal. And after I read this, I would also like to have a chat with my mother. And her story was not so bad either. I felt like I know her already! I understand everything now. I know what she is thinking and feeling. And I am sure she did her best. I'm surprised. She knows what she did and what she needs to do to avoid problems. I think we should make her our best friend. And we can read about how she managed to be so good in life and how much she has grown up. I don´t know why people write bad books. Sometimes people don't have any ideas about writing and just make it up in their head. If you have nothing better to do than read bad books then do it. I have read so much better ones, but they never made me interested in reading more. I would love to know what this person thought about it, what made him write this horrible story. This book was really bad. But it was a better experience for me than the worst of bad stories I have ever read.  Reviewed by: C A - Verified Purchaser  What more could you want from a horror novel? Well, not too much except for a creepy atmosphere. A few things about the story don't add to the creep factor. That isn't to say that they do not add to it but I find the author's description of the character too vague and off putting. It is a story about the man that is trapped in his room. It begins with him saying that he feels like he's on the verge of madness. The first thing that comes to his mind are the shadows that run across the walls and his thoughts on
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ I think I made the wrong choice. This is a good read, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has not read some version of this story before. It's got some flaws, but all in all it's a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a long time fan of the book series I was extremely excited to see the film, and for a few minutes after the opening credits, I was happy. However, the film is extremely dull and boring. I'm not sure what was going on with the producers and actors to create such bland material that fails to interest in the most basic of details.  The story is poorly conceived and uninteresting and the acting is even worse. I also don't understand why they didn't try to make the book storyline more complex and interesting, but to be fair, I only saw about the first 3 chapters. If you have read the books and have been excited about the film it's more than disappointing, but if you haven't, I guess you are free to ignore it.  ( March 24, 2009, 7:11 am )  I just watched it again. I did not like it! It wasn't what I had expected it to be.  and I had a hard time following what was happening  ( April 14, 2009. 9:22 pm )  be ready to read the rest of the reviews. you will be disappointed. .   Read the rest here:  "Spartan", a comic about war, heroism and sacrifice, is released to critical acclaim, but some of its fans aren't satisfied. In this interview with the movie's director, Michael Bay, the filmmaker reveals his regrets and some of the film's many flaws.  The director explains how the movie changed from a screenplay that would have been much better than what it ended up being, to the movie that became a box office hit. I loved this movie. It's just that I have a hard enough time following its plot and characters as well as those of most books. I think that a lot of people would be very satisfied with this film as it is, but I wouldn't call it perfect either. It is a little bit boring and the actors don't seem to be quite right in the performance. My review will go with a positive comment, since I was quite happy with the film. I had an easier time following the story of Spartacus than I did with the book, but for the same reasons.   Michael Bay is a great director and I would definitely like to see more of his films. He is so good at making action films and I've seen all of his previous ones. I wish there was more of the same, but there

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read this book for my husband. I got it for him as a present for his birthday. I read through the first chapter before I gave it to him because it was too confusing and not very interesting for me. I was a little disappointed that the book wasn't written like a normal book. I have to wonder if the author just started writing at a young age so she could write. The first thing that I noticed was that the characters had no names. They were called "Troy", "Travis", "Dwayne", "Nathan", "Joe" and "Maggie". They could be called whatever they wanted to be called. There is no "Mr." in the book at all. Even if I was reading a real book, I would have known that they were not named after a real person. My husband didn't think that the author was a real writer, because she was just starting out.  5 stars for story :  The first chapter is so short and it goes by quickly but it was interesting. I really enjoyed how the author kept the book short, just enough to keep the story interesting but not so short that I thought that the story was going to go on forever. If you are into paranormal or paranormal history you will love this book.   3.5 stars because I had to wait a long time to get it:    This is a hard book to read because you have to keep reading to understand everything that is happening and the author does a good job at keeping you interested, but it took a long long time and I was kind of upset that I had waited so long to get this book because I really wanted to start reading this book right away. I know it is the author's first book but I thought it was a bit strange that she could not have started writing right away because she wanted to give the book a real feel. I don't want to be like her, but there is a reason that people wait so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a let down. I was really excited to read it, but sadly it didn't live up to my hopes. As someone who has never read a book written by a child, I expected a lot from this story. This isn't a bad story, it's just not up to the usual standard of YA literature. The premise is fine, but the character writing really fell short. The main character seems very shallow and unoriginal. The author makes the protagonist so boring and I don't want to know how it gets better, but I will finish this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________I started reading this book very reluctantly. I have been meaning to read it for months but the reviews were not good. I was going to read the book for a class and I could have given this one away because the first chapter had me reading the first few pages of the book and I stopped for the day. I did not see this coming and I am surprised that this did not get five stars. This is a book about a man who is able to "read" his wife's mind. It sounds very simple but it is not. I found this book to be very interesting, but I was not impressed by the author's claim of "mind reading" for a first book. It is like reading a "magic trick" book and the first magic trick did not seem to work because the woman could not be hypnotized. It would seem that she was so used to mind reading that she did not believe that there was a trick to be played. I can say with certainty that mind reading is real and it is possible to read someone's mind with some effort. I do not believe in mind reading, but if you ask me if I have ever read a book that could really read my mind, then, yes, it is real. It takes a lot of mental effort to be able to read a person's mind, but you can try. I really have enjoyed this book and would recommend it if you are a science fiction/fantasy fan and if you want to read about the mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I found this book absolutely useless to anyone not already deeply entrenched in the religious system of her community. It's the same old story over and over again, but instead of an inspirational story about overcoming adversity, this is a series of diatribes by the author trying to convince us of her worldview. It is filled with ridiculous statements and claims like "our ancestors would have been ecstatic if they'd heard the sound of their voices," "we were created in God's image," and "God created man to serve himself" just to name a few. We're supposed to believe that these people (the ones she describes as "sheeple") would have gone mad if they heard their voices, and that we're supposed be shocked at their views if we don't agree with them? She tries to explain away the supposed evils of her belief system by explaining how the world and humans were created by God, but what she doesn't mention is that this claim was taken out of context (she says that her ancestors would be thrilled to have heard God's voice, but she conveniently forgets to mention that they had no concept of a creator in the first place), or that she tries to justify her claim with scripture. Her ideas are so far from being backed by evidence that I'm not sure whether she's just trying to pass herself off as a real Christian, or whether she really believes in this stuff. My only hope is that she was just playing on some "crazy" readers' sympathy in order to gain a little attention, but I'm afraid that she's going to lose all credibility if she doesn to continue this behavior. In the end, I felt more sympathy for her than for her religious friends. **********  47 of 69 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. It had everything I wanted from a book about vampires. It was well written, well written. But the book doesn't work well as a vampire story.   The main character in the story is a vampire who has been bitten. In this situation, she is an ordinary vampire who is not immortal. She needs human blood for her vampire powers to work. She spends her days as a human being. But at night, when she transforms into a vampire, she becomes a fully awakened vampire. It is possible to find human blood in a vampire's bite. There are also human vampire bites, in which the vampire is completely undead, and these can be cured by having human blood. However, it is difficult to heal them if the vampire has been infected with a virus that has turned her to undead. So she does need human blood to live. She doesn't want to do this, but the vampire hunters are relentless and relentless.  , and I am sure that is the point at which the book really began to unravel. The main character, her mother, is an old and wise vampire. Her mother never loses her human form for an extended period of time, and is very intelligent and powerful, but she still can't help the fact that she has been turned into a zombie vampire. She cannot get over this, and never will. It really makes no sense to the reader as to why this would happen to her. There must be some way that she can cure her human blood, but no, not even the vampires who have turned themselves into zombies have been able to figure it out.     A lot of the action takes place inside the vampire hunter's tent. There is a lot of talking and people are talking. There were a lot more plot holes in this book than usual, but there are also things that were interesting enough that I didn't mind. There was a really cool twist about the vampire girl in the book that I liked.   the last two thirds of the book are really awesome and it all came together in the end. I think the author did a great job of bringing the story to a close. I loved the last couple of chapters. This is definitely the book to read if you want a quick and easy vampire story that is fun and entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ I have been following the Goodreads recommendations for this book since the first review was posted a few years ago. I remember reading the review by a newbie (who was in a bad marriage), and thinking this book would be one of the best books I could get my hands on. It was good, but I would have to agree with that newbie who thought it was too slow and slow to follow. The first half is not that slow (although I do wish the author would stop going on about his time in college in New Hampshire, since he should really tell us about his experience there). But then his wife and I are in for a surprise. He gets in a car wreck, is brought to the hospital, but not before getting in a physical fight, and then being caught cheating on her! I don't think I need to say more. I know the author is being nice here about the accident, but it is not the best way to explain what happened. I don.t think this book could have been much better if the author had just stopped there.   I love to read, and love a good romance. This book was very good, and I think it would have been the perfect book for a Valentine's day or something. But it was not. It does have some good romance elements (it really has all those elements) but it was really just a lot of boring reading (for me, anyways).   It did not really bother me because I loved the author's style (not only that, he is a good writer). I really was disappointed in the writing though. It is just not very good. He uses too many passive voice and too much cliche dialogue for my taste. In my opinion, he should have tried to make the character seem like a real person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard this book a bunch of times, and it's all I've got to say about it:  Not bad. It's nothing I can't get from the internet.   It's easy to see how some of the other reviews may be biased toward this book because it has "the same ending". It does have a "happy ending", but a pretty miserable one.  This book is so poorly written that I doubt I'd remember any of the plot details if I ever read it again. The book is really a mess.  It begins with a very boring character introduction, which is followed by a really boring action scene.  The dialogue is bad.  I was so bored while reading this that I started typing it all out for the first time in a while.  While it may be a short story, it really could have been a really long book, because the writing was so bad. I really wish I could rate this book higher than 3 stars.  So many reviewers talk about how the characters' relationships were supposed to be different, but I didn't think so. I think it just goes to show that people are generally wrong about their relationships, and when they're wrong, people should just stop reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, at least for a start of her work, needs to be more professional. Not only do the characters talk like teenagers, but the author also says so in the book.  Also, I did not care for her story that much, I think she should have made the story more serious (as is her own style) and less of the teenagers story. 's story does not have the atmosphere of her other books' and I find it annoying to read.   And this book has a long story! I guess you can expect this, but still I found the beginning very boring. And the book is written as a book for children, so it is a bit hard for me to accept the story as the original author intended.    I would recommend the book for younger teens but I am not very interested in it myself, it has only one thing that I am looking for - more stories, so I am ready to read the others!

The plot is about a young man with magical powers who gets caught in the middle of a civil war between two countries. As I said in my review, I really liked the character of Kvothe and I'm glad that he was involved in the story and made it interesting.  , not surprisingly, was the worst book I read this year. It was really dull and uneventful.There are two endings to the book and I can only assume that one of them is the intended one.The story begins with a man named Kvoth. He has a dream of a forest on the other side of a river which he wants to explore, and he also wants to do something to help someone in that forest. The next morning he wakes up in the forest. It is the same place he woke up the night before and he is still alone. He gets his sword and the map and sets out in a boat. He is soon attacked by a group of people who want to kill him. He tries to use magic to help the people who are being attacked and he succeeds. The group of attackers attack Kvoht and kill some people. Kvithis does not know that he is the victim of this attack and he does not understand why this group is trying to kill and steal his land.The first part of the book is a very slow, tedious and boring journey. The story moves very slowly from the beginning of the story to the end. There are no
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book, but unfortunately my husband didn't, he didn't finish it.  He said it was boring and repetitive and just didn't feel right.  "The Way of Kings is not for everyone.    It's not about the battle of Gods and Men, it's about a man who goes on a mission, and he goes there in a very unique way.  His journey is one of humility, and it's one of great suffering.  It is about finding oneself, and accepting your destiny.  This story is about the journey and not the destination.  If you think you have what it takes,  please give it a try.  A great read.  "I know this review will annoy a lot of you.  I would say that this is one you should read. If you like great characters and deep worldbuilding, please go out and read it. " -G. R., September 2015
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ I found this book to be an interesting read and a very enjoyable read, but it is very dry and boring. For me, this is just another way of saying that I enjoyed the book, but I wasn't hooked.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This book was very confusing from start to finish. I didn't know where to go with it or what to think and couldn't really follow anything. I found it extremely difficult to keep track of what I was reading. I had to keep going back and forth from page to page to figure out what the book was about. This made it even more frustrating because the book kept going on and on and kept distracting me from the main plot that I wanted to follow. I am so sorry that I bought this book but it is definitely not worth the time and effort. I will try to read it again but this time I will do it the right way!***   This book is based off the original screenplay of the movie The Mummy. I don't remember the movie but I do remember the trailer. I believe it was the one that showed the movie inside a tomb with the mummy. It was also the one where Tom Cruise got shot in the face by a sword. I have watched the trailer many times. It seems to me that the movie had a lot of problems. It has a terrible script that was written by someone who was clearly not a professional. The characters were un-interesting and one-dimensional. I would have just read a normal book by a different author.   I have read many books about the Mummy in the past and I have always been bored by them. There are some good stories about him but he seems so over-the-top that I don�t care about the character at all. I read about him once and that book made me think that he was a really cool character. In this book I found him to be absolutely annoying. I was bored, and I could barely pay attention to the plot.  .  I wanted to like this book and it didn�t satisfy me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just read it. I read this in two sittings. I think I just finished it the first time because I thought I was in the middle of something. I finished it and thought "Oh, I can just pick this up again." But no, this was just a slog. It got worse as I read it again and more horrible things started happening. The only good thing was that I had a good laugh in the last paragraph (just as I was reading it and was thinking "I must have just read this because this is how the characters are presented here and how they interact with one another"). Also, some of the things that were said were kind of funny at times (in some cases I would like them to be said, but would prefer that it not be in the form of a poem that is not going to be a lot of fun to read). There were just many of the parts that were too difficult for me to sit still and read. As for the story, I felt like it was a lot about the "little guy" and "the little woman." There was this one character that was always "little" and that was just horrible. I don't know what to make of her at this point. And there are other characters who are portrayed as not being that great, but their stories are kind of told through their interactions with "the big man". There were some really terrible chapters (I have no idea what they are. They just started happening in the second half of the book), and the ending was kind of a let down. The first half was really bad but the second one was really weak. It just didn't seem like the author cared at all. The Good: -The beginning was very strong -I really liked the way the author explained what was happening and made the characters sound human (even when they were not) -I thought the ending made sense. It ended so well but kind of left me feeling kinda bummed out that it was over. -If you're looking for a book with a lot to say, with a really hard hitting novel, then I would recommend this book. If you want to read a novel about an abusive relationship that goes on for more than a thousand pages (at least for me), then you'll probably want to stick to something else. It has it's good points, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for something a little more light-hearted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a first time reader and bookworm I was very happy with the book. It was easy to understand. There was one thing I noticed that I would have liked to have seen a little more of. If there was a character in the book that had some kind of power over another character that character should have been more involved in the story and I would like to see what happens to her.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   What do you think?   2 - "I have always been a big fan of the series, but I have to say, this is really bad. Not because it's bad, I love everything about this book, I just hate the plot. It's boring, it's predictable, it gets boring, and it's over way too fast.   The plot revolves around a group of five "gals" who all hate each other and want to destroy each other.   the plot is so predictable that I don't even need to know what happened next, it was written in a very cliche way. I mean, the girl with the bad attitude, the girls that are jealous, the crazy girl that loves to fight, and the "tomboy" girl who is so innocent. All these characters are so likeable and yet they all hate the other. So the problem with this book is that the author makes every character likeable, but then they all all hate their enemies.   of course I was not a fan of any of these girls, all of them are stupid and I just want them to be in the bathroom. In all honesty, I was annoyed, because I could not connect with any of them at all. Even when they were arguing and arguing over who they wanted to be, or who had the best costume. Not to mention that the female characters in this book have all been in a bathhouse before, so I guess that means they were all hot right?  . It was a shame that this book ended so fast, because it should have been a really long series.   1 - "The only reason I will read another book in this series is to see the "girls" again."
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This is a sad waste of time and money. It is a book that contains all the information on the internet except for some things that should be known for the people that are using the internet to get their own information. This book is a joke. If I was going to waste my time and my money to get this information I would have paid for it myself. I spent about 25 hours looking up this stuff in the internet. The author does not know what they are talking about. What you get is what you pay for.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- Please try and use the same standard you use in your reviews of other books. This is not a "perfect" book. It's just a really bad one. For that I give it 2 stars, but then I consider it a 1 star book for those who are looking for a good book on the subject. The only thing I would change about this book was that he mentions that he's trying to use "real" medical sources rather than just "fictional" ones, which I think would make this book more accurate. However, for this book, he used the fictional sources for both the medical side and the paranormal. This does not make the book more realistic, it just makes it more entertaining. If you are looking to learn more about the paranormal, this is not the book you are going to find, but if you are more interested in medical issues then you'll find this book pretty entertaining. It takes a long time to read, and it does have some heavy medical issues, but I think that if you read it in a month or two, it will be over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I wanted to enjoy this book but ended up with a headache and an upset stomach, my brain just wasn't "tuned" enough for this book to flow.   This book is a mess. I understand why they did this in book three, and the third act was much better than book 2. It was fun and exciting and I thought it was really good.   the last 20 minutes of the book are a mess too, and really not interesting at all, the last third of the story is just the beginning of an "ending" with the death of the main character.  , the characters are great but you have to keep going with the book and understand what they're trying to do. The best part of this book was the ending. It felt so rushed and it didn't add anything to the story and didn't move the story forward. The second and third act are a huge let down for me, as well.  There is so much more I could say about this book, but I think that enough has been said that I can give a decent review on this book. I recommend you stop reading now and get some coffee.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The writing was dreadful. There was not even one proper paragraph to follow. The whole book is nothing but a series of descriptions and descriptions. This book is just pure filler and doesn't really get anywhere. The main character is just a "moo" like creature. He just makes things up and tries to "convince" the main character that he needs to do his bidding. It was very obvious this book was made as a quick money maker. The author just wanted to get the book into the hands of as many people as possible.!!!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was pretty good until about the last few pages where the author started to reveal some disturbing information about her past. Then, it really became a train wreck.  For one, her father committed suicide when she was a teenager.   Then, as a teenager, she went through the motions of marriage, raising a family, and eventually became pregnant.  This was a huge problem for her because, as she writes in the last chapter, "In many ways I felt trapped, trapped with my life.  I was pregnant. I had a son.  It was hard for me to see how little time I had left."  In the final chapter, she writes, "This was the time for me, when I could finally give a voice to the women who had not always been heard, the mothers who were in search of the truth, the ones who had lived in shame, those who had lost their sons in combat and those who'd lost their husbands in the process of divorcing them."   In the last couple pages of the book, she describes the aftermath of her pregnancy, and it was heartbreaking.  There were some parts I thought were extremely over the top (her own parents, for example) but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.   I think that her feelings are genuine.  Maybe she was just making some stuff up.  She admits that, at one point in her life, she was "very good at reading" so her memory might be unreliable.  But I found that I didn't buy her story about her father being killed until the last page.  Also, as I was reading I wondered if this would happen to the other women in her story.  What if their families didn't believe them?  What about the women in the book who were raped or who experienced some form of sexual abuse?  Her writing about her "stuck up" family members felt very much like revenge against them.  The truth of this woman's story is that she was always looking for a way out.  Her husband didn't get along with her father, and she decided to go to the police and complain, only to be dismissed for lack of evidence.  When she finally did file a report, she found out that she wouldn't get a fair trial.  In that regard, I think the book really speaks to people with difficult relationships with their fathers.   The best part of this book is its ending
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very interesting book. The first few pages were so interesting, so thought provoking, I wanted to go on a trip back in time to see the world that I had read about. The story was exciting. I really had to wait a couple of weeks to get the book because it was just that much of a great story. This book is really worth the money. The book really is just wonderful and exciting.   I do have to disagree with a couple things in the book. There was no way I was going to read a book about a girl in the 19th century that talks about "shifting genders" while she was being trained in the martial arts. I think it is extremely rude of people to assume that a woman could not or would not have thought about how a man is a man and a woman is a woman. I also do not understand why it is wrong to say "men can be just as bad in bed as women". There are some things about sex that just don't change and the male/female relationship is no exception. I just can not understand how people can think this way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has so many problems it's hard to find the good ones to speak of, and the main one is that you don't even know where it's going.  The whole first half of the book is about a kid who goes to a mysterious town called "Amerian" and when he gets there, he meets a guy with a very specific task.  When you're not reading about that, your only clue to where it is going is from the book.  This book, in my opinion, is a bad attempt to be a mystery.  It is very predictable and you can see what will happen at every step.  The second half of this book is much better and I would give it a higher rating but it just ends and you have to start another book, so it has a very bad end to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book sucked.  I got it to read for my husband and it's just really a lousy book.  The narrator has nothing but a really low voice and is totally devoid of personality.    It just makes you want to turn the book off because it doesn't add anything to your life.  But, I bought it because I was curious, and I'm glad I did.  (I can now see why the narrator didn't give me a negative opinion.  )   The other reviews on here are all wrong.  This book is great.  I love the idea.  It's a great way to explore some things you've been wanting to do.  You know, just a little bit more of what you already know.    I was curious about what it would be like to have an adult that loves animals as much as you.  When I found out you were an animal trainer, I was eager to read the book.   When you told me this was a love story, I thought I was crazy.  And when you told my husband I was an animal handler.  Then we all wanted to know how you were going to teach him.  I loved this book. You know when you read something that you really like, you read the entire thing.  Because I'm always reading something else.  Once I read a really bad book. I really just couldn't stop.  There was just something about it that really really interested me.  Even when I finished reading it, I could not wait to start a new book. So I did, and it was wonderful.  Now I know what it's like. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ Book is a poor representation of my experience. It is a very dry and boring read. I could not enjoy reading it for the first part. It gets better but there is nothing to enjoy until the final pages. At that point I'm left thinking, wow that's good. Then I start to get annoyed, then frustrated. Overall I don't recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ My book came from the United States of America and had many problems. ~~ This book is very sad and very sad for many reasons.  The book's story has many problems,  from spelling errors to very strange names to the writing style which is rather slow and stiff.    My only complaint is that this story,   which is supposed to have been taken from the real life life,  is very confusing and has many different endings.  This book was so confusing that I couldn't figure out how the story came to be the way it did.   My only consolation in all this is that I'm still glad that I read the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********I was expecting this to be a great read but to be very wrong. The only thing I had the patience for was when the villain would say "We're not here to hurt you." I thought this was pretty funny and actually a bit shocking, especially when he was saying that. This book is about a group of terrorists (one being one of my favorite characters) who make use of a technology they've created to be able to control any body with a nanite implant. They are basically evil and sadistic but not like the real ones who torture, torture and then torture some more. I don't want to go into the details of how they were able to do this as I think most people have read all about it. The fact that they were even able to have such amazing control over someone they weren't even sure was human made this a very sick and twisted story. But when they start to use the technology to hurt people they have to go after the main character who happens to be her boyfriend. They don't really need to use it to hurt her because of her intelligence but for the main characters it's very effective. The whole thing is written so fast that there is very little thought put into it. I think it was written in such a way that it was easy to keep up with and had no consequences or consequence to the character's actions. The ending was a little too far, I think the author realized that the ending of the first book was very good and the ending was just more of the same.I liked the world and the way they told the story, I liked the character I got to know well but overall, this was a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   The characters are so boring that I had to skip at least half the books in this series. Even with their name I couldn't identify with any of them. The main character was a little too evil for me. I hate it when people don't do the right thing and take action that they know will get them out of trouble but don't. They say it's not always for the best but he was just going to steal from people. The fact that he stole from people in the middle of a war was just stupid. The other main character seemed like she should have been a little less selfish. She was so willing to give money to people that didn't deserve it. That just made her even more evil. The only reason she had any power to be in a position like that was because of the fact that she is a princess. Her dad wanted to take her as a hostage. But that wasn't his fault because the people were against him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will give the book a 1 for the writing and 1 for being a fun read. It is quite boring and not worth the time invested.   It's an excellent story and it should be.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------  I was not going to like this book, so I read it at a very leisurely pace while doing other things. Then I picked up the book again, decided it was terrible, and threw it away.   A really bad book.   The plot starts off on an uninteresting note, when a teenage girl is killed by a boy and it is revealed that he was having sex with her. When the police find out about this, they believe the boy to be guilty. After a few chapters, they are not sure, as they think the boy has an alibi that the girl's murderer could have fabricated to protect himself, and there's nothing conclusive, no eyewitnesses, no DNA. When they do learn a little bit about who the boy is, they find that he has never even had sexual intercourse with the dead girl, so that makes it harder to nail him down as the boy's murderer. As the police and the family dig deeper, they have a hard time deciding what to do about it.   a few other points:   1. I really do not understand the use of the term "incest". This makes absolutely no sense. The only incest they have seen was an instance in which the mother and the son were separated. They know there is no incest in the story. This is not a case of the mother's having sex, and the mother not having sex. That is incest, because of the child being a member of the incestuous group. In their logic, incest is any sexual intercourse. In the world of this book and this character, incest does not mean sex, but simply touching.  ,  2. The word "abusive" is used about 1/3rd of the way through the book. When I read "abuse" in my high school, I was being called names, I couldn't go anywhere, I had nightmares. This does not come anywhere close to resembling that, not even close. I don't understand how people would actually use that as a synonym for being abusive.  The author goes on and on about "intimate abuse", but this doesn't even come close to matching that. She says some of the abusers are abusive by choice, as if it's a choice, rather than an involuntary act. That's kind of scary. I think she says a couple times that it was "totally out of character" for her, but this is still the same kind of person who

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I didn't like this one. My husband didn't either. It was a little hard to read, and he had a hard time following the plot. The writing style didn't come to the surface until the end. My favorite character is still one of the characters I didn the most, and that was the boy that came to town and his mother. I also liked the little girl who had a secret of her own, but I didn´t care for the other characters that came into play. If you want to try this one, don´t worry about the book, just buy it. Don´t let the bad review discourage you. I think it was a very entertaining book, although not really my taste.   My rating: 3 stars

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I just finished a wonderful book about a child who will be one of my favorite characters in any book I read. It was such a beautiful and heart warming story. What made this book so wonderful was the quality of the writing and the author's ability to capture the heart and soul of this child with such ease. It seems to me that no matter how young the child is or how difficult the situation may be, every child needs this kind of comfort and inspiration in their lives. I hope this book will always be with my children and my grandchildren. The only regret I have about this book is the child I was reading about never had the opportunity to meet the author. He is now very old and I hope the author can come see me now and give my child a gift like the author did. I will be reading books and watching movies to remind myself of the beauty of children and the importance of being a good father to them. I highly recommend this book to any parent that reads it, no matter what your child's age.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I have to be honest, this is by far the worst book I have ever read. I did not enjoy it one bit. It was very difficult to read and very boring. The characters are very shallow and I can't see any purpose of their life. The only things that were interesting were the descriptions of how they spend their time, which is very descriptive and the setting. It is all very boring, no plot or depth. The way the book is written is horrible. It feels like the author was trying to be funny but he just lost himself. This is not a fun read to say the least. It makes me sad that it is just that bad. It did not make me want to end the book, but it made me realize that it was way too slow. This book is not for the faint of heart. You will want to put it down after your first chapter. I hope the author goes on to other books, but that would be sad.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a sad book. I hate that it was written to be the definitive account of an extremely important event in human history. There is nothing about this event that is particularly good about the account. Nothing makes me believe that anything good has come out of the events of WW II. For example, how could a country that is so powerful, so well armed and so rich be so bad when so many others in the world were so much better off than they were? It just doesn't make any sense.   I think that if this was the first book written by someone about WW II it would have been very good. The author is a good writer, he has an interesting point of view and his arguments are sound. He is able to explain the events in a way that even a layperson can understand. However, I don't see how anyone can take anything he says seriously.   the main problem with the book is that it is written as though the reader was there at that time. For that reason, I didn't feel that I was learning anything new about the time. I was just filling in the holes in the history I knew. I found this book to be boring to read. The only person I really thought the book was written by was the author. That was probably a good thing, but the book did make it clear that the author was writing an account of the story told by other people who had actually lived through the events that were described in the book. If I had to describe the book to a child I think I would say "There is nothing good about WW2."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an utter waste of time. Not only is there absolutely no depth of any kind, the entire narrative is based upon the plot to steal the soul of the author from a dying man. There is absolutely no thought put into how this can be accomplished in any way other than the author's own imagination. I felt more than a little sorry for the dying man who was in need of the book but now feels a little like a patsy. There are no twists or turns in the plot, only a linear progression from the first person point of view. The author claims she is telling a ghost story, but there is little of this.   There were a couple of things that I liked, however. The first is that the author actually gets in some real character work. She is not just a one note ghost/whistle blower. The characters are more like real people who have been through the same things. This makes the book more realistic and the author doesn't resort to "just making it happen" like most ghost stories do.   of course, since I have no idea what happened, I will just assume that the ghost was a bad person. But I would like to know, what exactly caused the man's death and why didn't the ghost try to stop it? I would not have thought that such a thing could be possible. Of course the whole thing is very odd. A man dies, a man hears a ghostly voice, and then it is revealed that the man was murdered. If I didn't know anything about ghost stories, I would have called this a "weird" book. It is really very odd, and the whole plot is rather pointless. There were other things that didn't do the book any favors, but I didn the same. This book is a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are trying to find out about a historical event in the past, you could do a much better job finding the truth than with this book.  It is just too long and very confusing.  What I have to say:  I found this to be the most difficult book I have ever had to read.   It seemed to be trying to tell two completely different stories.  For the first couple of pages, it was very difficult to find a way to tell the story.  The second half was very easy to follow, but it just became confusing. The reason why I am giving this book 3 stars is because it is not a bad, but is just not a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this is a very bad book, and I think the authors made a huge mistake in thinking that it is a fun story. This story is the worst I have read in a very long time, and there is a reason why this book has such poor ratings on goodreads: this book is a mess, and if you are even remotely interested in psychology you should be extremely insulted that you read this. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone, and you should NOT read it. - A reader from Canada
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this to start a library and thought I would be good at it, but have to say I am not! It is very difficult and not the most fun for me to read. There were also many grammar and spelling mistakes that I did not notice until it was too late. It has been one year, so a little over a year for me. It is hard to read when I know I don't have to, but still. I am sad to have wasted my time, and money!Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hated this book. The only thing I found interesting was how she was able to make us believe that a couple could make it work by changing the men. I mean she literally told us how they had a "humblebrag" and how they were "chosen." I found it so boring and boring. The way she was writing about the marriage and about how it wasn't working made me mad. She talked about how their marriage was bad from the beginning and that they couldn't see each other for two weeks. That just made me really mad because I don't think they couldn' have been that distant from each other that long. Also when the husband left the wife said how happy she was when the man left. This was ridiculous. I am sure that most marriages are really hard and I wouldn't blame the wife for thinking so. The wife was pretty stupid for doing that and that just made it worse. Overall this book is pretty boring and not at all interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************* I bought this book because I was looking for some positive reviews of people who have been on the road for a long period of time and are looking for the right books to read. I am so very disappointed in this book. I have to confess that I am an audiophile. I bought my first audiobook for this book, and I liked it very much. I was excited to read the book, however I had to give the second one a miss. The narrator was not right for the book at all. She seemed off-key, and the book itself seemed more like a story to her than something that was intended to be read by someone who knows all of the details. She had the "voice" of an elementary school teacher. I could not imagine a more inappropriate or inaccurate person to read such a story. If you are looking to learn about a road trip with people who are living on the roads for a good portion of their life, then I suppose this book might be suitable. If anyone who does not have a high tolerance for bad narration, and want to hear that voice, I would suggest reading this book in the car instead of sitting and listening in the living room.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ "The only good thing about this book is that I'm not alone in this feeling." - K-F, December 12, 2015"The story is soooo...soooo... soooooo... soooo...." - a bad reviewer on bookloverswh.com, March 26, 2016 "I was disappointed." - R, July 23, 2016"This story has no real twists or surprises. The characters are so stereotypical and predictable and the plot is so predictable." - M, November 28, 2016  More  Page 37 The book is so much better if you read it as a standalone. If you read the entire book you will come to the conclusion that you should have just read that one book. It has no flaws so I guess if I wanted to find flaws it would be hard to find them. This book is about a man, a good guy, who is given a choice and the choice is to kill his girlfriend because he's scared and he wants to move on. He chooses not to kill her because that's not in his heart. I'm sorry but you have to understand something. The only way I could believe a good person could kill a good friend, who was a close family member, is if that person is a monster, and that the person they are killing isn't the monster but they are the monster. That's the only way to me. That it's ok to kill good people because you don't want to be responsible for someone else's life...well then that is a choice you could make...or that's what my interpretation is and I don't accept anyone else's interpretation. The rest of the book is just an excuse for that guy to get his revenge on his girl and his family...and that's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book as a gift and it is a great book for someone like me who is really new to meditation. It was a real eye opener for me. My husband is not really interested in meditating and I did not want to read his book that said he does. I do not have the time and energy to read through many books like this so I was very glad that I gave this book to him. I got through this book in a couple of days and then I went and read the book. I'm giving this book 3 stars instead of 5 because it was a little difficult for me to listen to. I think it was because it's not my usual thing to read or watch videos for the same reason. The only thing I can't stand is the amount of time it takes to reach your "peak" in meditation. That being said, the book was so enlightening that I highly recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited for this book. I had a long, hard fight with myself to get over my prejudice against "romance" fiction that I didn't want to read about characters who were the same age as me. It was a very hard book to read, especially because the main character was a middle-aged woman who was trying to change herself through therapy, who also has her own problems with her mother. It's hard to imagine that a book that was so good could make me hate it. It didn't make me dislike it but I didn  It's amazing how much one person can make another person believe something. If I knew someone who was a lesbian, I would have thought the same thing. I was really looking forward to reading this book because I've been very interested in learning more about it and was very excited about having something to do with it.   I'm glad I tried it, because it has lots of great information in it and there was a moment I was almost tempted to take the book in hand and study it before writing my review. I thought of this book on reading a quote by Paul Celan, who said, "I read about it in a newspaper and thought, 'that's really interesting; I don't know if it's possible, but I'll be interested.'"   So, I was very interested. I tried hard to not be judgmental. I would say I tried to be open to the book and think of it from an intellectual point of view, but in terms of the way I approached it, I didn 't want to be too critical. When the book was over and I was just sitting back, I felt like I hadn't really read it. What I found was a really interesting book that I'd be interested to read again, and I don 't think I would write anything negative about it because I have read lots of the other stuff written by this guy, who is known as "The Master" (in my opinion, it's one of the better books on sexuality in any genre of literature.)   The book, like all of Celan's books, was hard to read. It seems so hard because it is. There are chapters that I was stuck on and couldn't put down. The book is divided into three parts: (1) Celan on homosexuality; (2) Celen's family, and his father's sexual infidelity; and (3) Cel and his
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________ I just finished reading this book by a guy named John Scalzi about a new religion, but not the one you might be thinking of. The religion that Scalzi describes in this book is called "The Culture," and it's based on the idea that humans are a collection of biological machines. The Culture's leaders claim to have found a "universal truth," but in order to make it stick, people must submit to its rules and follow its commandments. Those who don't obey must be "reprimanded," and that can take many forms. The most common form of punishment is called a "baptism." The Culture teaches that everyone who doesn't adhere to the rules must be given a "reset." And what does this mean exactly? Apparently, it's a sort of resetting, but more brutal than a reset. Instead of going through a normal reset, the person in question is punished by being "burned" for all eternity in a "hot-pink ball of flames." In other words, everyone who is burned must endure the pain of being burned for eternity. This is a particularly cruel form of torture, because it seems to make no difference what the person was doing before the reset. It doesn't matter if they're a drug addict. They don't get a reset, because they are the wrong kind of addict. In fact, it seems as though the more drugs the person does, the more severe the punishment is. Everyone who takes drugs is in the "wrong" kind of drug addict; that's the point of the Culture. And if you try to escape the Culture, you must be burned again! There's a second form of "punishment" that the Culture uses, but it's even worse. The punishment that the person is "burnd," or "killed," is even worse than the "burn" itself. The "kill" is that the "reset" is administered in a way that actually "kill[s] the offender." For a time, this kind of punishment has a ritual purpose. But after a while, people who do not keep the Culture's rules are simply killed off, like the rats in a lab. This sounds like something from the future, but Scalzi makes it sound like something out of the present. The culture he describes is basically a totalitarian dictatorship. In his book, Scalzi writes: "The end of the book is the worst. It ends with a scene

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I had been wanting this for a very long time. Finally got around to picking it up and I couldn't wait to get it. It was great. A little slow and a bit dry at times but otherwise a great read. I also enjoyed reading the story of how the characters came to be who they were.   The story is pretty much about a group of friends who meet one night at the college where they are studying and get into a fight. Things escalate and things do not go well between the four of them.   It's pretty funny and has a nice ending. It would be good for a young teen who likes fantasy/sci-fi and a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was a newbie, just a few days out of college. As soon as I finished reading it, I was so angry at myself for not reading this sooner. There are so many inconsistencies with the plot that I was baffled.   1. The author describes an entire city as a prison. The entire town is just an empty husk where people live in fear of one man: an American named Charles Deaver who has been roaming around the world for decades, collecting the hearts of innocent women. You could easily describe this town as a giant dungeon with no guards or exits.   on page 27, he talks about the women he has been taking to the United States, and he mentions that the women are like "gift-wrapped gifts that you are unable to give up" because they cannot let go of them, which is completely opposite to his actions at the end of the book.  , and the women can't be trusted to keep their hearts after Deaver has done what he's done to them. This is a major plot point, and it is never fully explained or explained very poorly.  :   2. There is another major plot twist that is totally unrelated to any of the other plot points in the book, which I will explain later.  ....   3. The ending is utterly nonsensical.   be aware: this book was written over the span of three years, which seems really long to me, but it was only four-to-five pages.   the book ends with Deaver's death. This was absolutely ridiculous. Why does he need to die? Is this really the worst ending in the world? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1 ) This book would be even better if it was written in english instead of german.   I found the book very confusing, and there were many typos, and lots of bad grammer in the book. I had to read through the entire book to figure out what happened. This book has the word "kompromat" in it. The author also has a personal problem with that word, and does not have the knowledge to write a realistic story.  3 )   4 )   5) I was very disappointed that the authors was not a "professional" translator. I think they translated from German to English too fast, and they had to go with their gut to figure things out.  7 )  Overall Rating 4 out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I thought I would give this book a good try because it was recommended to me from a friend and I have to say, it was not at all what I expected, it is not a fun book at all and it was kind of weird. I guess there were some things in it that I liked but most of the things I didn't really understand, maybe I am just a weird person. At one point, the narrator (who I don't think is female but rather a guy) said, "We were on the way to the top of the mountain where we were going to have sex." and I did say I don' know if that is a sexual thing. The narrator described a pretty standard love scene between two people in a pretty clichéd way. I would have thought that would have been a good book for young people, not some silly romantic comedy about sex and relationships. Also the main character, Jana is described as very thin, kind of like the description of a lot of skinny models or something, and you can tell that she does not have any type of muscle mass, I thought that was kind off as well. I do not know about skinny models but I would not describe her like that. She also talked about her boyfriend's breasts at one point and then later said that they were "not big" or something along those lines. Then, she said her boyfriend "would always wear a bra" and that is something that really surprised me because I don`t think he would ever wear a bustier or anything like that, especially not with her. So there is some things that were just not as clear as I thought they would be. I was also really disappointed when I found out that she did not graduate from high school. She would have graduated in 4th grade!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book on my book list, and when it arrived I couldn't wait to read it. I read the first page, and I am now a bit depressed that I will never read this book.  This book is about an evil entity who will destroy and eat a good tree in the woods and it is up to a young boy and his dog to get it back.  I hated this book, it was so horrible.  It felt so out of place in the fantasy genre. I would not recommend this book at all, it is so bad I would feel like I was reading about a different species.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am really surprised by this book, i read it in the UK, this book is very different to most other books i have read, it is well written and it does have its own style, the main character has his own problems with his mother, i was expecting a love story but it seems to be more about a family/children relationship.   The story is about the love/hate relationship between the main characters, the two are very different people, the daughter was born with a disability and he wants to raise her like any other little girl, she does things just like any normal little girl. the son is a bit of a wimp, and has problems with authority, it seems that he is a loner.  :The main character is very good, the only thing i am not sure about is, there is no way that he would be with his son, but then again, he is very bad at being around people, so maybe he will do the right thing when the time comes.   in short: it was a very interesting read, but i was not really impressed, i do not think that this would be a good read for a general audience

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's kind of a sad story when I came home from work one day, read the synopsis and immediately started to tear up. I mean, I didn't hate it. The story was just a bit off, I know, but the story wasn't that bad.  The problem was that it made me angry and I found myself feeling a little bad for my poor, poor daughter, especially when it's obvious she's in no way responsible for the awful things that are happening in her life.  The good:   A nice mix of both action and drama; both well done; the characters are well drawn;   The romance is enjoyable, and both the author and the heroine are very well-written.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I'm giving this book a "B" because it is the sequel to my second favorite book, The Unfortunate Events. The Unluckies took place over four short stories, but The Fated was the first story to appear in the original books. I enjoyed the book, but found it a little too short and the characters lacked the depth and complexity that I hoped for. The Faced was a decent story, and it was interesting to learn that the characters had been playing around with the fate of people since childhood. The problem was that, while I liked the characters, their interaction with the other people in the town were too little too late and didn't add much to the story or the plot. I wouldn't read the book again (probably because I didn't find anything new), but it was still a nice quick read. The other characters were fun to read about, and the story was a fun ride, especially when the plot was somewhat well thought out. But that's all. 5 stars for the book overall, but it just wasn't enough to make this book worth the time to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* ********** I will give this book three stars, but I feel like I can give it an "I can see myself giving this to a friend" rating. I love this book. I do so love it. However, I don't love the characters. They are all so annoying and I'm constantly annoyed with them. The worst is that I can't decide if they are a cute girl, a dorky man, or some crazy person. They all are annoying. And the worst is when they act all happy about what they are doing. What a horrible way to act! I know there is more to these characters, but they were not my favorites.   I did find it quite interesting that one of the people in this book was a girl. I like books with girl characters because I feel I get to see that people can be different and have different sides to them. However the guy I liked the best was the only character I disliked. The man who was the author's daughter! I think the girl's were better though because there was more personality to them and the author was writing about a girl with a strong personality. I also liked the whole theme about a small village being attacked by someone and the boy saving the village. I felt like I was the hero for getting everyone out of danger, but the real hero is the village leader, who had been in the village since the first day the village was founded. I hope she is well respected when she gets older.   a woman with an amazing heart and a strong will to live. There is a lot of sadness in her past and I feel her strength was tested in this.   The narrator was wonderful. She wrote the voice of the narrator in my head in a way that was realistic. I loved that she felt this was a woman's book and wrote about a woman being in her mid 20s.   (I also loved that this book had a short story about the boy who saved the village as well!)   One more thing I wanted to say is that it's not a bad story. It was a very emotional and I will probably cry in my next bed. There were a lot more scenes than what I read, but still worth the reading. I feel very strongly that this story will be passed down to a younger girl as well and I can imagine myself reading it when she is older and reading it to her.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the ebook from the publisher when they first announced it was going to be published and then I got the hard copy. It's the opposite of what I was expecting, as the ebook is almost perfect, but the book itself isn't. The characters aren't fully developed, it's just about the story and not about anything they say or do. It ends with a cliffhanger which is very annoying, and the main character doesn't seem to learn anything from this. I think the main problem is that it's a young adult story, but it's not a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________ What a disappointing book! The first chapter has the promise to be a good story, yet the book suffers from a lack of tension. _______________________________________ The author writes of the horrors and suffering that came to her as a child. She writes about her experiences being raped as a boy, and being molested. The story opens with a character telling her that God didn't create Adam or Eve. A woman tells her that he created her. She has no concept of being born or being made. I could only take her word for it, but I found it difficult to accept that this woman is going to be the mother of a God. The man's brother tells her not to worry, that she'll be alright. This poor girl is brought into the world without any understanding of the nature of the creature that she is going into. The woman does not understand the meaning of being human. She says that God made her out of dust, and that she will grow and develop with all of the others. She also claims that she was created by the man, and therefore he must be a man. She is made to be very gentle and kind, to make people feel good and to make friends. She tries to teach her baby brother everything he needs to know, but the boy just won't listen, not even to her mother. She finds it difficult not to think about the things she will never be able to do, because God wouldn't let her. But she is not allowed to talk about it. I feel that the author is trying to sell her book with the idea that everyone will accept it because everyone has a story that has not been told. In the end, it is an emotional book that leaves you cold.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really do not understand why a book like this was published. It really is nothing but a story of a man who tries to do good things and has to come to terms with the fact that they do not always go his way. It's interesting to note that one of the things that makes the book so interesting is that it's not about the guy, but about the author's character. You feel a little more empathy for him and not the story. However, the story never really goes anywhere. A very frustrating, poorly written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book had all the elements I was looking for in a book. The characters were real, I knew what they were going through and how the situation affected them. The story was good, moving, and had a good feel to it. Unfortunately, it ended in a way that didn't work. The ending was rushed and didn't really make sense to me. I think the story would have been better off as a short story. I would recommend this book if you have kids that love reading books. It doesn't have a very serious story line, but I think it would have worked.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ This book is a pile of dog shit! What a joke! This book was poorly edited and just made fun of people. The author made fun out of people that are in real life. And what makes the best is the author is the motherfucker that is actually writing this stuff. ______________ I have only read two reviews and it is like 4:20 hours later that I finally read this. So, there is the book! This is how it looks and sounds like: "Hey, everybody. Welcome to the world of the great world of health. This is about the amazing world of human health. In this world, the way to live a healthy life is by making the most of our food. This means that the foods we eat, the amount of food we eat and the way that we eat is important. We all know that food is the key to our health, but we also know that it is very important to be eating foods that our bodies are used to eating. It is important to keep in mind that we need to have a balanced diet to live long. We need to consume high-quality fats and proteins. We also need to maintain our muscles. We want to be strong, flexible, and we need our bones to be flexible and strong. If you keep eating foods like processed junk food, you are only making yourself fat. Your body is not going to be able to maintain the way it was designed to live. The best way to keep healthy is to get rid of the foods that you hate and to have the foods you love. The way to get healthy is by being a healthy consumer." Oh dear, not so much fun! I am so sick of these bullshit "health" books. What a shame that someone would put the time and effort to write such a bad shit book! And it is even more disgusting to realize that someone made money off of these books and people actually wanted to read it! __________ So here's a little synopsis of what I am about to say: -This book is an embarrassment. -This author is a moron -The author, the author, this book is not worth reading -This shit book is disgusting, this stuff is not healthy! -This article is bad, I did not read it -The article on this book was bad, you should not read this shit book I hope you all enjoyed my review!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is too vague and the information about the story is not in depth enough. It is like a summary of the story that you can use to start reading the book. I have tried to figure out what happened in the book but the book does not provide enough detail. I had to ask for an explanation by the author. The book will not help you if you are not interested in the story. If you are only interested in reading a book about the historical event that happened at the end of the war I would give this book 5 stars but the story does not interest me.   I was expecting a great novel with a lot of action and excitement. Instead, I got a book that is just a rehashing of a book from a few years ago, it doesn't seem original. The novel is just as good as the previous version. I would still recommend this book but with some improvements.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- This book really is bad, it's really that bad. If you read it, and then think, "that's so bad," that's really because you didn't pay attention, and now you can't read it again. This book is about a boy, Jack who is a child and can't talk to anyone and it's kind of obvious why. But what he can do is eat a book... or more specifically, a book which is "not like any other," and the problem is, there is no one who can understand him. The book is told in a way that makes it a lot easier for children to relate to, because it is narrated by Jack's father, who can actually understand his son's thoughts and feelings, and even get a few of his own in. I would have liked to see it told by Jack as well. But if you don't like kids, it will not help you to understand him either. The boy gets angry with the books, and his father tells him to forget them and that he is a special boy with special needs, and that's it. It's all very short. The characters are very stereotypical and don't seem real at all. But that's what makes them so cute.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  My sister read this book and we were both really put off. She couldn't get into it, and I had to pull her aside and explain why. It wasn't a perfect book, but she came away feeling like she had been wronged and the author should have been more honest with the reader. I wish the author had gone into more depth about why she wanted to include this character and why it felt like it was a good choice for the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I think this book was really, really wrong from the beginning. The concept was cool, but the way this book approached it was so wrong. The beginning was okay, but they decided to make this into a love triangle with some pretty terrible twists and turns. The ending was really stupid and not very believable.   I've read a lot of YA fiction and this was probably the worst.   A lot of the stories I've read about love triangles have been really good. I was so excited to read this book that I ended up reading it twice. First I was excited to find out what happens to Anna's ex and the second time I was really confused.        The only good thing about this book is the cover. It's a nice picture of some cute kittens. It says "A Day in the Life of..." I'm pretty sure it says "Life in the Kitten Zone" but I don't know. If I had it to do over again, I would just skip the book, but if I had a choice, I'd get the book.  Rating: 1/5   Review by: Erin   Date received: 10/06/13   Recommend for: people who like bad romance   Wow, I was SO excited to get my hands on this book. I loved everything about it, from the cover, to the title, to Anna and her two girlfriends, to their outfits. I've always been a fan of YAs that are about love, relationships, and stuff like that.   at the time I got it, I didn't realize that they were the same book but the different author!   But I decided to give this book a try. At first I was not sure how I felt about it. I liked Anna very much, and I thought Anna did well in the book and handled the relationship well. There was also something about her parents (Anna's father) that bothered me. It just seemed like there were some really stupid things about his behaviour and way of thinking that were so out of character for him that I just felt really sad.   in a very sweet ending, the narrator said she doesn't want to do anything that would make the kids suffer (which makes sense since I have a brother and sister too) but that she feels like she needs to at least say something. I just feel bad for the kids. They seemed to be a great group of friends, but
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________ I loved this book and had a great time reading it. I also have a little one and I could see them enjoying this book even more. As an older mom, I know that it's important to feed the little ones the right kind of food but, if they are hungry, I wanted them to eat more! So, I decided to buy the recipe books, just to get this one for my kids! I did not want to buy another book. It just didn't seem like something they would like. I went online and found this book but thought it would be a little boring and not interesting. I found it on a website that sells recipes for things like baby food, so I just thought it was for that purpose. But, it was so different than my usual favorite cookbooks! I like to cook and bake but this book was a little different. I like recipes that have a twist but this one was a twist on a classic. I will definitely have to make a few changes to my usual meals but it will be nice to see what they think of it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- * It was written in 1991 by an author with limited literary ability. * No one is better than anyone else at what they do, so do whatever you need to do to be successful. * Don't worry about what everyone else thinks about you and do what you can to be your own best person. * It is hard work to write well, but that is what you must do. * If you are the only one who wants to write, you are not as good as you think you are. * You must never take criticism personally. * There is no magic formula that will get you to success. * Writing is a very solitary pursuit. * All those people who tell you to "just try harder" and "write what you know" should be ashamed. * The worst part of this book is that if you don't follow my rules of what you want to write about, it doesn't matter because it is just a rehash of all the bad ideas that people have told you for years. I found it hard to believe this was written more than 10 years ago. If you try to read it as if it was written today, you will find yourself completely confused and frustrated with the directions. If the author had changed the author's name to "Robert E. Heinlein" or "Robert A. Heinlid" or something else that would have made the writing better. I would have read it, but I can't do that. This book is so bad that if I ever need to go back to school to study writing, I will pass it up for a different one. This is probably the worst of all Heinlein books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a joke... The main character, Mr. O'Toole, spends the whole book sitting in the corner of a bar, talking about his problems with women and the church and how he wants to change the world. I can't think of a worse thing to write about a book. He never has a point that he makes in this book, just some sort of rant.   It's all just "change the world" over and over. I was hoping for something more.  "This book is about everything..."  This guy makes it all about himself, and all about his own problems, the ones in his head, and not about others.  There's not even any development of the characters outside of him!   As soon as he has his point of view, the story just switches to the main character's point of views.  "This book was the worst book I ever read! It wasn't even good writing. There were things that I hated about it and it had all of the things I hated in books. And the ending was just horrible. It was like a roller coaster. I want to write and I don't know how to. I just know I can write and write well, and when I get a book published I can make it any way I want.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ________ ________ | | | ___________ | | I gave this book to a friend. I was skeptical. It had a lot of nice content, and the photos were great. I even like the subtitle of the book: A History of American Art. It gave a lot more information than the other books I have read on the subject of American art. I liked that, it seemed to have more information that the other book I read. But, it was terrible. The narrator was horrible and the author, so condescending that it made me cringe. I can't say more because I will never give it back. I didn't think it was that bad, but I read way more of the other good books before giving it to a guy who didn't seem that interested in learning anything. Also, the author never answered my questions and that was very unprofessional. This is an art book, not a history book. It's really the only negative thing I can say about the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I read this on a Saturday morning and finished it on a Monday. I finished it because I was so bored, and I thought, if only I could go to work on Monday. This book was boring, repetitive, and was extremely boring to me at 3:00 AM. I mean, I really liked the premise of the story, I was intrigued with the premise, but it just didn't work for me. I was never engaged. No action. No story. Nothing really happened. No development. All you get is the same story being told over and over again and not really feeling it." Possible explanations: The protagonist is really bad at making decisions, he goes where the author wants him to go and he just sits there doing nothing while everything is done for him. The author just wants to write a lot of pages. This book was in the category of a "bad book", but since this is a review about the book I will say it is not as bad as it first appears. A lot of the badness can be attributed to the author, and the protagonist is just bad at following the plot of the book. I have read similar books by the same author before, and some of the characters are just the same from book to book, but in this case it feels like every new character was just made into a new character that is not very original or good. I can see why a lot people liked this book. It really does give you a lot to think about. It is an intense read about a family that loses a daughter because of an accident and a family coping with that loss. However, at the end of the day I would recommend that you read a book about the family and not this one. It was just way too boring for me to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************* I am so disappointed with this book. I have bought several of these by authors I am a fan of, but I was very disappointed with how this one turned out. It is definitely too long and filled with a lot of redundant info and info that didn't matter. I wanted more action, excitement and a little sex. The main thing that bothered me most is that it seemed like he was just telling us how to make something that didn'y work or how to get more of what we want, rather than providing us with the information and information that we really need. The only reason this book got 3 stars was because it was on sale for $1 and the price is right.

(I just had my 3rd reading this book and I am sad I got so much wrong... It wasn't that I was really wrong but that I made a ton of assumptions based off the "fact" that she was from the Middle East and I assumed that was how she knew Arabic. No she did not, she did that by memorizing Arabic... so now all my "evidence" is wrong. She just said she could use this as a resource in her classroom for her Arabic and I thought to myself why would she want to? I was wrong)   Overall, this is just a bad story with bad characters. This is not a good book.   If you like history books that are full of details of the past or if you like novels that are easy to read, then you'll love this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ______________ ___________ (2/10)   There's a lot wrong here. The entire premise is flawed, which is why I give it only three stars.   The premise of this book is that there was an ancient civilization on Earth, and that civilization is gone. There is no explanation as to how it was destroyed, and no explanation for why the civilization is different from the civilization from which we are descended. The civilization is described in such a way that it can be read as an extremely advanced, technologically advanced, advanced, etc. civilization.     This is a problem.   at one point in the book, a priest/philosopher/teacher explains,  The human population is divided into three groups; the pure and the wise, the ignorant and the foolish. He says that there are two types of people in the world; the ignorant who refuse to learn and the fools who can't learn. It then shows how the foolish can learn but the ignorant don't. It goes on to say that there's only three types of weapons; the simple, simple weapons; weapons that can be used without effort; and weapons that require effort to use. The weapons that do not require effort are called 'impractical'. The weapons which are difficult to use but do require effort and effort to control are called the 'practical'.   We are told, by the Priest and by the other characters that the only thing keeping us from total destruction and ruin is knowledge and wisdom.   the first part of the book explains this through the story of a young man, a scientist who wants to build an airship, because he wants to get out of this boring city and go somewhere interesting. The only problem is that this boy, and every other person who wants a chance to leave this boring place, cannot build a ship. They have no tools, no knowledge, and they have no money. So the Priest tells the boy that it is necessary to build a tool called the wheel. Now the wheel is the most complicated object I've ever seen and it requires a group of people who are both experts in engineering and in building tools. And we are told that the wheel would require about 3,000 men to build. And he says to the boy who wants it, "If you could get 3,500 people to work for you, you could build the ship."   Now I think this is wrong.  .The whole thing comes
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You have been warned:  My first introduction to the book was not a happy one. This was a story about an unassuming middle aged man who gets caught up in a bizarre murder that happens in a small town in Wisconsin. The book was well written and the story was interesting but it was not very original. There were a couple of points where the author threw the reader for a loop and the overall plot was predictable. However, there was no real "bad" things about the book and the author had a sense of humor that was definitely appreciated.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I have been listening to this podcast for the last two months and this episode is awful. It's filled with poorly put together, incoherent rants and raves of some of the worst people I have ever heard. I have listened to the first four and will probably listen to the last four. I am ashamed to be one of those who bought this product. I feel that I had to put up with all this crap until someone finally pointed me in the right direction of a podcast that is well worth listening to.

If you want to enjoy this crap and laugh at the same time, then buy some ear buds and listen to some real music. No one likes a dummy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is awful.  You may like it. It's not so much that it's bad as it is that it is very, very boring. The characters don't seem like they are fleshed out enough for there to be much to them.  It is almost as if they were a series of side-characters with the same name and little to do with each other. This is especially annoying because they were all so good at what they did. I was hoping to learn more about them, but all I got was more of their same names.  I also found the writing to be so amateurish. A lot of it was just really bad.  For example, if the main character, Jules, is a detective, and gets caught, then there is not enough of an explanation as to why he did it, what happened and how the cops found him.  In another example, a big part of the book focuses on a woman named Sally who is a psychic who can read people's thoughts, but she is written as having no depth to her character.  She is a stereotype with no depth and her role is to be someone who gets caught in all of Jules's bad decisions and ends up getting killed. This makes it impossible for Sally to make a meaningful contribution to the story because the reader is supposed to hate Jules and Sally.  But, if you have read this type of book, then you will know what I mean by that.  To top it off, the book suffers from a really poor cover.  All the bad reviews were based on the cover.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   One of the worst books I've ever read. I have read a lot of horror and that's all I really wanted to read this year. After reading this, I can't imagine ever doing it again.   Why is this book bad? I know that this is a self-published book. However, this is the only thing in the world that makes this book not worth buying. I know the book is self-written but I still would've rather got some kind of printed book from a book store. Also, there were many things I liked about the story and characters but they were shoved into the story in such a way that they didn't add to the story.   and the most annoying character in this book is the character named Denna who I never cared for. She was just annoying and just annoyed me. I could not imagine what would've happened if the author didn't write her that way.   the author uses the term 'ghost' a lot in this story. I'm not a huge fan of that word but the author used it a lot. Also 'dead' or 'undead' is used a lot by the author too. I don't even know if they mean ghosts or ghouls but it is used so much that it made it kind of jarring.   It is also very hard to put the book down because of the terrible ending. It is too late by the time the story ends, so it makes no sense for the characters to continue the story once they know what is going to happen. So even if the story was good at the beginning, I would have never finished the book.   an awful book.

It's sad that I can't do it again because I loved it. But it's probably due to the fact that I read it over an 11-year period, and I'm so tired.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I really wanted to enjoy this book, it was the first book I've read this year and I'm going to try to read a variety of different genres to get through the year. However, I was just so uninterested in the story, and I was so unhappy that I wasn't able to enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. I was expecting a story that would give me chills, but I was more annoyed by the characters. I felt that the main one (who is very "hot-headed") was a little too much of a pushover in the beginning, but then after that he grew on me and I enjoyed the time that he spent with me. The other characters didn't seem very interesting (I didn't really know anything about them besides the name) and they were so unlikeable. I didn't see much growth in any of them so I felt like they were either just annoying or had no growth at all. I do wish there had been more of a character interaction in this book. I did feel like I didn a bit more of an influence on the other characters. This could have been a very fun read if it wasn't so "boring" and all about this one character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bad, uninspired, boring book that is all over the place. It's not a good example of the style or style of a good book and as a reader I found it disjointed.   The first chapter introduces the characters. There's a young boy named Harry who is the son of the leader of the anti-Muggle movement and his girlfriend is his sister. Then there's a couple of characters that are mentioned who have no development, and we don't get to know their back stories at all.  , the narrator, goes off on a tangent about something about the Harry Potter universe, and there is a lot of talk about magic and wizardry in this chapter. Then he moves on to a discussion of the plot for this book, then moves on. Then we get a brief chapter about what happens to some Muggle children, and then it's just back to magic and the plot. And the rest of the book just continues this same pattern with no real connection to the plot, except to mention in passing some of the characters (one of whom is a teenager).   So what happens next? The narrator talks about how the story is being told, about how Harry is getting along with the people he lives with, about the plot and who will win, about who is going to die and whether or not there's going to be an alternate world. This goes on and on for a couple pages until it abruptly gets to Hogwarts, where the narrator talks a little more about the characters in the story and their backstories. And then the story continues from there, back to the Hogwarts castle, back home to the boy, who is getting a job at his uncle's shop, and on and off we go.   It's all just exposition about the story, or it's about Harry and his family getting a new job at the shop, but never goes into anything that actually happens in the book.   in general, I found the narrative to be uninteresting. The pacing was all over-the-place and I didn't have any interest in the characters at all, except for the narrator. I wasn't really surprised that the author went off on so many tangents, and it was all really just a waste of time for me, but it was a waste for the reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book:..........................   I read a review of this book by the previous reviewer who thought the book was a piece of trash. I do agree, I think the book is pretty much trash. There is not a single redeeming quality to this book. The plot, while interesting, was very predictable. The characters are extremely flat and boring. There are few interesting plot twists, and most of the time the book will just be a list of characters telling us how they feel about something, without anything happening in-between. In fact, most of it will just get in the way.   All in all, I give this book a 5 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm new to reading and this is probably the worst book I've ever read. It's really boring and lacks a plot. The main character is a boring, self centered, egotistical and selfish person. No character growth in this book, nothing of worth happens. It felt like a very long, boring and tedious book that had no point in telling any story. There is no real plot and the main character in the book is a horrible, awful person. I feel cheated by this book. I'd like to give it two stars but I'm sure there are thousands of people who gave it only one star and didn't know it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book before I could finish it, but I didn't like it at the time.  The premise of this book was nice: it had the main character and the two girls on a ship and the pirates on the ship. But the characters just didn't feel real to me.  If I was going to read a book that had a pirate on a pirate ship, I would be more into the pirates.  But then they had the pirate get his arm broken in the first book and had to find him.  He wasn't all that great in this book.  This book was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________"This book is not a novel. It's a collection of stories of the different men who have been accused of raping, molesting, raping, etc. by a single woman named Jessica. The stories all have a kind of creepy feel to them, and if you were looking for a novel, you won't find one here. " ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Review for "The Rape of Lucretia" by Robert Graysmith  "The story starts with Lucreta in a Roman prison cell with a man, a Roman knight, in chains. As they talk, the knight tells Lucretha about the ways in which people try to kill her. He tells her of his attempts on her life and the various ways he tried to kill himself, including a suicide by jumping off a cliff in a desperate bid to live. Lucretda listens in horror and disgust. Then he starts to tell her how to commit suicide, the most effective way of doing so and what to look for when trying to find a suitable place to take her life. Lucretta listens to this and begins to have doubts. He explains that the person who has to be sacrificed to satisfy the demands of a tyrant, the one who has no choice but to be killed, has a right to have some dignity, and that this dignity can be given to the woman who has been the victim of a crime. Lucrenta is disturbed and wants to kill the knight who is telling her these things. He asks her what she thinks of this, and she asks him how he could have ever wanted to be the man she is trying to kill. He does not understand, she says. He says that he had no other choice. She is still not convinced and says that she is not ready to kill yet, and he says he's not ready either, but she tells him that she will try. The narrator explains that she does not know what has happened to her, that she has been sleeping the entire time. The knight, knowing that she's about to try, gets up and gets into bed. She puts a dagger on the bedside table and tries to make a move. It takes all her strength, but just as she is about to stab him, he gets up, jumps out of the bed, and starts running away. Then the knight says she is too scared and she can never kill. She asks him what he means, and the knight explains that he's come to

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because my college roommate was looking for a book to read. I was excited because I'm a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, and this seemed like it was going to be the perfect choice. I mean, I love fantasy, sci-fantasy and horror. I love writing fantasy. I think that's what it is. I wrote all the stuff I wanted to write. I just thought that this book would be a great way to put all that knowledge and experience to work. I don't remember what happened. It was after I read the last chapter, when I was sitting there at my desk with my laptop, thinking "Wow! This was great!" that I realized it was a horrible book. The first 2/3 of the book I just didn't care. I really liked the idea of this world and the plot, but I hated the writing. It seemed rushed. The author got two paragraphs together about each character. I liked the characters so much, but it just seemed so forced and lazy. I'm used to writing, and to having an outline. This was just one long, tedious paragraph, a paragraph after the previous paragraph about the same character. It just seemed like I was reading a book written by someone who really doesn't know how to write a good book.   So...yeah. It wasn't a great book.

I'd love to know how much it cost for the hardbound, because this was the first time I ever saw one of these in a bookstore, I would have been much more willing to buy it if the price were half that.   Anyway, it was a really hard read, and I had to read through it in one sitting. There are a lot of scenes in here that I wish I had gotten out of the story, but it was really hard to get through because I wasn't really invested in the characters. I'm not really sure why there was so much romance in this book, because I think that would have ended the whole thing before it began.

That's the exact thing I was hoping for.   to the main thing, though, the writing and the writing style in general of this book. I was very disheartened by it for a long time, I couldn't seem to put my finger on it, but finally after reading this book I really can put my fingers on what it is. The writing style is like it's trying to be as literary as it can possibly be, but then it still just makes up stuff, it doesn't follow the rules, and doesn't seem able to make sense. I don't think I'm a very good reader of English, but I do enjoy a good plot, which in this case is not happening. If I had it my way the characters wouldn't have been as developed as they were, and not much of a story would have developed.   and it also seemed to me that the author had no idea how to keep the story moving or how to put the action into the context of the world they were in.

What's even going on?" I read this book in 2 hours, because I was bored to tears. I couldn't put it down.  My biggest complaint about this book is that Hermione is so damn annoying. Her name doesn't ring a bell at all, and I was expecting a lot from her, and it came nowhere close. If you don't like her, then I would not recommend this book to you. The plot itself is pretty neat, and that makes up for it not being any good. This was my first ever bad Harry Potter book, so I was hoping that it would be better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- * I was excited to read this, since I have an interest in the historical development of the British Empire. The book was ok, but the history was a bit dull. I think they could have gone more into the background about how and why British colonialism came to be, but I liked the idea of a British/American alliance. * The book did have some interesting history behind it, and that was something. The main reason I was upset with the book was because of how much of a rip-off this was for the modern era. The author made several references to the Revolutionary War, where they both had different philosophies and ideologies, and also the French and the British were actually at war before (1815). That meant there was a long time for this conflict between British and French. The whole history of the book felt like some modern political lecture with no real depth to it. I don't see how this is the first time a book about the British empire was written (it's pretty recent, as the author has been around for a long while). And it would have been great if there was more historical information given to us before the events of the novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The characters are great but the plot is crap, the narrator is terrible, and I had to pause this book more than the first book, because the author was having trouble finding her voice and was talking so fast that the story seemed to be moving a mile per minute.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book, I love fantasy, it is my thing. But this book was not for me. I know it was for some people, but the fantasy elements were just so random that the whole thing was just very random. There was one scene I remember very well, where there were a group of kids playing games and one kid had the most terrible thing ever, an old, black crow that looked like an elf in a witch mask. It had a face like a wolf, like the face of a human. It just looked at him and gave the same horrible look. It's so silly! The other thing that annoyed me about the book was the fact that I kept waiting for it to get interesting, but I never got that. I really don't get why someone would want to read something with these random, ridiculous fantasy elements. The only reason it was ok for me was because I thought it was a good story and I liked it, and maybe I am just one of those people that get so hooked on fantasy they don't give a flying fuck about what the book is. (I think I was the only person in my whole circle that liked this.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but I think I would read it again without it being so many pages long, and it would be a whole lot better. The characters are quite likable, the story interesting and the writing very strong, but unfortunately it doesn't have enough to make it into my top 5 books. It is a very good read, but if I had to say it was bad I would say it might be in the top 10, but not my favorite book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I have only read ONE OTHER BOOK BY JAMES JAMES... THIS WAS A HORRIBLE BOOK... The Story of a Boy named Jack was a story I never expected to read about a boy named Jack... I was very interested to know what happened to the boy Jack... Unfortunately, I found out very little about the boy in this book... This was a book that did not have any emotional impact at all... My son, also a boy of about my age, liked this book, but he was not the only one who disliked it... The book was filled with a lot of sex, and some graphic sex scenes that were very hard to listen to for my son to listen... I did not like what I found in this Book, but I do not think I will have another book written by James James in the future...
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________   This book is absolutely worthless. I have tried, in vain, to give it to my father for Christmas gift, but I was told "no" because of the bad reviews. That is a huge disappointment to me.   My father had just finished reading the first book in the series - it was one of the best books in the collection - so I was really looking forward to reading this one.   is it about a little girl named Nessa? Yes. Is it about the book of the same name she reads in the beginning? No. Is this the last book? No, but the title certainly gives the game away.  is there a happy ending for the little girl? No and no. Is there a bad ending for Nessa or for the whole book? Yes, the whole story is a horrible train wreck of bad writing and poor character development.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was one of the first books I ever read that I was completely unenthusiastic about. I loved the concept, but the book was unenjoyable. I can only imagine that the only reason they could have ever gotten an average grade was because the publisher had never been published before.  At some point they might want to have a look at their numbers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was interesting, but not interesting enough. The author is a well-educated person and he knows what he's talking about, but he is still trying to make his book sound like something it's not. There were a few good ideas and some interesting observations about the nature of memory, and a few other interesting things. That's about it. The writing wasn't all bad. I do think the ideas would be more well-received if he didn't try to make it sound like he's learned something from each subject he writes about, and if he had focused more on his own ideas.   I've heard some really good things about this book, so I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5. This could have been a great book if the author had just written about his own personal experience with memory.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I was tired of reading horror stories about serial killers. After reading this book I realize how unrealistic some of the events in this book were. The killer who rapes the young woman, rapes a boy, and murders a man in cold blood is not a killer at all. He's just a sadist who was able to get the girl's attention. The people who tell this story are just crazy. My biggest complaint about the book is how the book ends, but that's not really the point of this book. I will give it another chance, but I'll skip any horror stories of serial killers that I already know.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! 1 star is a very good rating; this was a complete and utter waste of time and money.   I purchased "Masters of the Universe" as an eBook for a friend. I was skeptical of the book at first because it sounded very much like a Christian book. However, I read the first few pages and was completely blown away. It was fascinating and educational at the same time. I highly recommend this book.   the story begins with a scientist who is looking for a planet to study. He comes upon a planet that he believes is not from this universe. He then sets about trying to prove that this planet is from another universe. One of the key things that this book does right is the information regarding the creation of the universe. For example, there are different times before and after creation of this universe which is the key to understanding this book (and understanding the creation process). I also believe the author should have included a section on how life and consciousness came about. This book would have been better if he included this information. The author should also have given more background information regarding how the stars form and how they are different than the Sun, Moon, etc. I would like to have read more about the other dimensions that this universe can be.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a waste of time, not worth the $0.99. I had a great idea about a book I was going to read but I just gave up after 10 minutes. I think I might have just wasted my time for a week if I had given up at the first 5 pages and tried to read the rest. I'm definitely going to give it another shot but now I know I don't really want to get my life and business in a mess. I was hoping for a novel that was just like an audiobook but this isn't it. There were parts in the book that were very entertaining but they really didn't help me with anything I was looking for. I feel like there was too much narration for a few of the chapters. I hope you can fix this in the next edition.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a book a year ago by this author, but I have never gotten around to reading this one yet. I found it boring. It's about a guy who is sent from his country to a small town in Canada to live and work there. I thought he would get along well there and it was going to be a great experience. However, the story is boring and very repetitive. I read the same scenes a thousand times just to get the gist of them. It has many scenes of the same guy talking to the same girl, but he never seems to enjoy what he is doing. I really wanted to be on his side. He had the ability to change the world and change the lives of everyone in it, but his problems are too much to handle and he starts to lose hope.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- [Bosch] is just a mess in every sense of the word. I was expecting a decent book and I got nothing. The character of "Dr. Bosch" is completely worthless. This guy is all about making sure no one has a good time while he is around. He's the "Godfather" of partying. He gives "guest" permission to do anything to himself/theirself. If you are over the age of 21, and you have a good sense of humor, or are at least moderately attractive and "hot", you are invited to join him in his "house". You get a "permission" to do almost anything at his whim. (And if you are not of age, they have no way of knowing whether you are underage or not.) It is just completely inappropriate. Boschi is also the best example of a "man in charge" character I have ever seen. He has a real superiority complex. He wants to be the king of all of Mexico, and makes the Mexicans do his dirty work. He is the first person to realize that there is some bad under the sun (besides alcohol, drugs, sex, etc). You can actually feel the anger and hatred from this guy. Boschini, on the other hand, is a complete loser. He would probably be a good father to a child, but no one will ever know because he is constantly drunk. This is also a very sad story. This man will get what is coming to him and it will be much worse than he can imagine. Overall this was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book really hurt me. It is an excellent book about being trans but it made me feel like I was in the dark about everything. I went into the book thinking I would be familiar with all the details, that this book would be as well written and complete as my previous book "Trans 101" by Janice Raymond, but that is not what I got. There were many parts where I didn't even understand what was going on and I kept having to explain that to the author. I would not recommend this book to anyone.   The worst part of it was that even after I read the book to understand it I still felt that way about it. I read it for a couple of weeks to be sure, but I never felt I could have gotten to know it as an author did because she was so out of touch with everything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  No one is going to go and read this book just for the plot, but if you like some of the action I enjoyed and can see the potential for a second season I would say go for it, it's a decent story and it has some cool fight sequences!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book. I read it because I needed to know what happens to our characters after the initial invasion by the dragons. I'm sorry, but I just didn't want to read about that. It's too much story for one book. There are too many characters and I didn't feel as though the characters even got that much time to develop as much as they should have. The book was interesting though. The dragons are interesting. The plot is interesting. But overall, the story was pretty weak and repetitive. It didn't provide me with much excitement and I think that the book is just a bit too confusing for anyone who hasn't read the Lord of the Rings.   A few things I liked:   -The world of the book was just awesome. It was interesting to see how the world was so different than our world and even if the world wasn't so far away it made me appreciate the time we spend with the people in the story. I really enjoyed the way they created a different world and different things that we need to deal with.   it was hard to imagine where they would get their information about the dragons that we didn't know about at the start. It made sense that they didn't have much information on dragons so I really appreciated that the books were based off of the best of the world and not the worst.     Characters were pretty interesting to me. Even though there was so many of them I didn-t get the feeling they all had a defined personality. They were all very different and I enjoyed the different characters that the author created.   was a bit more likable than I thought I would be. I didn?t really like him much at all but he wasn't too annoying either.   at times he was just annoying. I think he just annoyed a lot of people because he was too strong and aggressive.  . I felt like he was overused in this book and I really did not get to see too much of him. It would have been nice to see what he did for his world and see some of his adventures. He was also kind of boring in this story. He is a boring protagonist. I do not think he was that interesting and I was kind of bored with him after he finished reading this book but he still wasn?t too bad. He still made for an interesting character.   a few other things I didn and didn?ts like:  , The world building was
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________.   This book, for many reasons, was a waste of my time. There were a lot of good parts, such as:   1. It was very well written. It felt like my favorite novel. There was nothing wrong with it. It could have been written by a thousand people. There wasn't a single bad sentence in it.  ...   2. The characters were really interesting. They had real, very deep, deep emotions and they developed the story with such grace. I don't know how many times I reread this book to find out how many character traits and flaws there were. It would take more than a hundred books to describe all the characters. I think you could read this book and it wouldn't give you any characters that you didn't care for.   the main character, who is the most interesting, was an 8 year old boy named Jack. This is why he was my favorite character. He was very intelligent and very well read. He liked books. He didn't want to read them all. He would always come up with stories and stories. He loved learning about the universe. He thought his brother was smarter than he was. He had a lot to say. And he liked girls, too. He just loved his brother.   in the end, he was so good at everything he did that no one was able to get the better of him. No one. The only character that he couldn't out think was his little brother. It took several books to get around to actually learning why his little friend Jack hated his brother so much.  ,,   3. Jack was a very likable character. This could be a little confusing because there was no conflict in the story. You could sit down and read the story in one sitting and it would be the same story over and over and again. There really wasn't anything in the book that was bad. It wasn't too bad. I could imagine this book being a lot more enjoyable if it was written as a series of short stories. The main character is a great character. It has everything you would want from a great main character. But then he loses his memories and we never see him again.     ,,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I thought that it was a new take on a story that I've read before and wanted something new. However, what I got was a recycled story that had already been told so many times. I don't think the author has read one of my own books, so I know that most of the characters have no life, no character development, and no growth whatsoever. This is the same old story that has been told over and over again for the last 30 years or so. I really couldn't have cared less about the story, but this author has no business writing any stories about the Middle East.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is very poor and the plot does not hold together in the end. There is not much mystery in the book, just a couple of leads and a plot that is very cliche and predictable. I found it rather annoying to read the first 40 or so pages of the book where I really thought there might be something really interesting going on, because there really was not. The writer should not be writing about something so bad that it is really hard to like.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I just finished this book and it was NOT for me. I hate how some of the characters' stories were dragged out and dragged out to the point of where it was annoying. I guess this book was supposed to have a happy ending to some of these characters but I am afraid it wasn't. So much of it was just...weird and weird and weird...to the point that I was not really sure if there was an ending to this book. Maybe I will not finish this book or just give it away for free to someone who will find it hilarious. I just don't know, I just did not like the way I felt while reading this book....it wasn't funny, I guess...I just did. And that's a shame because I really liked the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did have a good time with this book but I can't get past the ending. I read the entire book but the ending is just so ridiculous and contrived. I was hoping to see what kind of evil villain this book was going to be but instead I just got this weird story about a guy who had to find a girl to marry him but couldn't be bothered to even try. That just made me so angry because I don't get it. Like why wouldn't the author go for the girl in the beginning if he had the power to do anything about her? It makes absolutely no sense at all.   I also felt like the ending was rushed. I could see that the book was very long but it would have been much better if it just ended there and then.     This was just too rushed and contorted and I can not wait for the next book. I think it would be fun to do a book with the author and that would be awesome.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had no sense of humor whatsoever, no sense at all. There is no character development in this book, there is no plot, and there is a complete lack of plot development. It's almost impossible to read a book like this and think of a reason to buy it.  This book is an absolute, textbook example of why the world needs to be fixed. I feel like it has been pulled out of a bad joke, with no sense to it at all and it is truly a piece of garbage, a piece that has nothing to do with anyone in this story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I had the most amazing time with this book! It was like getting to know a new friend. I think I'm going to read it again. When I was finished, I was so happy and felt a little like a king. However, I had a friend give me the book because she liked it so much. I gave her a gift for her birthday and she really enjoyed it. There was a nice, friendly reviewer with a couple of helpful hints.   My rating is a 4 (Outstanding):   "This book was one of the best things I have read in a long time. You will not be dissapointed. Please share this wonderful book with your friends."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this one is not good, it is boring and poorly written, the main character is a girl with a mind of a 6 year old, the rest of the characters are either a 9 year old child or 8 year old boy, no way they are capable of such amazing feats.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************* 1. It wasn't even that funny. I didn't laugh, but that was the extent of my reaction. 2. There were several things that bothered me. First, it was confusing that there was a "curse" but not just any curse. I don't know why the author doesn't use any curse word, other than the "goddamn" one. And I thought it was funny that they all started with a curse word like "cocksucker" and then added curse words as they went along. I've heard curse words used in the Bible, but it seems to be a very common curse in modern times. 3. The author also added one curse word that I didn' t realize existed. I know this is an anti-religious book, but the author mentioned that it's not the "god is watching you" kind of curse, but rather the "the enemy of gods" kind. So, this would seem to be the curse for Satan. So why did she say the word? 4. The curse was "stuffed with profanity". I don' t understand how the author could have made something about the Bible that was so foul. 5. It seems that the curse is supposed to be temporary, so you can try it on your own child. I'm not a big believer in curses, but this seems a little too much. I also don't understand why you should even bother with it. 6. I was surprised that the author never mentioned this curse at all. Even when the curse was mentioned, it seemed like the curse would never actually end. She didn't use a curse, she just said the enemy is "a big, big-g"g. 7. I think the author should have mentioned this to the child, to make it more real. She really didn't have to say it. 8. There was also a whole lot of swearing. I can't believe that it even got past the editor. I wouldn't have minded, if it didn't come at the end of the book. This is a problem with most anti-religion books, that I have ever read. 9. The other bad part about the book is the profanity. I really couldn't believe it was in there. I guess they were afraid someone would say "damn." It didn't seem to matter to the publisher, but I can imagine that the editor at least would have asked for a "please, sir" to

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- **One of the worst books I have ever read. A real disappointment**
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first time I read this book, I didn't want to finish.  It had a very strong, narcissistic, unapologetic narrative of being a bad person, doing evil, etc... I had to take time away from my work to read it... It was hard to put this book down.  I had a hard time getting the story through my head...it was difficult to keep track of the details.  This book, in my opinion, is the best way to understand a sociopath, and will help you identify when you are reading one yourself.  It has a definite'story' to it that most books don't have.  In fact, the more I read the book, the better I can tell how each character has engaged with the sociopath and what they have gained or lost.  A must read, especially for those who have a friend who is a sociopathy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I had to go to the gym because I was feeling too lazy to move my ass, and while I was doing cardio, I could not stop thinking about the fact that I had read this book.   It seems that every book you read makes you feel like shit afterwards. What I mean is you feel so awful after your first read, that you can hardly stand to read another one. This book was like that for me.   the bad thing is that it felt as if there was a certain person that wrote this book who knew all the right answers, and she put it all out there and made you feel horrible for wanting to go out and enjoy the outdoors, which, believe it or not, is not always the easiest of things to do when you are a virgin.  .   "What was that?" I asked myself, reading through the pages again. It sounded like I was reading the book in a foreign language.  "She told me that I would never see my family again, and her words were like a punch in the gut. She said it was so true and it made my heart race, even as I read through the words."   I don't think I can ever read another book, or listen to another podcast, or read another newspaper, or check my email again. This woman's book made me feel like a little girl. It made me question my beliefs about sex, about what I wanted, and about my family. I wanted so bad to have just one more experience with her, and to have it be with someone who had really done me a huge favor, who understood me, and who I thought was smart. She was my mother, I thought.  , and I had a feeling that she was actually a little bit older than her age. I remember having a feeling about her, a feeling of awe and wonder, like she was one of the ancient gods of my imagination. I felt like she knew everything, but was too afraid to show me. That scared me more than the actual sex.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................. I've read this book a couple times now, and each time the ending sucks. A couple weeks ago, I picked up the hardcover version and gave it another go. I thought it was a little better and thought the main character (Dwight) and a couple of other characters had a lot more character depth. Then, a month ago, there was an electronic edition of the book, and I figured this might be a good one to try out. The book has this feel of being put out there, just in a different way, and it was great to see a couple changes that didn't make it into the electronic edition. I'm a huge fan of the movies, but I had to be careful about reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a total waste of my time. The author did absolutely nothing to write this book. All of his characters were a bunch of stereotypes that he just copied from an old book. He made no attempts to show you anything about these people. He even made himself into one of them. He had a couple characters change, he had an old woman in the book that was just there to make him look older and better than he was, and he made all of his main characters in this book white. The main characters, the one's that the people really liked, were all white. I don't know if I would be offended by this book because the author is not of color, but it was offensive as hell to the people who read it and offended others who did. I have a few issues with it, one is the author seems to have written all of these characters into this book so that he can make them seem like they are not a stereotype. The other is the only character that was not a white person was a Black woman and she was not very happy about it.

I've read the book over and over in the hope that I'd have the insight to improve my typing speed, but I've been frustrated with the book all along.

The book is extremely boring and the author doesn't even try to make the book interesting. I read this book in 4 days because it is such a waste of your time and a waste on your pocket. This book does nothing to help you improve your typing, and it will actually frustrate you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the first few pages, the author goes off on a bit of a tangent, a little rant about how the book was "written" by a computer (the same computer that he claims was in the movie. So basically, the entire book was written by a man who has never seen a real person). What I like about this book, is that it's easy to read, and it makes it very clear why the computer wrote the book and what its motives are. I also found it quite amusing that he says the book is about what happens when "the world gets so much bigger" than ever before. This book isn't all that big a deal, it doesn't make you feel like you're missing out on something important, it's about the effects of technology on humans. And if the computer didn't write it, then the computer had to have written it somehow, but that doesn't take away from the book's overall enjoyment.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********   I was very excited when I opened this book, and was really excited to start reading it. Unfortunately, I couldn't get much beyond the first few chapters, as it is so short (only about 50 pages). It's all too common for a novel that starts with so much promise to stall in the middle, and this did not help. It's hard to tell if the author got this book published, as the ISBN for the book is printed in Chinese (査力支持有的非查), which I'm not sure if the publisher translated it from the original language. I think it is worth checking out though as it has some decent stories, which are told very effectively.   This book starts out with a mysterious man, who is the author, who goes by the name "Zi", who is not as mysterious as he seems at first. The man, along with his friend, goes on a quest to find the mysterious book that supposedly can turn people into dragons, with his help. They do find the book, but it turns out to be a collection of notes, which seems like a bad joke for the author. The characters were well done, with a little bit of sarcasm mixed in, which was quite well done. Unfortunately though, the characters and story are just kind of a blur, and you get the feeling that you are never quite sure what is really going on.  .   This is probably a big negative for the review, but I can see why it might bother some readers, as I find the characters a little flat, and I really have no clue as to the true nature of this author and his book.  , but if you enjoy reading mysteries, then it's worth a look. If you are looking for some good stories, this may not be the book for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I had never heard of the term "sperm whale", until a friend of mine (who had just come from Australia) told me about this book. Well, I must say this book is a huge disappointment, for the most part, but I have read worse. I had read one or two books about sperm whales before, but never this one. The title really says it all...this book is NOT about sperm whale reproduction...it's all about one of the most unusual animals on earth..."

Write a negative review about a bad book:     The book is well written. It's about a father and son relationship. However, this relationship is not what I wanted to learn about. I'm interested to read more about what goes on between parents and children. I also want to learn more about the child's perspective. This book isn't for me. The writing is very bad. It seems like someone had a bad day with spelling or grammar. It was very hard to read. The grammar and spelling are terrible.   The story: I would have been more interested in the story if there were two parents. I know the child is a teenaged girl but how do they interact with each other? Do they hate each other or do they just get along? This seems like a very boring story. I don't want to read about a parent and a teenager that doesn't have any drama between them.   a review of a child's relationship:     A child's friendship with her father.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   Readers are expected to have some familiarity with the basic science of biology, and a working knowledge of basic chemistry to appreciate the plot, but I can't see the point of it. I just wasn't impressed by this book.   My son is a college freshman, and my daughter is in high school. Neither of them are reading much, but they are avid readers. I purchased both books at the same time so I can read both to them at the exact same time.   the characters are interesting, I like them, but... they don't seem realistic. The story is mostly about the "research", so we get no idea what the characters' lives are really like, and the characters don't have much of a history. We don't know who they are or what happened to them until halfway through. We know that they started studying to become biologists, but not much else. We meet the author at about the same point in the story as in his other book, and we don't get to learn much about him in this one. He's a good writer, but this book was a slog. The only part that made me like this book more was the science, which I knew, but was still surprised by. I think the idea of studying evolution for a career sounds cool, so I wanted to read it. Unfortunately, I can only give this one 3 stars for that.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________   "This book has been extremely interesting to me, although it has had me completely off the mark in many areas."   _________________________________________________   The only problem I had with this book was that I could not tell you what this book is about...the title is not what made me think about it in the first place. It's about the creation of the World Wide Web, and all the implications and implications of it.   If you don't want to read about the web...that's fine...but I would still love to know what it is about, and what it has to say about our future as a society.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I bought this book I was so excited because it was by the amazing Barbara Hambly and I have loved her writing ever since I read my first book in a series of five in my early teens. When I started this book it was amazing but then the bad bit came out and I started hating this book. This book has so many things wrong with it that it is hard to say anything good about it because it has so much wrong with so many areas and there is not enough time to write down all the bad things that happen in this book but I will tell you that this book was really good about one thing, it taught me that no one should get what they want from no one. That is a lesson I still think about over a decade later. I am happy that I got this book because I have never found another book that had everything that this one does but then when the bad bits came out the book really fell apart and it was hard for me to feel anything about it or give it a chance.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________   This is probably the worst book I've ever read. I just didn't get it.   The protagonist is a young boy named Jake, and the story is about him growing up. But it also happens at some  This book was so bad that I had to put it on the "bad" shelf with "Huckleberry Finn". And I'm not even exaggerating. This is a bad, awful book, with lots of bad writing, characters, and even the ending!   Here's the thing. I like Jake. I really like him. He's just an average kid who is bullied and bullied by his older sister, who has a temper. At the same time, he's just as much in the spotlight. He wants to be a writer and he wants to write. He has an ambition to make a name for himself. He works at a bakery and tries to help them out. When he discovers a magic spell that will allow him to write anything that comes to mind, he starts a new life for himself, in a small town in New England. But the bullies keep on bullying him and his sister. He gets picked on and picked on by the other kids and sometimes they even beat him.  . When I started reading this, I was so excited to get to learn more about the magic of writing. I read that "every book is a story told in a sequence", so I really wanted to see how the magic would work for Jake.  's story is told through the eyes of Jake. He starts the story being called "Jake" by the teachers and friends he makes and by the bully himself. I loved this first section! I didn't mind the fact that Jake was "Jake", but I did mind the bullies calling him "Bully" and I was excited for the adventure to start! The story continued from there, but I didn the part of Jake and his relationship with his sister when he went to the bookstore to try and get a copy of this book. That part was boring. I was bored to tears because it was so boring. All I knew was that I'd like to read a book called "The Bully Chronicles", but since I had that book, I would probably pass. And I didnít care because I knew I'd just read about what's in the book. After a while I realized that Jake is being called an "it" a lot in the story and that it was kind

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________This was just plain nasty. The narrator was absolutely horrible. He did not have an accent that I can hear at all (not that I would ever be able to distinguish one from the other, but he sounded like a complete stranger to me), and did not even seem to know English when he started talking. There was one passage (on page 36) where he made some silly comment about how people's clothes are "so hot right now" and I just laughed because he was clearly not talking about the hot weather (which I know is what he was saying) but I was laughing anyway because I was so confused by the fact that a narrator in English would use a silly line like that as an example of something people wear right now. There were also a lot of lines that made no sense. One of the things he said was, "If you go to the beach, wear something tight so your clothes can keep you dry," which confused me. "Dry" is not a word I'd use for that situation. There are a lot more of these problems in this book, and I was very disappointed. I gave this book two stars because I just found it so much fun to read, and at the end, I was glad that I finished it (and I probably would have finished it a little quicker if I could have read more of it during the first few days I read it, but I guess I have to start over with another book).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was completely disappointed with this book because I really like the idea of being able to be connected to a character on some level. I liked how it seemed to be a very personal book for John and the other characters. Unfortunately, John was completely unlikeable and I was really hoping the main character would be more likable. I was expecting more of a romance, and there was none. The rest of the book was fairly uneventful. I can see how people would enjoy the book, but for me, it was not good enough to recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself was very bad. It was not what I expected, the story was very bland and uninteresting and the characters were boring.   I hate when books have bad reviews because i feel like its because the author doesnt really know what she is doing, i have read some pretty good books and this one was just bland and poorly written. i would rate it at about a 1 star if not for the fact that it was one of the very few books that i have purchased from this author and it is one of my all time favorite series.  , if it wasnt for my love for this series, I would have given the book a bad review.  It was ok, a lot of the things he was talking about were just not very interesting to me. The thing I didnt like about it, was that he would go into his past as if he did not care for it. That bothered me. I thought that he was going to explain why he left.   is his family really that bad, or does his brother have a thing for his sister?  And how does his mother have to die at the age of 22 to make him believe in magic? .     Anyway, it was a very boring book, a waste of my money.    And i am trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with me, I cant seem to figure it out.   the reason i didnt give this book 2 stars was because i think that is the most boring series i ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- ***The writing was bad*** --------------- --------------- So, let's take a look at what the writing is all about. This book is so riddled with problems that I honestly do not understand how I came to ever believe in this book in the first place. This is a book about the past, as we know it. The story starts with the world's most powerful warlord, who was raised by elves after his mother and her brother died in the wars that they were fighting against the giants, and he lives the life of a king. He has a palace, and a small retinue of bodyguards who he treats with respect. When he dies, his brother, the current warlord (who is still young and a young man), is made king. This story is told by two people who are the only survivors from the war with the giants. Their story starts to change as they are forced to do war with each other. This changes them, as well as the warlord's kingdom.The book begins with the book's "hero" as he is given some tasks to do. As I have already mentioned, the main character is the main villain. This main villain is a human named T'riss who was sent to the mortal world from the godlike world of the elves to try to kill her half-brother, the war lord. T'rin is an interesting character as she is a villain for the story, but also is interesting as she has a human father and a half-elf mother. She is forced to take this job because she is the one who was promised to be the main antagonist in the story. I find it interesting to read a story that starts out as a human taking the title of the main evil villain and then has the protagonist take up the title to try and stop him. The ending of this book seemed really out of nowhere, as it was a bit of a cliffhanger. If the main book was about the warlords and the humans, then why did the story have to end with the villain being a human? It really would have made sense. There is a lot of characters in the book and all of them, except T'Riss, are interesting to follow. I found it very difficult to keep track of who was important and who wasn't. Some of the characters like Jarns (a friend of the war prince) and T'rniss, the two main characters have little to no motivation to be in
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  I love this book. I know, I know. A book that gets my interest like this does not need a review. But this book had been in my library for many years and I finally bought it for a Kindle. I really enjoyed it. In my opinion, the story has a different feel compared to the first one. The story is told from the points of view of the characters who are going through a very dark time of their lives. The main character, Jaimi, seems like a very nice and calm person; but his feelings of being lonely and sad are really obvious in the beginning. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a really good love story, or a dark one. If you like dark and tragic, like me, then this will be right up your alley. There are many happy endings, and even some sad ones. I think a lot of people would like this book, even though it is not for everyone. I just gave my rating to the story itself, which I think is good. This book is really not for a person who wants a fast read or is just looking for something dark. A person who likes a good horror or thriller, who does not mind a slow read or a good emotional journey will really enjoy this book more. A story in a book like this would definitely be an emotional rollercoaster for most people. It is a very different and different story from any other I have read. I give this book a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   The book sucked.   Why would I read a book about a wizard and then have to read another book about how he has a daughter? I don't care if this one is worse. This will only add to my collection of books with wizards in them.   and no you will not be able to see his wife either. She has long blond hair with purple streaks going through it.   of course he is not an evil wizard but the other characters are all evil.   a bad family of wizards.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a fan of Stephen King and it is not for me that the story did not start with the "The Boy Who Came Back From the Dead" so as a first timer and as someone who loves his work but also doesn't have the time to read a lot of his books it felt like a wasted book. But it is worth the read and I am hoping some of the reviews here are just people who are bad at reading the book. It would have been better if it was set up in a way that the reader could understand what was going on in the past and future and what was happening to the people involved. Otherwise there was too much exposition and it was not really clear who was who or what the motives of the characters were so it was a little confusing at times.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  My boyfriend and I loved this book and we're reading it again and again. We love the illustrations and the story line of what is going on in this book. It's just a great book and I look forward to reading it over and over again. However, it's really too short for me. I have a little over 3 months of free time now so hopefully I will have the space to finish it. It also has two sequels and an omnibus book called "Innocents in a Gloom." I'm hoping that it can be read as a whole series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as an introduction to a philosophy that had a huge influence on my life. I was not really interested in any of the teachings, but I thought it was an interesting concept to try and see if it could help me. I didn't get much out of the book, although it helped me understand a lot of what I was thinking. However, it made me want to stop thinking and doing the things I wasn't supposed to be thinking about. I'm actually in therapy now trying to figure out why it all happened in the first place. -I know, I know. I should have picked a different one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it is a flawed book. It is very short at just over 250 pages. It does have a good idea in it though. I had a difficult time starting and ending this book at the same time. It took me many tries to get a good story. I think if I had read this book 2-3 years ago I may have had a much different ending. I did not really like the characters. I was hoping they would have more depth in them. They are not too complex, but there are no surprises. I found the ending to be just a little too convenient.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I'm a really big fan of this book! It was a fantastic read. It's very well written and easy to read. But, the only thing that I didn't like were the ending(they seemed very contrived), and the ending of the first one. I think it was a good idea to do this but the ending was a little too rushed for me. I'm sure it is meant to be a mystery and not a straight to the point thriller. I like how the characters are presented and the way the story is told, but not the ending. I will definitely be reading the next book. By: M.B.Nguyen This is a wonderful book! I like that they give us characters with different personalities and all the personalities are very interesting to read about. The writing is easy to follow, and it's just a great book!

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I read this book from the first page. It was very exciting, and I was curious about the story, so I put my headphones on, and decided to listen to the audio book version of the book. I thought the audio was clear and well-recorded. I could see how the author was trying to capture the tone and flavor of the text, but I just don't care for the book's prose and the audio's audio-like quality. It sounded like it was recorded by a kid on a public radio station. There were also numerous spelling and grammatical errors that made me cringe. For example, the book opens with "It was a bright, cold day." It shouldn't start with a description of a cold day. The author then proceeds to describe how there is a storm coming. He then goes on to say how he is the son of a king. He goes on for a few pages describing how he has done some bad things, and has gotten into some trouble. I am not sure if the writer wrote this so it sounded like the audio version or if he was doing it to add to the suspense. I'm not sure how to tell the writer what to add in the future. One more error that I found was that it says "he was a prince." Well, if a kid is going to start calling his father king, that's what you call him. If not, you can call him prince.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the first book in the series and the book started out okay, but then it fell apart. I'm not sure what the problem was. There was a character who seemed to be the main character for a while and then he vanished, and I think that was the reason the whole thing got messed up, but other then that, the story was decent. Overall, it was a good book, but not one i would recommend.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you have not read the book, and have a few minutes, just read the first chapter of this book.  I didn't like it, and was so disgusted, that I went back and read a chapter to see if it was worse.   This is a book for parents to teach their children, not for teachers to use in the classroom.  The writing style, writing format, grammar, and vocabulary are just too amateurish to be considered professional.  This book was not helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really expecting something much better from these authors, and that's what they delivered. There were parts that really bothered me. The characters had little to no depth, their motives and feelings were often not explained. The world building was a bit thin.   I'd give it 4 stars if it weren't for the "horrible" ending, which basically had nothing to do with the plot, but I can't really say I was too disappointed by it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________" This book is the most entertaining book I have ever read. I am a big fan of science fiction and was so intrigued by the concept and the science in this book, that I had to give it a try. It started with an excellent idea and was executed flawlessly. There were moments that I truly believed it was going to come off as a hoax. But even when they weren't there, the idea was so intriguing that I was willing to give this book another chance. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was extremely excited for this book. I have been a fan of fantasy and sci-fi since I can remember. I was also a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise. I wanted to read the Star Trek books but had no money so I had to wait until I was old enough to buy them. Now, after waiting two years and finally getting my hands on them, I am very disappointed. This is a series I had been looking forward to reading for many years. I had always heard great things about the books but was worried they wouldn't live up to the high standard I knew they were going to. I knew I would enjoy them because I had a big old Star Wars collection. But alas, I don't like this book very much. I don,t think I have ever hated a Star Trek book. It is just not my cup of tea. There is too much going on and it's kind of hard to follow. It took me a while to figure out who was who and what was what. I feel as if I have read every character in every book. This book is just too complicated and confusing. I didn't know what to think about Spock and the Klingon Empire. I also found myself confused about the Romulan War. I wish there was a little more explanation on all of it. If I had read the book before Star Trek: Nemesis came out I would have enjoyed it more. It would have made more sense to me. I love Star Trek and I really want to like this series. I just wish this book didn't take me so long to finish.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was terrible. I bought this book to teach students and it made them cringe.   It's like some people are so self-centered and self-absorbed that they would rather write a book to help themselves than help anyone else.   and I am an outcast in my own life and it's only because I read a book called this one which says, "the more the merrier, except this time when they get you started, make sure you turn around" that the world doesn't hate me because I'm different than them. If I wasn't different, I wouldn't need the book. I read it to help myself be happy and I think the author did that.   on the other hand, I was so pissed off that after reading a couple chapters and being so annoyed that I had to start all over with a different book. Then they got to "get you started". I felt like I didn't need any of this advice anyway, since I had already learned a lot. It felt like they had already written a book on how not to be happy, and then they wasted two more chapters on me, so I had wasted my time. I wanted to write a five star review and give this book a zero. But I can't. I was frustrated by this book and I couldn't stand to read more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took me a while to finish this book, and I really wasn't into it much. The only character I really cared about was the evil doctor who was so evil that he made me want to kill myself, because he was a total douche. The book was full of pointless descriptions of what he ate and what he did to people, and how he made these things taste. I can't even remember why I read it. The other characters in the book were dull, and the setting was not very interesting. I'm pretty sure that this book took place in some fantasy world where every character was a jerk, because it seemed so far-fetched and ridiculous that I really didn't care about any of the characters. Overall rating for me:    5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book because I was looking for something different and had been wanting to give a book a try since I started reading (I'm not too keen on reading the same thing over and over, in fact I hate it, so this may come as a surprise) I was so disappointed in it I gave up after the first sentence and never looked back. I found the premise quite confusing and I am a huge sci-fi nerd so the fact that it was a fantasy seemed weird. However, the concept of a universe with a very very large amount of 'fate' for every living creature and even non-living organisms was really cool. I was also impressed by the author's use of magic and I'm glad that it wasn't in the main plot of the book. I had a lot of difficulty coming to grips with the main characters and I think the author could have done more with the secondary characters too. It's also a very confusing book because the author is not really clear on what he's trying to say. I didn't really think anything was actually happening but it was too confusing for me to concentrate on reading for longer than a few pages. I felt it would have been better if he had put the main character's life on hold at one point and then moved on to the book's main plot. I would not recommend this book to anyone, in any case. I ended up reading The Book of Lost Things, an epic fantasy book that is much better written, with a far better plot and far more interesting characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book and I didn't like it very much. I am a writer and I have always had a writing problem and this book wasn't helping me. I was bored with it and I ended up writing a very long essay about it. I'm glad I didn t purchase it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:..............................."I hated it. I don't like that kind of thing." I don'st know what I expected. I thought it would be a fun, cool, edgy, well researched story about a small community in a small town. Instead it's just a poorly written, poorly researched, poorly structured story about "a small town." There's little plot or character development, and the writing is awful. As someone else mentioned, the author is clearly not that good, and there's a lot of repetitive things. I could give it a 7, but not a 1 star.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ "When I read this book I knew I had to give it a go. It's not a bad read, just very generic and lacking a lot of things that makes a good reading experience. There were things I liked about this book but it really didn't hold my attention for a long time. I ended up waiting an hour for it to get to the part that was supposed to be a story, it kept dragging. I felt like I was being told the same story over and over again. The author doesn't really seem to want to make a reader feel like they are the main character and that's the biggest problem with this book. If she wants people to like this book she needs to change up the pacing and make it a story that will be more exciting and keep me interested. If you read this as a book in the series I think it will be better."
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  This book was poorly written. The main character is a young boy with autism. The story starts out as he is reading a book about his autism and is excited about it. He has a crush on his teacher but the teacher is not able to communicate his feelings with her. He's confused about it and can't explain it to his friends. The author tries to make it all feel like a tragedy and then later it is a happy ending.   This one bothered me the most about it, but not in the way the author made me feel. I felt this book had no plot. It has many things that happen that don't make sense. The characters never have any real conflict with each other and it seems like they're just doing what the book dictates to them. In the end, we don't really learn anything. It seemed like there were no interesting characters and just a plot device to keep the reader reading. The ending felt forced too.  , September 8, 2018

The magic in this book is great, it's not too complicated, and has enough twists and turns to keep you interested, however it is not overwhelming and requires some attention.   The book is also long, however the writing is fast paced and easy to read.   The only thing I would change is the ending, I think it was really poor.  I understand that the story is about a new student coming to an old school, however at the end of the book the student that started it all (who has been gone now for 10 years) is still alive. I just felt this was a weak ending for a book that had such a good plot, and it was definitely not enough to bring the book to a happy ending.   and that's what I dislike about it. This was a great book, but I would have liked it better if the ending wasn't a let down.   is written with a light hearted, humorous tone. It is not really serious at all, and not overly serious at any time, it is just funny and light heartened, however there are some things that really hurt my feelings for it. First of all, I thought the protagonist was a little too perfect. She is a genius student, she has gone to a school that is like a different planet, yet somehow manages to pass, she knows a lot about magic (she used to be a witch at the school) and she has a very nice and mysterious personality. Her first day of school is a bit more exciting, however upon reaching the main part of the school the book goes a bit slow for her. This made me really think that she was too perfect, and I just didn't like her. Secondly, I felt that the author needed to add a little more information about the character, and how much
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was a disappointment.  It's basically a story about a father and son who go to see a new movie about the history of the Civil War, and there's some great bits of history about the war.  Then it gets a little bit silly in a bad way.  I don't know what happened, but the son is an alcoholic, and his dad has a temper, and the son gets in an altercation.  A fight takes place, they're both in trouble, but then the father goes into the other room and dies.  When the son finds out he gets hysterical and the mother is a very nice woman.  The film also doesn't try to make up for the wrong that the father did by telling the son's story.  So there's a little story that's not explained in the book, and some funny stuff.  But all in all, not a bad movie, but I'd recommend another one, or better yet go see the Civil war documentary!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very sad and disappointing book! It was too short to be a good story and the way the ending was set up is not believable. It would have been better with a little more time in the book.

But overall, I really enjoyed it and hope it will be in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that bothered me about this book is that it doesn't end. It's a really good story and it ended too soon. The ending was predictable, and even if it was good, it would still have been better if it had ended right then. I hope it comes back because it is such a fun story.   Overall rating: 3 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because the blurb said it was a "revelation" from God. I knew that this was not a real revelation, just a book of fairy tales, but it didn't stop me from getting it. I am an atheist and it was one of the first books I've read by an atheist that gave me hope. It was the only book I've ever purchased from Amazon with a negative feedback from a friend.   The first few chapters are very nice. The author explains that God is an abstraction. That isn't a bad thing, in fact, this is a very good way to understand God. God is not real. God doesn't exist. The best definition I've seen is that "God does not exist." That is what a religion is.  -A God that makes you see all things in a certain way -   What if that is exactly how you see God? That is a bad explanation because we are all created to look at things in our way, to think like ourselves. It is what makes our lives interesting, and to not think like yourself is very boring.   (For example, if you don't think in your own image, and you think of someone you don,e, like, then they are not a part of you and you won't experience the same feelings for them as you do if you believe in God.)   -God is just the same as the Christian religion. That would also be a bad example. There is no reason that if we believe in both that they should be the same. (If you do not believe in either one then they're not the same.)   and god was in the Bible to save us all!   It is not a revelation. The bible is full of things that are not true. What the bible says is not the best thing to go off of. A religion is the best way to believe that things are true and worth believing. A man can say he was raised by wolves because he believed the bible. It wouldn't make a whole lot of difference if he was.   the book is written in a way to appeal to the Christian community and it is the first book by an agnostic that gives me hope   Well the first half of the book isn't all that bad. I found it interesting how she explains things in different ways. Some are less interesting than others, but that's the price you pay for giving people more information than they
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " I love to read, but there was so much bad information that I just couldn't read it." The book is written in a very academic and scholarly manner. I know this may be a hard pill for most to swallow. After all, why would you ever read an academic book about sex? And yet, in the interest of science and research, I am going to share the facts here and try to dispel some of the myths that are being propagated by the pro-sex (or anti-sex, depending on the perspective) movement in general and by anti-choice activists in particular. It's really all about the biology of attraction. First, it's important to understand what it is that makes people sexually attracted to one another. The sexual response cycle is a series of physiological and psychological responses that are produced by hormones that are released in the brain that are important for regulating the body's reproductive functions. The primary hormone is called androgens. The female is most responsive to testosterone, which is the most effective way to manipulate a sexual response in the female, and the male is most likely to respond to estrogen, which causes the most dramatic physiological response. When men have sex, they release natural androgens (e.g., testosterone), and their sexual response is stimulated. They also secrete natural progesterone and estrogen, both of which have significant physiological effects on their female sexual response. Since these natural hormones are the same as what the human body naturally produces, they function in the same manner. However, the natural androgen, testosterone, is less likely to stimulate a response in a woman because the brain has a hard time processing the high levels of testosterone produced by a man's body (this is known as "compression of the nervous system"). This makes a man less likely for women to respond, which leads to lower rates of conception. So basically, men release natural sex hormones that cause their bodies to produce a high level of androgens, which then causes the brain to release natural progestins that decrease the response to testosterone. Androgens can also be released from the female body, but their response to these hormones is far lower than a man is likely to have, and these hormones are less likely than androgens to stimulate an aroused response in women. These physiological responses to androgens are not a reflection on a man or a woman. It's just how nature intended them to be when it comes to the body and the brain. I
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The end result is the most disappointing thing I've ever experienced in any book I've read. It's just so poorly written and told. No point is ever made at all; there are no consequences, it's just a list of things that happened which they've got wrong (such as how the characters met, and who didn't get along with each other etc.)   The author also says in a "back of the book note" that there's a short story (about a week's time) which will explain things, but it's nothing of note at all. I mean, that's why I gave it 4 stars. I'm sure if I read the book first I could have enjoyed it a lot more."   Read at   A novel with great potential, it falls short in every way.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________   The Book:   I was given the first of this trilogy, and I can honestly say I'm not excited by it one bit. There's no suspense, there's no tension. It's dull. It can be boring at times, and there is very little action, with some sections going on for quite a while without even a single fight.   To be fair, it is supposed to be that kind of series - The Empire Strikes Back to the Star Wars movies - with the main plot being something that is very different from that. However, it doesn't quite come across that way - there is nothing special about it.   and it really doesn't do much to change the plot of the book.  What it does is just keep the main characters going, but at the same time gives them very little story to do.  . -  "It has always been you, she said. For a long time, it had seemed like an inevitability. Then the Empire came knocking, a small, nameless man arrived on the scene, a stranger in her own palace. A foreigner." -  And it never does anything to change this, and it's a pretty typical example of what can happen.  , she says. A foreigner. A stranger in  It has long been the case that there are those who know more about the world than it does, and those who don't. And that knowledge is often what will lead to the downfall of the people who hold it.But this book's plot was not only boring, it's also incredibly inconsistent.It is very clear from the first sentence that the book is about a man who has no desire to rule, but is forced to do so - by someone or something. I mean, he could just as easily have been a girl who had no desire for to rule but was forced to, or a guy who has never wanted to rule because he's a pacifist.But the book doesn't follow that logic. Instead, the main character, a woman named Jax, and her husband have been having a tough time of it for quite some time, both financially and psychologically. The family is just scraping by on what little they have left - not that they have much of it, as they are basically an impoverished farm family.And then the book's main character appears. And her name is Mandy, and she is absolutely wonderful. And it's not really
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read the first two chapters but don't really want to keep on reading this.  I'm really disappointed that these characters don't have personalities.  There's really no sense of drama in it either.  It would have been better if they had written in the way a normal person would write it.  The only character that has any sense of realism is a cop but he is a complete asshole.  This is a book for young adults, and I'm going to be honest and say I had no clue about drugs or sex.   I think they have really over-thought this book.    Rating: 3 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like this book at all. It is just so confusing and boring, and really not the type of book I would read. The narrator is horrible. I mean, it's a really bad narrator! I would have been better off listening to a recording. Maybe I could have picked up some of the stories, but I think I'd just be confused and bored for hours at a time.  I do not know what the author was thinking when she wrote this book.  I do not like it because the book is so confusing. I have a hard time following the story. The characters don't seem to be able to get to the important parts. It really frustrates me, especially when the author tries to explain to the reader what the importance of certain events are in the story, but doesn't actually go into much detail about what is important. It was really hard for me to read, and I was so frustrated with the poor narration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a child. I really didn't like it, but I remember reading it and getting a little excited. I never finished it. I read another "graphic novel" about the same story that is just terrible. I don't think there is anything positive in this book at all. If you read this you will hate it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A novel is like a movie. You know the movie or the book so well that when the movie is a bad one, you have no reaction, but the novel can be awful and you are always in disbelief that the author made it this bad.  I have read about 50 of these and every one of them is the worst book I've ever read, and all of them are by the same author, because that is the author's style. He is so self-involved and doesn't care about his characters or the story.   So many times I got to the end of a chapter only to find out that he had completely changed his mind or did not believe in the plot, then he just started another chapter without a doubt, just like the first one.  Why would anyone like reading such a story?   I had no motivation to read this book, I found it so dull and the only interesting thing in this book was the description of the house.  For my taste, I prefer to read fiction than non-fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a compilation of over 20 articles written by a retired American marine officer who is a renowned expert on the Vietnam war. I was intrigued by his writing. He's a very entertaining and engaging speaker and author. I especially liked the "Inconsequential" section of the book. It helped me realize that the war was not just a horrible event, but it was also the catalyst for many other issues, including our current economic and social climate. The author also uses the Vietnam War as an example of the United States military's use of propaganda, which made him seem really authentic and like he knew what he was talking about. He has a way of speaking that just seemed so real. The military would probably not approve.   Overall, I did enjoy this book. I think that it could be very useful for both students and general readers.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book isn't that good. I was given the idea to use this method of reading when I was a kid and I tried it out. I learned a lot. The technique works well. I liked the fact that I didn't have to keep looking over my shoulder for notes because the book itself did all the work. However, it is still hard to read on a plane ride. If you read it to be read, you can read it on the plane. But if you read this for the notes, it won't be that good...   The book is written for an adult audience. If anyone is thinking about getting a Kindle or a Paperwhite, then this book will be a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________  What is the book? It's just a collection of the most horrific and horrific things in history that ever happened. That's about it. In fact the author goes out of his way to try to make it seem as though Hitler was some kind of benevolent dictator. The only person who ever killed more people in history was Hitler and he was really just a tyrant who didn't care that much for his people. That being said there were a number of horrible and brutal dictators who had their own problems but no one is trying to pretend that Hitler is perfect. The book basically covers the time period from 1917 to 1933 and includes the killing of Jews, gays, blacks, gypsies, and even communists. To me Hitler sounds like the evil step brother of other fascist dictators like Mussolini or Franco who are also just people who didn`t give a shit about their people but were more concerned with their own power and were more than willing to kill people. This book is really very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I enjoyed this book and thought it was very well written. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit too predictable and that was a little too frustrating for me. It seemed as if I was just left hanging on a cliff hanger and was left to wonder what would happen next. Overall, not a bad read, just a tad disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is all too common, it's about the father, who is a violent abuser who has had an affair, and now has a child out of wedlock.   I found it very interesting that the father was caught and now his child is an adult, he may be on the road to some anger issues as a result of the affair.  In conclusion, the father is violent and the mother a drunk. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I read a copy of this book back in the late 80s and loved it. Then I started reading it again some years ago, and was even more sucked into it, to the point where I gave up on reading. But then I reread it again, and this time the story and the writing were actually good. Then recently I was contacted by the author and he kindly allowed me to review this book. It wasn't so bad, and I'm glad that I re-read it. But as the book is about a little girl who is in the hospital for a couple of days, I was a little surprised at how it was done. I didn't like the story about the father and daughter. However, the end of the book was great!      Overall:  5/5 Stars for: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I liked the first few chapters, but once I found out how many of these problems they had, I stopped reading. The plot is predictable and repetitive, and the characters (especially the kids) are the same as in most books I've read, with the most important change being that the little one has more of a personality than the older one. I would have thought that this kind of problem would be obvious in the first chapters, and not have to have a long explanation about it. The main character is a girl with a very small personality, and there is no development in her. The writing style is cliche, too, and she constantly switches between her older and younger self in chapters, while not really making a difference between them in the beginning. I know the author is a fan of this kind, and that she is writing it for young readers, but I do not think she could have had such problems writing a story about a girl (I am 16 myself) with a personality like mine. I do hope that this novel will be a long-term story of development, and it has already become interesting enough to read, but with no real development to begin with. I hope it will turn out better than the other books by the same author (like "E.P.C".) Rating: 1 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read many good books, but this one was the worst.  Some of the chapters were very short and I found the plot and characters to be very weak.  I had to pause this book several times just to make sure that I was reading the original version of the story.    I found that there was a lot of editing in this book to make it more palatable for a mainstream audience.  In addition, it seems that many of the changes were done by a book-devotee who doesn't know anything about the original story and is trying to make a little profit by using the name of the author and some of the material.  Recommendation:  I would not recommend this book at all.  It is poorly written and has an unpleasant story, as well as some typos that are very annoying.  My copy had lots of editing that made it less bad, but I still do not recommend it.  If you like the first book, do yourself a favor and get the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I'm writing a book and i decided to give it to a family member. they took it home and it got thrown on the floor. now they are on the phone to the librarian and they said no problem they will look at it. then the librarians said it is a good book but it doesn't have my name on it. I will not buy a book from them again  Write a positive review about an excellent book: ----------------------------- An excellent book with a wonderful story. The author has created a world rich with detail and meaning. A very thoughtful story that will keep you thinking. The illustrations are also wonderful. I especially like the way the story is told in a variety of settings. From a bustling city square, to a lonely town on the edge of nowhere, to an old-fashioned house on the outskirts of the town, the world is presented with beauty and richness. A wonderful read for all ages!  Read an excellent review of The White Queen and write a positive rating about the book: ---------------------------------------- It's wonderful and I am very happy. It is easy to read and I loved it!  on another occasion I was having a bad day at work and I needed a good read so I looked online and saw The White Rose and decided to pick it up. I have to admit I was a little put off at first because I have read a lot of bad stories and have a very hard time believing they are real. But once I read this and I started reading the story, it was all good. It was not my favorite story in the whole series, but it was certainly a story I'll keep coming back to and telling people about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been planning to buy this book for a while because I liked the style and the quality. So I was thrilled to read this and find out that there is no good writing and that it is a poor book. I will not waste my time again.   Helpful tips  - I would recommend this book to people who love to read or are looking for a book that is short and does not bore them.   The author's style is really cool and unique, which is a great selling point for this kind of work.  However, this book will not satisfy you in any of the respects listed above. There are several things I wish this author would have done differently in order to get better results in this book.  - He has a long, dense prologue in which he presents his story line and introduces the main characters in an interesting and engaging way. This is a good idea but it seems that the author took more time to explain the background of the different characters than to write about the main story. , and there are no details in this chapter that are not covered elsewhere in the book. You get the impression that the story was only written so that it could be presented to his readers. The chapter is a waste of time.  for a start the author has to deal with the character who is most responsible for his failure. In other books I have read this person was an antagonist but in this case he was the main character.  There are many things I wished this author had done differently:   - He could have developed his main character's character better, which would have made the author's writing more interesting.  with a bit of effort he could have made his character as strong as it should be.   - The author could have better explained why the main villain was so hated by the world. . There were many things that annoyed me about this book so I have tried to do my best to highlight the main problems. However, even though I have focused on the more serious problems the book is still good, and the main selling points that I have mentioned should not be discounted. That said, I would not recommend this to anyone who really wanted to read a book about magic and fantasy but is just not up for a difficult and detailed story that will take several volumes to get through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really like this book. There are a number of issues that I have with the book. I felt that it was too repetitive, it was repetitive as a story, and too much focused on the character of the villain. It made me realize why this book didn't get a wide release, because it is very repetitious and boring. The story line that started with the story of the protagonist, and the villains are not interesting, and you could see how these guys would be in many other books by this author. There were many plot points that were explained in very few paragraphs. There was so much that could have been expanded, but I think it could have easily been condensed to make it more digestible. This book did have the potential, but as is it was very much "meh". I don't think I will be re-reading this book after I finish this review. I am sure I will enjoy the next book that this author writes, but for now I just think it is a bad story with no real twists.   Overall: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************   What a waste of time. I read this to prepare for the CFA level exams. I was disappointed in every aspect.   I read this in 1-2 days.  I spent more time working on the test than the book.  the writing was the worst I've seen.   a bunch of people got good results so I'm not surprised, but how many people would even think to check a writing sample like this out for themselves.   in the end, I would not recommend this book to anyone.  , September 3, 2016   This is the worst book I have ever read. I have to give it a 0 for 1) poor writing, 2) a waste the time and 3) a very, very low overall score.   The author does not do very good on the writing aspect. I don't know why the author wanted to make this into a book but he really doesn't do anything to convince me to read it.  ...   In my opinion the author failed to do what I think a good author should. I can't figure out how he wrote this book. First he wrote the following:   "The way to learn about financial planning is to go through a series of very specific steps and then a set of very strict rules. The book is a guide to doing this."   but in the second paragraph he then said:   for example,   There is a lot of very well written information in the book, and a lot is true and useful, but most of it is scattered throughout chapters and is not useful to any single person. There is only one chapter on asset allocation, and the amount of information it contains is staggering. There are countless ways to achieve a given asset allocation. And there are probably as many books on asset-allocation strategies. And each time I tried to follow it, I got lost.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad read. This was an experiment for me. It is a book that I am ashamed of and if I hadn't read it I wouldn't know that this was a book. It's bad and makes you feel like a monster. I didn't like it and I'm not going to read it again.   The reason this book is bad is because it is full of lies. It starts off with the main character trying to get out of being in a hospital. What he ends up doing is taking a drug to let him fall asleep and it makes him dream he has sex with the nurse who is supposed to be taking care of him. Then he wakes up and is in the hospital with the other inmates. Then the nurses are having sex with each other. Then this book gets worse and worse and you wonder why you even read it. I just didn't find it interesting enough to finish it.  's narration is boring and unrealistic. He sounds like he is reading to himself from a book, which is very odd since he is supposedly a psychiatrist, and he says the "stories" he tells about the inmates have to be true or else the patients will not be able to sleep. This is very weird since he goes back and forth between narrating and talking to his patients and not using any other narrators.  . I hate to admit that the only reason why I read this book was because I saw the movie and wanted to see how that story would turn out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. After reading several reviews I was sure it would be good, however, I was disappointed. The story didn't interest me, as it seemed the author had written the book to be an easy read, or a quick read. In the end, it didn't click for me, and it was too long to stay focused for the time I read it. I didn't understand anything in this book, the characters were flat, and the plot didn't go anywhere. I don't recommend this book to anyone, as I think it's bad, but I will read it again. I will not be returning to this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to my friend and we both enjoyed it. The characters were interesting, and I felt like they all had a different way of looking at things. That being said I can't say that I was really interested in the plot. The story didn't interest me, but it was the story that kept me reading. In the end, I gave it 2 stars for the writing, and the characters. Overall, I'll probably pass on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ ____________________________________________ I read this book in college and it was one of the first works of science fiction I ever read. I had a lot of trouble enjoying it at first but when it was over I was absolutely smitten. This book takes place in the year 2430, just after the Earth's end has been foretold in a number of books. The book begins when a group of survivors from Earth arrive on the planet, Earth 2. A group of humans, known as the New Warriors, are sent to protect the Earth from the aliens. The only problem is, the aliens are out to wipe the humans out, and the humans must fight back. They call themselves the New Warrior. I won't give away what happens next in this book but this is a book about fighting to survive and survive well. This is a very unique book that will appeal to most sci fi fans, and those who enjoy great characters. This will appeal especially to readers who like great stories, strong writing, and a great sense of world building. The characters are very real, and I found myself liking them a lot as I read. The world building was amazing and felt like a real place that was almost more realistic than the Earth that I know today. The aliens that the humans are fighting against, are also very real and they feel a lot more real than the humans do. The Earth 2 is an interesting place to live, and as this book took place over two years in the future I knew that this was a place that we would all be living on a lot longer than two years. The ending was not perfect and I don't want it to be either. It was a little too abrupt, but for the most part the book worked well. It takes a long time for the people to fully understand what is going on with the aliens and I felt that the book needed to be more thorough before this was solved. But overall this was an excellent book that I would recommend to any sci fi fan, and this would also appeal to those who prefer great characters over great world building and a story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________   This book sucks.   It's over 600 pages long, and you can hardly believe you're reading an adult book in English. The writing style is clunky, and there are multiple grammar errors throughout the book (aside from that one one scene when the author actually uses the wrong form of the past tense!).   I actually found it really hard to take this book seriously. As I said above, the story is so terrible that I could barely care about anything that was happening. I don't remember many details about what happened, except the main character's name, so I can't say I really liked the main female character at all. I'd probably say the same about the male characters, too, except for the other main character.   the author tries to explain everything in detail, but there's too much going on in this book for that to work. So I'd say try to find some other ways to pass the time...   Overall, I gave it three stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I picked up this book I was not expecting much but what I got was a boring story about some really ugly and unpleasant people (all in a very stereotypical British way) that seemed to have little or nothing to do with the world outside the book. I never felt the need to read the other books in the series and it took me way too long to get through this one. In fact I went back and reread the first book in this series because this was the worst of the bunch. It was more about some characters from that series that didn't even get that much mention, and it was more pointless than enjoyable.   I'm only about two thirds through this book now and it is still not all that bad but I've now read two of the books in this trilogy and I'm not looking forward to going through these ones any longer.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- It is a hard book to review. The author tries to write an interesting story with good science, but fails in doing it. The story starts with a bad guy who steals nuclear material and uses it to make a small nuke to bomb a town, but the book fails in making the story interesting and in making it believable. The evil scientist has some of the best dialogue, but also has the worst writing. The book also tries to tell the story of a town in which all of the population have died and only two people are left. I liked the story and the good scientific explanation, but it failed in giving it some life. I also liked the evil scientist, but that was not enough. I wanted to know what happened to them. They could have been the main characters in the story. I hope this book is better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was an interesting read. I was curious about a certain type of person. I read this book in part because of an article that I had read online. I don't think that I was the first to read this kind of blog and the article was good. It gave me an idea to look into other things. In my search for other people that I could talk to about how I had come to understand a lot of things and see a lot about me, I came across this blog and it was good to hear from someone who did research and could help me see things that I hadn't noticed. In short, this book was interesting and useful. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the topic that I read about, what it's like to be a child of a single mom, why there are certain reasons you may be interested in having kids, why you might choose not to have children.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a bit taken back by how the story kept changing and changing and going from a plot to plot. After 50 pages or so, it was still not clear what the "true" ending was. This is a good book for children, but it should definitely be read by adults. - November 2, 2005Why did I buy it?

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The final part of the trilogy (Book 5) was so-so and it didn't have a lot of potential. The author's tone was also very, very dark at times and the ending is rather abrupt."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never loved a book so much and loathed a book as I did this one. The writing is so bad that it is hard to say what the plot was.   The narrator was so bad. I remember thinking, "Is this the best that the author could do??"   I will not buy any more books from this author. She is an amateur.  25 of 28 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ I read this book, it is not good, because it is very bad. First of all this book was the reason for me to be a bad person because I could not like the book because of the bad book I read. This book is one of the worst I have read in my life, there is no grammar, no grammar or any english at all. There is no plot or any real plot because it just has a girl who is a cat and she is not a good person and there is just no story to it. The main character is a girl named Kim who is going to do something bad and she thinks that her cat friend is going too. But you just never know what she is going do, it's just not a fun read. There are no words in this book because I think she made this book without them. I mean it is just weird without any words. Also there are no pictures or any pictures at all, it just makes it weird, because the only thing the readers can see is their screens or it's pages. Also this book is also the reason why I will never read any books by this author, because she is too horrible to read, too bad, I will not read her anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is awful, it is so much worse than the original movie.   I was hoping that they would be a little more truthful with the stories, but they really are just recycled story lines from the first movie.   The only good thing about this book is that you can't go back and re watch the movie and compare the two, which is a nice bonus!   There is only one other story line that is in the book that I didn't like, which was the one where the main character got a new job as a waitress and had to work with the same customers over and over again.  Overall:  This book was so bad I had to read it twice just to understand what was going on.  I will say that you do not get a really interesting story line in this book, but it is not like there was nothing else to the story.  The story of the little girl from the original book is pretty great and she gets a new friend in the story that she could not have had in the first book.  They have to do work to keep the store and the owner has a hard time hiring people because of their terrible performance in the previous job. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** *This book sucked me in and kept me reading*   Story: The plot is an odd duck and at first. I was confused as to what was going on, but a lot of info was given and as a long time fan of the show I knew it was going to be good. But then the plot got even weirder. I mean, I knew there was no chance that Jack was going die but this still threw me. If there was a chance that his life was going off the rails then it was worth it to see it.   Character: Jack was a great character, the book did a great job of bringing him alive. His back story was well told. He has no memory of who he was, what he has been doing. He was just a guy who lived his life in the desert. There were times where it felt like it was not Jack's life anymore but the plot, and I am not the one to say this. But a lot was left to be desired in this aspect. Jack was just another dude on the show and nothing more. I wanted to find out more about him. I loved how this book was a throwback to the book The Sandman by Neil Gaiman and how Gaiman was not afraid to go back to the old source material and change it. Gaiman did a lot with The Sandmen in the early 2000's. The Sandworms were the big focus and it is one of my favorite stories in that series.   the one problem I had was with how the main character was changed. Originally he was going by the name of The King of Hearts, which made me think he was a warrior. He fought against the vampires on the streets. It made him like the king of heart's and what he wanted. I liked how the character was created in the book. When we meet him he is still just a dude from the desert, I really liked that. It was refreshing to me.  ....

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The worst book I've read in a very long time. It made me want to throw up after finishing it. It makes you feel like the author is out to get you. There are no characters and no story. It's so boring! It's just about a girl trying to convince the boys in her class that the things she writes are true. It was really horrible."   I was honestly hoping this book would give me an alternative way to tell stories that didn't have any romance or suspense. I was so shocked to realize that this book is a pure disaster. There is so little in this book that actually gets me excited. The prose is so flat and monotone that I had to reread passages several times just to see if my thoughts had changed or not. The entire book is just a collection of observations, theories, and theories. The way this book works is that one of the boys wants to tell everyone about the stories of the girls in his class, and so the story that the girls have written up about their lives is given to the boys so they can tell everybody else what they have to say. I don't even know how this book could have been different. It reads like a textbook. The author can't seem to write stories with suspense, drama, or excitement. They just have these flat observations, endless theories, endless explanations, and then the "excuse" that they have some sort of secret relationship to the girls. The characters are so unlikable and unlikeable that the only characters I really cared about were the boys. I would hate to have to read their books, because the only character I really really liked in this novel was this boy. I did like the way he told the story, but there were so many things about the way the book was written that made me cringe and want to turn the page faster than a teenager could turn a page without accidentally falling over a chair and breaking my eye.   This book doesn't even seem like a novel. I think the author was thinking about the kind of books that other kids read when she was writing it. And the way she writes stories so obviously does not belong in the book world.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* *********** If there is a single quality that makes a good book a great book, it's the fact that no matter how great or terrible the author's writing is, readers enjoy it. There is something about this kind of book that makes me want to go read the first few pages again and again. This was soooo close to being the book for me. I didn't like it though, and now I'll probably never read it, but still, I feel like it could have been. I feel so sorry for people who have to be stuck with a book like this. I had no idea what was going on and it took me forever to figure out what it was about. I think it would have been more enjoyable if it just started right away with the main character and explained what happened. I would have understood what happened better and enjoyed it more. Maybe it was just my bad luck. Maybe a lot of people will like this book and read it. I don't know. I'd love to give it a chance though, it was an interesting premise. It was a good idea but it just didn't work out. I thought I would be mad, but I kind of like it. It would have had more potential if it was a little bit more coherent. I'm sure people will find the first chapters of the book confusing, but then they will figure it out after about the tenth chapter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters are very cliché and predictable, although I could see the potential for some great twists. I got the idea that they were some sort of secret society, or some kind of cult, but it didn't work for me. The writing was pretty dry and cliche. Also, I don't like the way you wrote the characters (except for the ones who are super cool).  I just finished this novel and I didn't really like it much. I mean, I liked a few things, but they weren't very memorable. The story was good, but the characters weren't that much. The characters were very cliche and predictable. I liked how the characters would do their thing. There was a lot of action and a lot going on. But, that's not really my type of book. Overall, I'd give this book a 3.75/5.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book sucks! I liked the premise of this book but the story and the plot was all wrong. The protagonist was never going to find his way back to the girl he left behind. It was like the main character never changed from where he was on the first night. It all just felt weird to read. I could understand why he thought he was the only one who could find her. What I did not understand is why he would get back together with the girl if he really wanted to. I was actually disappointed when the story ended.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   I loved the story and the characters. I was glad the author had a happy ending, and I think the ending was satisfactory.   A couple of things kept me from being a full-fledged fan. The first thing was the way the characters had their names changed. There's nothing wrong with having a different name or something that makes one think a name change was necessary. I just don't think the author thought it would be a good idea to put in the names, then come out with a second book that's about two years later and still has the same names.  .  The second thing is the spelling of some of the names. The books was written in the 1980's. I'm sure there were more than a few readers who were raised in the 1950's and 1960's. This book was written when everyone spelled everything the same way, and people just assumed that everybody did. It would have been nice to see how the author would have spelled different names to help with the reader not having to be familiar with every single spelling and word in the books.   of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst in my library. It has some nice ideas, but they are so poorly explained and implemented, it's hard to know where to start, where to stop reading.   The story, which takes place in some sort of alternative universe, deals with the idea of a person who comes to life, only to find out that they no longer exist. It starts off ok, with the protagonist, but by the end of the book, it doesn't even seem as if the book is trying to show the protagonist's life. I feel that this book would work better if it were a standalone, but the author's name is already on it, so I can't complain about that. It's worth mentioning that the main character's name IS THE BOOK'S TITLE.  's main idea is that a person goes to a very high place and returns, only for no one to know who they are, or even that they have left. There are many things wrong with this premise:   1. You could come back to life and nobody would be the wiser.  2. No one would recognize you, even if they knew your name.  the protagonist just ends up walking around in a forest like a ghost, talking to no one, and talking to himself. - The protagonist thinks he is dead, but no one else seems to be aware of this. He knows that the world knows about him, but never once does anyone ever mention his name.   - The author doesn't give the reader much information about the world the protagonist comes from, he just jumps between the perspectives, and the way they relate to each other is never really explained. The protagonist ends up talking to the people of his world in a way that makes no sense, and I felt like he was speaking in a dialect, not to mention the fact that the protagonist speaks in a peculiar accent (which I didn't realize until I read about it a few pages later)   - One thing that I found really disturbing was that the only thing I knew about the main protagonist's world is that it was a very dark and mysterious one. This is even worse than the last book, where I just assumed the protagonists life had ended. Not only that, but I found it quite sad that no one seems to know about the protagonist.   the world-building isn't much better, as there are so many details that I could tell you about, but none of
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********  This book is awful. It has zero redeeming qualities and if you have read any of his prior works then you know what to expect. It's so bad, I read it twice, once in print and once on Kindle and I felt compelled to write a negative reviewer because I felt so bad for what this author is attempting to do.   It's a mix of the supernatural, horror, sci fi and adventure. There are a few fantasy elements but for the most part it's just some really boring writing that makes you feel like you're reading the plot of a boring bad book. I really couldn't understand how this book came out as being published by this publisher.  .   and I mean that in a good way, since it's not good at all. The ending is extremely unsatisfying and I honestly felt like I was robbed of some great potential and story lines.   - this book is a total dumpster fire. -   There are a couple of moments of potential. I could definitely see how the protagonist, who's been locked in an ice castle for thousands of years, might be able to manipulate his surroundings somehow to save himself from the dangers surrounding him, but I just don't think he'll do it because he's so stubborn. His personality would probably be similar to a cat - he just wouldn't care at all about anything except his own desire. He's also pretty useless, so why is he locked in ice? Maybe it's a magical, frozen castle that's just too difficult to leave, but whatever it is, it's too hard to climb out.  : I feel like this book was trying to do too much, so I didn't like the ending much. ********-This book had nothing going for it. First off, it has an ending that is more of an ending than a beginning. It doesn't begin until after the protagonist has been locked away in an eternal ice castle. It also didn't really explain what was going on with him or why he was locked up. I think it was a shame since there was so much potential there, but it just didn't work out that well for me. I did get some laughs, but they were really forced and unnecessary.And I hate this ending. Why didn't the author show us a character falling into the ice hole? Wouldn't it be cool to know that there's someone who could break the ice castle's hold on him and free him? No! He
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________ (This review is from: The House of Dark Shadows) I don't know why, but I found myself really enjoying this book, because it felt like it was written by someone who really understood the themes of the story, and wanted to give a very satisfying ending to the saga.  I really thought the final act was awesome, and it even had a pretty interesting plotline that I liked.  However, it is pretty clear that the author doesn't really understand the genre, and in my opinion, didn't really get the theme of the novel that she wanted to convey.  It could have been done better, but what's the point if it isn't finished?  If you like fantasy, it's a good book, but it wasn't really what I thought it was going to be.  _______________________________________________ (This Review is from The House Of Dark Shadows): In any case, I found this to be an awesome book. I can't even put it on to explain the magic system - it's so well written, so well thought out and the author clearly put tons of thought into this. The book is set in a world that is in a lot of ways very familiar (for most fantasy authors) and also quite different - like it's got magic, a lot more than most fantasy, but also a lot less than most modern fantasy. The story is also set in the year 1636, which is also in the middle of the French Revolution, but because of some weirdness that goes on, it ends a few years before. There is also a twist ending, which I found somewhat satisfying. I really enjoyed reading this book. The main character, Cully, is a pretty strong and likable character. I also liked how Cully was introduced and then grew throughout the novel. There are also some interesting twists that Cully finds himself in with the help of some very interesting characters and a few interesting plots. I thought the book ended on an awesome note and was a great book. ________________________________________________________ (This interview is from "The House of the Dragon": http://dragonmagazine.com/articles/thedragon/theshows/cully_the_wicked.html ) This is the second in a series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very poor example of "realism" because it does not offer any real insight as to how to make money. The book is written in a very vague fashion to the point where you can make a whole bunch of conclusions about what will happen without any actual knowledge. The main character is a fraud and the whole book is just a series of con games. My only complaint would be the description of how they "build up" their trust and that he is "unorthodox".
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I liked the book, I just couldn't stand the fact that she had to go back in time to prevent an atrocity. --------------   Overall:   When I originally saw the title, I immediately thought "What? A young adult novel? I've read more fantasy, so this is pretty new to me." Well, yes it is. That said, I didn't like this book very much. I've only read a handful of YA novels, and most of them were quite good, so the first two books on my "don't read this unless you've read at least a handful" list. This one just wasn't for me.   I liked the main character, I felt bad for the heroine, and I liked how the book was fast-paced and had action. I didn-t particularly enjoy the "back in time" part of the story, and in fact, I think it was a bit confusing. I also didn't really understand how the author intended to get back in, and why she didn't simply teleport there.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - September 6, 2008If the story had a little bit more character depth, it would have been great. This book didn't even make my top ten to read. I have a very low tolerance for boring and poorly written books. I didn't understand why the character was so important, it just seemed so irrelevant in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- Just finished the first book in a series about the murder of a small boy on the island of Horseshoe Island. I just wish I could have found this book earlier. This is a terrible book to read, and I think the author needs help in the future. It is very easy to tell that this book was written by a first-time author. There are so many things that are wrong, and it really makes the book hard to read. When I finished the book, I was just sick and tired of the book. I'm going to give this book 1 star, because it really just makes you wish you would have read it earlier.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think that this book has no story at all. This book is not about the main character at all and the story is not even about the world at all but about the characters in it. This is not a good book, I'm sorry to say but you need to get a different book, just get something else. The author doesn't even seem to understand what the main point of the book is. I was actually disappointed in the book because the world that he made is just...weird, I mean it is a fantasy world but the world has many things that you find in a real life. But to not even think about making the main characters the characters of the story at least would have made it better. I just could not find the book that i was looking for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little wary of this book at first, because I found it so disjointed. When I actually read it, however, the book's strengths shine through. I enjoyed the writing, especially the characters, especially those of the book. The worldbuilding was interesting, and I liked how the characters' interactions with each other made it feel like there was a real life to the book and not just a book that exists in someone's head. I was also a little shocked by how quickly this book ended. I didn't think I'd be reading another book with characters named after the "sins of the Father" which were the two main antagonists. The ending was abrupt and, unfortunately, not satisfying. It felt like a "one-size-fits-all" book, and that's not really what I'm looking for. Still, I do highly recommend this book, especially to fans of D.P. Morgan and the works of Stephen King.   "No one had ever told him how much he was hurting. He just didn't care." -Karen  This is a review of the third book in the D. Paul Morgan series. The title of this third book refers to an incident in which a young boy in rural Maine had been molested by his father, and the book covers the events that followed. I first read the previous book in this series, The Boy with One Red Shoe, in 1993, and enjoyed it so much that I bought the paperback copy of The Man in the White Coat a couple of years later, thinking it would be just as good. The first two books in the series were written for young children, and while the third is for older readers, it still contains several descriptions of sexual content that are not suitable for young kids, and in some cases have sexual references in the title. The following review is written for anyone who has read any of the previous books in this set, or just wants to have a more complete understanding of this story. I highly recommend reading The Boy in the Tower as a stand-alone book if you are interested in reading more about this story, though I am not sure how much of this second book you'll be able to finish before it ends. I read the synopsis for this book on the back of the hardback book, but since it's a prequel to the previous three books, I won't be quoting the book synopsis here.  The first sentence of the pre
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********This is my first review so I apologize for that! I purchased this on sale for less than 20 bucks. I went to bed and this was the only thing I was doing. I tried reading the book to see if it would be any good. I had to take a break and get some food because I was so hungry. I got home the next day and found it to be very frustrating. The story was so boring and the characters were all the same. The book is called 'Love Your Neighbor' and the person's name was Susan. I found the character to be really annoying. She was rude to the other people in the house and I felt like I was being pushed around. I feel she should have just stayed in the room and stayed quiet. At the end I didn't like her and was glad I didn?t spend more money. I could only think that she was a bad neighbor. (Posted on 1/29/14)  I found the book: ***I found this book in a used bookstore in the late 80s or early 90s and loved it. It was part of a series by Elizabeth Stone (yes, she was also a woman, which is a rarity in the romance genre.) She wrote about a young man and his love interest who live with their parents in a tiny house and try to avoid making any noise. They live in a world where nobody bothers them, people just want to go home, and nobody bothers to call them. The boy is an adult with a hard job and a young wife. She is a teenager with dreams of getting into medical school. The series covers the three of them, so it includes many character names, but the stories were short and were about just the three. There was no love triangle, just a loving couple trying to live together in this small town. The love triangle is really a myth because Elizabeth Stone does not seem to believe in the myth. The woman is a good person. The guy is a bad one but is trying to make up for it. They are all living in a small town, but I think this is the setting because I read a comment in the back of the book that they had moved away from it many years ago. I can't say what it was, but it did not seem that small. Elizabeth Stone writes very well and the stories are good. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because Elizabeth was kind of mean to the boys, I felt sorry for
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What would make me give this book four stars instead of three? Well, the characterizations in this book are spot on. While the book is about the death of his son, John, the main character of this story is actually a very well crafted one, I'm very much enjoying his development as a person, not to mention his development of his personality as a result of the loss of his child. That's pretty much it, but I've got more to say about him, and it's probably something I should talk about later... So, I just want to add my two cents. This is one of the best books I have read, period. Not only that, but the writing was amazing! As in the characters, I really liked the characters of this book, especially as far as the main characters and their development is concerned. They were well developed, well written, and had a very personal development for their character.The setting of the book was absolutely fantastic, and the main events took place in an absolutely beautiful setting. I've said it in other reviews, but there is something about the characters and the setting of this novel that are incredibly beautiful to me. And for a fantasy novel, it was totally believable and believable in such a way.I also had a lot of fun reading this novel. The writing and characterizations were very good, and there was no real drag to the story as a whole. I had a blast reading this. I will definitely recommend this book to all readers! :P
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  I'm very disappointed in this book.   I know you are writing to give advice to others in similar circumstances, but for some reason, it didn't really work. First of all, I can't read the "reviews" posted by other people. There were no such reviews on this particular book, just a few random reviews at Amazon. So this was a complete waste of money and time, and I didn't feel any different than I did about all the other books I've read about living with MS.   a great deal of the advice I got was about having the confidence in yourself and in what you are doing, and then, of course, having faith that it will work. However, I have never had such little confidence in my MS. So even if the ideas in the book are good, I'm sure they won't make up for the fact that my MS is not doing what it was supposed to be doing.   the one thing I did take away from this book is that I think it would be helpful if we all could be more "self-critical" when it comes to things that don't seem to go right. I was extremely disappointed in how many times I didn`t even feel I had tried everything I could think of, and the author doesn't seem at all convinced that the problem is her, or even that it's MS. Maybe it is, but my guess is that it might just be something else.   is this book really a "must have" for MS sufferers or is it just another piece of "doctors' advice"?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed to find this book. It's terrible. It should never have been published. I don't read fantasy or science fiction, but I did buy it based on the reviews and it didn't do it for me. It was just bad. It has been hard to put down.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________I did not read the whole of this book before writing this review. I got through about 4/5ths of it before it was a no go, so I have no idea how much of this is true. What I DO know is that this book is an absolutely BULLSHIT BOOK and I wish I could have found out about it sooner.The author (Alfred, not sure what his name was, but I am pretty sure he is an idiot) tells a story about a young man named Ben who is the youngest brother of one of the major characters in this story. This man's name is Frank and he is the President of the United States of America. He is a rich and successful man who is also a devout Christian. His religion is called "Christianity" and is the religion that has allowed him to build an incredibly high-tech empire. He lives in a gigantic mansion, and the entire town revolves around him, with cars running on electricity and his son being trained as a hero to be his successor. But this all changes when Ben and his brother start to get closer, and Frank realizes that Ben is not going to be able to protect him forever. So he kills his brother and gets rid of his power. He goes off to live the rest of his life in peace and quiet in his mansion. But there is one problem. Ben and Frank are both Christians. And Frank is a complete idiot for not realizing this. He's so stupid that he doesn't realize that Ben was going to find out he was dead.So Ben is on his way to America to visit his old high school to get some information on a project that he's going to do as a sophomore in college. However, Ben has a secret that he didn't tell his brother about, one that would be very beneficial to the entire U.S.A. (he will tell it later on). And Ben's secret, and his love for Frank, are two of the biggest things he needs in his life. But Ben can't tell Frank. This is the book's real problem. It is an action packed book, full of violence and gore, but it doesn't know how to do anything else. It does not feel like it needs to. The writing is mediocre, the descriptions are vague, and there are just way too many characters. The characters are just too many, too many things that don't have anything to do with one another, or they do things
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was terrible. The prose was so dry that it made me cringe every time I read it. And the story was so lame. There was never any conflict, no fight, and even when a villain got his revenge, it was so easy to make it all feel like a dream. The characters were the worst part, with a few exceptions, i would give this book 0 out of 10. The main character, Sam, the daughter of a rich family, is so self-absorbed that I could not even feel any pity for her. She always does her own thing and never listens to others, which only gets worse as she gets older, especially when her friends start getting married and having children. Even the parents were not safe from her, she ruined the entire family by marrying the son of her husband's best friend and becoming his new best friend. Her parents wanted her to marry again and this was the only way that Sam could save her life.   I have read this book a dozen times. I have seen so many different characters in it that I still can't figure out how Sam even made it through the book. I know I would not get through it, even if I had to rewrite the whole thing. It had so much potential to be a great book, but this book just disappointed me. I give this the lowest rating because I do not know what I am supposed to take from it. It is a horrible book and I am still trying to figure out what I want from it, I hope I could find something from it that would be a redeeming quality.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I was so excited to get this book! I was so disappointed when I started reading the story... I read all the reviews, and they all said the same thing. The stories and the characters didn't seem to have much life. I thought I was in for a good read, but all I got was boring and cliche. It just all sounded like it was all there, but then I read it all. I wanted to put the book down, but there was no way I could because it was so good.  "One-Eyed Jacks" by M.R. Carey is published by Del Rey and is now available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Indiebound. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~~   I love the idea of books that have to be'spoofed' by another book. They are usually done in a very subtle manner, where they actually make you laugh. My copy of this book was done wrong. The cover had a title on it, but it wasn't the author. The title was "The Book with No Title."   As I was reading the book, I realized that the title was actually a spoof of books, or at least, books that were "no titles". I am thinking of "The Last Supper" and "The Lord of the Rings".   The title makes it sound like there is a big mystery behind the book. There isn't. At first, the cover is very hard to read. And then, I read it, and realized that it was the title, "The Game with No Name". I also found out that the book was about a game that was being played by a character that would be "called" "Name". Name didn't know that she was called Name, and that Name was just playing a game. This book could easily have been a parody of "Lord of the rings".     It wasn't until about 30 pages in that I realized this was a spoof. Then, I noticed that the first two pages had the cover on it. It was a book about a little girl, who was playing a "game." The pages before, however, were blank, and the third page was a drawing of what a girl might look like if she was a little boy. This is how the whole book is set up. The first page had the picture of the game, and what a little character would look like when they were playing the game. Then it starts with the page after the cover. The only thing missing was the "Game with No name" title, which the author is hiding from the reader.   All of this sounds like a very clever, clever parody. But, I think it is just too subtle to be really fun to read about. It has a very childish and innocent feel to it. The reader is just supposed to go along with it, for the sake of the story. But this is a parody. And, you know what? That doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- -------------------------   The first half of this book was interesting and very well written. The second half of the book is almost completely filler, with little to no insight and no plot to speak of.   In order to make the reader feel like there is some plot going on, the authors create some sort of interplanetary civil war on a planet called Theta. It is really an excuse to get the author and her boyfriend to meet and start a relationship. While I can appreciate the relationship aspect, it does nothing to bring this book forward, only slowing it down.  :)   Characters:  The narrator's character, Rose, was very good. Her narration is very well done, and in addition to her narration she also does a great job of describing the events happening around her. The author's character was very bland, although I have no idea why she was there or what she did.  ,,, and  There was only a couple of minor characters that didn't really do much to contribute to the plot, but their very presence made the book feel like it was missing something.   the characters in this book seemed to be very shallow, and just there to provide the author with some plot hooks and background information.  - - : )   - - - :, - :   This book really did nothing to advance its plot, so I decided to give it a 4/10.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have enjoyed this book but could not put it down. However, the last 10% was a bit disappointing. The story was good but it was boring and slow. The ending did not make much sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've always wanted to read this book, but never really got around to it. It's a good book, and the story, while simple and easily done, is well told.  The main characters, the two main characters in the book (and the reason I decided to read it), are very believable.  They are both flawed, but they try their best. I liked the character development of the main characters.  I loved that the book focused on a couple of the characters, and that they did not get a lot of attention.  One character is given a backstory and we can see his/her journey of growing up.  This isn't a character that needs to be developed more, but I did really enjoy this.  Another character, that was introduced only briefly, was written really well.  She was described as "a young man with a dark skinned face" and I found that description extremely interesting.   However, the book has it's flaws.  For example, a character died in the middle of the book.  The way this was described was very odd to me.  It felt like it was put into the book by a character not from the book, so why was it described this way?   Also, there was an ending that felt abrupt to me, as if the author had to rush it, I'm sorry.  As a side note, I have seen some of the reviews on here where people said the ending was rushed, so I know that there was a lot that could have been left out.   I just felt that the ending needed more time to be explained and explained the best that it could be.  Now, on to the bad parts: The ending was abrupt.  Although it was done right with the character's death, I found this abrupt and rushed.  There was a reason why the character was written that way, but the ending felt unnecessary.  That said, the ending is still good, but it just didn't feel right, and it made me sad.   The book could have done a lot better in other areas.  Not a lot is explained in the beginning, so the reader doesn't know anything.  No one really knows the truth behind the strange behavior of the protagonist, so there is nothing to really hold the reader's attention.   The descriptions of the world that are done are very bland and cliché, so a lot can be made out of that.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ _________ __________ _____________ I did not like this book, or even like it. It is just an awful story. It has not an ounce of story, not a moment of time, not even an ounce to think about. There was a time where I actually looked forward to hearing a book by this author, because I had a sense that it might be fun to read. This book was no fun at all. It did not make me want to read any of her other books, or anything else by her for that matter. It was a waste of time. The author does not tell a good story, it makes no sense. No character development, no conflict, nothing of any value. It just was a terrible story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I have read this book and I feel like I got ripped off by it. The writing was slow and there was just too much of the same story over and over. I thought this was the end of the book but then the book changed. I guess I got spoiled by the film and read the book because I kept thinking that the movie ended with the same thing and that the book didn't. This book doesn't even make sense. I think the movie had the right idea with it being all about the magic but this book doesn  ****** This is one of the most boring books I've read in awhile.   ******* This book was not for me but I understand that it might be for some people. The story of this book is quite interesting and is worth a read for sure. The author also gave several names to all of the characters in the book that I can't remember all of them so I hope that doesn't bother you but just don't know for sure because I could be wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This was the worst book I've ever read. It's a horrible and bad book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was boring, confusing, poorly written, and just plain boring. I had to go back to chapter 1 several times to make sure I didn't get caught up in one of the plot lines. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I read something like this. This book is about a girl who goes to college. She has trouble adjusting and doesn't really know what she wants. After being raped by a man in her class, she decides to move to New York City to be with him so that she can do her best to make her life better. She is a virgin and doesn´t know what sex is but she does know that it's not about the sex. Her friends help her overcome her problems and get her to realize that she needs to be herself and not be scared of anything. Unfortunately she doesn't do much with this new life and her friends keep being dumped and not being around. She meets a guy and goes out with him for the first time. He has a good sense of humor but he's very strict. He also doesn't have much of a personality and doesn`t seem to really want to have anything to do with her. This is the first chapter of the book and there really isn't much to it. He even says that he will never get in a relationship with a woman like this so he will always be celibate. But she isn't so convinced. She decides to stay with him and he becomes very protective of her but there are always things that can go wrong. He can become very abusive or very loving at times and doesn' t have a sense of what his own needs are. Then he leaves her again and she has a horrible feeling that she won't be loved anymore and she goes into depression. When she moves to another city and decides to get a job to earn some money, she finds a different guy that she has the same feelings about. He is the same as the first guy except that he is a much better person. He doesn't force himself on her and he gives her plenty of attention and affection. He's a nice guy who cares about her a lot and does his best to be the man that she wants to be. Eventually she decides that she really can't stand living with the guy that just dumps her and she decides she has to make the best of this
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book on the way to a yoga class and I had to take a day off work to do it.  It was really boring.   The story is basically about a woman who has been a devout yogi for twenty years and she is getting ready to move out of her house.  As she is doing so she meets a man, but I am sure she will never really know what this man wants and just goes with the flow.  She moves in and he is her guru who is helping her get ready.  Unfortunately there are a lot of misunderstandings between the two, misunderstandings that are revealed pretty early on.  I think the author had too much fun in writing this book, and I can see why so many of us love it. If I was a beginner and I could only read it as a short and sweet beginner book I would love it even more.  There are more interesting, and more informative books that are available.  It is worth your while, but be warned that there are some misconceptions about the life and work of the yogi and the life of a guru, that I didn't understand or didn't find as interesting as the book suggested.  This is only my 2nd experience with this book and I hope it wasn't as boring as it seemed to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I enjoyed this book enough to read it, but there are a few issues: the first problem is the lack of a beginning and an end. It should begin and end with a description of how the book began. I would like to know how the character who has problems is introduced. This book was supposed to end with the story of the character. I wanted a better explanation on how the problem was introduced, and why the problem is being ignored. A problem can exist for a long time, even though the cause is never mentioned. In the beginning, it is not known what caused the problem to occur. Also, the character is not very descriptive. The characters are a little too detailed, which is good for a story about problems, but is a little boring for a book that is about characters. The problems with the writing are a problem with the book. The writing in the beginning was a little better. However, the ending was a bit bad. I'm not sure why, the book could have been written in three pages. One problem with my favorite authors is their endings. I was ready for this book to end in the best way. This is a great book, it's not perfect, but I liked it. I'll have to read the other books by this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It's funny how often some people can tell the difference between a good book and a bad one and they're often wrong. "  - The Booklist   For this review, I have read and reviewed a whole bunch of books. I am now, I believe, the largest self-published author on Goodreads. I have also been the first one to review most books that have been posted on Goodread. I usually do a good job in making sure my reviews are up to date. My first book, The Cottage Library (the sequel to The Cuckoo's Calling) was first posted on January 24, 2006. I did a good review and a good sales pitch. I got a lot of responses and had an overwhelming response of positive feedback to what I wrote. On January 27, the sales started and the book went on to do great. Then the reviews went out and the reviews were not good. I started looking at the book and realized that the negative reviews were by a group of people who had never read the first book and had no idea what I was talking about. It was as if I had just gone on a radio show or something and had a big rant. In fact, some of the reviews weren't just off topic but actually wrong on details. I was just trying to write a great review. Then I looked at the Goodreads ratings and realized I was not only getting negative reviews, I was getting the exact same negative reviews over and over again. So, I decided to go back and revise the book a few times to make sure it was right for my readers and for me. And finally, I had my revisions. The review was right and the feedback from my fans was just perfect. It's funny to look back and realize the reviews on GoodReads were all the same. Then, I realized I had to do something because it was really annoying to see people saying the same thing about the first two books. It seemed so stupid, but at the time I thought, "what the heck". And I went back and started again.   This was the third book and I was still getting the same criticism of the book. This time it was all the bad reviews were coming from other people who never had read my first two novels. I went through the book cover by cover and took it as a whole and went back to my first novel. Then when I was reviewing the first revision again, I noticed a few things

He really wanted to do it, but he just couldn't" left me with a sour taste. -------------- ------------- It was a nice book, but it left me bitter and cynical.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **************************** I didn't really like this book. It had an interesting premise about a man who falls for an imaginary girl. There was a lot of exposition on his backstory and the characters, but that really was not my thing. The story was confusing at times and at other times just felt dull. The prose style was a bit on the dry side. Overall, I didn'st really enjoy it. I would like to read more, but it was a pretty short read for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book. But, it took me quite a while to get to the end. I finished it within a couple of hours, but there was one section of the book that took me longer to get through and I didn't like that part at all. I found myself getting annoyed because it was so unnecessary. I don't want to say there's a problem with the story, because it wasn't bad. But this part of the story seemed unnecessary to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ This book isn't worth the time or effort it takes to read it. I gave it 5 stars because it is entertaining. _________________________  What I liked:   The Plot:   with a twist.   Characters:     Gail was a good character. She had her flaws, but she was good. She was just doing her job. She really enjoyed herself. She didn't have a big, dramatic past but her life was filled with drama and that's what made it interesting. Gail did have a past that had a lot of drama and she made it through it by staying strong.   of course, it has to be all about Gail and the book doesn't have any other characters that did have any character development. I liked the way that they took on the book. They didn't take it for what it was. They took on it as what it could be. And that's a good thing. I really enjoyed it.   be sure to read the book!   I wish they had done better on the last 3 pages. I found that the book is getting a little over all dramatic and sad when you look at it. But, it is a good read for those who have issues with character development, just make sure you don't make it too much of a "dark" book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a lot of bad things in it, including not a lot to work with. The writing style is stilted, and the dialogue is stifled. Also there are not enough women in the book, and this seems to have been a point of concern to author. I understand why she had so many characters and made the book so vast, but she should have made a more diverse book. It is clear that she is not interested in being diverse at all. I wanted to love the book.  —Carol E. Wessel  Review at The Review Bookshelf:  (5 out of 5 stars)  A very good book. Not for everyone and certainly not for all women. This book has been recommended to me by my brother, who also read this as a young woman. I would recommend this book to women who are concerned about their future because it is an excellent book that has a purpose and a point to make. It also speaks to the concerns of women who have been in a certain job or who have had other men in their life make decisions about them.  the review:  (3 out of 4 stars)

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________I was a huge fan of John Grisham before I read this book, but after reading it I just hated him. There's so many things wrong with this book that I wanted to rip the pages out and throw them in the trash. There were parts in this book where I couldn't believe I could have been so easily tricked into thinking that Grish am was a decent writer, and even though I didn't like the story, I still enjoyed the characters. I think if you are expecting a good story, then this book probably isn't for you. I wouldn't even recommend this book to someone who doesn't want to read a bad novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very dissapointed to find that the last chapter of this book is the least interesting part. After the first page, I thought I might be in trouble for writing such a negative book review but I was actually wrong. This book isn't so bad that I wouldn't read any more of it but I think it could have been done better. I think the author was too focused on having a big plot point at the end of the book instead of putting the characters through some of their most interesting and relatable parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should not have been published and should have been dropped without a trace. I am an active member of the military and had spent my life on the front line, always in harm's way. I have been shot, I have gone over the top in hand to hand combat, I was in the line of fire when the Iraqis bombed the embassy, I had been in a helicopter with my battalion in a fire fight, I spent weeks recovering from severe burns. This is an example of a poorly researched book. The author claims to have been a journalist, but the author does not have enough knowledge of journalism to write a proper book. This book is a mess, it has all the hallmarks of a bad work. The writing is terrible, the characters are dull and uninteresting, there is nothing of any interest in the book. At one point, it makes us wonder if we will ever see a proper military history book, and then it is gone. I know that many of you may find this review to be somewhat biased since I have already reviewed a few military books in my review for the Military History Book Club, so take that into consideration. I would strongly suggest that you do not buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* My book review about this book is very difficult because there are so many negatives about this amazing book. I can't find a negative thing to say. The book describes an amazing and strange alien that was from the planet, Triton. In the book, he comes back to Earth to visit the humans on Earth and they have a lot of trouble dealing with the alien. I loved the way they described this alien. It made me think about the alien in the movie, Alien, and how much he resembled the way in the book. The author even made a little alien to try and make the aliens of the book look different. The aliens of this book looked great and the best part about this alien was that he kept telling the humans that they could not understand him and that the humans were all wrong. I know this book was not published on earth in the year of 1978. However, it was published in 1967 and if it was written today, I'm not sure that it would be published. The story was very good but the way that the story was told was so confusing. I was having a hard time remembering all of the events in the story and they were just so hard to remember. The way in which this alien came back to earth and how they dealt with him made me feel so bad for the humans. The alien did so much to help humans and the humans never got back on their feet. It was sad to read this and I was sad that I had to read it. I really would have liked this to be in English and it would have made a better book. It would have been easier to understand and I would have loved to read about the aliens instead of the humans being in love with one another. I would love to know more about this world and I can only hope that this book will come out in another form.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________ I read the book for a college class on history. I enjoyed it but wasn't as moved by it as I would have liked. It took me from chapter to chapter, and sometimes left me feeling unsatisfied. It was a good class though and we learned a lot about the Spanish-American War. However, I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to the book. I also don't recommend this to the general public.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is awful. It is horrible. It's very confusing, and it doesn't make any sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- When I read The Shadow Over Innsmouth, I was so excited. I loved the book and the author was wonderful. I did enjoy the book but I was disappointed with it. I know this is the type of book that will be loved by many and I felt that it did not meet my expectations. This was not a bad story but it fell short of my expectations and will definitely leave many wondering if they will like it. There were too many moments of tension and not enough action in the book. It took me over 40 pages before a character was introduced, there were several character introductions but they were not developed enough to make me care about them. I found the writing style too slow for me and not the type I am used to reading. I thought the characters had a good cast of characters but were a little too thin for me. Overall this was not good but could have been a better book. I would love to see The Shadow be released in a larger format, it was amazing to read in hardcover and not have to use my Kindle.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it was a real downer to read, i mean REALLY downer. I had expected more from a story about a vampire/human, I was even hoping they would end up together or that the vampire would somehow become human so he could have his own body to eat but it all just ended up as "hey, vampires don't get the best of humans, i'm your new love interest so you better stay away from me or i will hunt you down and kill you" I'm sorry I read that as a good thing. The narration was ok I guess. The story kept changing from page to page and I was like "what happened?" I wasn't a big fan of the narration because it felt like the person narrating was just reading out of the story instead of saying things themselves. If I had to give this book a 3/5 I would because it was good I guess, but it wasn't perfect.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The narration of this book was pretty good.  It was clear and distinct from the rest of the audio.  but the characters in this book are really the worst I've ever read.    I could have told you this already, but there are just so many stupid, annoying, idiotic characters I can't do it justice.  I have had my fair share of awful characters in books and this book is no exception.  The main character is such a pain.  He just does not want to be there.  It would be amazing if he just had the guts to walk away, but unfortunately that's not the case.  No, he has to pretend to care, which is why his constant whining and complaining and not wanting to work is so annoying.  To be fair, I'm not complaining that he's annoying. I'm complaining that the way he's treated makes me want to run screaming from the room.  This whole time he's been around the house he's just been trying to play the role of the "good guy", and he really doesn't like that role, and I don't blame him at all.  But to be fair I don the whole time.  Because the thing is he's not even a "good" character.  At all. The whole thing is the worst and most boring thing ever written.  A book that just has a lot of bad jokes, and bad characters.  So many, I can tell you every one of them.  When I think of the worst thing I've read, this is the number one and 2nd best.  Don't waste your money on this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book before starting my first job, and the information that I got was so much more detailed that I'm going to take another look at it when I have more time. I will admit, I had some confusion about the names of the parts of the world and the differences between some of them. I have been following the blog posts that you post from here and I'm not going to re-write my own posts and re-do all of this, as I believe it will not help in any way.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is so boring and I was so bored. I'm not a huge fan of the author's writing but it's hard to complain after so many reviews about how boring the story is. I think it's a good story for younger readers but not a favorite for me.   Rating:  1 star   Review by: J.D. O'Malley - February 12, 2017 - February 13, 2017   Not an easy read, and I'd say that the plot is rather average, with some decent moments. I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting and couldn't find anything to interest me. I was left bored and wanting more.   the only positive I can give is the characters are realistic and you can relate to them, so they're not stereotypical. I hope I'm wrong on that.   and it's all in the name of art...   and who needs "art" when we have "science"?   so... if you read this, you've wasted your time.  This is a book written by people who really care what people think about their books. It's probably the worst book I've ever read in the genre, and it was recommended to me by a friend who was pretty much positive about it. I don't know, I'm kind of torn by the overall experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book about 6 months ago, and was so intrigued that I tried to finish it before it was time to go to the gym. Unfortunately, I had to put it down to read some other books at the same time (a friend was trying to get me to read one of his!). I have to admit that I liked the premise of this book but the writing just felt forced and I was so annoyed by the lack of research. There are a number of facts and examples that just do not add up. This book did not work for me, I think I'll put it aside until I'm a bit more educated about the science of sleep.   I have a question about one of the examples given for the benefits of sleeping on an elevated surface:  This is a question I get a lot: Does sleeping on your back or stomach (elevated) improve your sleep? I don't understand the difference. Is there a difference in gravity or pressure on my back or is it a matter of the air moving over the surface? This makes it hard to know the answer. If it's gravity, I get my body in a relaxed position and feel fine but if the pressure is on the back or sides it's more difficult to settle down. I can imagine a case where a sleeping on the bottom might make my back sore.  A reader writes:  My name is Kevin, and I am a college student studying Psychology at university in Ohio. I read your book about sleep and am very glad that I decided to check it out. I have read other books on sleep and have a hard time seeing how a sleeping pillow would give any sort of advantage over another sleeping pillow for students. The last two books that I have bought that talk about this topic are "Goodnight, Sleep Tight" by Dr. Bruce Lipton and "Sleep Sucks" by Michael R. Czeisler. The books basically state that sleeping on one's back, side, or stomach may have certain benefits. The thing about these books is that they do not address the psychological issues that might play a role in deciding whether or not to sleep on an incline or not. The only thing I found in Lipton's book that I agreed with was that lying down on one side may help one's mood. There is no way to know whether lying down has a positive effect on your mood, but sleeping on a side seems to help one keep a consistent routine. He also suggests a
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________   My husband and I purchased the book to share with our children, ages 8 and 11. However, we will not be buying this book for them again, since we learned that the book's author is a child molestation advocate. We do not care for his approach to the subject. Our children have not read the book, and we have not encouraged our children to read it. The book reads like a propaganda pamphlet, and is a waste of money.   I hope to not have to purchase another book by the author.   (The author is an attorney and a former attorney with the Oregon Supreme Court.)   Reviewed by Jodie B. Wootton, D.D.S. on July 02, 2010
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The story begins well enough, but as the story progresses, the characters grow on you, the plot twists become increasingly confusing, and the narrative drags on. While the story had some interesting ideas and was worth reading, it took an inordinate amount of time to actually read. --------------- - No good ending: The book ended too abruptly. It was very confusing to me that the author wanted to wrap up the story in such a quick, meaningless way, but I guess I'll never know. -------------- - I thought the characters were interesting: I think they all had unique voices, some are very good, and others are not. ------------- - The ending was not what I wanted it to be: The author said they wanted the book to end at the halfway point, but it doesn't. I was hoping there would be a happy ending, but that was not the case at all. ------------ - What more could I want: This was a very, very fun book to read. The author wrote an interesting, yet complex story that you will never tire of reading. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ I've read it. I recommend it. It's a great read and I'm glad I picked it up.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   I'm a little disappointed with this book.   It starts with the narrator claiming that this is one of those classic "unconventional" detective novels. I wasn't sure what "conventional detective novel" meant.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. ______________________. ____________. __________________________________________________________. I loved the concept and the book, but I really wanted to like it, and I really liked it a lot, but there were a lot of problems. 1. My favorite line in the book is the one about how I couldn't wait to get to the point in my life where I could go down on a girl and I could give her head. I was talking to my boyfriend about this the other day and we all just laughed. He said it was because I was too old to start getting into that. 2. If you read the book long enough, you'll see that you're not the only woman to have trouble with your lover. It's a very sensitive topic, but a lot has been said about it, but only recently have people started saying they're having difficulty. 3. I had a real hard time with this book because it's all about men and how bad they can be. They're like rapists and pedophiles and bad people. I didn't really get that from the book. I think the book could have been a lot better. And then the next book she was writing, "The L Word," was not good at all. ____________________________.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is such an interesting book, but it's way overpriced. I will not buy it again. I would have paid around $10 for it.   It's one of those "don't make it too long" type of books that just gets boring after a while. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt this way.   with that said, the information in the book is great and informative and I enjoyed learning more about the subjects that I know a little more about than others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished it and thought this book was full of nothing but boring, dull characters. They were so shallow that I just couldn't get behind them. I had no idea what was happening for them to be so shallow.   All I know about the characters is that they're basically stuck at one point in time in a bad situation. The rest of it is just dull. I'm still waiting for them all to make an interesting, well developed character.  - This review was edited after I was given the second printing of this book. "The next day, we returned to the hotel, and went out for ice cream. As usual, the children seemed more excited about the ice cream than about the work they were supposed to do. They couldn't decide between the strawberry and the chocolate. When I tried to convince them to eat ice cream without a fork, they refused. I explained that they couldn't eat it with a fork and that it was perfectly okay to put a fork in it. When we were done, the girls went back to their desks. I gave them an ice cream and sat down at my desk, waiting for a response. At some point, I got up and started walking around the room. Each of the girls approached me, as if trying to talk to me. Finally, one girl approached me and said, "Mr. Schieber, I thought I was the only one that knew how to do this!" She explained that she had learned how to eat a sandwich with a knife and fork at her grandmother's house, and she was amazed that anyone could think they were so smart. The other girls followed her example and learned how, too."
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________   This book was one of the best books I've ever read. It was full of facts and interesting facts and I could feel myself being sucked in. I've read several books on the subject and most were dry, dry, but this book had a lot of depth and was more of a history lesson. It covered things like the ancient Chinese and their culture, the fact that the Mongols were not actually nomadic. All that I loved in the book, I got to experience for myself. This book was a good read and one that will stick with me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was one of the best books I've ever read.  The story is good, the characters are realistic, the action is well written and the ending was well done.  I'm a little disappointed to see that the first two books in the series are both not currently available.  If I were you, I'd buy the next two books, which are not by the same author.  The first book is better than the second and the third is not as good as the first.   The fourth book is not available, and is scheduled for a release around November.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  I did not like this book, at all. I'm not sure why, other than the fact that the story line is very much one-sided. We see the people involved with the story, not the people who created it. The main character, K. K., is a very bland character, he's very self-centered, rude to everyone, and he never seems to have any real problems with anyone. He's always got a plan and he's always on his way to accomplish a goal. But it doesn't matter what his goal is because the story never seems able to tell us why. And the main character just seems to do this for no reason. I couldn't get into the book and I found the story very uninteresting.   There are some interesting ideas in the book, but they are not presented in the right way. For example, when K.K. finds the missing girl, she tells him that she is in her room, and the whole time she is playing music on her phone. So he goes and finds her and she's dead. So then, he leaves her body in her bed and thinks he did the right thing, because she was trying to get away from him. However, when he leaves, he does not bring her body back to her home to be buried. I found this to be incredibly inappropriate.   The ending of the book is extremely unsatisfactory. It is not what you are expecting and it seems to lead into a different, but equally unsatisfying story line that doesn't really answer any of the questions you were left with. It felt more like an explanation of what the main characters had done, rather than a conclusion to the story.

The story was awful. The dialogue was uninteresting. The book was poorly written. I really don't understand why the publisher thought this was the idea they wanted to try out. There's absolutely no reason for such an idea."   - A review by  "I read this book as a teenager and I'm not sure how it makes anyone think I should read it again. My dad and I were both disappointed. I don't remember much of it and found it a bit confusing."  / Read a negative comments on a good book:  A reviewer for Booklist  "...an extremely dull book of mediocre prose."  / Read more on the bad books.  The first book I ever bought and was thoroughly disappointed. A terrible book with terrible writing, bad ideas and terrible characters.I gave it a good review when I bought the second book but as I kept reading it became more and more obvious that this is not the author's work.The author tries too hard to make it look like she had taken an old literary classic and made it her own. She does this by creating several characters that are all slightly different and that are so much alike and similar that you cannot tell them apart. When I first read the book I thought that it was a rip off of "The Outsiders" but it is definitely NOT that.The story begins in a very boring way. The protagonist finds her parents dead and goes on a quest to find the perpetrator. The main character is so unlikeable that I felt sorry for her. She is extremely immature and lacks any kind of understanding of the world around her. What little knowledge she has is not passed on to her daughter who is only 11 years old at the start of the story. When she finds the culprit and the murderer she is forced to kill him and take his name. What a waste of a perfectly good name! She has a sister and the sister is also pretty much likeable but this sister does not have any problem killing. She kills the murderer, and then goes on to kill others, some of which are not even villains but just annoying little children. After all the killing she becomes pretty much a recluse and has a very hard time remembering anything about the plot.The most annoying thing about this book is how
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I received a copy of "The Girl on the Train" as part of my Kindle Unlimited trial. My fiancee and I are avid book lovers, and while we enjoyed reading "The Stranger," my husband was not quite ready to take the plunge and read all of his books. I gave "The Boy on the Run" a try, and although I didn't like it as much, I can see why a book like that might appeal to a certain audience. It's certainly not my cup of tea, but the author does a good job of capturing the essence of the novel. For what it is, though, the book is a little too dark for my taste. And that is saying a lot, since I am one of those readers who is not overly fond of reading about crimes, but still wants to know how the story plays out. If I could give this book another star, I would, because I really enjoyed this book. But I can't. I had hoped that this book would be a good introduction to John Grisham's crime fiction, but this book is not a good choice for that. It was interesting, but I can imagine that a lot of people will find it disturbing, and I hope that you all will be careful about reading the book.  12 of 13 people found this review helpful

It's just as boring as the books it is parodying.   There were too many clichés:   - The narrator is always making jokes about something that happened in the past, like "I guess this is where I used to go to the bathroom."   ....   -......

Write a negative review about a bad book:  You could spend a lot of time debating the morality of torture. Some would say that torture is not torture, but the author is wrong. Torture is torture. Tortured people are still tortured. The torture here is not for the sake of finding out the truth. This is simply to give the killer's daughter some pleasure before they kill her.    For some reason, this book came out early in 2015.  A lot of these reviews were posted during the release of the movie The Hobbit. It was hard for me to understand why people would like this book so much. It seemed like the author was more interested in taking the reader down the rabbit hole and explaining the world of  Norse Mythology than he was in telling a good story.  The main issue I have with this book is that it has several scenes in which the author does his best to show how wrong his theories are.  You get a glimpse of this from chapter 2 when you're introduced to Eirik, the "Fairy Godmother" and see her make a deal with the wolf, Valkyrian, that gives her the ability to transform herself into a beautiful woman (I didn't understand why she had to do the deal, especially since the wolf is a male). But this scene is so bad that I can't even really complain about it.  For the remainder of the book, it is just hard to take the ideas that the author presents seriously.  I am not quite sure how to fix this book. I know that I am a little more on the "fantasy" side and have enjoyed other books that are very close to this one. But still, this was a very difficult book to get through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I have read the whole series and would recommend it to those who don't mind reading the entire thing again, but may not enjoy this one as much as the other two. It is a very unique fantasy series and I can tell that it is well written. However, I think it could have been written a lot better, and the characters are somewhat one dimensional and the plot is confusing. It's definitely worth the read, but I won't give it a 5 star rating because I think that it falls short of some of the best fantasy novels out there. It does get better as it goes on.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ * ___________ * _______________________________________ I loved this book. I have been having trouble with the book since the first page. I read the first 3 pages and then realized that I didn't really like what was going on. There were too many details to remember. The first third of the book is a lot of talking and not very action oriented. That part of the story was not too interesting. The next third is very action and it just became boring. I think that the author had to show a lot more to the main character. I don't like the idea of the main characters father not knowing his son and not giving him much time. I would have liked to see the father be a little less strict in regards to the son and more of a loving father. I also feel that the story could have been better with less "spoilers" and more focus on the main story. The book ended a little too abruptly. The last half of the novel was more action and adventure but then the book ended and I felt like I wasn't done. I really liked the main charachter of the author and I would love to see more books in this series but this one wasn't it.

So, let me say this: I read about a million reviews on this book, so there is no way I could be an objective reviewer. I did read this book after watching the movie. The book is not a novel. I found it a bit pretentious. It is written by someone who has studied ancient civilizations and is familiar with the religions in those civilizations. That is why, I don't think this book would be that helpful to people who don't believe in any of these religions. The author would probably say that he doesn't believe them either, but I think he was very aware that these are all myths. That said, I didn a think that if you're a religious person who is bored of the common myths, then it is probably a good book for you. If you're bored of myths, there's no point in reading this book either.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author really put in the effort to make this story intriguing, but it fell short of being interesting to read. It would have been nice if the author went deeper into the plot (to do so, he would have had to go into the backstory). I don't mean to be overly critical, but I found the story to be very basic and lacked the depth of a great book. It was good though, it wasn't bad. I just think it would have made for a better book if it was more like a good book. I also did not enjoy this book as much as others.  I read the first 3 chapters before giving it a chance.  I read this on a lark and it took me until my 40s to finish it. The first 3-4 chapters were excellent, but then the rest of it just fell flat. I really liked the concept and was curious about what the ending would be. I enjoyed some parts of the story, but just didn't enjoy the rest. This is not the story you want to read when you want something to spark your interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not going to give it 5 stars because I think that I've made my point.   I'd give it more stars if they made it to a "favorite" rating for sure.  I bought this in January of 2013 from Amazon, and I don't know where I got it but it came to my house the first day.  In September of 2013 I bought a used book, and this was on my list.  A few months after that I was trying to figure out if I should buy a used copy of this book because it was so inexpensive at that time.  This book is so amazing.  It is such a good "how to" guide, and really explains everything you need to know.  All the things you don't need to be aware of when buying this book are explained to you.  The book is well illustrated.  There are pictures of how different books are bound and pages that have illustrations are highlighted.  They have illustrations that explain the words.  If you buy the book you will not be disappointed, but if you want a reference book that explains the basics you may want to look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really, really wanted to like this book!  I read it at the airport and loved the book so much. It was a story about how two very different people got together.  But I was so let down by the book that I couldn't get to the end.  The ending was really disappointing.  It wasn't sad and depressing, it wasn't uplifting, it was very dry and sad and it just made me feel so alone. I have a few different reasons that kept me from getting to the good part, but one of my reasons was because this was a book that was about two people that were very different from each other, so the way the book ended just made my heart sink and saddened me.  I would recommend this book to friends but I would avoid this book at all costs.  Review: I've read a lot of books. I've even read some good books.  In fact, I don't really want to say "I've read hundreds of books" because honestly I only read a few.  When it comes to books I read, I really enjoy books with a very strong theme and a lot to connect to.  What I think you're going to like about this book, is that it was a very uplifting and enjoyable novel.  As a kid I felt that all the books I enjoyed were uplifting.  This book was very uplifted and I'm sure everyone will love it as much as I did.  If you don't like to read a very serious book, then this book is for you.  Because of that, I highly recommend this to all people who love books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I was in the process of finishing this book. I am not usually one for reading, I read mostly short stories, especially those that have a "feel" to them. This one had no sense of "feel." I felt that I had read this book once, and would never pick it up again. That's not to say I wasn't entertained, there are definitely some great moments in this book, but it was just not a fun experience.   When I got this book my wife, whom I love dearly, said "don't read this". She said that it is just too long. She has read many books in this genre, and none of them are ever this long. So I am left to think, is she correct? I am going to find out.  15 of 20 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** I'm not saying that this is a bad read, or that it has anything bad about it, it's just not a book I would consider reading, nor will I ever consider recommending it to someone. First off, I really don't know how to say I wasn't impressed. I bought this because of the "Best Science Fiction and Fantasy" book club and this is on the recommended reading list. It's definitely on the list. The book itself is very easy to understand and has an interesting plotline that I found very interesting. There are a few parts that I find confusing but it's very easy for me to understand what is going on and the author does a great job of explaining things. The characters and plot line are what made me go to the library to look up the source. It also seems that the author doesn't do a very good job at describing the space setting, it just kind of looks like a high school for a lot of the time. I do like that the story takes place in an alternative history space where there is no war between Humans and Aliens and also the story is set in a much smaller galaxy that has far fewer stars than the Milky Way. The ending is good too. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a good sci-fi story. Just make sure you read up on the author's other books!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was boring to me and made me want to stop reading it. I have to admit that it was very hard to stay focused when reading the first two-thirds of the book. The last third however was very interesting and worth reading for anyone that wants to learn something about "Manchurian Candidates".   What makes this book interesting is how the author uses his two-character stories to draw out a few things from this type of person, who has been given a lot of power over others, but is unable to use it. He uses the stories to show how these individuals have gone about getting what they want, and how this causes problems for their loved ones.   I also like the fact that he uses the "Mentor/Student" relationship as a framework for the author to examine how to manipulate people. The author uses the mentor-student relationships to illustrate how people use the two-characters to achieve their ends.   the only problem I had with the book is how it ends. It makes sense that the mentor/student relationships would end in one way or another. However, I was disappointed by how the book ended.  ...   In conclusion, this is a good book to read, but you will not get the "full" experience out of it, since it only focuses on the mentor and student relationship.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself is a little difficult to get through. I thought it would be simple to understand, but after the first 30 pages I found that I couldn't put it down. It's a well written story. I was trying to keep a track of all the information I'd read in the previous books and it felt like this one just kept going into new territory. The story and setting was interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. As a bonus, there is even more background to the plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ This book did NOT get a high rating by me. I don't like to give negative ratings, but this one was the worst book I've ever read. This is not just a bad novel, it's a book that had me questioning everything that was going on.   The book was supposed to be about a man named Robert who gets abducted by aliens that look like humans. The aliens are said to be called The One Above All. Robert doesn't want to cooperate, so he tells them to come and get him when they have a chance, but the one above all says that he will come. Robert continues to refuse, so the One Above all decides to do what it does best, destroy.   and they do, a whole bunch of stuff. We have robots and machines, aliens and alien technology, etc. etc. It all seemed kind of strange. But the thing that bugged me most, was that the aliens destroyed all the technology that they had brought along, which didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. I mean, we would expect them to be able to build more advanced machines and stuff.   is the problem with this book is that there was something really wrong with the writing. This book had to be written in English, and the grammar and the writing seemed really sloppy. It was hard to take what was being said seriously. It felt kind of forced. You would expect to hear people talking about a book, or what was going to happen next in the novel, but they just made it feel like they were just talking to each other.     I wasn't sure if I liked this book, because I thought it seemed really stupid. I wouldn't say it was a bad reading experience, but I did find that the writing was kind of horrible, and I could not take what the author was trying to do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't normally review books (unless it's the worst I've ever read and that's rare) but I just can't write a bad review for this book. A great concept, a fantastic plot line, a brilliant cast of characters and a story that is so fun and entertaining that I had to pause it for a second and ask myself whether I was reading the book right.   If you're looking for a good fun fantasy book, read it. If you're a fan of George R.R. Martin, check it out. It's amazing that a book this fun and good is being written by a first year university student, so I can't wait to read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************   This book is a little bit about the history of the Bible and the Christian faith. But the writing is really bad, and you will never be able to understand the content.   I found this book to be written in a very sloppy and unorganized way.   a few of the words are almost identical, and the sentence structure is off.   that may sound obvious, but I had to read a whole paragraph over and over again to see it, because the same sentence had the same word in each paragraph and the same thing in each sentence.  :-(   the whole thing is a complete mess.   I had hoped for a lot more from this author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all honesty I did enjoy the plot, and I enjoyed reading it, but I found it to be over the top. Not so much a bad read, but just really over the roof. It's a good read though, as the story does what a good book does, that is, to make me think about the situation I'm in. I guess that's a bad thing for a first time read. There's something nice to find about first reads though. I read this one with some trepidation, but after I finished it I just had to say it's one of my favorite books of 2012, maybe of all time. The premise and story are really interesting. I can't wait for what comes next. In all honesty though I was more in love with the characters and the plot itself, than the story itself. I don't think the story really mattered to me as much as I was reading the characters. The main characters are so much likeable, that I wanted to follow them, and get to know them better.   I'm sorry I'm so negative about this book, but it's just not my cup of tea. The whole concept, while interesting, is over the tops, as this is a book about "how to stop being a jerk", and "how a sociopath can still be friends with the victims he's hurt". The ending to this book is just too much to hope for, and it just left me feeling pretty angry with the author for not going any further with the story. But it's soooo worth reading because of the characters, the writing, and the storyline. It was worth reading, and so is The Sarcasm Test   "One can read about the science of sarcasm, but one must also read the lives of the people who make it work." -- Charles Darwin  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was in my late 20s. I'm a young-adult nerd, and was a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and the Harry-Potter-the-Complete-Series. I don't remember why I was so drawn to these books, but I can tell that the first three were especially important to me. When I finally finished this book, I found it hard to read. This was a big disappointment. I wanted so much to like this book. I read other reviews that said it was a great read, but in the end, I couldn't. This book was nothing special. It was a little short and not very exciting. It didn't give me many surprises. It's not really a problem if you're only reading one or two books a year, but if you want a fun book that will stay with you and interest you for the rest of your reading life, this isn't the book for you. I would recommend this book to anyone, but only if you have been looking for an easy book with great magic and mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have had some bad luck with a good copy. This one I got from a friend who had some problems. The book was a terrible piece of shit. The blurb was terrible. The writing was terrible and the plot was terrible in the slightest. The only thing that I could say good about this book was that I have a friend that likes the book. Unfortunately this book is a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:.................................I wish I knew about this book before I started reading it. It seems to have gotten so much hype that many of the reviewers who should have known better have a lot of trouble with this book. I think the reviewers will have a hard time reviewing it properly, because they will be judging it as if it is a "classic" book by some people. If it is not a "Classic" book it is very poorly written, it is poorly paced, and it is too many chapters long. In the end I think that you have to read this book on your own, unless you like books that take a long time to get through. If you can make it through one of these books then that is great. However I cannot recommend this one. If I ever write a negative book review, I hope it will be a better book than this one and if that is not the case then it was a bad idea.

It was the first book I tried and it didn't really click for me, but I read it a second time and it really opened up for me.  I really enjoyed this book and I think that if I had just started with that book again, I wouldn't have felt as if I missed out so much.   I definitely recommend this book to those of you who really love horror, and those of the ones who really enjoy dark fiction. __________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------This book really hurt my feelings. As someone with Asperger's, there was no way I could put this book in my own hands. The first person narration and the language just make the author look like an idiot. It is the beginning of the book, and that is not a good place to start. The author is so ignorant of autism and social interaction that it makes me cringe. I was in my early twenties before my mom discovered what was wrong with me. She had me tested and got the diagnosis. I have Aspergers and it was really hard to come to grips with. She also told me it was something that should not be talked about because I would end up hurting people I care about and I should not talk about it. So I didn't. But my mom told me to read this book and she gave me the first two pages and I said okay and read it. Well, I was not prepared for the amount of ignorant and condescending language that this book contains. If you are looking for a way to read a book with autistic characters and have a good laugh, I would not recommend this one. If someone can find a way around that, then yes this is a good read. But I would warn anyone that this is not the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ [Not a review, but an update for the fans who want it now] I'm writing this because of one book in particular: The Long Dark. It was the first book I read, and I don't have any bad things to say about it. As much as I loved it, it wasn't perfect, but there are things that the author could have done better. In the interest of full disclosure, I also reviewed this book in The Rumpus: http://rumpusreviews.com/the-long-dark-a-review/ I'm going to start with a spoiler, but I have to warn you that the first three-quarters of The Long dark is very well done. The plot is very interesting and the characters, though not particularly unique, are well-developed and likeable. I was so invested in the story that I read it over a couple of weeks, then took a break, then picked it back up again, and finally got it in the mail a few days ago. The story is really the same as the synopsis: a group of people on a long journey find themselves lost in a dark and forbidding world. I really enjoyed it and really enjoyed the characters. The book is very close to being perfect and could have been a great book had the author done one of the things she does in The LongDark. If you are not familiar with The Longdark, I suggest you read it first, as it covers most of the major plot points: the beginning, the middle, and the end. If that wasn't enough to persuade you to pick it up, let me give you a few other things I really liked: The characters: I liked the characters more than most books I have read, but they were still unique. I liked their choices, but not their actions. There are a number of books where the characters do something wrong for reasons they didn't think through, so that is what I was looking for. There is nothing wrong with that, and if you aren't a fan of those kinds of books, I would still recommend this one. The setting: the setting is one of my favorites. The world of The Rook has a very realistic feel to it, as if it had been written by someone who had lived there and seen it. The main setting of the story is called The Long Depths, a vast underground labyrinth. The Rooks themselves are dwarves from the deepest depths of the world, and
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ was a terrible book! I loved the premise and the writing. The plot was so great, but when it went bad I was so upset, because I felt it was so unfair. First of all, the main character was called "Candy," and her parents were in a relationship that was "unstable," and she had two step-sisters (one white, one black). But that's not even the worst part. This whole part of the plot was about how they were not even allowed to be in contact, and their parents could do anything they wanted. The only reason Candy was allowed to see her mother at the end of the book was because she had been given the word "torture" by her parents, and she was a nice person who needed to see this, but she never really saw her parents because of this. Then the ending was so wrong. The end left the kids in a really bad place, with Candy feeling that her step-brother and sister were nothing more than pieces of shit. If I had known that would be my daughter's experience at the book's end, I would not have bought it, as I was sure it was going to be terrible.  — Anonymous  My husband and I loved this book! He loved all the characters and how well they were brought to life by the author. We thought it was just the right balance of light and dark. We even thought it worked well for teens. I just hope it never comes to the big screen. .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book would have been better without the "The Other Side" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much" segments.   The book was interesting but it felt forced at times. The writing was awkward and the story seemed to have some holes in it. This book was not what I had been looking for, but it is still a worthwhile read for those who want to find out about a guy who was born in France but grew up in the US.   I think there should be more details in the book about the life of Robert Bork.   "This book" was a big disappointment for me, especially the "Man Who Kicked the World" portion. In many ways, the book felt forced and as if the author's mind was blown. In some ways, it could be considered good as it gave me an idea on how Robert B. Bork actually behaved as a human being. However, "This Book" didn't really leave a lot of room for a human interaction and some things just didn't add up to me. In terms of his political views, I'm not sure I believe what he was saying. It wasn't as if he didn't believe the stuff he was writing about and it just didn´t make sense. I don't know, I don´t know. In fact, my thoughts on Bork´s political views is probably the only thing that I still have not finished in this book. I am still trying to wrap my head around it.The book ended on a weird note that I can't really explain. The part that I am not sure about at all (and I don`t think I was supposed to) was when the guy told the narrator he thought he had a better chance of being found innocent than being found guilty. The guy also said that he didn´T have the money for a lawyer. The narrator had nothing to do with the matter and it made no sense to me at all. This was just a really weird part of the book that I didn´'t understand and made me feel cheated.I'm not even really sure if I would have enjoyed it at all if it was only about the trial itself. Maybe I would. But I don'T think I would like reading about Bork at all after he got convicted of something. I guess I will not read about it. I was really confused by the whole thing and the part where the guy went to a lawyer after the trial.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually give bad reviews but I'm doing this to help the author out. First of all I think the author has a problem with women. He has many women that he describes as submissive. One in particular I didn't like because she was very manipulative. I don;t like manipulative women. I had trouble finding the other three women that made me feel like he was a psychopath, which was the case for the vast majority of the book. Second of all, I was sick of women talking about themselves. You can't really say much about the women if you make them constantly talk about themselves and then they get off on it and get in trouble. It's like, what are you guys talking about? You're all just talking about your feelings. That's all you're interested in. That doesn't tell you anything about the lives of the people you're talking about. Third, the characters were annoying. They were very annoying. I couldn't stop thinking, what am I doing here reading a book about women? I was very disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:................................................... This was my first ever book by an author I had not heard of. I went into it thinking this was going to be my book of the week for the week of Nov 8, 2015. This book is about an extremely talented woman (the writer) whose husband dies before she can marry his murderer. But when she takes the murder case, she becomes involved with a local lawyer named Jim. His wife and son are killed by an intruder, and he is forced to hire a female police officer to protect him. She, in turn, hires a friend named Joe, who was the former owner of the house where the crime took place. Joe had a gun on the first victim, but had dropped it the night before. She is a good police officer. The book has a lot of drama to it, so I do recommend that you be ready for that. But I can't say I got my money's worth. This story is all about the murder that killed the first husband. There is nothing about any of the family's problems. It is just Joe, the police officer, and the killer in the end. There was no emotion in the book. The murder happened in the house. There are so many dead bodies that it looks like there has been a house fire, or someone has been drinking the whole time. I feel that the book could have been better. There were some things about Joe that bothered me. He was just a friend, no different than the police officers I dealt with. He had no clue about the whole situation, and there was nothing I could do about it. He did the right thing, and did the best he could. He didn't know about the murders in the first place, so his actions were completely understandable. But there were things that I wished he had done. I think he should have followed Joe more. If Joe hadn't tried to save Joe's life, Joe would be dead. Instead of leaving him to die, he should be leading him to the hospital. The end of the book should have shown me that Joe and Jim were good friends, but they were really just on a friend's level. That may have been fine for a woman's perspective book, but not for a husband's perspective. Joe and I have never had anything that I would call a fight before. When Joe tried to protect me, I was so mad he did it, and I wanted him to pay the price for it. I am not saying that
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________ So I was thinking about this for a long time, but I think I may have given it a 5 because I wasn't really sold on the story, despite the beautiful prose. There were some parts that didn't seem to be set up at all. I also didn't like that the author didn't really seem to enjoy playing with the characters. She was always trying to get the characters to say or do the wrong thing, to do or say something that didn. I think that she did this on purpose to show off how much she knows about the characters and that she was really trying to create characters that we would care about, but didn't do it well. I didn't think I was the main character in this book. I found myself getting annoyed with the other characters.I was expecting to see a lot more character development. I was expecting the author to know that there were other characters, to have read about them before. In this book, the characters were just kind of put in a world and left to the story.I also didn the author was trying to be realistic with the food. In fact, the food in the book is so unrealistic that I felt like I was at a party where they were eating everything. There are parts where the food looks like it was cooked on the grill and parts where it looks like the food has been boiled, even though it was clearly cooked on a cooking pot. I liked the way the characters all ate the same food, but they did this because it was the only food available. I would have preferred that there was at least some sort of different food. I like to eat a wide variety of food, and I didn' t like how this book went for the food choice. I guess the author thought that most of her readers would like this type of food choice as well.I feel like there was just something wrong with the narrator in this story. She always had a voice that was so monotone and boring, especially during scenes that were a little more emotional. At times, it was even very annoying. I feel like I could hear the author talking directly to the reader about this at least twice. I'm sure the readers would have liked it, though. I wish she wasn't so monotonous. This narrator was distracting.When the book ended, I felt so sad. I felt kind of stupid that I bought this book and didn't enjoy it, especially after reading a lot of other
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The entire book is based on the fact that this is not an adventure story. The only people to have to suffer are the characters, and even they don't have the benefit of good people trying to help them out. I find it quite insulting that a novel can be so self-important and preachy but not be able to be fun. This book is simply another book of its kind."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife loved this book! It's about a man and his dog. My wife told me the main character is a real nice guy. However, as soon as I finished reading the book I couldn't help but think of how much more there could have been written about this story. There is not one thing that happens in this book that doesn't feel like it's missing something. I have been frustrated with a book and then had to listen to this one and I still feel like I missed something.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.    2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ The Book is a bit of a disappointment.   It was a "classic" by the name of "Momma's Boy" which I had not read when I bought it. I got the book for Christmas, and I got a second book in the series called "The Girl Who Loved a Dog". I didn't care for either book, and after reading "The Boy" I felt like I had been tricked. I thought I would like the story, and then I was disappointed. I was able to finish the books, but I can't say I enjoyed them much.   in the beginning, "The Book" was great. I really loved the book. It was a great story about a boy who was being mistreated by his parents. When the books was over, the boy got angry. So angry that he ran off to meet a girl he liked, to fight his tormentors. But as the story went on, the book became "tired" and "dull". I just felt cheated by the book!   I also thought the story was just a bit too long for the story. I couldn't wait to see what happened to the girl in the end.   A lot of people praised the author and the author herself gave a review, so there was a good review.   the book was just plain stupid and boring!

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  I would love a book written from the heart by someone who is suffering from cancer or a similar illness.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I did enjoy this book but it was just a little boring. I felt like the author would have been better off having just one or two character(s) that were more fleshed out. I think there are enough clues about what is going on that one should just keep guessing what is happening. For example, why did the doctor have to break into the house where he has been living? Why did he ask for the medical records of both the woman and her husband? What is the story behind the missing persons report? Why does the man need to see his doctor? Does he have cancer? What did the girl give him to drink after his son was sick? These questions would have made the book better. It seemed like there was not enough time or effort put into developing the characters. Maybe I am just not a big fan of crime or suspense novels. ********************* I was extremely excited for this book! I love crime fiction, so I figured this would be a great book to try to pass off as fiction. What I didn't expect was that it turned out to be not very good. I feel like the story was told so poorly and in such an overly dramatic manner that it was almost impossible to suspend one's disbelief. The way the story goes on about how they find the body and what happened in the car, the way the characters reacted, and the way they reacted when they found the body are just all too believable. It just kept pulling you in. However, it took me all the way through the book just to figure out who the killer is. That was the hardest part to get through because the only thing you had to rely on was the word of the police officer (which is why I didn a few parts wondering why the cops weren't doing anything) and their own gut instinct. The rest just seemed like it was in the book to be there if you wanted it but if not then it seemed so rushed and rushed. Even when the killer was finally found, it was still hard to believe because of how long they had been looking for him. Also, the killer's motive for murder is never really explained. This could have made it so much more intriguing but it just seemed pointless in the end. I didn t understand why he chose this woman over the others but after a while I came to think that he was just so upset over the fact that he missed his chance to commit murder that he decided to do it to save her. It would have
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________   This is a horrible book, and I don't know how anyone could recommend it to anyone. I didn't enjoy it at all. It starts off fine but gets to the point when it becomes ridiculous and the writing falls off so much.   I didn't care about how the protagonist was created, she was just some girl who came across some magic. The fact that she's also a witch that can do amazing things with her magic. I'm a sucker for these type of things. I loved the concept and the book was a breath of fresh air. She made magic the focus, instead of what the person is. She started off very smart and thought the right thing to do, but by the end she just made a stupid mistake and the story just ended.   I feel as if I was reading a series, like with "The Mortal Instruments", but I didn''t like it. The characters didn't change from book to book, it didn't move forward, it just stayed the same. I felt like the author was writing about her character, but that's not a good thing.  's main characters, however, kept changing, and she still couldn't seem to tell the difference between how she created her characters and the way the characters in the book acted.  -This is not a series and it doesn't even have a beginning and end, it had two chapters but not much else. -This is just a book about some girl making magic. -It is not about witchcraft, just magic.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is so slow in it's pace, I was thinking maybe he went out of his way to get it on the publishing circuit because he knew he was writing something that would get a great deal of attention. What I got was nothing but mediocre writing. Not only was this book very slow, there are so many inconsistencies in it. The pacing is so good that I can't believe there was only one book in this series and he didn't go out of there way to make sure he gave people the most up to date information possible. It made me wonder if the other books were out of print and if he never got around to writing any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an utter waste of time. The narrative is not interesting at all, the prose is bad and the ending is unsatisfying. The author writes a story of a very specific age (18 to 35). The main character's name is called Rolfe. The age is very interesting, because it could be anything else. Unfortunately the character's actions in the story do not add anything to the story, and make the reader wonder, why Rolf were that young. One of the biggest problems with this book is the lack of character development. This book is very similar to the classic book The Devil's Own, which was written around 1873 by Richard Bentley. This is a very bad book. I have a lot of respect for Bentley and I wish he had written a book about Rolf instead of writing about the devil in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book back in the 1990's. I was quite a young teenager when I took it on as my first adult book to read.  Well, it was a book that was well written, I loved the concept, but I never got the hang of the characters, and the plot was not what I expected.  This book takes place in a fantasy world called "Lantern", which is a place of magic where a great deal of magic and magic users gather and train together.  For people not used to these kinds of fantasy books, or books where magic and humans mix, it would make sense that the plot would be one of friendship, training, and training that the characters would develop over the course of the book.  The main character, Raziel is a young man with a destiny and destiny to save all those in the world who have been killed.  But his destiny, if it even exists, is to save the wrong person.  At the beginning of the novel we learn that Raziels "sister" is an assassin and will be murdered shortly after he turns fourteen.  After the murder the narrator (who we believe is Raziela's sister) is attacked and raped by a group of bandits.  A little later in the book, we learn RaziEL is a member of a mercenary group.  I found this rather confusing, but it's not the fault of the narrator, this group was just so new and untried.  When Razielia is twelve, her mother dies.  It's not until after Razieli is a teenager that she realizes she has a magical sister, and also has a sister who is the killer.  These two things really do not go together and I don't know why.  In a few places in the novel, the characters are presented as more stereotypical for their time, not a big deal, but there were other times where I would find this very annoying.  One of the things that annoyed me most was Razielo's attitude toward his mother.  There is a reason why she was murdered, but the narrator never makes it clear what the motivation behind her death is, nor why Raziiel would care so much about the death of his mother if it wasn't such a big thing for him.  This is a huge problem with fantasy novels, especially for those who don't expect their novels to be realistic.  Another problem is Raziel and his

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------This is one of those books that is great on first read but gets really bad and I think that's why this book was such a success. For me it was so over the top, and I had no idea what was going on for the first few chapters. I'm pretty sure the author was just trying to sell his books. It was a great idea. I've read some good things about this author, and some bad things, and this was more of the bad books, but the author is still a good writer so it all works out. I think this book is a book that I would only read if I was looking for an entertaining book that was fun to read. It's not one I would recommend to a friend if they were not looking for a fun read. I really would have enjoyed reading the first two chapters of this book more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Book of Common Prayer (1817) by Dr. William Robertson is one of my favorite historical novels.  Unfortunately, it is a terrible book about Christianity.  The protagonist is a "new convert" from Judaism who is a bit too eager to learn the Christian way.  Robertson does a decent job of describing the early years of Jesus Christ, but he is so eager to describe the Christian religion that he ends up repeating what many Christians believe about themselves.  He even repeats a quote from the Bible where Christ makes the same claim that we Christians make when we say that we are just like him.  As a historian, I find that a bit shocking that a historian would repeat something that we as Christians have already said many times, that Jesus is the son of God.  It was so obvious to me when I started reading the book, but Robertson just goes on and on and makes it seem like it was something new.  This book is so badly written that you might want to skip it, but if you do, I hope you enjoy it. I gave this book 4 stars because it was a fun read.  If you want to read something interesting and historical, this is a book that would be a great choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really enjoy this one. The characters were a little flat, they didn't seem to care about anyone at the time.

Her family and friends could have been more interesting and likable, but I didn't see that.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________ Lasted about three hours on my kindle. It was fun at first, but then it got boring, and it was hard to finish because I got stuck in this plot. The characters were so one dimensional, and the plot was too convoluted.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book from cover to cover and found it to be a complete waste of time, however the book will probably help me to get a better understanding of the concept of "poverty" as it's applied to men. When I first read this I thought it was very interesting and would be a great read as a man. However, after finishing the book I realized it was an absolutely pointless book. There were no real lessons to be learned from the book except for the fact that a person will learn that poverty is a woman's problem (unless you want a woman to become a victim for a man's financial support). I just wish I could have learned a lesson from the fact this book is so pointless.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an enjoyable read, but it leaves you with the feeling of being robbed. It starts well and the pacing is perfect. Then they have the characters try to get what they want at all costs. It's so obvious to the reader that they aren't actually trying to be honest, it's just the way they behave. My thoughts:  I read it in about two days and my husband and I decided we had to read this book as soon as we got home. It was my husband's first foray into romance and I didn't want it to be a big disappointment. It had some flaws, but overall it was well-written and enjoyable. I thought it was the perfect length for a romantic novel, and I don't think it could have gotten any better. It may be a little confusing for someone who hasn't been through a relationship with someone who is married before. But I liked it, and the characters are interesting enough to make you care about them. The romance is subtle and easy to follow, and you are invested in them. I'm sure that I will read the sequel soon, and when it comes out, I will definitely read it again.

I found the descriptions of the books they were comparing to and comparing themselves to to be a little weak.  As far as the writing is concerned, I found that a lot of people could have done with a few more adjectives.  In conclusion, I thought I'd give this book a 2.5/5 stars out of 5, but it doesn't deserve it.  I would say this is well written. It's very short, and they compare their own experiences with some of the more common complaints I've heard. The book does not compare their situation to what everyone else has, but rather to how they see their situation compared to others. That said, I feel the book was better when compared to other books I've read that compare their experiences to the hardships of others. So for example, one of the complaints is that the guy gets a promotion because he's willing to sacrifice his own needs for others' needs.  The book describes how the person who would be on the first floor getting paid the least is at a disadvantage because he has to put up with the person up there.  Now the guy might think that sounds great, but for the people who can't live on the second floor, that isn't ideal.  So, for example if someone had to buy a used car from the first-floor guy, that could cost him more than it would cost the second-floor person to buy the car. That's why I don't agree with it as an example.  Some of the descriptions could use a lot more examples, but that's only a minor complaint. When reading the book I was expecting more from it. But even if I would have liked the book more, it's still a worthwhile read, if just for the discussion of what others think is reasonable.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     I read this book expecting it to be a really good horror book, but when I finished I felt a bit disappointed. The story is told in a really slow and monotonous way, which is something I don't usually like, and the characters, not just the main character, are not as good as I would like. One reason was because the main guy, the author who wrote the book, is very bad at writing. Other reason was the plot. The author did not seem to care about the plot at all. When he has a chance he just goes straight into his description of the horror. That is very annoying for me. This book did not have any real action, the scenes of horror were not intense and it was really boring. There were a lot of words I would have removed, but I have a feeling the author will not be making that decision.  This book is definitely not for everyone, because there are many parts that are boring and the plot is really dumb, but it is still a good horror story. I gave this book 5 stars because it was a great read, but not much more.  the ending was very unsatisfying. I think it could have been made a little more exciting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I loved this book. It had all the things I love about a good YA book, but also made my heart soar. I could not stop smiling at all the beautiful details and happy moments. But it did have one big issue. If you read it in the first person and were hoping to see things happen to the main character, you will be disappointed. It was a bit predictable, but I did not mind. I would have liked to have seen more of her life and a bigger role in the story, but that will have to be some other time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I read this book for a class. I did not like it. The writing style is sloppy and the plot line was confusing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- My sister and I have had this book since it came out. She didn't like it and it took me forever to get over. But, it is a classic. It has a lot of good material about the American Indian struggle. She did like it when she read it when I was in school. But the things that upset her and I still don't agree with her are: 1. I would not recommend this to anyone but a history student, because the Native Americans aren't the only Americans who had to deal with this problem. The Romans had slaves who were African, the French were not nice to their slaves (the same as the Iroquois), the Irish had to put up with Irish slave owners. 2. The story of this book was not important. You need to have a basic understanding of American history and how slavery evolved in this country, so that you can understand the basic events of this story. The stories are all about white people, so you know that they weren't bad. The Native Americans are not interesting in this book either. I just felt as though it was a history book and that the Native American story was not that important. It is a story of how some Native Americans had to struggle, but not to the extent that it was going on in the other parts of the country. I understand why this book is so well-loved though. It was one of those classic books that has a huge following. I don't understand why though, that it would upset people when they read the Native stories. I guess it is all in how you read it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would like to add a personal note.   For a fantasy book that was supposed to be a novel of epic proportions, The Red and the Black were completely disappointing. The plot, as I had expected, did not progress and did not change. There were two chapters I actually read and thought I had been sucked into a Tolkien-esque story until I came back and saw that, while it was indeed the same, the author had not taken the time to fully develop it. One of the characters was completely useless and no more than a plot device that made no sense, just to be there. The last two-thirds of the book (if it has a final third) was just uneventful and nothing at all really new in terms of how the events were handled. The main characters were either boring or too annoying for me to care about them at the end.   it just didn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   If you like to read but don't have time, or find you have to write a bunch of times to get something done, then this is for you. This is not a book to read in one sitting. It is a book you should work through and get some stuff done.   However, when you read a book, you don't always want to have it on the brain at the same time as every other thing you're doing. So the book is not going to be right in front of you. It's going to take a bit of time to get to it. In my case, I had to put this down and do something else to get some of the more important things done. I have not seen that book around so I don't know if it is even out there. I haven't seen it on sale anywhere either. Maybe I should get the book on the next Kindle Fire.   a book that is good but takes a bit to get used to: ____________________________________________________________________________________________   This book is well written but takes some time to learn how to use it correctly. The book has lots of exercises and you have a list of things to learn. The problem is that the exercises are not very well written. You have to take your time and figure out the rules, what the exercises mean, etc. This will make the book very time consuming.  /end
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very misleading, and its message is a poor one. For the most part, I found the material confusing and lacking in substance. There were some parts that were interesting in their own right, however, for the most of the book, I wasn't particularly impressed. I can understand that there are people who would want to use this book to guide their lives, but I find it highly misleading and far removed from the message they're trying to get across. If you're interested in the subject matter, I would highly recommend it. However, I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   I don't even know what to say about this book.   This book was so disappointing that I ended up having to return it and I'll never buy it again.   A couple of things about the book   The first thing that happened to me in the first chapter was that, although this book took place at a college, it seems very much like a college story. There are some pretty intense characters with a lot of character development and it feels like it could have happened in any college (or high school for that matter).   Most people will probably feel that this is a really boring book with very little to do. However, I think I will actually have to read this book for two reasons:  1) I just read a really good book from the 1800's in which the main character goes to a high school and he does not do well. However there is also something that happens to the main characters at a highschool that is interesting. This will help to make it a more interesting book.  2) I have no idea what a "bustle" is.  's story begins about a day before Christmas. A young woman named Emily arrives at the college of her dreams. She gets her acceptance letter and she then decides that her dream will be to attend the school that her grandfather runs. Emily goes and waits for the day that she arrives and when she does, it is not what she expected. Emily is told that she is to become a part of the secret society known as the "Champions of the Dawn" a secret society that has been around for centuries. However it is up to Emily to figure out what this group really is. I'm not a huge fan of secret societies and I just felt that this book was a lot more plotless than I would have liked. The book is told from a third person perspective of Emily who is also going to be the narrator. There is a lot that is said about her but it is only in a very brief description.   the second thing I noticed about the first half of the book is that there are quite a few sexual scenes but it just felt a bit too rushed.  .   a third thing about the story was that Emily was supposed to be a pretty shy person so I didn't expect her to go through this much at the beginning. Also, I did not know much about this school so I did find it a little hard to believe that they would have so

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I don't know why I read this book. First, I didn't. The author, Michael Scott (not the actor, but the book's author) gave me a lot of hints, but not enough to make me understand what was going on in this story. The main character, David, is a young American missionary, but even his friends tell him that he can't speak English and that he's a terrible missionary. When his mother dies, David must leave the US and travel to a poor community in Mexico called La Paz, where he tries to prove that he is a good missionary. He has a terrible time in Mexico, and by the end of the book, he thinks he has "made a horrible mistake" by coming to Mexico. He also learns that he has been living for months on a street corner in La P the whole time. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________ Note: This book is currently being republished in the United States under the title of The Promise of the Gospel: The Story of David and His Mission by Michael Scott, Jr. (Doubleday, 1993).
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book was nothing special. It was just another in a long line of self-help books written by people who have no idea what they are talking about. The author has been known to have a problem with the truth. I have seen him lie, plagiarize, and distort things on the Internet. This book is no exception to this. He quotes two other books (one of them is a collection of quotes taken from other books) with no regard for consistency. I cannot understand how someone can have any success in a self-improvement book if he has problems with facts and truth. This will not help anyone, especially not if they are looking for a shortcut to happiness. The main reason why I do not recommend this book to anybody is that the author does not follow through with the instructions on how to use it. It doesn't say what to do, just gives you a "quick start" on things. When the book tells you what to write on your first page, he tells you that it will be more powerful if you make a list before you start writing it. That was a waste of my time. I do think that the "quick Start" advice is good if you are just starting out or you don't know what to say. The "quick" start did not give me the results that I was looking for. For example, he said to write something like this: "The secret to long life is to focus on doing what you love and not what you don  This book was just a bunch of nonsense. It has not changed anything for me since the first time I read it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I will finish the rest of my reading and find something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I liked this book at first, then I became a little annoyed by the author's tone and style. I don't like writing reviews that don't get to the point! If there's one thing this book needed it was a little more romance and romance/sex and a little less horror! I don,t want to read a book with just horror/sex/romance/violence in it. I'm still looking for my next bad book that I can read and find a way to give the author a few more stars for his creativity and writing. (Also, for those that do get into the books, it's pretty scary and dark, but still fun).  27 of 31 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    Posted by: Anonymous at 06:28 PM   If you are an author who is seeking a publisher, you may want to look into the work of author John Grisham, who has been a successful book author for over thirty years. He is a true master at selling books. In an article in The Economist magazine, Mr. Grish Am wrote the following: "In the last fifteen years, the rate of new books that fail to sell more than one copy a year has fallen by more than a third. That's an average decline of more than fifty percent. And it's just a fraction of the collapse in the sale of print books, where sales have been in freefall for decades." John Gratams new book is a best seller. The book "The Secret" is selling extremely well. He has also written a number of other best selling books, such as "A Thousand Clowns", "Billion Dollar Babies", "The Power of Nightmares", and many more. He lives in Atlanta, GA, and is an author, radio show host, and an author of several other bestsellers. You can read more about him at his website www.grisham.com He is very successful at selling his books. His best selling book is his latest, "The secret." His other books are in the top-selling list. You should definitely check him out and see for yourself if he is a good book writer. I have personally recommended him to many people who have asked to learn how to write. John Gras is also a motivational speaker and speaker coach. If you have any questions about writing books, please contact John Grasham or listen to his free podcast at www.podcasttalk.com John Grats most recent book, " The Secret," is in the best-seller list in paperback, ebook, audiobook, and on Amazon in its various formats.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the hardcover, but was very disappointed that it had no index. The first two chapters do not have indexes, so I had to go back and reread them, and it made me angry to read the characters speak so poorly about each other. I had assumed that the characters would get along because they are all from the same city.   I do not believe that the author had any real intention of conveying any information about the book's world or history to the reader.  There was no sense of history, and nothing to tie the characters together.    It was just two people trying to get by, and that made the story repetitive, and uninteresting.     It's so easy to read these books!  And I think you need to know what this world is like before you read one of these books.  I don't know if I'd read this book again, but it will make me want to have the first book on my shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ ____________________________________ My daughter loves this book. When my wife got her it was the perfect way to get rid of books. It is a small, light size, with a bright red cover that is perfect for a small child. There are no pictures on the front of the book which is a plus for her and me. The book has an excellent back cover with illustrations of each animal, bird, dragon, snake, and creature. The back cover has two diagrams for a parent to reference, one for each side. The first diagram is a drawing of each creature, birds, and creatures. This is great if I have to explain what the creatures look like, and they have a picture. The next diagram is of the animals, birds and creatures in the story. It was great if it was just what the children saw in the picture. This book is fun and easy to read. This was my daughter's favorite.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   It seems a little strange that the author claims this book is about "the best selling book" of the year, but his description of it (and other books) is a mess, from the start. I have not bought any of the other books in this series. When I was finished with this book, it was as if I had never read it. It seems he has created a new character, named "Sugar", and then decided to write about her and the people around her.   If the main character in this book was an ordinary person, I might be okay with it. Unfortunately, the main characters of the books are just awful. I hate to say this, but there really aren't many characters in the book. There is one major character, Sugar, and the rest are all just like a bunch of the same people I already know. She spends a lot of time complaining about her new job, and she is never the most interesting character to read about. Her brother, and friends all seem like they have nothing interesting to say about. There are lots of other characters, and some of them don't seem all that interesting either. I also found that it wasn't really clear how everyone's character was going to develop. Was the boy going to be the best person at all times? And how was he going to come to terms with his parents getting married?   I just feel like I read this book too fast. It would have been a lot more entertaining if I read it a little more slowly, especially since there are only two characters.   "The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly" seems to be just another one of the many books he has written, and I don't know if I'm even going to like it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  A poor beginning that was quickly ruined by boring writing. The story told of a man named Daniel, who was accused of murder and the two women he was dating while in prison. His attorney claims that he did not know about the accusations until the day of his trial and that he is innocent. We are then lead through a lengthy and boring book of legal arguments, the court process, and the trial itself.  It's all too boring and hard to keep reading as the case progresses, there's no new information presented throughout the entire case that would have changed my opinion of the case. I don't think this story was interesting at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.  Don't waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I was really looking forward to reading this, but I am now so irritated. The plot is not interesting, it is a bunch of little moments, the characters are uninteresting and one of the girls is not even a good one, the whole story just feels like something that has been written to get a cheap rating and a review. I could have been more creative with my negative review, but to me it does not really matter what the positive reviewers had to say, I could not care less about it, if you have read this book then please do not read it, it's rubbish.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I think the book could have been done better. I found it very boring. It's all about what you think would happen if this or that happens. It doesn't really go into the details. I felt very much like reading the script. Very uneventful. The narrator sounded like he was talking to someone who had to be kept quiet. She also talked about "being around that kind of thing". It got very repetitive as well. In fact, I think this book can benefit from being reread by someone who has a different view of life.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I have ever read. When I was 13 years old I read this book when I was going through a divorce and I couldn't bring myself to finish it. This book is nothing but racist crap. It gives the reader the impression that African Americans are stupid and have no intelligence. It has nothing to do with science or medicine. It doesn't mention anything about mental health or psychology.   It has a bad history, but that is beside the point. The history is horrible. The people in the book are the same people you meet in any book of slavery. A good story could have been told that was a better story. But a bad one is still a bad story. The author is lazy and doesn't even try.   is a terrible book. I wouldn't recommend it. It is not only racist, but it is completely uninformed. This is the reason this book is written: to make money. It does not even try to make a better history for it's purpose. The story was written as if the author is trying to explain things to others but still isn't able to understand the subject of his writing. The writing in this book was atrocious. There is no grammar. One sentence in this novel is a grammatically incorrect sentence. It was written like that because the author did not know what was going on.The author makes it seem like racism is a fact of life in America but the reader is never told it is true in the story. This author is the same person who wrote the book that got Martin Luther King killed. This has got to be a big problem for a historian to write a book like this because the people will have a false impression of history. It would be easier to write about the actual events that occurred. The racism in this story was not a thing that happened in history; this was a fiction of a fictional time in history.This is not a book that I would recommend to people that are going through hard times in their lives. This may be a good book for teenagers or adults, but not for kids. It may be fun for people who like to read stories about slavery. But as a history book it is so bad it is not worth reading. This history book is racist and it is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book had a lot of good points and made me smile, but the ending is way too much of a bad thing. I had planned on reading this book for a little over 2 weeks before I got it and was super pumped for the whole thing. So when I read the ending, I was like what? the book wasn't even close to being as bad as I thought it would be, which I know was very unfair to all the hard work the author had put into this book. I didn't know who this author was but he didn't make a big name for himself, but I guess he just went off and got drunk a lot, and this book is the result. My only advice to this author, go back and read your earlier novels. If you do that, you'll see what I mean. It doesn't matter if you're not the biggest author, you can still make your own name. I don't know what you were doing the past few years, but stop drinking and writing novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because of the title, and I had always liked horror and urban fantasy books, so I figured this would be an enjoyable read. Boy was I wrong. It is so, so, SO bad that I couldn't even finish it. In the beginning, the author described a very, very frightening scenario. It would be like a horror movie where you could hear voices or see things like ghosts. She then went into the details of what would happen to the protagonist, a female protagonist. Then, in the second chapter, she described a woman who had been killed and had her body dismembered, but there was no mention of anything else. So, I was so confused. Why did I buy the book, and why would I have bought the book if I had to read about the female character being killed and dismem  So, now, I have read the novel, and in the first chapter, it starts off with a person going into a room, and the door closes behind them. They enter a basement, and there are four other people there, a man and two women. One woman is a child, and one is a middle-aged woman. I didn't really understand much of the story because, as I said, it was just describing what the first part of the novel had told me. I thought that there might be more to it, but it was still so terrible that I just could not even think about it. Then in the middle of the chapter, there is a flashback to when the characters are kids, and it describes some sort of thing that could happen in a horror film or something. So there is some foreshadowing about what might happen later on, but you still have to go with what the story told you to expect.   There were some interesting things that happened in the novel. First of all, there was the aspect of a woman being raped. However, the rapist was not a monster, he was just some man, and she managed to get away. I liked that part of it, it felt very realistic. Another interesting thing that happened was that the woman did not kill herself, she was not murdered. I was interested to know what would have happened if she had killed herself. She was pretty normal and not like a real zombie, but what did she do? She went home and had a drink with her husband. It was all so strange. There was an interesting aspect of the house that it was not quite

The only thing that made this book any good was the cover. I think that this is because it wasn't actually the same person I read about in the book, I thought it was the guy who gave the talk at the end of the book and the last 2 pages where the best and it made it hard to believe that this guy was the same dude. I mean he's not even the one who took the pic at the top, the guy on the bottom who took pics was actually from the talk.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- In a great way, the author created this great book and then decided to ruin it by writing something he thought would please a certain segment of his audience. I was in college then, so I didn't really see the need for it. My dad had read it when I was younger so he gave it to me for my 21st birthday, along with a lot of other comics that were all fun. It was one of those things that people would come up and ask me about. I really had no idea who did it, or why, but at the time it was a lot cheaper than buying the actual comic and I was like "What's the difference?" Well I now know. The first time I read it, I was just like "OMG, this is great! This is just like The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension!" The rest of the time, it was more like "Oh, I don't know, this doesn't really fit into the genre." It was more for me, I guess. Anyway, I did not love this book, so it was not a bad decision at all. (Posted on 4/7/2008)  Great comics! Review by davids  The story of a young boy and his dog, and the adventures that they have, is so good. I just wish the author had used more color. (Updated 3/14/2017)  of the story of the boy and the dog, of the adventures they have the coloring is not great, the coloring does the comic no justice.  Good comics but some bad drawings. (Update 2/22/2017: The author of these books did a good job. A couple of the pages where he went back to color have become a bit too bright but the rest of it looks great.) (Posted by the author, davides on 11/18/2016)  the dog the dog's story is so great,  but it would be even better if he had his own color page. I wish that he would use his color pages in his comics instead of using them to cover up the fact that he didn't do the colors himself. (Edited on 6/1/2017 by Davides)

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************* The world I created is so wonderful but when I got to the part with the story about the dragons I found myself wanting to put my head out the window and scream. The dragons have been around a long time and no one has ever tried to tell them apart. I had just gotten used to their weirdness and now I couldn't stand to see them look so ridiculous. I felt sorry for the other side of the story because this part made the dragons appear less intelligent. This book is hard to rate because you get what you get. The writing was good and the story was interesting, but the dragons had to be the worst part.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In this book I found one story where it seemed that they tried to be very scholarly while trying to sound plausible, but failed miserably. They tried to use scientific names for the monsters, but the scientists were not used to the idea of a monster of another size and shape, and many scientists, including myself, felt this was misleading the reader. This resulted in very confusing story. I felt as though I was supposed to believe this was all a very old story, but I kept wondering about the changes in the story throughout the years. In conclusion, if you like the book and its monster concept, you will likely be disappointed by this. I just did not feel the monsters worked well with the story, and I would not recommend this book to others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very excited about this book.  I really enjoyed the book. I was excited to finally be able to read the book I have wanted to read for over 25 years.   The only thing I didn't like about the book was the way it was written and edited.  It was very choppy and very difficult to read.  If the book had been written well in the first place then I would have not bothered with it. I am sorry but this book is not for the average reader.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to read this book, it was a few years ago and I have read about some good ones and was hoping for another. I got the book a week ago and opened it to a new chapter that I have not read yet. I did not know what to expect, to be honest. I thought it was just like another fantasy novel and so started reading it, which took me 5 hours and now I am just tired. The story was dull at times. One thing was that the protagonist did not seem real to me (at least the beginning). At first I was laughing because he seemed funny at times, then I was confused and he did not make sense. But I just did not get what the author was doing with him and I think it was the writing style of the book. It seemed so realistic but it just had to be so so and not in some fantasy way. I think if you do not like fantasy, this one could be a turn off for you, but if you like fantasy books and want some laughs and not just reading a fantasy novel, then you might like it. Also the characters seemed real to my eyes. They were so well written and had their own thoughts. I read it in 3 days so I did get the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book was not fun to read. I found the plot annoying and the book was poorly written. The author has no clue about how to write in a fun way and her writing style was not very good. This book did not teach anything I wanted to learn about myself. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel because it's written by a different author. *****
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------   The narration is the main problem I have with this book, and it is one that will make people think twice about giving it a try. There is not a lot of information about the character interactions in the story. This makes the reader feel like they are the only person in the room while reading, and this is not helped by the fact that the author says something like:   "I was a bit hesitant at first as to whether she was really a good person, and that's understandable, I mean, she was crazy."   This really seems like a cop out to me. As if this character needs to be so clearly defined, and there are too many people who have to share their thoughts and ideas about her.   I think the most important thing to read about is what the character thinks about the situation in the book. It's okay for a character to have a few ideas about a situation, but if that is the only thing you think about about that person, it makes you feel like you are the sole person in that room. I'm sorry, but the story and characters need to stand on their own. If you don't want to care about what a character thinks, then don't read this book. If that is all you want to think about, then by all means, read this novel. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because it does what it says it does. I loved the book, but I feel as if a lot is left unsaid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!!!! This book is not worth the price. I got this book at a library sale for less than $5. I wanted to be able to read the Bible when I was younger, and was delighted to find it in such an inexpensive form. But it did not read well. I am very disappointed. The stories are good, the author is good at writing, but this was a wasted opportunity for me to learn more about the Bible than I could from this book.!!!
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I don't like this book. I got a copy in a sale from Amazon. I read the last 20 pages or so. I just didn't like it at all.   I like good writing. I like good characters. I've never liked this guy. He seems like he is out for himself and doesn't care about the other characters. The whole situation reminds me of the film "The Exorcist". I just can't stand the guy.  , a good novel in my opinion, but just not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I just read this book and I must say that I loved it! I felt like I was learning something new about myself all the way through it. It was a very good read and was well worth the money.   It was hard at times to put the book down because there was so much to learn, but I am glad I did. I feel like my life has been shaped a lot by this book. It helped me learn how to cope with stress, change my thoughts and improve my communication skills. It gave me a deeper understanding of myself and my life.   with all that said I also recommend this book to anyone that needs to get back on track after some tough times in their life. It will help to open your eyes and see what is really happening in your life.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________   The story line starts off strong, but it gets stale pretty fast. As a woman who had a very difficult childhood, I can appreciate a character who had to deal with abuse but had the fortitude to overcome it. I didn't feel the author was being thorough or that it was fair. At times, I felt that the character was only one step ahead of the story and it was too easy to just jump ahead and forget the details that took place between the chapters. There were points where I was so sure that the story was going to change direction that I kept rereading chapters in search of a "clarification" that I was going the wrong way. I would have been interested in reading about the family dynamics and the love stories. The only character that was memorable was the son and I hope that I get the chance to read a book where that character is truly interesting.   I gave it 3 stars because it was a fun story. I did not enjoy reading it so much as I enjoyed the characters and that's all that matters to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I started reading this book, and I was instantly hooked. The plot is so intricate and the characters so well written and realized that there's no telling what it's going to be like. The characters felt real and the story seemed to have a beginning, middle, and end to it. I've enjoyed several books that I read, but this was the one that made me really want to continue reading. It was hard to put down, and had me thinking about it for quite awhile. I know this review is kind of long, and it seems like you're just rambling about the book, but it's kind of important to me, so here goes: ************** I loved the writing of this book. I liked the idea of a world where magic is still the norm. It felt like a story I could really get into. I also liked the fact that the author really went out of her way to make sure the readers were introduced to some very interesting characters. The author really does a good job of developing the characters, I love the way that they all feel so real, that you really want the characters to live, and so you start rooting for them. The romance between the two main characters was also really well written. It made me want to see their relationship continue, and that I really would like to see how it turns out. The best part of the book to me was the ending. I feel like it was meant to be. The ending was so good that I couldn't believe I wasn't going to get to know any of the characters that I had read about. There was just so much going on, and there was no way that I would have been able to get all of it in to read. I think that a part of it is that it's not like that often, but when it is, it makes a huge difference. There is nothing I like more than reading a good book that is just an awesome story, and this is definitely one of those books. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone looking for something different and exciting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________   "My favorite character has to be Caster, and this is one of the best pieces of writing I've ever read. And yet, she's just a little girl."   I hate to start this review off as a negative one...but...I am just not a fan of the Caster character in this book. I'm not a big fan of teen characters either, so I can't help feeling this character is very underdeveloped.   As I've said, I really liked the characters of Caster and Tilly. They were like real people...just like my friends and I. They didn't have big personalities, but they were just as complex as any of us. Their love for each other was palpable. Caster's mother was also a very strong and independent woman. She never took things too seriously or downhearted when things were tough. Tilly's mom is a little more of a softie. She's a mom who doesn't want to be with her husband all the time, but she's always been there for him and it's nice to see. Cress is a big brother who is very protective of his sisters...I like that.   is such a beautiful novel. You'll feel the love and care put into each character in the way they talk about the characters. It's truly touching. It reminds me of a child's book where everything just comes together and they're able to come to a conclusion. This was a beautiful and touching story about a family with a lot of love, and that made me love it.   The romance was really quite cute. It wasn't super fleshed out...but the ending of the book is wonderful.

I think he was thinking that this was an important subject. "This one is on the brain" is an interesting story about a patient who had some neurological problem, and got radioactive radiation to treat it.

But he had been an out of town guest at one of the nuclear power plants for a day or two, and probably did get a little radiation, but that is all. "  (read more)

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________   What a disappointment.   This is really a novel about nothing. It tells no new story. It barely touches upon the character's past. It's essentially a summary of the main events of the previous books, except worse and with nothing new to say.   is really just a summary. The only things I think is interesting is the fact that the characters are so well developed. The characters have a past and are trying to survive in an uncertain future. They have families, friends, struggles. We see what the world of the future might be like if the main character's parents were not killed and the other characters survived.   the book opens with our main character who has been kidnapped by the other character. In this future world, our main characters live together, although we do not see this. The main character is kidnapped, interrogated, tortured and beaten while in captivity. The kidnapping and interrogation are done for reasons of revenge and revenge is in the past. The kidnapper, who also wants the revenge, tells us the main characters' name and they tell me their name. This story is told through flashbacks and flashbacks of the kidnapper's past as well.  I don't know if I will finish this book. It is just a synopsis of the last book that has nothing new or exciting to say about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure how much this book did, but it ruined any hopes I had for The Book of the New Sun. If you are reading this and you don't think that's an insult, then you are totally wrong.   The characters were boring. The whole plot of the book is the characters trying to find a reason to continue the story, and the author is constantly reminding them how pointless the story was.   the story is about the journey the protagonist is on, about finding out his reason to keep on living and how he is going to get out of this mess that is his life and get a new one.   on a positive note, there is a lot of action in this book.   I liked this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all fairness, I was really looking forward to the new "Wizards of Oz" book. I was expecting it to be about a different type of Oz - one that had not been seen on TV, and was still fictional. I liked the idea of the movie Oz. I also had read in a previous review that it was set in the 1950's so I hoped that it would be set in California or somewhere. Well, I'm going to say this right out of the gate: The new book is all about New York! The book takes place in Los Angeles, and it's just the worst in the world. I'm sorry, I really don't know what the point of this book was. It could have been set in any time period as far as I can tell - it's not really an American setting. The characters all say exactly the same things over and over again. It is a typical book in that it is really good at using the first person plural but that doesn't really hold up when you are trying to understand what the characters are talking about. All the characters say the same lines and they say them in the same way - which is great - but at some point you have to figure out what they're talking about, and then they can be made out. I think the "new" "Wizard of Oz". (The movie is not very good) It really is a terrible book. It takes place mainly in L.A., but it's really New York, and I don't mean that in a negative way - in many ways it's the New York of today. I don a lot of the things that I think about when I go out into the world and I try to imagine what that city was like in 1900 - or what that world would be like in 1920. (The city in the book is really a lot nicer and cleaner, with no pollution.)The story begins in the year 1885, with a small boy who dreams of going to Oz. He goes to his mother who tells him that he has to go to Oz before he grows up. The boy goes, and he meets the wizard, who introduces him to the wonderful world of Oz. The kid gets to know and like the wizard and they have adventures, and all the time the boy is growing up he thinks, "I want to go and visit Oz." When he grows into an adult, the wizard tells him, "You'll grow up to be a great
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was so short, with too much plot, and just too much drama. It seemed the authors couldn't think of one interesting thing to do with the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     The writing is sloppy and confusing  I found the writing sloppy and confused. There was no consistency at all between the three major characters (Ruth, Riz, and Burt) except they were all trying to do the same thing and to try to do it without a common ground or even understanding of each other. Riz and Ruth are trying to kill the alien and Bort trying to save it and Riz is trying to steal it and Ruth and Buse are trying not to get caught and kill the aliens as a distraction so they can get the alien back to the city for a ransom. So basically there is nothing like a common cause or a common enemy or something to keep everything together. It just felt like a disorganized mess of random events.   There was no explanation as to the circumstances of the alien abduction or what it did to the people who witnessed it. There is nothing to connect the events of the abduction to what the abduction is doing to the abductee. It really didn't have a purpose.  ...  There is no development between the characters or the plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was boring and I didn't like it. But a bit of a twist is needed. The writing style is a bit clumsy, and the prose is so-so.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________ I've just read The Drowned City by Ken Follett.  I was thoroughly entertained but not particularly impressed.  The characters had a great deal of life but were very flat and uninteresting.  It was also hard for me to read because I found myself wondering if I was reading an author's commentary on the situation or a description of the situation.   There were some pretty dark elements to the book.  Some of the writing was very bleak and realistic.  Although I enjoyed reading it I am reluctant to recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A very poor and tedious book, I felt a bit sorry for the author because he wrote about all the cool things you could do in a car, and the car just sat there idly. Recommend this book to:   I have read this book, and I'm glad I did. If you're looking for a book about owning an E350 and can handle the learning curve of a vehicle, this book is for you. For the most part, it's very informative and entertaining. As I said, it has a nice combination of knowledge and fun. I'd recommend this book. It's not the fastest way to get from point A to B, but it will get you there safely and get you out in the sun for a few hours.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this book. The characters are too one dimensional and it felt like the author was trying too hard to get the reader to like all of them. The narrative was awkward, the story wasn't original, and the author couldn't pull together the plot in an interesting way. I think this book would've been better had it been a stand alone novel.  My rating for this book: 1/5 - it's a bad read
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ is terrible. It was like a bad episode of The Twilight Zone or something. Very strange and surreal to read about a man in a very strange predicament. His wife had passed away and they were in a state of grief over her. The woman who was the love of his life (it was hard to believe) had a daughter that was born. She was very young when she died and they only saw each other for a few hours each month. When they were together, she was like the only person that ever came into their lives. But since their daughter was a few years younger than the two of them, they were very close. In a state where he was a recluse, and his marriage was on the rocks, they decided to see the world. They spent years traveling to places they visited as a couple. This is when things started to unravel.  When they finally landed in a place that was not the place where she grew up, the two were stunned to find that they were the only ones left. The town was now infested with zombies and had been since the zombies attacked. They tried to find a place to live, but it was already in a zombie infested state. There was also a very dark past involved with the town and the man. It wasn't until years later that he realized he was the same man that had killed his wife. It's a strange story that left me feeling uneasy. It did not leave me feeling at all hopeful. I think the author did a better job than I did. I had no clue what was going on or why the two people were in the place. The two made some plans and eventually moved into a house. After years of being together, their daughter grew up to be the same age as their daughter, then the woman in the story got pregnant. Now that they had a child, they started thinking about having another child of their own. Things took a turn for the worse and their marriage was in chaos. They were both having trouble in the bedroom. This left them feeling very frustrated, and the woman left to live a solitary life on her own. After that incident, the husband became obsessed with the fact that he and the deceased woman had a biological child together. She had no right to get pregnant from a stranger, no matter how many years ago it was. We did not even know if they were married. There's some strange stuff about this book that made me feel a bit uneasy. The

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really bad book.   I have a hard time reading bad books.  But this is a truly bad book and I don't think I have any right to complain about a book that was so bad it makes me wish I'd never read it in the first place.  The story:  First off I want to say the book is really bad.  I don;t know if this is because of the plot (which I don?t think it is) or because it was written poorly (which seems to be the case), but this book just doesn't work.  It is also so badly written it makes it hard for me to believe the author can even read.  To be fair, the book doesn?t have a particularly bad plot, but I just can?t believe that an author who can write this poorly even knows how to write a plot.  You know when you read a book and just get so bored you just want to stop reading, even though you know what?s going to happen next?  This book was just that.  And I don,t think that there?s any way that the author could have known how bad the book was going to be.  So that?s my take on the book. What really didn?t work for me:    I guess the main thing that really didn't work for the book for me is that it just didn?  It?s a really boring book. I don???t think the author is very good at writing dialogue, but even when he is, it still seems so cliche.  There were times that I just wanted him to just throw the book away and make a whole new book (the way he did with his first book,  The Last Hero, which was really good).  You don?ts not get any real depth from the characters in the book, because they are just so stereotypical.  When I think about it, the characters were just the worst part of the book at first.  They just felt like there?t any reason to care about them.  After a while I just started liking them, but it was a really weird process.  For the most part I just?t really got the point of the characters (it was still fun to hate them and see how bad they could get) and I think that it was hard to tell if they were supposed to be any more than generic villains.  This kind
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all the years I've been reading, I've never read an entire book that was completely devoid of enjoyment. This book was that, even after reading it a second time.   I was expecting a fun read about vampires. In this book, vampires, werewolves and humans had been fighting, but I've always thought that humans and werewolves had the advantage. Well, my assumption was completely wrong! Humans, werewolf and vampires were all so much weaker than each other. It almost looked like the humans and vampires had been working together, since we didn't see anyone that the other werewolf or vampire could identify as a human or a werewolf. I guess the werewolf/vampire would know what the werewolves' or vampires' weaknesses were, and then the humans would attack. This is why the weregild in the novel was so important. The weregoloths were able to communicate with werewolves, and were able control werewolves to kill their human enemies. The humans and humans were also able to take advantage of the weakness of vampires, and also learn what they could do to weaken their vampire weaknesses. All this helped the humans gain the upper hand.   of course the werezoloths also had their own weaknesses. The vampires and humans are both intelligent, but the weresoloths are simply more powerful than the vampires and the humans, since they can read minds, and had already been trained to be even more powerful. It just went on and on.    I had heard that this book was written with an American author in mind, and I thought this is just a bad excuse. It has such a big difference between the were vampires and weresols. It's so hard to believe that people in America can't tell the difference between a were vampire and a weresolo. And this isn't even a vampire or weresolar series! This is the first book in a series!   There were things that were very annoying though. I really wanted the werevampire to be bitten to death by the werelun. This would have been amazing, since the were werewolf would be able to bite them too. Well the wereslur had a much different weakness than the vampire, and there were a lot of times that the were vampire just had to eat their own blood, or a human would bite them to death. The only problem with this is that the vampires were too powerful! They killed and ate everyone
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I gave this book two stars is because it's not the book I wanted and didn't get. I wanted a straight forward, action packed, hardcover book with characters I can really relate to. When it comes to books I think people are more interested in seeing how things are done then anything else. I was looking for a book that would have my favorite characters and plot twist and I found a book with that. I have read a lot of books and loved them. This book I would not recommend. If I was a person who bought this book, I would get a book I knew I liked, not this book with the plot twist. I would have liked to see an action packed book with action, suspense, and twists that I loved, not one that was like an action movie and was only told by the characters in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a wonderful book! I read the first 2 chapters and was hooked from the beginning. A brilliant combination of a modern historical account with a fantastic adventure story. I loved every aspect of it, and was excited to begin the 3rd part.   Unfortunately, I read it about 4 days ago and have just been so happy to have the next 3 chapters. So exciting and good. Unfortunately, I'm now in a terrible mood, I feel very guilty about it and am feeling really sad about how I feel right now. I feel like it would be good to talk to a therapist about my anger issues and why I'm so upset. It's really hard to read the characters' emotional growth and not feel really bad about myself for being so bad.     So sad, I really did enjoy it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "how" is the thing.  This is a great "how-to" manual for anyone that is thinking about starting a business.  It's easy to put together a good business plan.    It's difficult to implement.  I learned the hard way how to create a successful business plan and then was surprised to find I had to start all over again.  The one area that did seem like it could be improved would be the section about recruiting.  In particular the suggestion to "look for someone with the right skills" seems rather vague.  If you are looking for someone who knows a lot about marketing or sales, you will find them in marketing or in sales.  Even if you can find someone with a marketing background or sales background, that doesn't mean they know how to build a business or get things done.  At best you are getting someone who will work with you for an extended period of time for free.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a good book, very bad writing  This is a very bad book, it was very hard for me to read and I feel the authors wrote this book very badly and just did not care about the story. The author is very unprofessional. The book was a good fun read, however after reading this book I am not interested in reading any other books from this author.   The characters are all completely stupid. It took me to this book because I liked the idea that there was an organisation that was helping people in some ways and they were always good but now they are not. The characters are not well written and make no sense. The story has a good beginning to it, it's a good way to start a new series, however it quickly becomes horrible to read, after 10 minutes the author tries to do a re-write of the book and he doesn't care at all. After about 3 hours into the book I felt that I was watching someone watching something they made in a video on Youtube. The books writing is bad and the story is made up of very poor characters and story.   the author did not write any characters like in Harry Potter or any other series. It is all very bad. The best way to describe the characters is that they are stupid, there is absolutely nothing interesting about them. The first half of the story they were ok, but the author made a change halfway through and everything just went to shit. The only reason that I didn't give the book a 1 is because I was hoping for a happy ending. I know there is not a happy end here. It was a pretty awful book. I was very disappointed.

The son wants to get revenge, so the father, his family and his daughter have to make a sacrifice in order for him to get his revenge. That's all. I'm sorry that this book is so short, but it was good.  Review originally published September 2014
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a serious dislike of the authors name "Ruth". I was in shock at the time because I'm in love with the author and had read her many other books so it seemed like I was missing out. I also found the style of writing somewhat strange and the prose didn't flow well. It didn't even seem natural to me. The author would sometimes put quotes into the beginning of sentences but I found this to be an extremely odd way to express your thoughts. It felt out of place.   I had a hard time getting through the book. I felt like there wasn't enough substance in the book to enjoy it at the rate of reading. The ending of the book didn't really make sense for me. I'm really disappointed in the series. The next book will be very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________ The book is a collection of poetry and prose written by Richard Adams about his family and a wide variety of subjects, but mostly it's an autobiography. As you'd expect, Adams's family history is fairly standard -- great-great-great grandfather is a general, and his great-grandfather worked for the army. But there's a long section dealing with his brother, Richard, who died when he was 9 from an unknown cause. Adams has been told the cause, but no one really knows (except Adams). The next-to-last section is a kind of family memoir, detailing Adams's own childhood in Great Britain. The chapter on his mother is especially poignant. He doesn't say much, but this description of her is really beautiful: _________________________________________________ Richard was a gentle and affectionate child. He was shy and withdrawn. When he did speak to his brother or sister, it was to reassure them or to say thank you. But when he came to me, as we walked to school, or when he walked into the study, or to the nursery, he was full of energy and laughter. Richard loved his mother and took after her; but he loved his father, as he loved himself. He never said much, because he didn't really know what to say. He had a sense of humor. When asked about his childhood, he often said that it was a great deal like his own. But it was in this way, in this sense, that he was so unlike his brother. He always took the same path. He would have been a general if he had been born a year later. This, I know, sounds silly -- but Adams knew that his brother had to have been the most talented, the most intelligent, the one with the closest ties to the British army. He took this to heart. And yet it's difficult to imagine his brother coming from such a strange background. As I was reading, I kept thinking back to the picture of Richard's father. In many ways, it is Adams's idea of the perfect British soldier. If there was ever an era for the modern, the Second World War was it. Adams's father was a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Artillery, and the regiment had been formed as a training unit for officers. As Adams puts it, the men of the army are a bunch of "brilliant people." In fact, so much is common to the men in uniform that Adams describes how the day before
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________ I don't understand this. I haven't read this book, so I cannot comment. But I read some reviews and the one that I agree with is: _________________________________ I really like the cover, but for the cover I'd have to give it a 2 or 3. But there is so much to get off this cover...I have seen several copies in this shop and the prices were almost a dime...It must have been so many years since I purchased a used book. I will purchase the book for sure. The content in this book is fantastic. I'll read it the first time. Thank You for the review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book pretty terrible. It seemed to have been written by a middle aged, nerdy girl. I could not believe what I had read. The character had no real depth. I found her to be shallow and unrealistic. It was really weird to read a book that was so terrible to begin with. I feel like there was no real attempt to make it sound like a realistic story. I don't think it could have been made much worse by adding a real villain. I wish they hadn't bothered with the main character. It made it even more unbelievable.  I could never stand the character. She was not one of those strong, beautiful girls you would want to be friends with. She had no personality and I could see why everyone liked her so much.    It's hard to believe that this book made it out of the publisher's hands. I can't think of any good reason.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ A VERY poor book. This book was written by a teacher who just graduated from a high school where her class is the only non-Christian. She describes what she believes to be God's plan for the world, and it is based on the Bible and no one's evidence or observation has anything to do with it. I'm sure God is very pleased with the way her class will turn out in the next life because it is not based on evidence. However, because she just graduated she can write whatever she wants about anything. I can understand how some people find this material attractive but I am very disappointed in the content and overall book design.  Review of DJB Books' The Life of Christ by Brian D. King on February 08, 2012 :  This book is probably my favourite book ever published. I have had several other reviewers on this site suggest that this book is the most offensive book ever written, and they are dead right. This is a book that is 100% based on faith, and this makes it worse than any other book ever printed. Not only does it contain very offensive statements about Christians, but it does so without any evidence and without any rational explanation for those statements. The book's claims are so wild that you need to be a believer to believe them. The whole book is very long and consists of many different parts. It has a very high level of error. But, the end result is that you will have to read this book and then go to the library and search all the reference material and the Internet to find out what actually happened at the time of Jesus' birth. If you find yourself going to the Library of Congress, you have found a very powerful book. It is a wonderful thing to learn so much about Christianity while learning about the early years of the Bible in which Christianity began to gain strength. I highly recommend this book for everyone who is interested in learning more about the true history of Christianity. It takes you on an interesting journey and puts you in the position of a believer. I would suggest that you do not spend any money on this book. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a boy named Harry who is trying to help his parents raise money for a house. When their money runs out they get married and get a new house with another man's money. The story ends with a very weird twist. The narrator keeps talking about the house in the last chapter and then he goes back to the beginning and says that this has been a bad chapter. I will never buy this book.   -The last part of the book was a very boring. I had to leave the book and then go and look it up on my own and then read it again to find out what happened. This book is not a story of money and what it does to your family and it is not about Harry's struggle with the marriage. It was just very boring to me, a book that I could get through without the narrator and a book I do not really need in my life.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- This was an interesting read. I was interested in finding out more about the author, but wasn't able to read her books because I'm an English major and I don't want to waste my time on books written in French. The characters and the story are interesting, but the author's English is so bad it's almost impossible to understand. I can understand the author writing in French, but not the poor writing. The fact that the author wrote so poorly in her French books (which I was able to finish) shows she's not able to write well in English. I found it difficult to understand and enjoy a book with poor English. Overall, this book is not worth my time. ------------------------- 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I'm so disappointed with this book, it seems to be about the story that the author didn't like or was unhappy with, and he didn't seem to be very happy with his ending. There are so many inconsistencies throughout that made me wonder what the hell is going on and I couldn't care less what happens next, it was too confusing for me to really care much about the ending and the way the author tries to cover up his inconsistencies, and to top it off the ending is not as a good as I thought it would be. I would have much rather been in the middle of this adventure and have it be a well written story, but this book wasn't it. I don't like how it ended, I want to know what the last page of the book says...I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. The only things I liked was the romance, the way he put up the book and the art and writing. I give this book 3/5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................... Read all the reviews........................................ I have a serious problem with this book. My husband and I read the first page and loved it. It was funny, had a great plot and was fast paced. The next four pages we read as if we were reading it for the first time and thought it was horrible. The characters sounded fake, were so stereotyped and so one-dimensional that we were actually offended by the characterizations and plot. The writing was choppy and it did not flow well at all. This book left my husband and me feeling ill at ease and disgusted with the author. The only reason I got it is because I was worried that my husband was going to tell everyone we're not a fan of children's books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I really enjoyed reading this book, it was fun and light hearted and kept me from feeling the despair and depression that the book was trying to convey. I found it funny, the way a lot of the characters reacted to situations, especially the one who was really depressed. There was a really cute little girl in the book that I found very cute. The main character didn't seem like someone that would feel depressed, not like this. I think I liked the story the best and the character designs were very creative. The narrator did a really good job at conveying the emotions and situations in the story. Overall I liked this book a lot, I think it was a very good read and I think that the author is really going to do well with his future books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "If you are not the type of person that thinks every book is good, you should not read this book. If you are, please do. I think this is the worst book I have ever read.  In this book, there is no mention of any characters or situations that make me roll my eyes at the writing style. This book is just one long monologue from the author. He talks about everything he does or has done throughout the years and makes no mention for those things. This also happens to be the book I read first. There was no point when he started talking about the book being good.  (hide spoiler)  I have read many books with a strong female character that are also quite good and this one was definitely one of the best that I have read. I know that this is not for everyone because there is some sexual tension between the two characters. There is a girl that I don't like and she is not a character that has any real depth to her. I will be trying to read the rest of the series and I think if the author writes the other two books, she could turn this one in to a decent book. I give the book a 4.5 star because I enjoyed it but there are definitely things I would like to change.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you have to give this book a bad rating, it's because you can read it and get a pretty clear picture of where it's coming from.  This is a classic case of someone writing a book with the best of intentions, and writing a terrible book that attempts to justify a horrible worldview.  I understand that he is trying to show that there is some truth to the claims he's making, but he has a very limited view on where this truth is.  It's one thing to say that "you can't know a person is evil from the way they say things," it's a whole other thing to try to justify it from the words they speak.  "If you are really angry at your father, you might be able to rationalize by blaming him for your hatred," is a pretty good summary, but not nearly as convincing as what's actually said.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "Mountain" section was full of stupid crap, and I can't give this book two stars. The first half of the book is "Mt. Everest and Everest" but at some point he gets a description of the other side of Everest, the mountain. The author claims the Everest is over 3000m tall, but there is no way anyone would have climbed it, especially without oxygen. What an idiot! And why the hell did they climb it? I doubt if they would have passed out, which is pretty sure of themselves. I got the impression that they climbed it with a lot of high speed running. Then we come to the middle of the mountain (I don't know if that is the correct place) and there is a lot more talk about the other peak but then you come to this section in the middle, where the author talks about how much easier it is. You just read the section and know it is a dumb story.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ ~~  This book is awful and does not tell you anything useful about how to find your dream job. I wasted over 15 hours of my time on it, just to learn nothing from it. It is so biased against the IT sector, that many IT companies are hiring people from the IT industry, like IBM, Google, Cisco, Microsoft etc, all because of the fact that IT people know how to create a product. I think you should listen to these people, they know the real truth, you just should ignore the biased nonsense that is written for you.   The book is biased against anyone with any background. It will tell you how hard it is to get a job in IT, and will also teach you how to get out of it. You are going to get many useless tips about how you should look for a job and what types of interview you should have, what skills you should be looking for, how you can tell when you're a good fit.   to sum it up, it is a waste of your time and your life. It doesn't teach you anything valuable about what you really need to do to get into IT. If you want to get your foot in the door of an IT company, read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of time. This book explains nothing and doesn't seem to even be about the topic it is about. All of the "discoveries" made in this book are totally incorrect. It is basically the same book over and over again. What I want out of a good book is to learn something new, that's why I bought this book. But if I were an animal scientist, or a botanist, or an animal nutrition researcher, or if I was an exercise physiologist, or any other kind of scientist who might be interested in this topic I would be embarrassed that this book was published in a scientific journal. This could have been a good scientific text for somebody in a Ph.D. program in plant science. I don't have that kind of background. Maybe a good read for someone who is a high school student. If you really want to learn about this subject then buy an actual textbook from a journal or from another source. If nothing else this book can make you laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   I was hoping for an epic book like "The Lord of the Rings", and was disappointed. It was a story that just did not make any sense, and there were many contradictions.   After reading this book I found myself wondering "Why are they all looking for this man?" Was it just me or does every story of this nature seem to end in a man's death?   Also, the author is obviously trying to write a great horror novel but this story was nothing more than pure evil. I found this book a bit hard to get through and was not a fan of the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this book, and I must say, it is a very good book, but I have to say that I found it very confusing. What exactly was the "war" going on? What were the "enemy" nations doing? Why is the "citizenry" so obedient and well behaved? What's the point of having a "government"? Why is a "war"? What's being fought in the book? Was there any real purpose behind this "war", other than for the government to seize the "oil" and "wealth" of the "citizens" of Iraq? The end of the book was rather dull. It was just the same old, same old in my opinion. I am not a fan of the way this book was written. I felt like the author was using "filler" characters to "fill in" the details of the real, historical events which were "saved" in this book. And, of course, the author uses all of his "plots" from the Bible for the "history" of America. I was also confused about what was going on in the last "chapter" of this book because I thought that it was to be a very exciting and exciting "chapter", in the "beginning" of American history, with the birth of America, which would explain why America was to become a "nation". However, all I got was the usual, boring, "tit-for-tat", "warfare" story in this "book". It was very interesting, but it just didn't have that "war fever" I was looking for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book and hearing some good things about it I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed, I felt as if I had wasted my time.   I've always loved the movie "Back to the Future." I remember watching that movie when I was in elementary school and it still makes me laugh. I watched the sequel when I got old enough to understand it. I thought that one was a lot better than the first one. But this one was just...  I'm going to tell you what I loved about the movie, but I'm not sure if it's enough for this review.   the premise is that the kids have a time machine in their house. They have to travel back to the future to save the universe. But they accidentally opened the time machine.   (no really) So their time travels to an alternate future where they have to defeat a villain called Dr. Zorg.   He is a robot from another universe, and he tries to destroy us all by turning on our TV's in the past and bringing them to our present. But then we fight him anyway. So... he's a bad guy, I guess. I mean, he's just as bad as the evil Dr. Evil in Back to the past.   and it was fun. The movie was about three kids who used a time travel machine to go back to a future they created, but accidentally opened it. The kids had to travel through time to fix it so it wouldn't bring down the universe, so they had to go to the alternate future and help the kids and save the earth. But it doesn't last long and they're stranded in this alternate future. Then they go back in time to get the kids back from this alternate timeline. So, basically, the movie was a movie where you go to a futuristic planet and you have to fix the time machines so the planet won't blow up.   "The movie was great!" - me   but this one just doesn't have the heart that the first movie did.   is this one because they're making this sequel and so they need to make it as good as the original or something?   So here's what I'm thinking. I'm going by the movie and it seems like the movie takes place in the "Back To The Future" timeline. If that's the case then they can skip the original movie and start the movie where it was. They can have
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was my first experience with The Hunger Games books. I have been wanting to read this series since I was younger. I was intrigued, so I purchased a copy for $10 on a whim. I read the first book in the series in one sitting. I don't have high expectations for the books, but I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it. The characters are very relatable and well-developed. Even though it is the series that started me on the path to the Harry Potter, I was looking forward to this story. The main character is interesting, and she is pretty cool. She is a bit darker than Harry, so it is not a good fit for everyone. The story does not really focus on the young kids, so this is a good thing. I didn't get lost in the characters, so they didn't overwhelm me. The writing style is a little slow, but it is easy to follow. The dialogue was nice, and I found it to be fairly witty. If you are looking for a quick read, then you might want to read the other series first. I would recommend this series to those who like young adult, young adult/middle school, and young adult romance, because there are some twists that I loved.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. There was only so much I could do to keep the title from clashing with the next book. This book is the first of two that I purchased and can say, is the one that I enjoyed most. I loved the story and the characters and I was very impressed by the level of detail on the people's lives and the lives of their dogs. I didn't find much in the way of spoilers, but I did find out that the man who was married to the woman I was seeing was originally supposed to be the protagonist. I also learned that the woman that I was with for six months was supposed to also be a main character and, if not the main character, then one of the most well developed and well drawn in this series. The only reason that I would not recommend this book to a friend who was on the fence about the series is the same reason I did not give it 4 stars. I liked the plot and characters and found that I liked it all more as I read the first book, but it is a little bit more complicated than I expected.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I found this book by accident. My wife read a copy of this book in a bookstore while I bought a copy for myself. We both loved it. Unfortunately we both got a little tired of it as I found it too confusing and too much at times. We had a hard time following it and I believe that it is too easy to get lost and that the author did not take the time to develop the characters. The ending was a bit too abrupt and did not seem to have a happy ending. This is a must for a family book as the illustrations are beautiful and really put the family back in the middle ages.

She sounded like she wasn't really listening, or maybe she just didn't really get the characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------This book is just too bad. The main character gets kidnapped, and the girl we follow as the hero is an evil overachiever. Her dad is an asshole, and her brother is a total jackass. And the book is written by this guy (not the author) who calls himself a "recovering alcoholic". It takes place in this crazy world of a bunch of girls who are like, the same ages as the main character and yet somehow different (mostly because of how they dress). The books tries to be funny but it is just hard to make it. The hero is not funny at all. And we get a real, life like plot where the heroes try to rescue people and save the world while all this crazy stuff happens. And of course the guy who writes this book is way better than the author. The story is just overblown.  Rating: *  Did you like this story? Please leave a comment, and tell us what you thought of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ "The book is the book but the writer was a horrible writer." - TK  Book details Publisher: St. Martin's Press Publication date: September 19, 2010  "I didn't expect this book to be all that interesting, but I was pleasantly surprised!   The basic premise of this book is interesting, and the author seems to know where he is going. His writing is clear and his sentences are concise. I have found my way through many books in my day, and this is not one of them. The characters are not as likable as I would like them to be. I found them a bit flat, and I could not sympathize with them. At times, they were very unsympathetic, and at times, very unlikable. I was not sure if they were truly bad people or just unlikables.   This was a fun, entertaining read. If you are looking for something light and fun, I recommend this book. However, if you want something that will get you thinking, that will make you reflect and that will maybe lead you to think about your life in a different way, I would not recommend this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* My husband and I love this book! He loved it as well. We even picked it up from a used book store. Unfortunately, we picked it at the same time as another book that he really wanted to buy. I'm afraid that I don't want to spend the money on that one either. I still think he will love it though. My husband has ADHD and this book really helped him see things more clearly. It helped him recognize when he needed to get out of something or think of another solution. He was able to do both of these things and to be able to think on his own. It took a long time to get the information into his head, but once he started thinking about it and writing, it was easy to explain it to him. I really don't know why this book isn't in every used book section. It's a great read for both adults and children!

I do not know why I felt the need to read this book in the first place, I just kept reading because it was a good book. As soon as I realized that this was a bad story, I threw the book away and started reading the last book. This one was soooooooo bad, I wanted nothing to do with it. It made me angry, angry that I didn´t enjoy it as much as I could have, pissed off that it took me so long to even start it. If I could read only bad books, I might as well stop reading. In all honesty, I feel sorry for anyone who had to read it, I really don´t think they need to.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   This is a "so bad it's good" book, and one of the worst I've ever read. The main character has a personality disorder that causes her to act out at every turn, and her constant self-harm and drug abuse puts her at risk of becoming a violent offender in a mental institution. When the protagonist falls in love with the main character's husband, a psychopath who abuses and murders people, the author attempts to add a plot twist about the villain and the hero falling in love, but the plot twist isn't enough to save the book from being utterly boring.   The author takes the plot synopsis of The Good Doctor (1999) and the plot description for The Shining (1980) and throws in the whole thing, but then tries to add another plot twist at the end to give it a more interesting ending. The author takes a similar approach to the plot summaries for The Handmaid's Tale (1985), The Silence of the Lambs (1991), and The Killing (1990), adding their own plot twists and plot lines as the plot progresses, but never actually resolving any of them.   the main plot twist, which comes out of nowhere, takes away from the plot and isn't as good as it could have been. the characters aren't as well developed as the main characters are, which makes the story less enjoyable to read. the entire book is very repetitive, and if you like a good thriller, you won't like it. The story seems like a parody of itself, so I had to stop and turn it off to see if the author would actually end the book.  : ( 5 )
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read "Lincoln," I was very excited to find a historical novel that was free of "political correctness." I did not expect such a negative portrayal of a president's wife, or such a lack of a positive vision for a nation. Lincoln was a nice man, but what happened to the "real Lincoln"? Was it really him or was it just the president's "laid-back, Southern-friendly" persona? I guess I have read many historical novels that were more positive, but this one was definitely not one of them. -Ruth W. "Lies, Damn Lies and History" - The Washington Post I would only recommend this to my friends who appreciate historical fiction. This is a pretty terrible historical book that does not stand up to the standards set by more recent historical fiction such as "The American Presidents," "The Life of Lyndon Johnson" or "The Presidents" by Jonathan Taylor Thomas. However, I'm not so picky that I'd reject it simply because of that. My rating is based only on the writing and the historical fiction part. If you're interested in reading another book about Lincoln, I suggest you read "My Life" or one of Lincoln's letters. -E.F.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a kid I used to love this series. I remember buying the first volume and immediately reading it over and over. It would never get old. This was my first book in the series and I was hooked for good. I would read the series over and again. So as soon as I found out that this was going to be a trilogy I was already very excited. But the first book didn't live up to the hype. There was a plot hole that got in the way of the main character and she lost. The story was great though and the plot got so good I just had to finish it to the end. But I just couldn't find one thing in it that was worth reading over again. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either. Overall this book is a very well written, interesting and engaging story and I will continue to pick up the book and see if the next book lives up to expectations.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book on a whim and had not heard anything about it, which was odd, because I hadn't checked Amazon for many years. The book is short, but it was enough to get me interested and the summary was pretty good, so I bought it. I finished it and didn't like much of it, so it wasn't that great of a purchase. There are so many holes, holes in character, and holes in plot, that it was hard to get through, but I was curious enough about this book that I kept reading anyway. This is a mystery/thriller, so you can kind of guess the end of it as you read, and that's kind of sad because it seemed like the book could have had so much more going for it, but unfortunately it didn't.   The writing is poor. I really liked the premise of this book. It is about a girl who is in a relationship with a guy who she just got into. They were going to wait for a friend to show up, but her friend got really sick and she doesn't want to wait anymore. So she decides to leave him, and he is a bit disappointed that she isn't staying because she's a great friend. I thought the writing was quite well done, and I found it to be quite interesting, but the main characters were really thin, and the plot was so flat, that I wasn't interested in reading the rest of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I read this book when I was a first year medical student and my first impression of it was a lot of wasted money. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is because it really is a good book. The information is so detailed, and so easy to understand that a patient could easily follow the suggestions given in this book and get their medical problems solved. I'd really recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book during one of my breaks at work. I love this series so much. My husband and I read it to each other once a week for the first several years of our marriage and we have both loved it. So, why would I buy another book? I think it's just for the fun of it, I mean, you get to read a book with a very high rating by the guy that wrote it. Well, the book is pretty bad. It's not awful, but it isn't great either. It seems like it was rushed so that they could get it done in time for the holidays and I wish they would have gone back to writing the books they had before they decided to rush them. Also, I think if they had gone back and written more of the books the series has, they might have found a way to create a plot that is not so stupid and clichéd.  So what does this book have to do with real life? Well...   So, to get back to the point, this book has nothing to do on the topic it is about. It has a lot of talking about the history of the land, the history, the culture and how that affects the humans living there, which seems like an interesting topic to discuss with your kids. It also has the talking about what the kids would think about their parents, which is good since this is their first book. I am sure that it will be very interesting when they find out that they are going to be parents soon. But for me, the real attraction is the talk about how the kids were going to grow up and what they would do in life. They talk about their friends and their parents and it's a nice read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucked, but it's a very well written and written well and I think that's what makes this book better than so many other books that are basically a combination of bad writing and crappy characters.   The book opens on a very dramatic scene with the hero being kidnapped by aliens and his father dying in front of him. He is saved by a girl who he is unable to talk to, but has a good storyteller voice and a very good point of view. The main character is named Marko, and he is an alien whose father died in front him. In the first chapter, the narrator describes him being able to talk about what he thinks and feels and how he wants to be a different person, but then he loses his memory and the story goes on from there. I was confused at this point because I thought that the story was over. But then the narrator says that the hero's father is dead and the girl is going to tell him all of his memories when he gets back to Earth. This is when the book begins to get very good. The narrator's writing and the stories told by the girl and the alien make this a very interesting book.   a great story that I did not want to put down, and a good one   I have never read a book that made me want to die, and yet this book made me cry at times. I don't mean the actual tears but the tears of sorrow that came from reading a book with good writing and a story. Marko has a great voice and I love it, it was the perfect tone for this book. The writing is very good and there are some very good scenes in the book. It was nice to be able to read about Marko growing and changing and becoming a man as well as being a good friend. The ending was very good as well, and I loved the ending that the narrator told. I felt that there were a lot of good things to be said about this book but the pacing was off a little bit.  :)
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________  "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" is a book I don't care for at all. I didn't enjoy the film in any way, but that's just the way it is for me with the old Hollywood movies I grew up on. The book is good in many ways, but it's also really bad in others.  The "bad" parts are mainly the plot and the characterization of most of the main characters, both good and bad.  on the bright side, there are a couple of characters I enjoyed who weren't in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I'm sorry I never got around to reading this, but I read it, and the book is atrociously written. The whole thing is an attempt to draw parallels between a story about the Holocaust and modern day issues, but that's not what it is. It is a book about a man's life and his experiences at Auschwitz and the Dachau concentration camp. I can see the connection in one way, but in another way, it is very different. The author attempts to draw comparisons between Auschwitz and Dachaus, but then the story takes a turn to show the horror that occurs at Dachhaus as well. Then the parallels end. I have to say this, I am sorry this book got into print, but it really just isn't worth the trouble, and I'm not sure why it did.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** The plot was so bad! It had to be a made up world of vampires with magic and all of this. I didn't believe it for a second. I have always wanted to read a book about vampires and all the bad things about them like how they feed and all that, I didn-t want it, but I couldn't believe they were fictional. I guess it is my fault I was so young and gullible back then... I would love to know the truth about them, I guess I just hoped they were real. *** This is the only book I have ever read from this author that was so horrible, I was completely disappointed and I had to go back to the beginning of the book to get a new copy so I would get a good look at it and then read it all over again to make sure I didn't miss anything. **** I didn t understand the storyline. I thought it was all for the best because of the fact that I read it in the 90's when this was all new and it would have been hard to get people to understand what was going on. There were a lot of words that were used that I could have used to describe a vampire's sex life but instead I just used more words. *** I love vampire books and I love the genre, but there are definitely issues with this book. I feel like I would have enjoyed the story had the author used a little more of the characters personalities and their motivations. I think a lot would have benefited from the ending of the story. It was rushed for the first half and felt a bit like a cliffhanger that didn't do anything to keep you interested. I liked the characters and I think the book could have turned out so much better if it was written a little better. ** Overall a lot bad and boring. *** ************* 5 Stars for me  My Rating : 1 star *   My Review :  It is a nice story. The book has lots of information about vampires. It gives you lots of info about their behaviors, food and sex. But, it is still a very bad story. I was expecting a little bit more, but it just wasn't good enough to me.  The main character is so naive, she was not even born when the first vampires were created and she is too young to understand that she is living in a fantasy. The only way she can see that her world is not real, is when she goes to
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is so good I cannot stop reading it...but it's also so bad, so overlong, so unoriginal, and so not well written that it's hard for me to finish it! It's too bad because it seems so good, so unique, and is well-written. It's not.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was given this book to read for an English class. The teacher, Ms. Brown, is also a teacher of English. I was hoping for an interesting book, but unfortunately this one was just tedious reading. I found the characters boring. The setting was nothing to write home about and nothing was done with it. I didn't enjoy the story that much, but I read it anyway for the English course.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disaster. Not just a disaster as in a waste of time. It was an insult to intelligence and a complete waste of money.   I picked up a copy of this book on a whim just to see what it had to offer. The cover said it was a historical fiction, so I thought it must be alright.   the cover was intriguing. This was an interesting take on WWI. I was very interested in seeing what kind of writing it would have. Well, first of all, the style was horrible. It had no character, no story, no logic or reason. I mean, it read like it was written by some random person who had no idea what to do with a novel.  ...   Second, the story was a complete rip off of H.G. Wells. The story was about a man named John Snow, who had escaped from London during WWI to live in the South. It took place in the middle of the 20's. The author even went as far as to show his house in a flashback.  , which was a very neat touch.   It took an entire paragraph to describe the weather conditions in England. When I say conditions, I mean what the weather was like when I was growing up. The weather conditions at the beginning of the novel were terrible, with snow on the ground and a heavy fog, and this was in the year 1925.  - I know the book is called 'A Story of a Boy Named John Snow', but I just couldn't take the time to learn any of the characters' names. Not to mention the whole point of the book was how John Snow got out of London during the war and became an American citizen and then made his way back to England.  I found it hard to take the author seriously and his work.  He made it clear the book had no actual plot or characters. The book was only 90 pages long. That's pretty typical for the genre.   with that being said, I would give this a 0 if I could. It reads like it is written by a complete idiot and I would just pass on this.  This review is from: A Story of A Boy Named Jon Snow
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. I read a lot of stories by John Updike. I'm a fan of his books and I think he was a great writer. His books always made me laugh. He had an easy way of writing. It was very short stories but it was very funny. His writing style was really good. I enjoyed it and I liked Updikes books. But this book is not Updikers books. I found it very different. I liked the characters. The author made them real, like my friends or people I know. It made it interesting. The characters were a lot like our friends or family. But the story was not very good. It seemed to be in the same genre as the other Updayers books. And it was really sad. And the story took a long time. The last section was really not interesting and I didn't like the story. I think it was just so sad. But then I read another book and I like this one better. I will definitely read other Updyke books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would like to write a negative rating of this book, because it is so inaccurate and so unfair, as a result of which it is unhelpful in any way to anybody considering or attempting to obtain the book. In the first place, it is unfair that a good part of the book is devoted to the 'possibilities of the present'. It would have been a much more helpful book to have given the author some detailed descriptions of the ways in which things could be changed and changed again. To this point, Mr. Bloggs has only a very general description of possible changes that could have been made. To a very great extent, this book would have become a waste of the author's time if he had not included a very detailed description of all the difficulties which might arise with regard to the use of such a program. Mr. D. P. Smith, as far as the present program is concerned, had the ability and the courage to go to the front and take up a job that was the best one available, but as far I know, he never did. I am glad, therefore, that there is another, and I hope that there will be more, such projects that have been undertaken by future students of the problem, if they wish to try this or the other way. But for the present, the only way in which I would recommend it is as a practical aid to anyone who feels that he may want to do something of the kind. There are things that have to be done, and there are changes which would have to go on, and the present writer has some good suggestions as to ways in Which to begin. I wish, also, that he had mentioned the many and various programs that have already been proposed. I would gladly see a program of this kind given much more publicity.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was a disaster.  There were several glaring errors of fact, and several mistakes of the writer's logic.    I had to go back to the original book to make sure I had read it right.   I know that many of the errors of facts were due to my own confusion of the different words.   However, it is still difficult for me to accept that this author was trying to tell the story of a real person.   Here is an example from the book about a woman who had been born and raised in the town.  I had always heard about this woman, but her name was a mystery.   I was not able to find any information about her when I tried to find her in the book.   The story about her was fascinating, but the facts of her life were unclear.    I had always imagined that the woman in the story was named Jane, but it was not Jane.  She was the name of the man.   And then I realized that it was all a trick, and I thought the writer had gone to a doctor to make this all up.   So I put the book down and went back to my original book, in the hopes that the story would be different.  I went back through the story and it was exactly the same.  I am also very frustrated with the way that the narrator describes what she believes to be the world around her.  As you read along, you discover that there are many other places with different names and cultures.   You are told that people in the woods and in the fields are similar to humans, but you never meet any of them.  The language is always "human."     The narrator tells you that people live in houses, and you never see any houses.  Some of the houses are huge, some are small, but they all look the same, just like the people in them.   What a pity that we could never learn more about people because of the narrator's ignorance of the language, because there are so many other stories we could tell, about people from different parts of the world who lived in their houses.   But because the narrator does not understand how language works, she tries to describe what happens when she goes inside of a house without using proper language.   To the reader who wants to know more about the world, it seems to be very frustrating and confusing.       The most frustrating of all is
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "Gone With the Wind" was a book that I was reading as a child and never realized that I had completely read it until I looked at my older brother and asked him if he'd read the book too and he laughed and said "Of course, you must have read it. What else did you do when you were seven years old?"   ...I know, it sounds ridiculous to me now and I'm not going to lie but it's true.   There are some things in this book that just don't make any sense. I found that out the hard way and I had no idea where the heck the hell the plot was going in the end. I didn't understand the "big twist" at all and I think I was supposed to.   a   When you have an author that's that brilliant as to have completely read a book, then I guess we all have to be really clever to figure out what's going on.     I was just about ready to give up on this book after reading so much about it. My expectations were not high.   the story is so convoluted that there are some points where I just can't wrap my head around it.   in one case it made so much sense that I just gave up and went to bed.  : i think the "magic" used in the book is so far-fetched and not realistic that it's not believable.   and there are several things that just dont add up. like for example how did they have to have the Civil War in the first place. if that was in a different time period it wouldn't make sense. the fact that they had to get the South to secede in the 50s doesn't make much sense either. the idea that they would use the Civil war as a plot device is so much nonsense that it makes me wonder how someone as smart as author could come up with something like that. I think the book really should have been called "How to Write a Bad Book" or some other more descriptive title. i had so many questions about some things that were brought up in the story and I didn`t realize that I would need to google them before I got a clear answer.  . i know, i sound like a broken record, but this book was one of the books that really took me by surprise. I know I'm going to have to buy a second copy so i can read it again and see what else I
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I hated this book. I have never read anything written by Mr. W. C. Mullin, and although it sounds good in the title, I can't believe he was even allowed to write this book, much less publish it. This is a horrible work, filled with horrible descriptions of people. I would have never thought someone as pathetic as Mr. Mullins would write anything good, but I did. It is written as though someone is sitting around the kitchen and cooking up some of the most terrible stories they could come up with. You can almost imagine the author's eyes as he tries to come up and write something so horrible that you would never want to read it. He really tried to have a little fun with the "pagan" world of this story, but all his efforts went right out the window in his attempts to make the story seem more fun. I think it was really meant to be a novel for his children, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I will probably never read this book or ever have the chance to read something so terrible again. I am going to give a bad review to my other children's books as well, until I read these. But at least they have some sense of humor, and are more enjoyable than this awful book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book I enjoyed all the writing style but I felt the story has not reached my satisfaction.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My mother was given a copy of this book when she was about 10 years old, and it was a massive disappointment. I would not give this book another chance. It was terrible. The characters were stupid, the plot was pointless, the writing was awful. I just finished the novel, and I still want to punch a hole in the cover and rip out the pages to burn them. If you read this book, don't bother to waste your time with it. I'm surprised I managed to finish it.   The plot revolves around the lives of two women. The first is the heroine, who is an orphan. She comes from a poor, rural family. Her life changes when she's sent away for an unknown reason to an all-girls' boarding school in the city of New York. Her name is Charlotte. The other character is the protagonist, a young and intelligent, but sheltered woman who moves to New York with her two older sisters and two young children. When Charlotte and the other two girls arrive at the boarding school, they are forced to live on campus in a small dormitory in an effort to provide them with a more comfortable living environment. The girls are separated from their parents and their brother, who was killed in a motorcycle accident when he was 17. When the girls go to the cafeteria for lunch, they discover that a strange and sinister, dark and dangerous girl has taken over the cafeteria and moved it to the back of the building.    A very strange and different book. I couldn't help but feel sorry for Charlotte and her sisters, as they were forced to suffer through what seems to be a very difficult time. I liked the narrator of this story, as she was a voice that felt honest and realistic, despite the fact that she sounded like a girl from a different time. However, it was quite frustrating to see Charlotte, the main character, constantly fighting to avoid the girl in a red shirt. It really was very tedious to read. I was also very disappointed that we only get glimpses of Charlotte's life at school and at home. I expected more, but I'm glad that we don't get to see all of her daily life.   This book didn't feel like a novel at all. I found it very dull and boring to the point of being disgusting. The story was boring and there was very little plot. I didn't care for the characters. Charlotte, despite being a very intelligent and brave girl, didn't seem to

Write a negative review about a bad book: **********I've read three of these books, and now I'm going to have to stop, because I just don't get it at all.The book itself is, in essence, one long list of things he thinks and does that are wrong. From his belief that humans can't be reasoned with, to his belief in a magical world, to him saying that he can get rid of cancer. This is NOT science. The way he says that things work, they don't. He claims that he will cure all cancer and all AIDS with a simple magic "plant" and that the scientific world can't possibly know what's going on. He does this with his "miracles" that involve his miraculous healing plant, which he sells. I mean, how many people sell products that claim they can treat and cure the same thing but don't? How many people claim to be able to cure a multitude of things but don the claim the claims are just false? He says that everything in the universe works according to his understanding of the universe and this is totally not true. And it's all his beliefs.His beliefs are all his ideas, he has no evidence for any of them. He has no idea about the laws of nature, he does not know the first thing about how the universe started, he cannot find the laws that govern the universe, and he claims that God put the laws in the physical universe and that he doesn't understand why they work like that. There's nothing more he can say about this. This guy is a complete mess, and you will not want to listen to him. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what he believes. What he believes is wrong. It's just a huge waste of money, a huge hassle for the customers, and an embarrassment for the world.This was just a waste of time, and it will make you feel stupid and like you're being pranked, and I'm sorry but you are being pranked.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because I wanted to read something about the French Revolution that was not a book written by a political theorist.  Instead I got a book that was very poorly researched and written.  On the surface, the book has the same format as many political history textbooks.  The writer explains the revolution in simple words that are very easy to understand.    The problem is that he ignores many major factors that played a role in the revolution.  He also makes many incorrect assumptions that lead to his conclusions. Some examples:  - It was not the monarchy that caused the Revolution; it was the people.     The peasants and merchants did not join together in a popular revolution against the aristocracy.  This fact was ignored, as if it were self evident. -  The French Revolution was not due to the French monarchy.  It was due to a desire for democracy.  Democracy was the common cause of all the revolutions.  These were the main reasons for the French people to revolt against their oppressive government.  In fact the aristocracy itself had many reasons to revolt.  For example the poor conditions of the peasants. (This is a blatant omission that I found quite strange.  If the peasants had so little power in the government, why did they revolt?  What if the peasants were not peasants?  In the middle of a revolution?  These people did not have much influence on the revolution and should have been ignored.)   -  France was not unified by the revolution; it became so under Napoleon.  No, the Revolution is the cause of the nation as a whole.  All the other nations of Europe became unified under Napoleon because they all had to do the same thing.  I have read this in other books; it does not seem to be an uncommon assumption in these types of political history books.  Also, Napoleon actually had many good reasons to do what he did.  There was no need to take over France because the French aristocracy was no longer powerful enough. This book is not the worst political history book I have ever read, but it was one of the worst I have come across.  To avoid this book, I would highly recommend you read some of the more popular books written by scholars such as Bernard Lewis, Louis Hartz, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  Even if you are not a political scholar, reading these books will be a better idea than reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed.  The beginning was okay, but the ending was so dull that I decided to just put it down, not even finishing it.  The writing is not interesting, the story is not well paced and the characters are not complex at all.  This was a book that I could have done without, but there were parts in which it made me laugh and other parts in the same that made me cry.  I thought that the world was interesting, but I was disappointed that it was just not well developed, with no real motivation, and the writing felt too uninspired.   I would have preferred something more exciting.   5.5 stars from this author.   Rating: 5 stars -  My Review :  It was nice.  If it was an action-adventure type book, then maybe it is better, but it doesn't even come close to being that.    It was just a little slow paced and dull.  4.5 Stars from this Author.   Review :   This is the first book in a series and it took me a while to get around to reading it.   My first impression was:    What a boring book!   And then I remembered my friends complaining about the same thing so I thought it might be time to give it another go.  My only complaints are: 1.  He doesn't really get into the world of   In the beginning he does get into it, but after a while he just focuses on the politics of the time.  It might have been interesting to see how this world reacted to events happening in other places.  But then after a bit more of that he seems to lose interest. 2.  In addition to the politics, the action is a little flat.  There was some excitement in the middle, but then it seems to drag on, and there isn't a lot of character development, either.  After a while you just want to get out of the book. I really wish that I had the time to read more about the world that he is using and I would definitely have liked to read a series of books that covered much more than just the first half of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- "The worst book I ever had the displeasure of reading."  I was given a book by a friend, and I read it in the course of an afternoon on my own time. There are some interesting parts, but as a whole it's just a bunch of nonsense. I was pretty sure it was some type of Christian bible study material. I didn't have a good grasp on Christianity, so this wasn't particularly valuable to me, as far as I was concerned. At any rate, I didn  [the author] was trying to give an overview of all the main points of the biblical narratives and to show how these were relevant to the modern world, but there was just so much wrong with it that I couldn't bear to read it again. I would have given the book a 1/10.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  There is one or two sentences in the beginning that seem off.  The story picks up, the characters develop and then the narrator takes off in his story.    It's like one of those things that you see in movies and tv shows that you get excited about but never get used to.  The end of the book had me at "what?" I felt like this was a bad idea for this book to end so abruptly and to me, that's just unacceptable.

I'm sure I'm not alone in the feeling that this is a book not worth reading.  I didn't know how to feel about this book   when it was first published.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************** I was disappointed, that a reviewer would write such a negative book review. First off, the book doesn't bother with any sort of character development whatsoever. In fact, it goes out of its way to make us think about and analyze the motivations for the actions that it creates. This is one of those books where the author is not telling the story of a particular person, but of a culture and way of life. That being said, I will say that if you are the type of person that is afraid to be different and is hesitant to express yourself, then this book is not for you. In an interview with author William Gaddis, he says, "I'm afraid of people saying I was a racist. I think it's great if you're honest with yourself. But I'm afraid that I could come across as racist." This is a common theme throughout the book, because if you express yourself too freely, you may come off as a racist, which would make your life harder. In other words, if you do not want to have to explain your racial preference, it is best to stay the course. That said, the author also states, "What if he's really not one?" which, if this author is correct, means that he is an "in between" person, who can also express himself. He is, in other words an "out of the box thinker." I think that it is a beautiful insight in itself, and I look forward to how he uses this in his novels to come up with new, original characters. My only complaint is the ending, where it is not as strong as I had hoped for. Overall, this is a very good book that has a strong message. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the ending was not strong enough, but it is still a good read.

He just refused to do it and was so angry that I tried to make him do it he went to the store to buy a baseball bat to beat my head in.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not the right book for me. I was hoping to learn more about the history of the early church. Instead, this book gives the impression that the early Christians were the "true Christians" who only believed in what is in the bible. I find the early Christian church to be the best version of Christianity. It's not perfect, but it is what it is. If I could change one thing, I would be very careful about which book I read.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * I was expecting more than a quick synopsis of the book, so I asked for a summary, which my match sent me within 5 minutes.   Unfortunately, my match's copy of this book was out of print (not available at bookstores anymore), and they decided to get me the second edition, which I was quite disappointed in, but I suppose since they got me a copy, I would appreciate it more.  * Overall, this book could have used some additional editing, but it didn't take me more than 5 minutes to find a few grammar and spelling errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________. My daughter started reading this book at the age of 7, and although she loved it, my mother and I found it a bit boring. My son also loved this book, but he started getting frustrated after the 2nd chapter, and we had to pull it out of the library. I don't think it will appeal to readers under 12, and it is a bit hard to read for those who are. It is interesting how we came to our conclusion, but I think we are all disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I'm giving this book 2 stars because it is only 2 stars for me. I will not review the book because I think the author did a poor job. The premise is good but the characters are bad. I would have preferred the main character to be more of a good guy or maybe a girl and not a male.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are a fantasy book fan, you should know that this book is not for you. If you like fantasy, there are better books to pick. If they are not available in the US, the book is a waste of time. If your main goal is to read books for fun, I think it is a good idea to take a break before reading this book and then come back with some friends. The book is over two decades old and is quite bad at best. The characters are boring, the plot is silly, the fantasy elements are weak and the world that is presented is not as interesting as the authors want to make it. Overall, this is not a good fantasy novel and a bad fantasy novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- When I first got this, I was disappointed by the fact that it was really hard to get through. The "beginning" had a lot of good stuff in it (which made it a good first book) but I don't think that was the main reason it was a failure for me. There were other good stories but it was hard to finish them. The story seemed a little like the characters in "The Secret Garden" - they were in a beautiful place, it was beautiful, and there was a bad guy that was very powerful but couldn't stand up against the great beauty of it. The ending felt like the ending of "The Lord of the Rings". The bad guy had a great power, and he was defeated by the power of the great place. I liked the characters and I like the story but the ending was just a little too much of a cop out. The narrator was very good - I didn't know what he was saying in every story. The book is hard to read! It's very good if you just want a good story and a good ending to the series. I just wish there was more in it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********I really liked this book, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I've read a few short stories of this author before and I have to say this is one of the better ones. However, I didn't enjoy the story or the characters very much, they were just not all that exciting and interesting. The plot was also a little confusing because it seemed like it wasn?t going that way at the end, but then it did and I was confused by it. Overall, this wasn?�t the worst book by this author, it just wasn?����??�?a lot less interesting than I thought he was going for. I had to re-read some of the previous stories just to figure out who was who and where things are going. This wasn?��t the first time I read about this sort of thing, but I think he is getting a little too popular now and people like to have more of his books than anything else. I would rather have something that is slightly more original and interesting in my books than the same old story over and over again.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I really liked this book, although I don't recommend it to people who already have a strong opinion of vampires. The book is about a vampire hunter and his wife who are trapped in the attic of a house where a vampire lives, and they must learn to communicate with their killer. While I'm not so much into this genre, I liked the plot and the characters were interesting. It does contain a bit of blood sucking and there is a bit (more like a LOT) of killing. There are two characters that are particularly interesting, however: (1) Dr. Vee, the doctor, who believes that people are born with special abilities, and therefore must be protected. (2) Mr. Bess, the owner of the house, who has no qualms about his wife and her special abilities. I liked both of these characters, and it was fun to read about their interactions. There's also a small part in the book that deals with a vampire who goes around killing people and his son. I have no idea what happened with that character, and he was basically just there for cheap comedic relief. I don' think it was as funny as a vampire can be though, and the book is over too quickly, so I'm gonna give it an average rating, but for its genre and its premise, I think it's worth reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________________________________ (I hate to be so harsh, but this book sucked. It's the only book I've read since this one that's really bad. I didn't know what it was going to be about, but once I got to the end, I was so confused, that I couldn't put the book down. I was frustrated that it was the only bad book I read in a long time, and also frustrated that I can't find any info about it online. It is a mystery, and not a good mystery. The author doesn't even have any plot points to the book, and it's basically a case of "who do you know." It's just too boring, and I think the author is just too young. The mystery elements are basic, and they seem to be the only thing that this book is good at, which makes me wonder why he's writing so much of it. The story has a beginning, middle, and end. I would have much preferred if this book would have kept going, instead of just being a complete waste of my time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and I felt like I was being watched. This is a story about a teenage girl who finds herself in a sexual relationship with a creepy old man, who doesn't seem to mind that she's naked. The creepy old men are in this book because they are "evil" and the narrator's description of how this "evil man" looks at her is just creepy.  I would have read this story, but I was uncomfortable reading it. I wanted to stop the book. It's hard to read a book in which I can tell that the author knows exactly what is going on, but that makes it really hard to finish.    1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************** I don't like writing negative reviews, so I won't waste any more of your time. This book has many flaws, and some of them are the book's faults. I think the author was too excited about writing this book, and thought he could write it as good as he did with his previous books. So, he spent a lot of his own time writing this, to try and make up for lost time. He wanted to write a good story, not a great one. However, he wrote the book in too many steps to be a complete novel. He could have split it in many smaller books. It's easy to write when you have lots of ideas to use and a lot more time. It also makes it easier to edit if the story gets out of control. The only thing that saved this book from a 5 is that I had to read it in a few days, so all the flaws I pointed out could be overlooked. However if you've read a lot about dragons, you'd know that when dragons fly at the moon, they're always looking for their next meal. This is the exact same reason that these dragons were attacking the farm. The author failed to realize that the dragons were just looking for something to eat. This was his biggest flaw. **************************** The author is a liar. He knew what he was doing, and he's not going to stop now. *********** This book was really hard to get through. There's not much I can add other than that. It was long, it had a lot to say, and it made me want to read all the other books in the series. I really liked how all the characters were not only portrayed well, but were in very different situations that they had to deal with. It made the characters interesting. I also really liked that the author never gave up. I'm glad I finished this book. It may not be a 7-star book, but it was a pretty darn good one, if I do say so myself.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________  I have been reading The Last King of Scotland for over three years now and it was the very first of all my epic fantasy series. I read the first three books before I got to my first big fantasy book so I was already a big fan of the series and had the whole series in mind. I was so excited when I found out that this was going to be a trilogy and was worried that I would be put off by the long length. However I was really not let down. The first book was great, and I really loved the setting and the action. I didn't really have to read much in between as the plot seemed to pick up from where the books left off. It wasn't quite as exciting as some other series out there, but I was still pleased with the book.  As for the first book itself, I am pleased to say that I did finish the first part of this book. However the third book is going to get very very very hard to finish as it is just too much of a bore. I found the entire book to be just plain dull and there were just too many characters to keep up with. If you are looking for an epic fantasy novel that is not going to take over your life then this might not be for you. If however you are someone who likes epic fantasy novels then give it a go. : The Last Kings of Scotland is a well paced novel, it had just enough action to keep the action moving, but just not enough to keep it interesting or engaging. I understand that this is a trilogy, but that doesn't mean you need it to be all epic fantasy. The setting is beautiful and I enjoyed it, but the action and characters just weren't engaging enough to make it a great novel. As for the writing style, I was disappointed in how slow it was at times.  on the other hand, The Last Kingdom and The Last Days is just simply great. The characters are amazing and I can't wait to see where the plot goes next. I really hope that the third novel is better because I am really looking forward to that one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book very much. However, there are several parts that have been very frustrating to me. My biggest issue, as you pointed out in the review, was with the ending. I felt like this book had a very rushed ending, especially for an 80,000+ word book. As I read this book, I felt that it was going to be a very quick and easy way to get me through the last few chapters of the book. However for an ending that I felt was rushed, I did not feel much satisfaction from the ending of this book. Also, some of the plot threads that were left hanging felt a bit vague. I didn't understand the logic of why the two girls were so interested in each other and what it was that they were looking for when they left the church. Overall, this was a very good book to read that has a strong storyline and interesting plot threads.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a little over a week and I'm so disappointed! I had high hopes for this book due to all the praise it has gotten, and it's a good book but I can't really see myself recommending it.   The first half of the book is about the creation of the universe as a computer program and the second half is about a group of people who want to control the universe and are attempting to do so.  The universe is not really mentioned until about page 150, and is barely mentioned again until page 230!   One of the main problems with the book: the book claims that the reason why the universe didn't explode or break up is because the program was programmed to shut down if a "distant event" (the Big Bang) would occur.  There are no "dishonest" computer programs.  Also, it isn't mentioned at all that these people are attempting a takeover and attempting to create their own reality.  So much of the story is focused on them and their attempts at a takeover of reality, they barely have time to mention the universe.  It seems that this was a way to try and make a computer story and as such the story was really lacking in that aspect.  This book was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book, though I can't say I enjoyed it enough to make it worth re-reading, and I'm already looking forward to the next one. I had to re-read the first chapter because I couldn't figure out what to do with the character's backstory - in a sense, it was too "tough to swallow" for me to enjoy her story for more than a couple of chapters. The narration was so-so, as well, but it wasn't bad for what I had read in other books. I think this is a good fantasy series, though the characters are a bit too "simple" for my tastes, and not a lot of action and conflict, so I'm not sure why I was so invested in this book. I'm looking forward for the next in the series, but at the rate I'm going through them, I'm a long way from finishing it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was good but I would not recommend it. I had some serious issues with this book. 1. It was a little confusing. 2. It seemed so rushed. 3. The main character is a complete dick. 4. He's so far over the top. The most realistic part of this book was the sex part. The sex was ok but the sex parts really didn't seem important. The rest of the book felt completely unnecessary.  "I never knew I was such a bad person."  The main character of this story, a girl named Kay, is a loner, and spends her time playing video games, reading books, and being alone. After a tragic accident at a video game tournament leaves her permanently paralyzed, Kay sets off on a journey to reconnect with her friends and learn more about her missing life.   As a loners story, this is one of the most heartbreaking books I have read in a long time. I love it when a lonesome heroine comes face to face with life's harsh reality. Kay's personality is so incredibly realistic. Her fearlessness, self doubt, and lack of desire to fit in has really helped me to understand her. I think the reason this book has taken me this long to read is because Kay is such a great character. I find myself thinking of her all the time. Every time I feel bad, I think of her.   the story was very good  Kay, the main character, is in a wheelchair. Kay is a very outgoing and outgoing person. But the accident happened 3 years ago, and is not a surprise to anyone. But, it still does not feel real. Her wheelchair makes her unable to move and use the restroom at school, but she is still a normal high school girl. She loves video games and plays with friends at a lot of different arcades.   The other main character in the story, an old man named John, is Kay's best friend. Kay likes John very much, and they like to hang out a lot. Kay never told John she had a disability. But when she is kidnapped and brain damaged, she is devastated.  :)  In the beginning of the story Kay is very shy, but after a while becomes quite popular. But then the story takes a turn from tragedy to drama to a real life coming of age story. Kay goes on a quest to find out more about herself and learn how to become whole again.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. I don't normally give these as 5 stars, but this one deserves it. I read this book to a group of women as a self-help book and the only reason I read it was to help a friend with her depression and I just had to give it a try. The author, a very attractive girl in her 40's, gave it to us like it was no big deal. I mean, how could you not be interested in an article about how to deal with depression? I bought it on the first day and read it two or three times a day for about a month. It really helped me tremendously and then it just sort of faded into the background as I moved on with life. That is, until I read about her blog post "I am an author. Do you like my book? Well then, come and find out what depression is all about." So, you can imagine my disappointment when I read that she was leaving a comment about how she didn't like her book because the women she had been helping, including herself, ended up not liking it either.  I think I am in the minority here, but I was absolutely floored. I never realized she had such a difficult time with women. She must have been in a constant battle with them since it seemed like it had been forever that she wrote this book. Her self-esteem problem was so obvious to everyone else that it was not worth mentioning to her own readers. It was just a waste of time for her. She had the same problems with men and she wrote about them so well. Maybe she felt she was doing a disservice to the men if she kept her problems with them a secret. I was still stunned when I looked over her comments and discovered that she could not stand her book. I had to look at it just to make sure I had read it. In my opinion, her book was horrible, but her blog was actually kind of funny. Her blog had been updated regularly for over a year, as she went through all the stages of writing this book, until she finally put it down and just moved on to something else. She said in her post about the book that she had learned so much from the men she had written about that it almost was worth it for them to be attacked by her now. I could only imagine how she felt. She was obviously not very good at handling her emotions. ...  The last book in the series is

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is good, but very tedious. You have to keep moving from scene to scene to get the plot going, which is a chore. The only scene that's interesting is one where all the characters are standing around and talking. It's really hard to understand anything that's being said, and I don't understand a word of what the characters say.   This is not good.  - The author tries to portray this world as a fantasy and to make it sound like a wonderful place to live. He tries to do it in a way that would make it seem that the people there are more knowledgeable than humans. Unfortunately, he doesn't think the world is that magical. In a scene in a tavern, a character says "If a person is a wizard in the land, that person is an angel," which really doesn't make any sense. What does "an angel" even mean? A "moth"? An "angel"?   - There is no "real" religion, but instead, there are several religions. One of them is the "Pagan" religion. The author uses the term "Pagans" a lot to make a religious comparison. That's fine, as I understand what he's trying to say, but the "pagan" thing is just irritating to me. He says things like, "The pagans' magic was real and they could make the world bend to their whims. They are the people who are in charge of the world today." It's so irritating to hear a character call a religion "real." I thought "realism" was the opposite of what he meant. It sounds like he doesn the word to mean something he didn't mean at all. I like that "Pags" is an old word for "pagans," but if the author wants to make this seem real, he should change it to something more descriptive.   the "magic" is real and can bend to the whims of the "magicians" who live there. I didn't understand anything about that.  - The characters have no real emotional depth. The main character, for example, doesn't do anything except listen to everything said about him. He seems like a blank slate with no motivations or problems. Other characters in the book aren't much better. They're mostly annoying or useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- -------------------------- There's no redeeming value in this novel. It's a terrible book. If you're looking for something new and different that you haven't seen before, then you might enjoy this book. The story is basic and boring. It takes place in a fantasy land and the characters are interesting. Unfortunately the story never really gets going. The book also feels like there was a writer who was trying to write in the old tradition of the heroic fantasy. It felt like he really didn't know what he wanted to write and was trying just enough to stay afloat. The characters are all bland and boring, and the story is so boring and confusing that I never wanted to read another word of it. In conclusion, I can't recommend this book at all, because it is such an obvious flop.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________ I can't tell you how many times I've looked at a book and then went home and said "I want that book," but haven't gotten it. I mean, I have read every book by George R.R. Martin and I love them all. So I have had my hands full. However, I loved the books by Christopher Paolini. These are books you can read over and over. They are rich with detail and characters. I also love that all the books can be read in one sitting. All the time. They can be taken in a fast-paced, casual manner, or they can be more serious. They will have you re-reading the same books over and OVER again, but the enjoyment is there to make it all worthwhile. This is a MUST for all fantasy fans. I'm so excited for the next series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't recommend this book to anyone.   In a world of "discovery" books, where everything has been explained so perfectly and with such clarity, this book is a farce.  In spite of the title, the author has no real idea what she is talking about, and in fact makes it hard to believe any of the information in it, in an effort to "prove" her "discoveries."  The author claims to "discredit" all of the existing scientific evidence, yet the book is filled with allusions to all the different studies in the world that refute the various points the author presents.  The claims are so ridiculous, that I can't even go into the book without laughing out loud, as every single "findings" and "mysteries" are completely false, or at least heavily discounted, without providing any supporting evidence.  When you actually try to make sense out of the book, it becomes clear that the authors has no idea what they are talking about.  This is especially apparent when you look at the chapters that are "discredited" (for example, there is no mention of the effects of CO2 on plants, or the effect that changes in the Sun have on Earth's climate), where the author writes: "We have only one kind of plant, one kind in a million: the ones that are grown in greenhouses."   This was from the same book I reviewed, and it was wrong as well.  So, in the end, this is a book with zero points of reference.
