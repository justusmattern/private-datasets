Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie and I like its director's work. It is an adventure film that takes place in the old west. I have seen a lot of western movies but never saw anything like this before. It has some action scenes and there is a lot to see in this movie.   The movie is good but I think it could have been better. I do like it but I am a little disappointed with the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at the local theater about a week or two ago, it was pretty good. I've seen a few bad sci-fi movies before, but this one wasn't too bad. The story is a bit slow at first but it picks up with a decent pace and the movie keeps it interesting. The characters are all pretty well developed and the acting is pretty good all around. The action scenes are also pretty good, the aliens are pretty cool and have a little bit of the Alien franchise in them.   Overall, this was a pretty good movie, it is a little long but I can get past that if it keeps up the pace.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The film is about a former Vietnam veteran who has been living in California with his wife (a former model), who he has recently divorced. They are living with his daughter who is also a veteran of the war, and their son. The film also follows his son as he goes through life as a young man. It is a story about family, about fatherhood, about love, about the things that are important in life. It also deals with the pain and loss of war. It's a very strong movie. Â If you have a strong stomach, and can handle a lot of violence and gore, you can't go wrong with this film.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to this movie so much but I don't think it really lived up to the hype. This was a fun movie to watch and it made me laugh a lot. I had fun with this one. It had a lot of fun jokes in it but the plot was a little weak. I found myself wondering what would happen if all of the world's bad guys were given a second chance and if they could pull it off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen many great horror movies in my life but this one stands above all the others and I can't help but think of all the people that went to see this film in the early 70's.   It has a very macabre feel to it and I think it is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was an interesting movie that took me back to my youth, as a child, my brother and I would be out and about, and this film was a highlight of my childhood. It's a fun, silly, yet interesting movie. It reminds me of my favorite film, "The Goonies" (the film that made me a child of the 70's and 80's) in that it's a great little adventure that you want to experience.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ It's about a boy (Dennis Quaid) who finds his father (Tim Robbins) in a car wreck, he tells him he is not going to die and goes to meet his mother (Susan Sarandon) who is still in the hospital. He asks her to marry him and she agrees. After he is a little older he finds out that he's not the son his mother was expecting and she is pregnant with his real father (Dale Quaid). This is the first in a series of Quaid movies. I love this one. It's not really a sequel to the first but it still is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sisters, we have some big news to share with you today.  We're so excited to share the news that we've secured a distribution deal with A24!  They've been a great partner on the film and we're so grateful for the opportunity to bring it to the world. " Sisterhood is a tough movie.    It has an unusual and refreshing take on relationships, and a great cast.  "Sister, we've got some big, bad news for you today." "This is a real shock.  " "It's true.  That's the news we're about to tell you.  You're going to be very, very happy.  Now get ready.  This is a very good movie." What I love about this film is that it's honest and raw, and very funny.  The film's themes and message are not about the usual family issues that are so prevalent in the news.  There's no one in this film to be blamed, no one to be saved, but the film shows how much you can get away with when you are in love.  And the most important message of the film is: "You're in love with the wrong girl." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Eyes Wide Shut" is the first part of the David Lynch classic "Lost Highway" and I found it to be very well acted and a very entertaining movie. The movie takes place in the early 1960s. A man named Bill Hewitt, who is on a plane headed to California to spend the night, finds himself in the middle of a bizarre and nightmarish sexual encounter with a woman he does not know. Bill is convinced that he is having a sexual encounter and does not believe the woman at first. The film then slowly unravels and the mystery surrounding the woman is revealed. It is a dark and fascinating movie that does not reveal all the answers in the end. It really does not take the time to explain everything about this woman but it does take a long time to understand why Bill Hewett believes that he has sexual intercourse with her. "Eyes wide shut" is a very well-acted movie with a great soundtrack. The sex scenes are really hot and the movie is very scary. If you like creepy and strange movies then you should definitely watch "Ears Wide Shut".

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* This movie is about a man who was shot by a man with a knife, but he survives. When he wakes up, he realizes that he is in a hospital. He also discovers that he has lost a lot of weight and is still having problems with his memory. He decides to do a memory test. Unfortunately, he forgets a lot in the test. He finds out that the man who shot him, a man called "The Joker", is still out there and is trying to kill the other men in the hospital. So, The Joker goes to the hospital to kill his former friend, "Sugar". But, The Jokers friend "Cobra" (John Travolta) comes to the rescue. He saves Sugar and The Joker kills The Joker. The Joker's friend "Ginger" (Marcello Mastroianni) is in the other room and asks the police what to do. But, before they can make a decision, they hear a woman screaming and a man yelling "It's a bad dream." So, the police go in the room and find the Joker. They decide to shoot him. When they shoot him, he doesn't die, and he takes the gun from them and shoots them. The woman in the dream screams, and the man in the movie says "I'll always remember you as a beautiful woman." ********************
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love the movie and the art design is great! The story is quite interesting as it takes place in a small city in a time when it is still relatively modern. The main character is a street urchin who is a bit of a rogue, who is also a very talented painter.   After a bad encounter with a bad guy, he is thrown out of the city and he and his friends must take the city by storm to find his way home.  A bit of history: the original story was written by E. M. Forster and was adapted by John Boorman for the film "The English Patient."   A lot of the film is set in the street vernacular of the period (it is still quite modern in many ways, for example, it has no telephone or television, only "street lamps," and it is all very informal), and the film's art direction is very reminiscent of that.  The movie is about as entertaining as you would expect from a film by John Hughes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, for me, was about a little boy who gets a magical toy that allows him to fly.   The movie was very entertaining and I liked the characters very much.  The film is very much in keeping with the comic book books, and I like the idea of a little brother who has special powers that he has to control.  It was very exciting and a good way to end the summer for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** This movie has been reviewed many times before, and every time, it's a good one. It's a pretty good film from a young director who is clearly an interesting young man. It has a strong female lead, who is not a bad actress, she just is a bit shy and a little naive at first. She learns from her mistakes, and becomes a more confident woman, who can now handle herself in a serious fight, but is still very much a novice. The screenplay is quite good, with an interesting plot and a great number of action scenes. It is a movie that you can easily watch in one sitting. *********************
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good flick. I really enjoyed the story and how they tried to bring a good sci-fi movie to the big screen.   I found it a bit overrated and had some issues with the characters but I can see where they were coming from and I still enjoyed the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to find a good film about a group of young people, but this one, directed by John Waters (who also wrote the film) is the best I've seen.  This is an extremely funny film, with one of the most absurdly over-the-top scenes I've ever seen.   I think it's funny because it's so obviously the work of John Waters.  In the film, a group (played by Waters and a bunch of his friends) go on a vacation in a secluded area in the woods.    The group is a mix of high school and college kids, a couple of hippies, and a couple who are all "drunk" (that's how they describe it in the film).   And they're all trying to get a glimpse of a young woman who has just been spotted by a couple men who are "looking" for a woman to rape and torture.  They're all on edge and anxious, but they're also a bunch that loves to make fun of the others and get into trouble.  The film is very silly and silly, but the comedy is very good and the characters are pretty original.  In a lot of ways, this film is more about the group than it is about the young woman.  It also has some great music (which is one of my favorite things about the film), and it's one of those movies that is more "in the moment" than other Waters films, like the "Wet Hot American Summer" (which also features a young man looking for a young girl).  It's definitely a film worth checking out if you like funny and silly things.

I mean you see a little girl who is in a house and then there is a man who is a sorcerer and a dragon.  And they fight and there is an old man and a little boy.  It was just a fairy story.  But it was real, you could feel the magic and the magic of the movie.  A little girl and a man in a little house fight magic and they live happily ever after.  What else could you want?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many times that the movie has a great set piece or the perfect sequence to show the story. The best is the time that a man and his friend travel down a long road to a country. They walk through the night and then after a few minutes a truck starts up with a big load and starts to pull out. The guy looks up and realizes that there is a fire, then the truck stops and the fire trucks come to put it out. As the guy and his friends are walking along, they are attacked by the firemen. They are knocked over, then one of them is killed by a blow to the head. After that the guy realizes that the fire was caused by a bomb planted by the communists. He goes back to his truck to get some guns and he looks down and sees that the bomb was actually a mannequin of a man. He blows up the mannequins and goes back out to fight the fireman. When he gets back to the truck, he hears the truck come to a stop. As he gets to the door of the truck he sees that a big man has come out of the fire and he gets into the truck and starts driving away. The next day the guy looks back and he sees a lot of the people he knows lying dead on the ground and he starts to get angry. Then he finds out that his friend has been killed and he goes back home to tell his mother. He does not tell her the reason why he is going back to fight. He also does not know that his mother is the leader of the communist party. She takes his gun and goes to his house. They find that he is in bed with a man who has the same red hair and same eyes as his son. He starts to shoot at him and she runs to the front door. He sees that she has run inside and she tells him that the communists have taken over. The mother tries to get her son to leave but he is not going anywhere. He looks around and sees the big man and then the mother tells him to get down on the floor and lay down on his face. She then goes to get a knife from the kitchen and starts cutting the big guy's face off. As she is doing this the big one starts to cry and she cuts him some more. She runs out to get help and gets a policeman to come over. He tells her that he will take her to the hospital. When they get to the house,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't like this movie at all, but it was worth a watch if you are a sucker for cheesy, old-timey and cheesy-old-time movie like this one.  There is a story about a guy who can't find his way back to the old town he left.    This movie is about a bunch of old-fashioned, down-to-earth people trying to find their way back home.  I think this is a nice idea that is executed with no real flair.  The movie is not so bad but it's not very entertaining either.  There is not much action in the movie, just a bunch more of the same old things that have been done a million times.  In the end, I guess this is an example of what it means to be old-school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no question that the original Ghostbusters movie is the best of the series, but the third film in the series doesn't have the same magic that the first two had.  The third film, called "Ghostbusters: The Video Game," is not just a sequel to the first film, it's also a direct sequel to Ghostbusters II.  It's a good film, but it's not quite as funny or as enjoyable as the first 2 films were.   The new Ghostbusters don't get much of a chance to shine, but they are a very fun bunch of characters.  There are a few jokes in this movie, but most of it is just the characters reacting to things that happen.  The new Ghostbusters are a lot more interesting than the original.  They're not the only ones that are a bit dull, but this film really gets boring very quickly.  I'm not sure what the difference between the first and second films is, but that's a huge difference in the quality of this movie.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It was a fun, cute, and somewhat creepy flick. It had a lot of fun with it's premise. I really loved the music and the way the characters reacted to their situation. The movie didn't take itself too seriously and was very funny at the same time. I liked the way they portrayed the people that were there. I hope they do a sequel someday.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm gonna put a bullet in your head and then I'm gonna give you a shot of this little shit and then we're gonna see what happens," says a gangster. The first time we see him, he's shooting at a man on the ground. Then he's running, and we see a shot that seems to hit the man. Then it looks like the man is dead. Then we see the gangster and a woman running in a deserted neighborhood. We're then shown the man and the gangsters running past a house that is on fire. The man and a gun, and then the man looks back and he's dead. The film is really about how a gang of crooks, led by the bad boy, gets into a bank. But the bank's manager is a cop, and he wants the gang to get in trouble. He has his gun drawn. We see the crooks shooting at each other. The cop is on the phone with a dispatcher, telling him to hold his fire. But there's a chance that the crook could be the only one with a gun who will get into trouble. This film is about a gang who are trying to get money to run a drug deal. The crooks get in a shootout with a group of cops, and in the end they kill the guy who had been chasing them. The police tell the guy to run to the bank and get out of the way. The bank manager has his guns drawn. He wants to shoot the crooner and get the money. But when he gets into the bank, there's no money in the safe. And there's only one person left in the bank: a man. The gangster says, "I'm the only man in this bank. I'm going to get my money. I'll just shoot the man in the back and then take a chance." The crooner says, to himself, "What a fool, I'm just going to let him get away." Then the crooners start shooting at the man, but the man dodges all the bullets. The guy tries to shoot at the croons, but he's shot in the leg. He then runs out of bullets, and the crooons start shooting. Then they stop and the guy looks at the bank manager. The manager says, very quietly, "Don't kill him." And he shoots the guy in the head. He walks out of a window and falls to his death. The

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie that i ever saw that wasn't just a crappy sci fi/action flick. A well made film that has it's own personality. I don't care if you like or hate this movie it's a good film, the action was good and the character development was good. The soundtrack was good but not the best ever made, but it was nice to hear the music at least once. This movie could have been better and it's one of those movies that I think the studio should have just made a better version of, they made a good one though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has been in my mind for years, but until recently, I didn't think that I could make it into the realm of science fiction with a reasonable amount of realism.  I was wrong.   The movie is quite a bit more realistic than I thought it was going to be, but it is still not realistic.  One of the best things about the movie is the way the aliens speak.  It's like aliens are really talking to each other in the movie, but the way they talk is very realistic and human like.  In other words, I thought the aliens would be stupid, but they weren't.  They actually have a good idea of how to use a gun.  The way the alien language is used in this movie is pretty good, but I think it's kind of lame.  I'm not saying that it isn't a good way to do a movie like this, it's just that it doesn't do anything new or interesting.  As I said, the aliens talk like people, but not in a way that's realistic. Overall:    I think that this movie has the potential to be very good, and it does not disappoint.  This movie is very well written and the story is told very well.  There are some very good performances by a few very good actors.  Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is that it is very different from any other movie I have seen.  It's a very funny movie.    The movie is about a man who becomes a professional baseball player, and the funny thing is that he is not a great player.  This is because he is a "loser" who becomes famous because of his "lucky" baseball skills.  The best thing is he loves the game and wants to play baseball all his life.  And then one day he decides to play the game for a real big money.  It's a pity that the film ends in a way that will disappoint anyone who loved this movie.

It's all very bleak.  This movie isn't very scary at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a solid action movie and the story has some interesting elements, but nothing groundbreaking. The main plot is interesting enough. The story is told from the viewpoint of a man who has been working for the government for 30 years, but he is now old and doesn't have much time left to live. He is sent to find his old friend and partner, and he does just that. The film does a good job of showing the friendship between the two men and how much they both cared for each other. I found the action sequences to be good and very well choreographed. I enjoyed the music and it fit well with the action scenes.  This film is definitely a worthwhile addition to the Action Movies genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last time we saw Tom Cruise in a movie, he was in an action movie and I was bored to tears. Now, in this film, Cruise is in a family drama about his father's murder and his brother's attempt to clear his father of the crime. He also plays a good guy, an old-time gangster who has a few hard knocks to knock off his record. This movie is one of those movies you see in the theater and say "wow" and then go home and sit and watch it again and again. It is an excellent film with a solid cast and a plot that is compelling, although it's not always clear what the movie is about. I was particularly impressed by Cruise as a character and it's hard to imagine him in anything else, but if he can ever get out of his own way and become a character actor who can act as a man instead of a man-child, then he could become a great movie star.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. I have seen it so many times, I am not sure why I haven't seen it yet. It is a great movie, full of comedy, suspense, action, and the occasional horror.   The film is about a couple who have a new baby, and as they are taking care of the child, a serial killer comes to their house. He kills and eats most of the family. It would be interesting to see the film in a theater. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first five minutes are worth watching: The first thing you notice about the movie is the camera work.   It has the same feel and style as The Empire Strikes Back:  The camera work is smooth and steady and allows the film to flow smoothly.  The action scenes are well paced and the characters are well-defined.  I'm not sure how much of the film was filmed in Hawaii and how much was in Chicago.  But I liked the locations that were used.  This is a great action movie and the director is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and thought it was really good, but I didn't get the impression that it was a "great" movie.  It's got a strong cast and a great story, but the film isn't "great".  For a good time movie, I think it would be better served by a little more creativity.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  I saw this movie the other day.  It was a very good movie, and I liked it.  The film is based on the book  " The Good, The Bad, the Uglies " by E.B. White, and was written in 1929.   White's film is about the lives of three families.  The Black family is a well-to-do, Southern family, who is having trouble with their new neighbor, The Whites.  Their neighbor is a poor, uneducated, drunkard.  They have to take the Whites to court for their house.  This leads to a bitter, bitter, fight, and ultimately a victory for the Whites. The White family is the Black family's next-door neighbors.  Each family has different problems.  Some are about property rights, some are about religion, some is about social problems, and some is all about class warfare.  White is a wealthy man, and is trying to get rid of a neighbor who is trying steal his land.  Black is a former slave, and has now turned into a drunkard, who also steals from White.  There is also a group of women, who are all jealous of White, because they are married to Black.  All of this leads to some very interesting scenes.  My favorite scene was a fight between the Black and White families.  They were all pretty good fighters, and they were pretty good at it, too.  If you are interested in a good western, this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a well done movie, it is funny, it shows some great moments and is also quite an enjoyable movie.  The movie is quite good and the action scenes are really good, they show how a man can go out and get some action and get out alive. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this world we live in, there are things that are too crazy to believe. I am talking about Bigfoot, vampires, werewolves, and the "Grim Reaper". The story is a simple one. A woman is out for a hike, when she sees a man with a skull, dressed in black, and carrying a sword. She follows the man into the woods, and finds a trail. She comes upon a cave where there is a hole in the ground, and she finds a skull in it. This leads to the discovery of a man who is the Grim Reaper, who has been haunting the woods. This is where the story becomes a bit strange. The woman is actually possessed by a demon, and has been doing this for months. The only thing that seems to help her is a little dose of alcohol. It is up to the Grim Reapers to stop the demon from eating her. It's not easy. But, they do. The movie itself is good. It looks like a little short of a full feature, but it's not bad. It has some good acting, and is funny at times. The acting is a bit weak, but I didn't find it all that bad. I like the short ending, but there are a few scenes that seem a bit forced. Overall I'd recommend this movie. It isn't that great, but the ending was nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ The Great White Way is a great movie. The acting is top notch and the pacing is perfect. The story is told from the point of view of a white man who was trying to sail a freighter across the Atlantic. The movie is a mixture of real life events, such as the sinking of the Titanic, and fantastical elements such as a flying saucer, a talking horse, and other things that the movie would not be out of place in. I liked it and think that it is a good film. If you're a fan of the movies like Casablanca or The Third Man you will enjoy this movie as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a nice surprise. It's a great time, a little slow, a bit slow to start, but a good time. It is a good story about a little boy who has an unusual way of getting around. It starts out with a typical adventure with the boy getting in a van and running to another city. This van is a really old car with an engine made in 1910, and it is full of a little girl. They are on a road trip. There is a lot of action. There are some interesting people, but there is also some bad behavior, some bad luck. The boy and the girl are always on the run. It takes a lot to keep a child like this from running into a tree. They get into a lot trouble, but they are always trying to get out. I was surprised at the amount of bad luck that was in the movie. It didn't seem to have any bad luck in it. It just seemed to be a story about people who have a good life, but bad luck is always around them. The movie was well done, with a little bit of action and humor. There was a nice little ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie about a group of people living in a cave in a desert in the south of France. They live there since before the French Revolution, so it's a very authentic place in France. It's an interesting movie, and the acting is a bit too good to not watch it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie about a guy who, after being kidnapped by a bunch of pirates and dumped into a desert, is forced to fight for his life and the survival of his crew. The plot was pretty basic and boring. The story was pretty boring as well. The only interesting part of the movie is the guy's journey in the desert.   The main character is a pretty stupid and boring one. I never really understood why the movie had a main character who is always in a fight. Maybe it's a tribute to the fact that the main character was a former martial artist? The movie never really shows the dangers of the desert, nor does it really explain the plot. It doesn't make any sense and, like all movies about this genre, it was not worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure that most people that I know in this community have watched this movie, and the only reason I can think of why this movie has such a cult following is that it's so unique and it's also a very good movie! The characters are great and the movie has a nice plot that isn't overbearing and boring. The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack, it's pretty much the best score ever. If you're a fan of science fiction and/or horror, I highly recommend you check this out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about the movie is the character of Mr. Hockenberry. He was such a nice man.  He is a big guy, but he had a sweet, mellow voice and a wonderful way with people.  I can see why his mother would be a little upset with him after all the trouble he had getting out of jail.   He was a nice, sweet man. I loved his wife, and I hope she will come to see the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie in my dorm room when I was 12 years old. It had to have been a movie I saw over and over again. It's a very simple story about a little boy named Dwayne (who is really only about 6 years old) who has a dream about his mother who is the mother of a demon named "Gotham" who is going to kill Dwayne's mother. He has a giant iron cross on his forehead, so when the demon attacks, he turns into a giant red bat-like creature and he is able to destroy the demon. But the movie ends with a very strange ending, because the movie is really just about a child who had a really hard time of it in his life. It was an old fashioned movie, about a young boy who was a little messed up on drugs and who had to do a lot of crazy stuff to get what he wanted. It really was a very sad movie about a kid who was very sick. It just makes you feel bad for him. I just don't understand why people love it so much. I'm pretty sure this movie would have been even more popular if it was made in the 1960's and if it had been a more believable story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people seem to think that a movie about a kid who lives in a cardboard box is boring, but that's not true.   There is a lot of humor in this movie and it's actually quite good, so if you like movies with a lot going on, then you'll like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the perfect movie to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon. The first half of the movie takes place in the small town of Sturgis, where two families of blacksmiths are struggling to get by. The families are separated and the younger son of the older family is sent off to a boarding school to be trained as a blacksmith. The father of the younger boy goes off to war and the mother of the girl goes to a small town in Oklahoma.   When she is there the girl falls in love with a man named Charlie who lives in the nearby town and who has been out of town a few years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a film that should be seen by everyone in the world. It's about an ancient civilization that has been destroyed by the Spanish. The ruins are in the Andes mountains and the main characters are an old couple and a young boy who just moved there. When the boy is invited to a party, he and his friends make friends with a group of people from another civilization who are doing something similar to what the Andean people have done. When they learn that the old couple is dying and the boy wants to do something special for them, they get a secret message from the old people saying that they need to leave this world and find a place in another universe where they can live in peace. But, they also have to leave their memories and everything they have done to this world. So the boy, his friends and the group of other people set out to do this. The film is very entertaining and I think it will appeal to everyone who is a fan of movies. It will leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. I think this is a film you should see. It is definitely worth seeing!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I have seen. The story is great and it is about an army officer in a foreign land. He has a wife, two kids, and a great wife who is the love of his life. His wife's best friend is his cousin and when they are together the whole family seems to be happy. The bad part about the movie is the ending. The soldier has to return to his home country. He decides to go back because the army has to go to their next training camp. The wife gets upset because he is going back to a place where he has to fight and she is tired of fighting. He is a great man who does everything he can to keep his family happy. I think the ending is very weak. I liked it but it was just a little too long.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The main character, the "King of the Hill" is a tough little guy who is very much in charge of his "castle". The castle is a huge castle, that has several rooms, a kitchen, a dining room, a bedroom, and a large bedroom (that is to say, a large room where the king sleeps). The castle has a great size, and the king can do things that no other king has done. It is a well-made movie, and has many of the things you would expect in a movie about a large castle. _________ The movie is pretty much what it sounds like. It has some funny bits here and there, and is well-paced.    It's a little different from what you might expect, as it has some serious themes about slavery, and about racism in general.  It is pretty hard to watch, but if you are a little hard-pressed to watch something about a giant castle with a great big king in it, this may be a good one to try.  The cast of actors is pretty good, and it is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie follows the story of a family of 4 children living in the small American town of St. Clair, Missouri.  The kids are: (1) a 15 year old girl, (2) a 13 year old boy, (3) a 14 year old and a 13 Year old boy.    The movie focuses on the daily life of these four kids and the problems they face.  In the beginning the family is happy.  However, when a group of kids, with the same interests and abilities, start to play together, the parents start to notice.  Soon the parents realize that their kids are becoming a nuisance to the other kids and their parents.  When the parents try to discipline the kids, they end up getting in trouble with the local police.  They find themselves in a battle against two groups of teens who have the same problems as the family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought it was a good story and the acting was very good. It was not really a movie for the young audience, but the story of the young girl who was saved from being eaten by a hungry lion was very touching. The movie was not very expensive, it only cost $500.00 dollars and it was good for a few minutes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen a lion before.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't realize how much I liked this movie until I watched it again. I watched the film on VHS about 10 years ago. I thought it was very funny and pretty much the only movie I have ever seen that was funny. There was one scene where a guy came out of a store and a young woman said, "Hey, I want to go shopping with you." He replied, "No. I want you to sit here." And then the girl sat down and started to look at all the merchandise on the shelves. He continued to say, "But you're not going to get anything you want. There are too many things you don't like." And the girl said, "...and I don't know anything about shopping. I don`t know what the hell a 'doll' is." And she walked out of the store.   The movie was made in 1985 and was originally titled "The New Kid" and was directed by Gary Busey. The original cast was: Gary BUSEY, Kevin Conway, and David Spade. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always liked the idea of the story of a guy who has a superpowers that give him the ability to see in the dark, and it's always interesting to see what he sees. I don't like that they made him a guy but I like the idea. I like that he's not a big strong guy, and he does like to play with the power of the darkness. I just love how it's such a dark movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a guy who is about to enter the first stage of his transition from the "untranssexual". The transition is quite painful for the guy, and the story is sad. The transition itself is the main reason why the movie is good. The film was based on the memoirs of a woman, Joan O'Hara. The book is a memoir of Joan OHara's life from the time she was a child. The movie is not a romantic biopic of the actress. It's a film about the pain of the person and the pain that we, as viewers, experience when we look at the actor's performance. The first movie, I think, is the one that makes you understand the movie and to see it as a tragic story. The second movie, however, is an interesting study in how the transition itself works. It is not clear what is the transition in the first movie: Is it the change of sex or is it the changing of gender? In the second movie we see that the transition is both. The story is based on Joan O'deara's life and her struggle to find her place in a world that is changing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great example of how to do a horror movie.  It's very well done and has a very good cast.  This movie takes place in the 70s.    The film starts off very fast and it doesn't let up.  This movie is great for those who want a good scary movie with a good script.  If you are into the older type of horror movies you'll like this.  The best part about this movie is the acting and direction.  It's a good old fashioned slasher.  You don't see the same movie over and over and it is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a decent movie about a man who decides to spend a few weeks on a mountain bike trip. He comes to this remote location in the mountains, a small village near a big lake, to spend the weekend. He gets lost, and gets out of his car in a small valley. He decides to try to find a trail that is not yet filled in. He finds a trail with a good sized tree and a couple of small paths. He tries to cross the paths one by one. He eventually makes it to a stream and then a pond. The next day he is back to the car. He has had a great time. He returns to his car and finds it has been ransacked. He is not at all sure who has done this to him, but he is sure that it is not him. A few days later the police show up to arrest him. They take him to a small prison, but the jail is small and the food is terrible. The prisoner is very scared, but refuses to talk. The police have him take a drug test, but no one wants to touch him with a 10 foot pole. They are not even willing to give him water. Finally he gives in and lets them examine him. When they do this they find out that he has the same kind of disease that the doctor said that he had. He seems to have a hard time getting to sleep, so the doctor suggests that he could be drugged to get him to sleep. The doctor makes the mistake of trying this, and they get a very bad trip. In the end the doctor is very angry with him, because he didn't listen to him. He also finds out that the person that he thought he killed in the car, was actually a different person. I think this movie is a bit of a letdown. It is very funny, and a bit dark, but it is a bad movie. I recommend it if you like mountain bikers.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to admit I was surprised to find a movie about a group of teens who are going to have to find an alternative to the popular, popular, "hip" stuff in school. But, that's what the kids want, is to be cool and to be accepted, but they're not. The kids are just looking for a different kind of fun, and one night they find it in a bar called "The Belly of the Beast." The Belly is run by a very strange woman named Rita (played by D.B. Woodside) who seems to have an almost telepathic connection with all the patrons. But there are other kids who get the bad end of the deal, and when the girls find out that their favorite girl is being taken over by a demon, they decide to try to get her out of there. But can they do it in time?   Written by Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a few films in my time, and a lot of them are bad.   The best films have a great story, great performances, a good sense of humour and a good soundtrack.  They are also the films that get the most exposure on TV, because of the ratings they get.  I guess this film is the second best film of the series (after The Great Train Robbery ), and the best of the TV series.  This film is a must see for anyone who loves train movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I knew the name of this movie, I'd have never seen it. This movie was absolutely ridiculous and yet it got a solid "good" rating from me.   The movie begins with a black woman in a car and a white guy in a truck. They are talking about her being in love with a white man and her being very happy about it. Then a cop (Robert DeNiro) arrives and tells the guy to pull over and then leaves. He's followed by a white woman who doesn't understand why the black guy is following her.  The next thing we see is the black woman and the white guy, sitting in a tree, and it is very obvious that they are both having an affair. The movie then jumps to a scene in the middle of the road and a man named Frank (DeNiro's character) is trying to pull the car over. The car has a big red cross on the front of it and he wants to pull it over and get out of the way.  He then pulls a gun on the black man and the black lady and they are having a heated argument. Frank then tells the white woman that she has to go and then he takes off and leaves the woman alone with the black.  In the next scene, we see the white man pulling up to the same spot where Frank is and the woman is sitting in the car. He gets out and goes to talk to the black and then the black is sitting next to the woman. The woman asks the black if he knows anything about her husband (the man in the truck). The black replies that he knows nothing about her and then asks the woman to help him get to the truck. The next scene is a scene from a bar where the two women are drinking. The black woman says to the white lady that she knows that the man in her car has been following her and that he had been driving very fast.  This is the scene in which we see Frank pulling up and getting out of his car. The white woman tells the black to get in the trunk and Frank gets in.  Next, the woman gets out of her car and Frank is sitting behind her. He tells the woman that he can help her get to his truck and then they are in a scene where the woman's husband is trying in vain to get the black truck away from the woman in the back.  After that, the movie jumps to another scene where a police car has pulled
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll start this off by saying that I am not a huge fan of the Star Wars movies. Sure, they were pretty awesome at the time. But, like any other franchise, they are now just a part of pop culture. The new movies aren't as good as the old ones. In fact, they're probably the worst ones. They are basically "The Empire Strikes Back" with bad special effects. I guess I'm not a big fan of either Luke Skywalker or Han Solo, and the characterizations are very, very shallow. There are a few cool scenes here and there, but the story is pretty bland and there's very little character development. Even the special effects are pretty lame, with a few reused characters and a few recycled scenes.   The story focuses on a group of mercenaries who are hired by an evil galactic tyrant to take out a very powerful and well known bounty hunter. Unfortunately, it's up to them to stop a band of thieves and criminals who just happen to be Jedi and Sith! It's an action packed romp. The mercenaries and Jedi and even the villains all have interesting personalities, and are fun to watch. The plot is pretty standard fare. But this film isn't really about that. It's about a ragtag group of individuals trying to stop an evil despot and a bunch of Jedi and the Sith who happen to have the power to stop him. Unfortunately this story isn't as original as the previous films. It is pretty basic. It could have used a lot more humor and some more interesting characters, but I'm sure there are many people who enjoy the Star War universe just as much as I do. Overall, I'm a fan of these movies and will probably watch them again, especially if they are on DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great! It has the feeling of a film about the people who live in the valley. I liked the way they handled the music and the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** In a world where a man can be assassinated on stage in front of a bunch of his best friends (including his wife, who is also a stage actress) I thought it would be a little strange to see the main character of this film, a young man who was a victim of this assassination, come to live with his estranged father. However, that's just what happens when the young man is found to be a talented actor. The father then makes the young boy play the role of a boy in a play, but the plot is just too simple and this simple plot is all that is needed to show the boy's talent. He plays the part of a young boy who goes out with his best friend and is killed in the process. The boy, in a kind of way, comes to understand that this is the result of his actions and so he tries to redeem himself in some way. Unfortunately, I never found the redeeming aspects to be in this film. The acting is very basic and the plot seems to be very simple. It's a pity that this film is only in two parts because it would have been much better as a film that is more complete. This is a rather strange film that has a lot to offer but has the potential to be more than it is. *********************

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie multiple times and enjoyed it. The first time I saw it I thought it was pretty funny. The plot is simple and the film is funny but not overly so. There is a lot of good and bad things about this film. The acting is very good, although I did not care for the lead. The ending is very short and does not do much for me. The music was very good but I did have to look for it a little to figure out what was happening. The sound effects are good. The color and the lighting of the film was nice. It is fun to see how people would react to being in a prison and I think it is good. It did not leave a bad taste in my mouth and it is definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great comedy!  The plot is not much original (except for the title).  It is a "what if" story of the 1950's.  All of the characters are played by the same actor: Jerry Lewis.    He is the most charismatic and talented of all the actors in the movie.  Lewis is not an actor who can play a character well, he is an actor of great talent.  There are two actors in this movie, which makes it a good comedy.  The one who is the greatest is Jerry Lewis who plays a great comic.  His character is "The Comedian" and he is a great character.  He knows how to play a comic character and his performance in the comedy is very good.  Jerry Lewis is also a great actor in "The Nutty Professor".   There is also "The Rival" in the film.  This is a good, if a little predictable, comedy.   There are several funny scenes in the whole movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I love the classic "The Wizard of Oz" series as much as I love all things "Sesame Street". I grew up watching the first three episodes as a child. The first episode in particular is quite scary, and I always wondered what happened to Dorothy after she got away from the Wizard. Well, in the first episode "Lonely and Lost" Dorothy meets the Scarecrow. The Scarecrow is a character who is much different from his fellow "Sparks" and is very selfish. In fact, the Scarecrows were supposed to have been destroyed by the evil Wizard, but they have managed to keep the Wizard at bay for some time. This is a good example of how the Scare-crows can turn good and evil. The second episode is also very scary, with the evil wizard (or his minions) trying to take Dorothy and Scarecrow to the "House of the Winged Monkeys". The Scare-crow tries to stop them and fails. But he gets lucky and is able to keep them from getting killed. In the last episode the Wizard comes to Dorothy's house and tries to get her to help him take over the world. But she refuses and he goes away to fight the "Munchkins". This was one of the first shows I saw where I was very scared. The only way to win is to kill the Munchkins. The Munchkin leader is named Flounder, and he is an absolute evil person. He is very sadistic and sadistic. If I remember correctly, the episode where Dorothy gets trapped in a cave with the Muppets was pretty bad. I am not going to spoil it, but the episode ends with the Scareclrows trying to save Dorothy from the evil Munchks. This was also one of my favorite episodes, and is a very good episode in its own right. The other episodes, "The Yellow Brick Road" and "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ" are just as good. Â It was a good series that did a lot of good things for kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say that this movie has the best movie plots and characters I have seen in a long time.  There is one character that stands out the most in this movie.    He is an orphan and a loser.    He has been adopted and raised by a group of older men who have been drinking.  When he goes to get a job to help his family get through the winter.  He meets a girl who is beautiful and funny.  They fall in love.  It gets better, when he gets married to her.  After the wedding, the wife becomes ill and the couple go on a vacation to a cabin.  She is sick.  His father and his uncle show up at the cabin. He wants him to leave and get help.  Then the wife comes back to the cabin and she is dying.  The father and uncle go out and find a doctor.  Meanwhile, he has a run in with his uncle.  That is the end of the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this one a couple of times, but it's always been pretty good.   If you are looking for a good action movie, this is the one.  I'm not sure what was different about this movie that made it so good. Perhaps it's the great acting, or the music.  But it's really just the best of the action movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** I've always been a big fan of the 80s, and so was my brother when he was a kid. I think we got the whole "the big bad wolf" thing from the TV show. It's an original idea, and the story is really cool. We were at a friend's house and his parents were trying to get us to go to the movie, and we said, "Well, we can't go." But then, we were like, "we could." And, it was just the first time we saw this movie. I just loved the idea of a guy that was a little kid, and that was really cool to me. And then we watched it over and over and it was so fun! ********************** I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. It wasn't as "adult" as some of the other movies I've seen in the past, but I liked the idea. I was interested to see if the director, Paul Verhoeven, would be able to get a sequel off the ground. ****************** I don't really know much about the film, but it's really good. It does have a bit of a "dark" tone to it, but the characters were funny and the idea was original. ************** This is one of my favorite movies. It is definitely a unique, weird movie. It isn't for everyone, but if you like it, I would recommend it to you. *********
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think I can safely say that this movie is worth watching, even if you haven't seen it yet.  The story is about a group of teenagers who are all getting into the same drug called "Lilac."  They are trying to escape from the drug and the authorities, and the only way to do so is to get their hands on a new drug called, "Penny."  A group of friends decide to go on a drug run.    I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It is a fun story, and a good way to pass the time while on vacation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the early 1900s the rich and famous and the very rich of the era decided that they needed a place where they could go where no one could see them and they would be the center of attention. The location was the mansion of a very rich family and the mansion itself was built to be very big. The house was large enough for about 3 thousand people. It had a very big kitchen, a huge barber shop, and a very large theater. But the real star of the movie was the house itself. It was huge and full of all the trappings of the rich life. There was a barber with a huge moustache and a big smile on his face and a bunch of servants who all worked for the same master and were all dressed up in the most extravagant clothes. The only one who wasn't dressed to the nines was the master himself. He was dressed in a long white overcoat that made him look like a poor man. He sat in his big leather chair that was so big he could stretch out on it and he was talking to a bunch his servants. He looked like a very old man, which was just about right because he had been living in this house for years and years. He did his talking with his big hands and his big voice and he just sounded like a rich old man talking to old people. There were so many things to see and see about in this movie, but I have to give a special mention to the one of the greatest lines ever in a movie: "You're a rich man, but you're not a king."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this at a friend's house and it was really good. The movie was actually quite good, the only thing I could say is that I liked the way they filmed the fight scenes. It was quite a bit different than most movies about this sort of stuff and that's a good thing. The music is great and the acting is good. It also got a very good ending which is a nice touch.   Might as well mention, that this is the only film that I've seen where there's a man who doesn't really like the title character. He wants him dead, and the reason he's not happy about it is that he's a bit of a loner. This is a good one for a lazy day at the beach. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about an alien from the planet Vissur that has lived in a forest with the native inhabitants. She comes to a town that is trying to save itself. Her arrival is a sign that something is very wrong. I like the aliens and I think that it is the best part of the movie. The ending is good and it makes you feel that the world is not so much like it seems to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was surprised at how well this movie handled the situation of a guy who was about to kill his girlfriend when he is contacted by a guy named Steve to do a job that he has a talent for and he needs someone to do it with a little help from his friend. This guy was so good as the character and I found myself rooting for him a lot.  He is a real nice guy who does all he can to make things right for his girlfriend.  I liked this movie a lot:    I really enjoyed this movie and it is a good, good movie.   The movie is well made and it's just about what you would expect.  This movie has a lot of action, but it's not boring at all.  The best part of the movie is when Steve has a dream about a young girl and that girl was his girlfriend before she was murdered.  I hope this movie gets a lot more attention since it's so good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only one of its kind I watched and I loved it.  A lot of people don't seem to like this movie but I do.  It is a classic story of a group of men who are stuck in a bad situation and have to overcome all kinds of obstacles.    I hope they are able to get their lives back together after they are stranded in a snow storm.  I also watched this film and liked it very much.  The plot was a little long but it was interesting to watch the men overcome many obstacles.   The only thing I didn't like about it was the "movie" they made with the actors.  I would like to see a better movie made from the actors' actual acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We begin the film with the two of them in a room, with a little kid in a wheelchair sitting on a bed, playing a game with a toy rifle. We then cut to a scene of the old woman, Mrs. Houghton, who we know is a little crazy. She is looking around the house for something, anything to keep her happy. We next see her sitting on the porch looking at the little boy. Mrs.Houghton says she is so happy she could fly. After this scene the film moves to a party at the Houghtons' house. We see Mrs.Powers sitting on one of the chairs with a glass of beer in her hand. The other guests are: Mr. Bicknell, who looks like an old man, and his wife. They are not happy. Mrs Bickney's daughter is there and she is also unhappy. The older Mr.Bicknell then asks his wife if she has a hobby. Mrs Houghney tells him about a girl she is trying to get a picture of. The old lady gets up and walks over to the little girl who has a picture. She looks at the picture and looks like she is very happy. The wife then says she likes that picture because it is an old picture of a young girl, but not like she looks today. The husband says he likes the picture, but the wife does not. The younger Mrs.Bickleton then says that she wants a picture taken of the little girls with their mother, because she says that they look like they could be the next great models. Mrs Powers says that the little boys in the picture look so sad and she wishes she could take a picture with them. The father then says he would like a picture as well. The little boy, now a young man, walks into the room and says, "Mrs. Bickleton, you can't take a child's picture with me!" Mrs Bickleney says, I don't think you know what a picture is!" The mother asks, "Why don't you show me what a child looks like?" The old woman says, Let me show you a picture and then you can tell me." The father takes a picture, then we hear the mother asking the little man in the photo to smile. This is the first time we see the little kids smile. The mother tells the children they are beautiful and says they should take more pictures and they will be stars. Then

A team of scientists and doctors is sent to investigate the spread and the cause of the infection. As the team is sent out into the field, they begin to encounter the strange beings who are trying to escape the city and the world.  The cast is fantastic, especially David Ogden Stiers as Dr. Michael Thall. I also really enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Bill Paxton as the leader of the dirty death and his wife, Sarah Stiller as his assistant.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Great War" is a very good film and one that does not disappoint. The action sequences are fast paced and the action is excellent. The film is a good mix of action and drama and it is all done very well. There is nothing wrong with the story line but it has to be said that it does have a very long running time. It is not the longest movie but it does go on for quite a while. The final battle is not a good one and it leaves a lot to be desired but the action sequences and the ending are very good. There are many scenes that have to be seen to be believed. The acting is good and there are many strong performances but it is not enough to make the movie a great one. The music is very good but it seems like it is a bit overdone. It has a very cool sound but it sounds a bit out of place and is a little on the dull side. There was nothing wrong in the special effects but they are a little slow. It would have been nice if they had gone with a few more special effects. The DVD and Blu-ray are both very good and the picture quality is very nice. This movie is not exactly a masterpiece but it should be given credit for what it is. It does a good job of telling the story and of showing how war changes the human race. This is a fun film and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys action films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that this is a really good movie that has a good story. The movie is a little bit hard to watch because there is a lot of swearing and cursing, but it is not very bad. The story is about a girl named Rose (Mila Kunis) who goes to the town of Grist and is trying to find out where her dad (Peter Falk) is. She gets into a fight with some men who want to kidnap her but she escapes with the help of her best friend (Gunnar Hansen) and a man who looks just like her father (Peter Riegert). The movie shows that Rose has a lot more problems than what she is showing on the surface, but she is able to keep herself together because of her friendship with Gunn (Hansen) and the fact that he is the same age as her. There are a lot different scenes in the movie and the director really does a good job in making it more than just a bad joke. The characters are not so strong, but they are able to make it through with a good fight and some laughs. I have seen a lot worse movies in my life, but I like this one a lot and recommend it to all who want a good comedy.   This is a very good movie and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie quite a bit and was hoping that I would be able to see it again, but unfortunately the movie was not available for rental at the theater where I saw it. The movie was made in 1966, and I don't think that it is too old for us to remember, and there were some good old westerns at that time.    As far as the acting is concerned, there were a few very good performances, and it is worth watching them. The story is pretty much what you would expect from a western. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Citizen Kane" (1941) is one of the most famous films in history. It was directed by Orson Welles (who also directed "Citizen Henry" in 1925). The movie is about a rich man who tries to take a cheap flight to Europe. After being attacked by a German U-boat, the man gets his life saved by a woman and a man from a circus. It is the first film that really dealt with a love story, and was very popular with the American audience, who loved the story of a man who could not have anything but his own wealth and his love for a woman who has no money. Welles was an American director who had a huge influence on many film makers, including Stanley Kubrick (who directed the famous "Dr. Strangelove" and "2001: A Space Odyssey") and Martin Scorsese (who made "Raging Bull" and the classic "Goodfellas".) The film has a great story line, and some of the best scenes are in the last third of the movie, when the rich man is trying to get back to his country. The scene where the woman is holding the gold on the bank is a great one. The story was not about a great hero, but about the character of a poor man who has to try to find a way out of his situation. He does so with a very funny attitude and good performances. Well, I have to say that I had not seen this movie until the past few years, but I was quite a big fan of it. It reminded me a lot of the movies that I grew up watching, like "The Apartment" and "The Maltese Falcon". The ending was the best part of the film, because it made me laugh so hard! I am sure that the fans of this movie will love it as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been a big fan of Michael Cimino for a while, and I've seen a bunch of his movies since then.  In this movie, he plays the part of a retired cop who gets a job with a private investigator.  I was just curious how a retired police officer who worked on a murder case, who then goes to get a job and makes a big impression, could have so much sex.    So I watched it.  It's not a very good movie.  Ciminema is a bad movie, and it's the type of bad movie where you don't really think about what's happening.  This movie is about a guy who gets caught up in a murder and ends up being the murderer.  The plot is a little confusing at times, but you can't fault Cimini for trying something different.  There are a few good parts in the movie, like the car chase scene.  But I think the movie is just a mess.  I mean, it's hard to explain, but it has a bad taste in it. It's a movie that you can watch and see a few of the good parts, but then you realize that you're watching the movie Cimine.  And that's a shame, because the guy is a good actor, and his character is really cool.  He's not that bad in the film, but I think it's a pretty good movie, I'd just recommend it to people who aren't really familiar with Ciminal's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. It is not for everyone, it is very dark and serious. But at the same time it is a very entertaining movie. I was so excited to see this movie that I forgot all about all the other stuff I was supposed to do that day. I wanted to see the rest of the movie as well, but I couldn't help myself.   If you don't mind dark and mature movies then I think this is a good one. It has some very good action scenes. It also has a lot of comedy that you will find very funny. I found that I liked the movie more the second time I watched it. It was more enjoyable that I thought it would be, even if I didn't get to see any of the characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape is an action packed, high octane action film.  It's set in the 1920's in Nazi-occupied France where the Allies are preparing to invade France from the north and are under the command of the French commander, General Ludendorff. Â The French resistance is under the control of Colonel Renard who is the best fighter pilot of the resistance.    He's also the most intelligent, funny and likable guy you'll meet in the movie.      Renard is the lead character and his job is to go around killing German soldiers and blowing up bridges to slow the Allies' advance.  This is done by flying around a city blowing up the bridges so the French can advance. He's really a fun character and he's always getting into crazy adventures.  One of the best parts about the movie is that there's a lot of comedy in the action.  You get to see a few more action scenes after Renard's first action scene.  There's also a couple of other characters like a priest and a young girl who is a spy for the resistance, and they're pretty funny too.  Overall this is a fun action movie with lots of action and humor.  It's got a great cast and a lot to do and that's what makes a great action movie.   I give this a solid 7.0 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I'm not mistaken, this movie is based on a book by the same name by John D. MacDonald, who is the pen name of Robert W. Chambers, who died in 1968. It was published in 1951, and the movie was released in 1955. The book is about a group of teenagers who travel across the country, and one of them falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family who lives in the suburbs. The kids live in a large house, where they go to school, play sports, and hang out with their friends. They all are close friends, and they all go to the same school, but the school is pretty bad. One of the girls is pretty, but pretty ugly. There is a rumor that she's cheating on her boyfriend, and a teacher says the rumor is true, and that's why she's getting bad marks. The boys get jealous of her, and try to make her jealous. It's kind of a mess, but it's a good mess.   The film is about all the people involved in the story. The story is told from the point of view of the principal of the school, a rather rude and mean man. He has a son who is a bit too close for comfort to the girl who's in love. It turns out that she is the daughter of a wealthy, famous movie producer, and he and the principal have been in love for a long time. The girl, however, is a good student and the only one who can relate to the boys. The movie also has some good songs, and it has a lot of laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most recent of the three "Iron Sky" movies, this one is an excellent example of how the old "space opera" tropes (such as the exploration of the cosmos through the use of a starship) can be applied to the more realistic "space western". It's also the most coherent in its plot.   An excellent movie that's well worth the price.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of James Bond and a fanboy of the 007 movies in general, this one is for you.   It takes the essence of Bond films and the films in the James Bond series and makes them even better.  The plot was extremely complex and interesting, and the special effects were good, although the film was somewhat predictable.  I found myself laughing quite a bit and was actually a bit disappointed by the ending.  However, it's a fun watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny how a film can be considered an American classic and then be so widely misunderstood by Americans.   The movie was made in 1970 in Los Angeles, California, and it tells the story of a small-time businessman who moves to an isolated house with his wife and two daughters.  The children have grown up to be young women and the man has decided to go on a trip to Hawaii to find out the truth about the island and to see the beautiful woman that is his daughter.  But there are many problems with this film.  First, the title.  That sounds like a bad movie to me.  You would think it's the same movie that was called  The Little Foxes  (1942), or something along those lines.  There is nothing about this movie that would suggest that it is an American comedy.  It is a little more adult than that.  Also, the plot is rather silly.  I would love to know the real story of how the little girl got the fox's hair, but I doubt that the filmmakers have ever actually seen a fox.  And there is no way that the film can make us laugh at all.  Now, this is not a bad film, it's just a silly one.  My kids loved it, my wife loved it.  Some critics called it an anti-war movie.  This is certainly true of the ending, which ends with the characters getting blown to bits by a bomb and a bunch of American soldiers in helmets running through a cemetery, but that's not the movie's most outrageous moment.  If you think about it, the whole thing is based on the fact that the man was trying to get a photo of the beautiful lady who lived in the house and he got the hair of the fox.  But that's all he got!  I have a hard time believing that the people who made this film would be in on the joke at all!  They might have done so on purpose, but even so, it was just too ridiculous to be believable.  So, there's that.

This movie is pretty good.  There are a lot more action scenes and there are some very nice performances by a few people in this film.  My only complaint is that I wish the action scenes were just a bit more dramatic.  But it is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun, well made action flick that is easy to watch. The villains are fun to watch as well as the protagonists. This is a solid action flick from a great director and a talented cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first time watching a movie from the 80's and I can say that it is a classic.  The story revolves around a college kid who is the only person to survive the plane crash in the mountains, which is just the right amount of intense and scary.    I would recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun little film.   The story of the little boy (David O. Russell) who is told by his parents to "not let them know we are going to see 'It's a Wonderful Life'."   I thought the story of It's a wonderful life was fun.  This little film is a little bit more realistic than a lot of other films that are coming out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an oldie but a goodie.  It was produced in 1953 and the star of the movie was Jack Lemmon.   He plays a writer who is writing a novel about a guy who is trying to steal the secret formula for a bomb.  He's being chased by a policeman.  Lemmon has a pretty good physical presence, and I've always liked him.  This is an older movie and Lemmon isn't as strong as he was when he was younger, but he has a great turn as a writer trying to figure out what he wants to do.  I thought the film was great and it was a little bit long, but it was still a pretty great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing I didn't like about this film was that it was just about three hours long. There is a reason why this movie has become one of my favorites. The story of the film is about a girl who has lost her father and her mother. She is living with her aunt and uncle and the uncle is the only person who is still in the family. He is a former sailor and he has always been kind and generous to the girls who have lived in the house with him. This was the first time that the girls would be allowed to go out and do what they want. They were allowed to play and have fun. This is the first film in the series of films about the girls that were once a part of the family that has been destroyed. These girls are now very old and they are no longer able to do anything with the old man that lives in the attic. The film begins with the girls going down to the attic and getting on a rocking chair and doing whatever they want to do. This scene is really fun and entertaining. The girls start to feel the warmth of the attic as it is full of toys and books. They start to talk about their past and the old stories that they used to tell to each other. They sing and play and get into trouble a lot. When they get into this kind of trouble they usually get away with it but sometimes they are caught and it doesn't look good for them. One of the girls ends up getting into trouble by running into a tree that the others have been told not to go near. She falls and is badly injured. It is obvious that she will be unable to do any work when she gets back to her aunt's house. She can't even walk and the aunt and her husband have no idea how to get her back to the house. One girl finds the key to the old house and makes a plan to get back to it. They have to get the key by doing a dangerous trick. It takes them about five hours to get to the key and they have to find out a way to get out of the house without getting caught. The ending is really good and very exciting. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good laugh.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid movie, but it doesn't stand out in any way. I think the main draw is the characters, which are really good. There is a very sweet girl, a guy who loves her, and a guy with a really bad heart. The movie is about how a guy comes to terms with his love for his girlfriend. He has to learn to love himself in order to live with this girl. This movie was shot in the 1970's, and there is a lot of sexual tension and nudity. The acting is very good. I thought that this was a very good movie, even though it didn't really stand out to me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was okay, the only thing that i found wrong was the fact that the characters all look like they were made by an 8 year old.   It was ok, not a bad movie by any means, but nothing that will stick in your head. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie ever made, in fact, it is the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen.   It's like the whole movie is in one movie theater, the movie is like a dream.  There are things in this movie that are truly amazing and things that are so simple as to be comical.  It has a fantastic ending, but you need to be in a place with a lot of people to see it.     I don't know what it is about this movie, but I love it. It's a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a little over the top at times, but it is the right kind of over thetop. There are some pretty awesome action scenes.  The plot is simple, but not simple at all.   The story follows a group of children who are all from the same village, and are the only ones who can fly, and who all have special powers.  When a storm rolls in, the kids are trapped on a small island. The storm is so powerful that it is killing the animals on the island, and everyone is in a state of panic. The kids decide to save the day, but there is a big problem.  What if the storm comes back?   This movie has so many things going on at once that it never seems to slow down.  It doesn't feel like a kid movie at all, and I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I loved it.  My favorite scene is definitely when a giant boulder comes crashing down on a boat, causing a huge wave that drowns everyone.  The ending is really amazing.  I'm sorry that I don't have the original soundtrack on vinyl, but the song "Hakuna Matata" is great, and the kids singing it makes it even better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a way, this movie is similar to the first part of the story. The first part was very good but it didn't do anything to keep the audience interested. This part is a bit more interesting, more action-packed and the plot is much more interesting. I enjoyed this part more than the first.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie to watch when you are bored. A man wakes up to find himself in a strange world. The film starts with the first line "I'm in a very strange and disturbing situation" and the story begins. We see a man on his way to work in the morning when he hears the scream of a woman. He gets on his bike and heads towards the sound, but gets stopped by a strange woman. The man is intrigued and starts following her. After the woman leaves he realizes that he is in a house. It seems like there are other people in the house, but he cannot tell who they are. He goes to bed and dreams of the strange woman from his dream.   The film is filled with mystery and mystery. We know the first person in the film to be a woman, but she does not speak or appear in the picture. She only watches and seems to watch. We also see another woman with red hair, but we can't see her. We do see her walk into a room. It looks like a hospital room, but there is no bed or any walls, and there is only a white carpet. We hear the man's voice, and his wife is heard.  It seems that the man is stuck in a room and has no idea what is happening. The only person who seems to know anything is the woman. She is an eccentric woman who is trying to find out the man in the strange world, but cannot seem to get a hold of him. She has a lot of weird ideas. She also thinks that she is being watched by the man from the dream. It is interesting that the woman is in this strange world and not the man. There is a strange creature who can see and hear. He has the same eyes as the man and a red nose. We get to see this strange creature more and more. The creature is really creepy and is a great addition to the movie.  This movie is worth seeing, and you will be really bored by the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This is one of those movies that make you think "Why is it still here?". Â The plot is not a new one (in the Western genre), but there is something about it that just works, that I think is just an extraordinary way to make a movie. Â There is a sense of realism about it, of an area where people have lived their lives for centuries and that it has all sorts of strange ways of keeping alive its traditions and culture.  I don't want to give too much away about it other than to say that the story is very well done and the story itself is very engaging.    I would say this is a good watch and one that is a nice change of pace for me from some of the more serious Westerns that I have seen in the past.

There is a few moments of real comedy, but the rest is just very average.  The plot is a bit too simple to make the story engaging.  It's like a movie about a boy who becomes a cat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been wanting to see the movie since it came out, but have been very busy lately and have only seen it twice. I am so glad I finally got to see it! It's the funniest thing I have seen all year. The actors are so great. You never know what you are going to get. The movie is not for everyone. It's just too fast paced. But I do think it is a good comedy. It doesn't try to be something it's not, and it doesn't take itself seriously. The ending is a little off, but I like the way they ended the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few things about this movie that I don't really like.  The first is that they had to have a really good reason to put the evil guy in a tank and drive around in a trailer with his gun.  It is just silly.    This is a really old story and I think that most of the people who make these old movies are still alive and still making them.  There are still people who can make a really nice old movie.  I am not sure if this is the best movie about a gangster.  But I really liked this movie and I enjoyed watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great piece of cinema. There are many scenes of the same thing in many different places.  A little boy is kidnapped by a girl.   The girl is not very good looking but she is strong, and the little boy has a small sword and he wants to help her.    They are in a big house, the mother is there, and she is in a room on the floor.  Then the little boys big sister comes in and she has a sword, and he asks her to be his big sister.  And she says no.  But then he gets a little bit mad, and they go to the kitchen.  When they get there they find a big bowl of food and the mother and sister are eating.  The boy sees them and wants to go help them.  So he runs in and sees the mother with the big sword, he jumps in the sword and tries to kill the mother, but she has the bigger sword and she kills the boy.  Now the little brother runs in to see the mother dead, and when the mother dies he is really sad, but then the little sister comes to see him and she says it is alright, the big sister has a big sword too and she could kill the little brothers mother too, but the big sisters big sister is a girl, so she wouldn't kill the big brothers mom.  I have watched this movie a couple of times now, and it is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This movie is an absolute masterpiece, and is worth watching all the way through. The story, while not very original, is an incredible combination of the horror genre and the classic western, with plenty of violence and humor." -Movie Review "I'm not sure why, but I don't have the slightest idea what the story is about. The film opens with a very good fight scene, but there's no plot. The main character is a cowboy named Roy (Billy Zane), and he's out to get his sister Mary (Helen Hunt) who's been kidnapped by the local town bully. Unfortunately, it turns out that he's not the only one who's trying to get her back, and that the bully's a bit more sinister than Roy's fear of the dark. As the story progresses, the plot becomes more and more unclear, until it ends up in a rather strange way, but then the story gets even stranger and we have a very strange ending. This is a very fun movie, and I have to say it deserves a place on your list of great Westerns. It's hard to believe that this is the same Billy Zane who was in The Magnificent Seven, and he looks great in the role. This movie isn't just for kids, and it's great fun." -Rotten Tomatoes

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The story is very good and the actors did a great job in portraying it. It is a story about a young man who has a strange ability that he uses to scare people. The more you look into it, the more weird it gets. It seems like every time he does it, something bad happens. So the only way to get rid of it is to find the cause and destroy it. As it goes on, the guy seems to be losing control and losing his sanity. If you like the idea of being scared, then this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My review of this movie is not a review, but rather a review of the movie itself.   I would describe this as a "mature" and "dramatic" take on a "fairy tale" or "romance" story.  And it's a good one.  It begins with a young man named Thomas (John C. Reilly), who has an uncanny ability to survive any kind of disaster. He is saved by a handsome prince named Thomas, and a princess named Alice (Hannah Dunbar).  However, Thomas has a secret: He is a sorcerer, and he is in love with Alice.  Thomas uses his powers to make everything around him disappear and then re-appear. He can also take the form of a mouse, a fish, a dragon, and even a snake. He wants to become the king of a new land, but he needs the help of a sorcerer named Jorg (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do so.  The story takes place in a small town called The Little Mermaid, and it's there that the story takes a turn.  Before the main story, we are introduced to three characters who are the "main" focus of the film: the beautiful princess, Thomas' love interest, and Jorg, a master of magic.  While they may not have a huge role in the movie, they are a lot of fun.  Also, in my opinion, the acting was a lot better than expected.  I liked Dunbar and Reilly a lot.  Dunbar's Alice is an interesting character, and the chemistry between them is very well done.  Cumberbatch is not just good in this movie, he is also a great villain.  One of the things I was surprised by is how the movie doesn't take itself seriously at all.  This is a movie that is meant to be silly, and we see that.  However the characters are meant to grow, and develop over the course of the story. It's not a movie for the squeamish.  There is a lot to be said for this movie.  My rating:     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting a lot of the same things from this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It's pretty straightforward, but the story was really interesting and had a good plot. It has a strong sense of humor, and the character development was good. There are plenty of memorable moments. The movie was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie, but I had to add a few words to explain the story:   When the young couple go to visit a new neighbor (played by William Atherton) in the big house at the end of the block, they discover that he's a very bad man.    The wife is a very beautiful young girl, but she doesn't do much of anything.  She is just an older, more educated, and more worldly wife than her husband.  They meet the nice young couple at a local park, and the wife is introduced to the neighbor as "the lady next door" who has taken an interest in her.  The neighbor has a young wife, who seems to be just as interested in the husband as she is in the lady next-door.  I loved the idea that we see the wife as the more worldly older wife, but then see the neighbor at her most innocent, almost childlike, when they go to the park.  It's so funny, because they have so little sex in the movie, and they do everything they can to stay away from it.  Even when they come to the bedroom to have a little fun, they are still very careful to not do anything too "hot" or even "brave."  It makes for a really cute, sweet movie, which is a real treat to watch, even if you haven't seen the movie before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most amazing movie that I ever saw!   In the beginning of the movie, we meet our main character, "M", a mysterious and shy man who goes on an adventure with his friend "J", a young, pretty woman. We meet their friends, a cat called "B", a boy named "S", a little dog named "Mulan" and some other people who also play an important role in the movie.   It's not a good idea to talk about the movie while it is in progress, so I will just say this: this is a movie about a small group of friends that go on an adventurous journey and meet some pretty women.  The story is very interesting and is very well told.  There are many things in this movie that are completely new to me.  I liked the way the story is told and the way characters move through the movie without a moment's hesitation.  Also, it is a good way to spend your afternoon.  If you have seen a film like this before, you will have a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny movie that will make you laugh out loud, and laugh until you cry.   This is the perfect comedy movie, and the laughs are well timed.  I think the only downside is that it seems to be in black and white, but it isn't. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a wonderful movie that was shot in an unusual way, by the director of the same name.   He used a film camera with a zoom lens, which allowed him to take pictures that were wide enough to cover almost the whole stage of the play, but narrow enough to capture the people in the foreground.  The setting was also interesting, especially in the early scenes, which were shot at night.  I can still remember the dark shadows that fell on the face of the actor in the stage door, where the audience would have been standing.  This was a fun movie that made me laugh a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Mysterious Stranger" is the perfect film for Halloween. This is a great story and a great character, with a very well written script. It is an interesting film with great acting and a really creepy story. The story is told with a bit of mystery, but it is very believable. I really liked this movie and I hope that it is released as a movie.  The next film in this list is "Mama" from the 1970s.    I like this movie because it is not about an "ordinary" man but a man who has a strange ability to transform himself into an animal. I liked this film because the film had a great soundtrack and the story was well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been a long time since I've watched a film in which the main character (and the movie) is a gay man. And this one does an amazing job of showing us how the whole world (and some of the people in it) thinks about gays and gays, even though they can't help it. I've seen many movies about gays, and I've only seen a few of these. But this movie is a must-see for everyone, especially if you're gay. I was a little confused when I first saw this film, as there were a couple of scenes that seemed to be about the same thing (I'm assuming, because there are other scenes in the movie that are the same). But it was all so different from anything I've ever seen before, and that's what made it so good. The movie is about two gay men, who are trying to find their way in life, and who are constantly having problems in their lives, such as getting in fights, not being able to get a job, and all the other stuff they do. The one thing they both have in common is that they love each other, and they both try to find a way to deal with the problems they have, but the problems keep coming up. It's a very funny, very interesting movie, and a very worthwhile movie. If you haven't seen this movie, you have no excuse not to. It will probably make you laugh a lot, and it's one of the funniest movies I've had the chance to see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know if you've seen the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still", but if you haven't, I'd like to recommend it. It was based on the book " The Day the Universe Stood Cool ", which I'm sure you've read at least once or twice by now. It tells the story of a group of people who are trying to keep Earth from being destroyed by a nuclear war. I loved it! It was funny and scary, and it was a good little story about the future of our world and a bit about the possibility of the universe being in some kind of constant state of chaos. The ending was very strange, and I really don't get it, but I guess that's the way of the future. I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's interested in the story, but the movie's a bit more entertaining than I expected, and that's enough for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of the classic, John Carpenter's 'The Thing' and have been for years. The new movie has all the classic elements: alien invasions, secret government experiments, mysterious disappearances, and even a hint of a scientific horror story. It's not a perfect movie, but it's a fun one. The movie is about a research team that is sent to the Pacific Northwest to find a living organism that is able to survive in the harsh conditions. There, they are trapped by a strange monster that can kill a man in one punch. The creature is named the Thing and it is a giant tentacled monster that is also able to shoot lasers from its eyes. The team is sent in to kill it but it has a habit of escaping. The Thing's only goal is to kill the scientists and whoever gets in its way.    This movie is fun. I've never seen anything quite like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie last night and was so impressed with it. I can't believe it's only 11 minutes long. I didn't even know the movie was so good until I saw it.   This movie is like a cross between a bad day at the office and a bad movie.  I don't know if it's the way the story is told or the fact that it's a comedy, but it's really funny. The story of the movie is about a bunch of losers that have to go to a movie and try to entertain themselves.  The only thing they seem to want to do is to go into a movie theater and watch movies. They decide to watch a movie about a group of guys who go into the movies to find someone. The guy in the movie goes to the movies every night. Every night. The movie ends and they decide to find out why. The answer is actually a really good one.  When they get to the movie theater the movie starts and they have to sit in the seats to see the movie. When the movie finally starts it's just the one guy who wants to find his girl. The girl he's looking for is in the audience. When he goes to her she gets up and walks away and he thinks she's going to leave. Then she starts dancing in the background and it's very embarrassing for the guy who has to sit there all day and look at her dancing. So he walks out.  At first the movie seems like it's going okay until the guy in front of the guy walks up to him and he goes over to the guy and asks him out. The man says he's married. The woman walks over and says "Oh, you're married? Well I don;t know who you are but I'd like to dance with you."  Now this guy has no idea what to do. He goes back to his seat and sits there and the woman keeps dancing in front. He can't sit still and it starts to get really embarrassing. He keeps asking the woman to dance but she just keeps dancing.  After about 10 minutes of this the guy gets up to leave and walks to the women's seat to tell her she has to dance again. She just tells him to shut up and goes over and dances with him.  Now the movie ends but the guy has a big smile on his face.  It's the perfect movie and it has a very good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of the Worst  is an  awful movie, and I love that about it.  It's a movie about a guy who lives in the desert, in the middle of nowhere.  He's pretty average, really.  One day a man walks up to him and tells him he has to help him move a giant rock out of the way.  So, the guy moves the rock.  After a while, a giant scorpion comes up to the man, and he's like, "You gotta move that rock.   That scorpion is going to kill me!"  So he moves the thing, and it moves itself into the ground.  At the end, the scorpion's head comes up and says, "Well, that didn't take long.  I guess I can just walk away now."  But, he doesn't.  Instead, he says, "Maybe you guys should give it a try.  If the scorpions aren't going to hurt me, maybe I'll be able to eat them."  And so he starts eating scorpions.  This is the movie: the scorpians aren't trying to eat him, they're just trying to live in the sand, in this little place.  There's nothing like that in the movie.  The best parts of this movie are when they're not fighting.  This is the point in the film where they have to use the "scorpion power" to get out of this desert.  It's pretty great.  And, of course, the most important thing about this movie is the ending.  We're supposed to be all like,  "Well what happened next?  Where did he go?  Did he come back to his house?  How does he live without his wife?  Do they have a kid?"  Well, they do.  They have a baby, and the baby is named "Jin."  He has a name, Jin.  (But, there's not a whole lot to tell about him in the book, so I'll just skip that.)  He is a scorpion.  You know, that's what he is.  That's what his name is.   Jin.  The movie is supposed to end with him eating his scorpion father, and his mom being like,  "Oh, Jin!  We have to go get our baby!"  And then we

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title of this movie is a bit misleading. There are a couple of "good guys" that are fighting against the bad guys. There is a small twist that changes the game entirely. There was no reason to think this would be a good action film. But what it was, was a great action film, a true gem of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Matrix" is a great movie and it is so well made and so beautifully photographed that it is really hard to believe that the movie is only 90 minutes long.  The story follows Neo, the guy who wakes up from a dream and the people around him.    They have all been programmed, some better than others, and all are trying to get to the end of the movie.  The story is set in a world where there is a war between humans and machines, and the machines are winning.  When Neo awakes, he finds that he is trapped in a maze and that his friend Morpheus has disappeared.  He tries to find his friend, but he can't.  Eventually Neo finds a computer and that gives him the knowledge he needs to escape.  This is the story of Neo.  It is a classic story about a guy who learns that the real world is just a computer simulation and that he can escape if he learns the secret language of the Matrix.

Â There is something about the cinematography that made me enjoy this movie even more than I did the first one.  I can't say that I'm a fan of the film's story, but it was a nice surprise to find out that this time it was actually an old person's story.    I like the way that the movie ends, it leaves you with a smile on your face.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the year 2113, a new alien life form is coming to earth to eat our planet and replace it. Only a team of NASA scientists can stop it.   The film does not try to make you feel bad for this bad guy. He is just a really bad dude.  But you get a really good sense of awe when he first appears. The film takes place over a period of months, with a little bit of time for each member of the team to develop a personality. They are all brilliant, but they are not all the same. They each have a specific purpose that makes them special. This movie is a good blend of action, science fiction, and even a bit of humor. It is also one of the best of the 1990s, at least in my eyes.

It is based on a novel called  The Manchurian Candidate  by  Robert Ludlum.  The book was very good but it was the movie that made this movie famous.  It features a good acting from  John Dehner and  Ray Winstone.  I loved this movie because it has the good acting and I loved the story of  James Bond and his meeting with  Dr. Evil.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was very well done. It wasn't really a science fiction movie at all. It had some space stuff in it but I thought that it was more an adventure movie. There are a lot of things in the movie that are unexplained. There was a guy who goes to a place called the Dark World. I don't know what that is but I would imagine it is like the real world but without the color and everything else. There were a lot more aliens in the real universe. There is one guy who is an astronaut. He goes into space to do an experiment. He can't find his way out. I thought this was a really cool idea. I think that there is a lot in this movie that I would like to see in the original Star Trek. I would also like to get the DVD if I could.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Wicker Man" is a true masterpiece of a movie that makes you feel as though you are watching a classic British horror film. The story is about a man, played by a very good performance by Johnny Depp, who is brought to a castle in the woods to meet a man who is supposed to be a sorcerer and has come to collect a magical egg. What ensues is a wonderful, and creepy story. If you want to see a truly creepy movie with great acting, a very scary story and a plot that is extremely original and imaginative you need to see this movie. If I am not mistaken, it is the first British horror movie to be filmed in the 1960's. This is a very well made, interesting movie that deserves to be seen by everyone. If a good horror movie is not enough for you, then I think you need a good cup of tea and a good book to get you through a long evening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is based on a real life incident.   It happened in a hotel in Rome and the hotel owner was a wealthy man, but a poor man's money.  He had his own plane, and when it was full, he took one of the passengers, who was a Jewish doctor, and flew to Switzerland.  The doctor was taken to a very wealthy family who gave him a room with a bath, a bed and a piano, but the doctor wanted to play.  It was the middle of the night when he had the idea to write a song about this.  In the night, he wrote and sang a song, "The Jew Is a Poor Man's Friend" and sang it to the room.  After he sang the song, he was awakened by his servant who told him that the patient wanted to leave the hotel.  Doctor was angry with the servant for waking him up. He asked him why he wanted to go. The servant answered that the man who was with the doctor was trying to steal his money. Doctor thought that the guy was a Jew and told him to leave.   The servant did so and the doctor began to write " The Jew is a Poor Men's Friend".  The servant asked the doctor what he was writing.  When he told him he was an artist, the servant was amazed that this doctor was a good artist.  But the doctor knew that the Jew was a poor men's friend, so he was able to write this song.  At the end of the song he asked the servant to tell him the secret of how he can be a good man.  Then the servant told him how he could be a poor people's friend.  Now that's a good song. The Jewish doctor who sang " The Jewish doctor sang "The Jewish Doctor sang "the Jew is poor man, a poor doctor, a Jew is his friend, a good friend of a poor friend, the Jew is the friend of the poor."   I love this movie, but I also love the story.  A Jew was sent to a wealthy family in Switzerland to be treated for a serious illness.    The doctor told the family that his illness was caused by his father's old wine bottle.  A good friend told the Jewish doctor that his father had given him this bottle.    This was the first time the doctor met the Jew, so the Jewish doctors thought he was a greedy rich man.   So
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie had some great ideas, but it was a bit long.   The plot was interesting but the pacing was a little too slow. The characters felt a bit flat. I don't know if I really understood the story. Maybe it's just a bit hard to get the plot.   and the music...I can't remember it at all.  .  - May 17, 2010I liked it  Reviewer: nancyjenn - favorite favorite favorite - January 16, 2010  Subject: I thought the story was intriguing and interesting. However, I also think the movie suffers from the same problem that is common to most of the films in the genre: the story is poorly written, and the acting and direction are also bad. There are also a number of plot holes and a lot of bad characters.   for example, in the movie, the police officer who tries to arrest the suspect is never identified, and there is no mention of his rank or what his job is. Also, a few other characters that aren't named, are also never mentioned, except for the ones that are mentioned. And the one cop that tries to stop the suspect by force is only referred to as a "pig", as opposed to a policeman.   (I know the movie is from the 1970s, but if I were a lawyer I would want to see the original charging documents, because there are some major holes in the prosecution's case. Also there is a lot that doesn't make sense.)   There are also two very minor characters that don't have much to do. One is a prostitute, and another is a "girl". Neither of them are even mentioned in the credits.  - January 16,, 2010I thought  Editor's note: This review originally appeared on A Star is Born.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting, funny, dark movie about a group of people who have a "psychological war" going on with a psychic (played by Meryl Streep) and her "psychic powers" (played beautifully by Streep and David Thewlis).   The movie is also funny, with an excellent cast and excellent performances by all the actors.   It's a bit more lighthearted than I'd expected, but it has some great moments too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a fun film to watch. It was about a young man that went to a beach. He was in love with a young girl and she said that she would like to go to his house. The young man went to his home and was told by his parents that his sister was not interested in him. The younger sister was going to go out with a man and she was going there in a few days. The man then decides to go and meet her and make a date. He goes to the beach and sees her. He is attracted to her and she tells him that she is in love and wants to marry him.  It was a simple movie but it was fun to watch and it was a nice start to the summer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a very good film. There's lots of action, plenty of funny lines, and an interesting plot with lots of twists and turns. The film is good, not great, but it's good. The plot is very interesting and is based on the real life events. It takes place in the early 1900s when there was a war with the Ottoman Empire over the region of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There was a major battle in which the Turks won and captured Sarajevo, a city that is now the capital of Bosnia. In this film, the character of Togrul (Alfredo Santoro) is a man who is captured by the Turks and taken to a Turkish prison. While there he meets a German nobleman (Dieter König) who wants to buy him so he can be returned to his family. There is a beautiful Turkish princess (Nancy Dorn) who is a slave to the Turks, so Togrig is forced to marry her. The Turks want him back so they can keep the town of Sarajef to themselves and make a big profit from the war. However, the local inhabitants of Sarafovo are also under threat from the Turks. It's up to Tograt to fight his way out of the prison and win the love of a beautiful girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A tale about a man who can't decide which side he's on and why he doesn't know why he even wants to live. An unexpected twist of fate brings two people together and causes them to discover that love and hate are not always so black and white. This is a beautifully shot film that deserves a long-term release on DVD."   Director: Richard Linklater   Writer: Richard Dreyfuss   Stars: Ethan Hawke, Ethan Hawkes, Julie Christie, Richard D'Onofrio   Plot: A man who lives in Los Angeles, Richard Link and his partner, Mike, have a dream job. They work as an 'art house' for films. Richard's dream is to make a film called "Sandy". The studio wants to do a musical version. So they have a couple of months to make the film. But before they can, they find out that a film is already being made. It's called "The Wedding Singer". They decide to take on the role of Sandy. But after a few weeks, Sandy is killed in the street. Mike and Richard find out who the killer is. But they also find out about the "Grim Reaper", who is trying to kill them.  Notes: Richard and Mike have a long relationship. It has a lot of funny moments. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to see a couple get it on. The film is a lot more serious than "Dazed and Confused". It is a very good comedy with a lot going on. There are some very funny moments in this film. It is also a very nice film. I think it's a great addition to the Linklater family. It makes the Linkleads more mature. "Sherry" is an amazing film.   Watch it:   I watched this film in high school when it was still "Dawn of the Dead" and I watched it again when it got a Blu-ray release. I had a blast watching it again. I thought it was great. This film is worth watching. I give it a 4.5/5.

I know a lot of people have commented on the "horror" in the movie, and I agree. But, I think the "mockumentary" is also an element in this movie, that makes it unique.  If you don't mind seeing a film about a "real" ghost, with a really great story line, I suggest this one. I will always remember it for a good laugh.

The guys are flying around in a fighter jet and they have to go to a place called a "hot spot" in order to destroy a bad guy that is using a super weapon. The bad guy is a bad ass. He has a giant weapon that is really powerful. I love how he uses that weapon. He is very skilled with it. The main characters are awesome, the movie has a great plot and it is very funny. The film was released in 1991 and is considered a classic. This movie is a must see movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with a man talking to a TV set, about the dangers of technology. He tells a story about a man who is having a heart attack and is trying to get to a hospital to have the heart stent implanted. The man who's wife died of a heart condition and who's son had his heart attack when he was a teenager. Now his heart is pumping blood so fast that it's hard for him to breathe. His wife is dead and he can't help the son, who is going to be a teenager this year. He's scared and tries to call the son's mom, but she doesn't pick up. He asks the woman who is the caretaker of the house, if she knows anything about the son. She's a nurse and she tells him that the son is being home-schooled, that he hasn't had much to eat or drink and that he's going to need surgery.   It's hard to say much more about the plot, because there isn't much to say about it. It's an easy film to enjoy, it's a good story to tell and the acting is excellent. The movie was made for children and teenagers, so the movie has a very simple plot. But it's good to watch a movie that's not overly complicated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great example of a "biblical" tale, a story about a man and his wife who, when a great drought strikes their country, find themselves on a farm in the middle of nowhere. They are, for the most part, pretty happy. The husband and wife are not so lucky, however. They come across a strange, bearded, bearded man. He tells them a great deal about the future. The wife's face goes from "meh" to "ugh" and then back again. The man then goes on to tell them that there is a great prophecy, which will be fulfilled in a matter of days. They do not believe him, however, so he offers them some money to come back and see the future with him. He offers a thousand dollars for the wife's freedom, but she will be sold into slavery. He then offers a hundred dollars for their freedom, though she is still in chains. He gives them two choices. One is to accept his offer. The other is to run away. They both run away, and are never seen again. This movie is really good. I enjoyed it a lot, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story about faith and God.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens in the middle of the night.  The police officer (played by the terrific William S. Hart) and his partner (Robert Duvall) have been chasing a man who they say is trying to steal a truck full of diamonds.  They stop him and are about to arrest him when a small truck starts to drive out of the desert and the driver gets out.  It is the movie's opening scene.  After a few shots of the man walking around the desert, we cut to the man's girlfriend who is asleep in bed.  Suddenly, she is startled by the truck's sudden appearance and goes out of bed to investigate.  When she gets there, she sees a small man, about five feet tall, wearing a long white robe and a white beard.  As the girl approaches the man, he jumps up from the floor and begins to walk around the bed.  This is not your everyday man.  He is dressed in a white robe with a small hood, has white hair, a big red nose and a big black hat.  But what makes him so unusual is that he has no feet.  I'm talking about feet.   He walks, he runs, he slides and jumps and jumps.  What's more, he is completely unencumbered.  In fact, he walks and runs in the same way a human would walk and run.  This makes him a wonder to watch.  A man who has no legs is not a normal man.    He picks up the girl and they get into the truck and drive away.  Of course, the policeman is suspicious and follows the truck.  We follow the truck in the darkness, and we learn that this strange man is a famous film director who is directing a movie called "The Phantom."  He has already made the movie because the original script has been lost.  And he has to get the film ready for a premiere.  With the help of his wife, the director tries to convince the police that they have a good case.  Well, there is one problem.  There is no one in the film to see the movie.  We get a nice shot of the trailer for the film:  The trailer for "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is pretty good.   When we finally get to the movie, we learn a little more about this strange movie director and the people he is trying too make a

I think it's a good idea to be able to put a little spin on things, but it seems the director was trying to make a serious film and couldn't. I'm a bit disappointed because it was just too serious and not funny at all.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third film in a trilogy. The first two films were made as the first half of a trilogy: The Man in the High Castle (1962), which I think was the best of the two films; and The Day of the Locust (1973), which was a sequel to the first film and a little less good than the second film. This is the only film that I really like, and the other two I don't really like. I think they both take the same ideas, and they both try to do a very good job of telling a good story. The one good thing about The Day is that it has a good cast, and it's a very well-acted film. I've heard a lot of good things about this film, so if you like sci-fi or if you are a sucker for good acting, I think you should give it a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing really wrong with the movie, although it's not perfect.

The film is funny and it will have you laughing for the entire time. If you like funny movies, then you will enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't see the movie, but my sister and I have seen the trailer a couple of times.   This is a good, very entertaining movie that shows how the Japanese have changed and how they can change back.  The story is about a young Japanese woman who goes to the United States to live with her uncle.  She has a strange, dark secret.  After returning home, she has a chance encounter with a young black man.  It turns out that this man is her long lost uncle. This brings up the questions:  Why was he so young when he left the U.S.  What did he do that made him look so old?  Why did he come to the U, S. and why did he stay there?  Who is this man and how did he get her into such a bad situation?   The only thing that was kind of annoying is the fact that this movie is about the United states.  I think that the Japanese will be surprised at the changes they have made and the ways that they can keep it going.

The main character is not that bad of a person, but I really don't understand the need to get him killed off in the first act. It really is unnecessary, but you would think that he would be able to make up his mind before the end of the first movie, because of his previous experience, and then he would probably be more prepared. I guess we'll never know.  I don't know if I would recommend this film to people who are new to the genre, because it really is a bit thin.  The second part of the film is not really worth watching.  I really think that the second part should have been cut out and never re-cut, or at least be cut out after the first half. It would have made the film a lot more interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think it's possible to make a bad movie.  It is so badly acted that I almost thought I was watching a badly acted Shakespearean play.  A group of friends go to a party at a man's house, where they meet the man's son.  He's about 6 and looks just like an average 6 year old.  They're all very friendly with him.  This is when things go wrong.  First, the son is not just friendly.  His eyes say that he's looking at the future.  Then the son talks to the girl he's with.  That girl has to leave the party at some point because her mother is sick and she's not getting much rest.  The daughter and the son go back to the party.  While there they find that the man is in terrible pain.  When they go back inside, they see that the house is full of his son's friends.  At the end, he dies.  I'm not sure what happened.  One of the friends seems to have gone off to the bathroom.  As they leave, the man says that the others must have seen the son get hit by the car.  What a waste.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw the trailer for this movie, I had to check it out.  I love movies that take a look at the lives of two men who have no interest in anything other than the pursuit of a woman.  So, I was pretty excited to see that I would get to see this movie.  I'm not a big fan of horror films, so it was a bit of a surprise.    I loved the story, and the cast did a great job in bringing the characters to life.  And as for the ending.  "I'll be back"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought I was getting into a good romantic comedy, until the movie got a bit too preachy, especially towards the end. The story was good enough and I had a lot of fun with it, but I'm not sure it was quite what I was hoping for.  The final scene was the worst.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - Great plot with some action scenes   This is the first film in a series of "doom-laden" films by the famous French director Georges Franju. I have been wanting to see this film since I saw it as a child.   I think the plot is pretty cool: The evil Dr. Voodoo (M. Chareau) kidnaps a child and wants to raise it as his own. When the child's family discovers that the child has been taken and Dr. Chabouu has the child in a laboratory, they try to stop the evil doctor. I must admit I found the characters to be rather dull. They have to go from town to town searching for a magic potion that will let them stop the Voodoo. One of the villagers (Claude Travail) is so stupid he thinks the potion can be found in a large tree that grows out of the ground. I don't know about the movie as a whole, but there was not a lot of action. I guess it was the way the movie was shot. I didn't care for the music. I know the French sound and there are many French people in this movie, but I did not feel a connection with them. It could have been better.   to finish this review: It is a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Best of the Best"   Director: John Sturges - A film about a war, but not about any of the war. It's a war about a movie - the war between the Hollywood studios, who want to make the most expensive films possible, and the movie industry who want movies to be about the people who are living and breathing in real time. It is about the studio executives who run their studio, the directors who are trying to make a film, and what it means to be an actor who can't take a break and who doesn't have a good enough agent, and who has to try to balance the needs of both groups. It doesn't take long for the story to be set in motion by the studio bosses who are going to decide which films are worth making and which aren't. And it is the director who is trying to balance both sides of this story, to get it to a point where he can let the film make its own decisions. The first scene of the film is set in the summer of 1941. The film is called "War Stories", and it tells the story of the movie studio, where the biggest stars of the day, such as Clark Gable, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Bronson, were paid as if they were making a real movie. But the real movies weren't about these actors; the movie studios wanted to make more money and bigger films, and they had to make films that could be shown in movie theaters around the world. So these studios made films that were nothing like a real war movie. They were a comedy, and a melodrama. The actors were paid to play characters, and were not involved in the actual war; and the studios were happy to sell these films around the country. But as soon as the Germans began to invade the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the studios got very worried. They knew that the Russians would be able to quickly defeat the Soviet army, and that the Soviet armies could then easily defeat the German armies. But this didn't mean that the war was over. It meant that the movie business would have to get back to making real war movies. It would have been hard to do that, of course, as there was still a great deal of uncertainty in the United States about what the future would be. It was very difficult for the studios to decide what would be in their best interest to make. One of the main decisions the studio made was which actors to
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is the best film about the Vietnam War, and it's an impressive movie in its own right.  It's an authentic story about the war, and the people who went to war, from the military and civilians alike.  The music is excellent, and if I'm being honest it's the best movie soundtrack I've heard in a long time.  I like the way the film is told; it's a bit slow at times, but there's a lot of action and some good scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent example of a classic sci-fi film, a sort of science fiction romance with a strong focus on friendship, that combines the classic sci fi themes of the time with the romantic genre, it is very much an example of the best of the science fiction genre.  The screenplay is good and the story is very well done, the pacing is excellent and there is a lot of suspense.  The cast is excellent, there is no lack of quality actors, there are some excellent performances here, and the music is very good.  The special effects are good, especially in the scenes where the ship is traveling through space. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a bit cheesy. The whole movie is like a cartoon. It has a good theme and a very cool plot. There is a good and good guy. It's the bad guys that keep me watching.   I like how the movie is set in the future. It would have been more original to put the movie in the past.     The movie was entertaining and I was able to look forward to the end.   the movie does not have a plot, but it is a great movie to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only way to sum up the movie is to say that the movie starts with a shot of a boy playing in the streets of a city. Then a man walks up and starts to scream "Get off the streets, you little rascal! You're an embarrassment to our city." He then walks away and the film follows a couple of men in a car. The car drives into a building and starts falling. The two men get out and start to chase the car. Suddenly a woman appears in the car and starts driving away. The men chase her and she gets out of the car, runs up to the men, starts to run, and then stops. Then the man that was chasing the car stops running. The woman walks up to them and starts crying. They get up and go after her. The man gets out and walks off. The film then follows a man and a woman in a small town and the woman goes back into the house and gets ready to make dinner. The door opens and the man walks in. The guy in the chair says, "I'm sorry, ma'am, but I have to leave. I have an appointment with a man about some kind of business." The woman then says "It doesn't matter if he's a good man, you'll still leave. Why?" The man then says, in a very high pitch voice, "Because you're not a real man." The film cuts to a man that is a police officer. He says to a guy on the street, "Where do you think you're going, kid? You think you can get away with this? Well, it'll be fun to catch you, kid, but you'll never get away." The movie then cuts to the scene where a couple goes to a restaurant. The waiter asks for their name and they tell him. The waitress looks at them and says, with a little smile, "This is the only name I can remember for them." The waiter then turns to the couple and says "If you don't have a change of clothes in the bathroom, come back in ten minutes." The man tells the waiter, "You don't understand, this is my girlfriend. She's not here." The waitress then says to the man, "Sorry, we don't take names." The couple then walks off in a different direction. The next day a newspaper reporter calls the woman to talk to her. She tells the reporter she was in an accident. He
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always had a soft spot for the "crocodile in the headlights" movies. I remember the first time I saw "Crocodiles in the Mist" I had to stop the film because I thought I was watching a movie. I don't know if it was the strange music that made it impossible to look away, or the way the crocodile's face seemed to stare right into the viewer's eyes, or a combination of both, but the first 30 minutes of the film made me completely feel as if I were in the presence of a great, evil, and truly disgusting creature. That is, until the end of the movie. That's when the crocodiles start to look like, well, crocodiles.  I remember that movie, too!    The first thing I thought about when I saw the trailer for the film was:   Is this guy really trying to do a sequel to the great film "Jaws"?   What happened to "Jaw" after all of those movies?   I've heard a lot about the film and I've read a lot of reviews of it, but I'm not sure if I even want to watch it.   It is a strange film that has an odd feel about it, one that I feel is mostly due to its subject matter.  This is not a "jaw" film; it's not a monster movie; it doesn't even attempt to be a shark film.  It's not even a monster film; its main concern seems to be the idea of "carcass" itself, and whether or not it is a good thing.  If it is good, then why is it bad?  Why does it seem to take on a life of its own?  There are a few moments where I found myself genuinely annoyed by the film. There are several scenes where the camera angles change and the audience is left to wonder why the hell we are watching a shark movie.  There were also some things in the film that made me feel that I should be the one to write a negative review about it. This is a film that doesn't give a rat's ass about being scary; it gives a rat a shit about being a crocodile.  I can't say I really liked the film's "jaws" feel; it just seems like it was thrown together with the intent of being a shark flick, without the care of creating a cohesive
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Lie is a fun, silly movie that takes place in the near future in an old New York City, in which a woman has an affair with a young man and gets pregnant by him. After that the father leaves her and her child is adopted by an older couple, which is a nice change from the traditional Jewish mother and father. The movie is really funny and has a lot of fun with the characters and the plot, the ending is also quite funny. I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good time, but not too much fun at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced.  And I'm glad I finally got to see it.    The movie is based on the book  My Brilliant Career  by David Mamet, who plays the character of a successful but somewhat arrogant writer, who finds himself unexpectedly divorced from his wife.  While this movie is not as good as his earlier films, it's still a good story.  I also really liked the film's music and especially the song, "The Ballad of a Broken Heart" by John Phillips, which really captures the spirit of the book.  This is not the most dramatic movie I've ever seen, but I found it interesting and funny.

He was the only person that could have done anything with Smith, but he chose to stay out of the way.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ I had never heard of this film until about a month ago. I watched it with my mom because it was the only movie I had on DVD. It was a very good movie. I don't think it is quite as good as the TV show but the story is still interesting and it does have the good parts of a movie, like the car chase. The car chase is what made this movie great for me, it is a good way to end a movie and it also has the great music in the background. I have never seen this movie before and I really liked it. It is not the best movie I have ever seen but it is definitely not bad either. It does have a very interesting story and it is also very good in it's acting. I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone. I also would like to mention that I was not a huge fan of the original show and I was very surprised at how well it worked with a new cast and the new story. If you are looking for a good mystery movie I would say that this is a very well done movie. If I could recommend this movie to anyone I would definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title of this movie may seem like it is a remake of a movie called "Jungle Fever", but it's not. It's a movie that does the same things, but it has more action and more laughs. It does have a few similarities to "Journey to the Center of the Earth" but it doesn't really have the same feel to it. This is a movie about the jungle and the people in it. There are many movies about this jungle, but this is the only one that I've seen. This movie is not like other movies about the jungles. There is a sense of mystery to the movie. There's a lot of characters and a lot that happen to them. I'd say it is worth watching, especially for kids who like the jungle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts out with a close up of a dog playing with a ball on the sidewalk in front of a house. This dog, who is played by the adorable and very funny Kevin Pollak, is a real goofball. He's so goofy, that I can't believe it's actually possible to do a good job in this film. The dog just sits there, in the middle of the street, and does a series of funny movements, and then looks at us with a look that is just so funny. I mean, we don't get to see much of the dog's body (which is covered with a blanket and a little bit of plastic) but what we do see is so funny that you'll never look at a dog the same way again. The film then moves to a different part of the same street. The people that are standing there are a little less well-behaved. They are drinking and smoking and they have a lot of fun doing it, but they're also a little too interested in the dog, and that makes the dog look even funnier. The street is filled with more dogs, and the dog plays with them and the other dogs and we get a lot more fun with the film. By the time we get to the house, it is just as good as the first one. There is a lot that I like about this film, but I also can't help but notice the slight lack of direction that is present. It feels like the camera was simply following the dog. But then, this is what the film is about. It's about dogs. It has no idea what it's doing. But it's the kind of film that's easy to watch because it's so darn funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you look back on it, it is hard to imagine a more effective and entertaining movie. I never thought I would be a big fan of the genre, but the more I saw it the more impressed I became with it. This is a classic sci-fi action thriller with the most interesting characters and a well-rounded story. The writing is strong and it's always easy to remember the names of the characters. It's a little slow at the start but then the action really picks up. If you like sci-fis, you will enjoy this movie. The music is also a bit out of place, but then again, it's a classic movie and you can't expect anything more.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ The first movie of the first season of the HBO show True Detective is one of those great examples of storytelling. The movie is set in the small, mostly fictional town of Vinci, where a strange case is solved, and the local cops are left to handle the aftermath. They are very good at this, and have a sense of humour. They're good, and if you like the Sopranos, you'll probably like this. You can skip the first movie entirely if you don't like the first two, but I like the second and third and have yet to see the fourth. It's a good idea to watch True Detective if you haven't seen the Soprano's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The title of this film is a reference to the 'The Matrix', and it is the first of several 'Matrix' films to come out of Hollywood. It is also a very good movie, and I enjoyed it greatly. The story is a fairly conventional 'how to escape from a cell' story with a twist, as one of the characters finds that the 'Matrix', which is a simulation, does not seem so real after all. There are some excellent special effects, as the 'cuffs' are shown in various positions. The action is quite good and has a 'Matrix'-like quality to it. I found myself wanting to watch the movie again and again, and that was a good thing. The soundtrack was very good, and while I did not like the lyrics at all, I liked the music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can see why it took so long to get this movie made. The film starts with a great, action-packed chase scene. The car chase is very well done, it was filmed with an amazing amount of detail. I was actually quite impressed with how well the filmmakers were able to recreate the look of the car. They also had the car do a lot of flips and somersaults.   Then we are introduced to the main characters. These guys are the most badass dudes in the world. I mean they are really, really, ridiculously good looking. I'm not sure if that's because they are from another planet or just that they are very good looking, but it doesn't really matter. The movie really doesn't get off to a great start. We first see a bunch of aliens. They are about the same size as a human being and they are also really good looking because their faces are just huge. Then they start fighting and they start shooting at each other. I have never seen a more boring movie in my life. The aliens just stand there and shoot at eachother and then run around trying to get the other aliens to fight. And then they are all like "Oh my god! I can't believe this is happening!" The fight scene was the least interesting thing about the movie. It was the only thing that was completely pointless and boring. The rest of the movie was about a buncha aliens fighting eachother. They did that pretty much all the time. Then we get to the aliens who are trying to find their way home. They get to a planet and start fighting. That is all there is to it. The ending to the movie is also very boring. There is one final fight scene between the aliens and some other aliens who don't have any special powers, it is all over in about ten minutes. There was no real sense of accomplishment in the ending and it really made me wonder how they could have possibly made it as long as they did. There really isn't anything to get excited about in this movie. There are a few nice fight scenes and a few cool shots of space, but there isn't much else.  ,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original "Bobby's World" was the best thing I ever saw in a movie theater. I can't say I'm too surprised that a new remake of this classic is being made. I'm hoping that it's better. I didn't know what to expect when I saw the trailer for this movie. I saw it at the movies and I was hoping for something similar. I was wrong. The new "Borat" is definitely different than the old movie. This movie doesn't follow the same pattern. It's a much more serious, darker movie. There is a lot more cursing and a lot less jokes. The acting is great in this film and it's not as slapsticky as I expected it to be. This is definitely a good looking film. The costumes are great. It looks like a movie that was filmed at the end of the 70's. I guess I'm not a huge fan of satire but this film is pretty good. It was definitely worth the $4.00 I paid to see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a fairly straightforward thriller. It starts with a man named William Smith (Jeff Bridges) in his hometown of Green Bay, WI. He works at a local car dealership. He and his wife, Helen (Teri Garr) have a young son named David (James Caan). David is the son of a wealthy and well-respected auto dealer named David Smith. Smith is the one who introduced David to the world of cars and how to drive them. In this film, we get to see a little bit more of David's father, but mostly it is just a flashback to David's early childhood. Smith and his family go to a ball game, but David, along with his sister (Maggie Grace) and a couple of other kids from his school, find out that they are at the wrong game. Smith has to stop the game and get everyone home safely. The film ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, but I didn't mind it. The movie is well acted and written, and the story is well paced. The characters are likable and there is a nice mystery and a nice ending to the film.

However, the story is told very well, and the storyteller is a good one. The action is well done and well choreographed, but it is not in any way entertaining. The film is based on a true story and the characters are not real people. The movie does not have any special effects or anything like that, but then this is not the type of film where special effects are needed. The music is also not very good and is nothing special either. The actors, all the lead actors are great, but they all look different from one another, which makes them hard to look at and hard to understand. The special effects, while they are not bad, are not good either. They look cheap and the special effects used are nothing new. There is no plot development at all, nor is there a lot of drama. The characters are like cardboard cut-outs and the plot is too simple to be enjoyable. The ending is a disappointment too, as it was so predictable that it made me feel as if I had seen the movie before. ******************** The Rating: ***
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when I was 12 years old. I remember the movie being an action-packed film with a good soundtrack and great special effects. This movie is still very enjoyable, especially if you have a lot of time on your hands.   This movie had a few bad endings, but those endings only come after you have seen the movie a few times and really start to like the story.  The movie is really well made.  There were a few things that could have been done better, but the movie itself is a pretty good one.  1. The music is good and the special effects are amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film about a man that was taken from his home at age 18. When he was only 14, he was adopted by a wealthy couple in Texas. This is the beginning of a family man and a very happy man that he is. He was raised with all the best things in life: family, friends, good food, a good time, and even better love. He never had a chance to express his feelings because he had never met the right girl to do so. His adopted parents, however, love him and they are there for him. They love him even though he doesn't understand them. His father, who was a very abusive man, is no longer around. His mother is a very loving woman who also loves him. The movie does not go on for long because the man is really sad and not really happy with his life. The film does not take away from the life of the man and is good for watching. The ending is not what one would expect from a film about the love of a man. But this is the life that a young man can lead.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film has a lot of heart.   In addition to the obvious plot points that you'd expect from a movie based on a book about a young boy, the film's themes are very much applicable to our world: we all have dreams, and in order to achieve them we must be willing to be a little bit different.  While the movie isn't a good one, it's still a good experience and I'm glad I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a few funny moments, but is pretty serious in most scenes. It has a good score, but I didn't feel that it needed to be made in the 80's.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a young man that gets killed during a fight and then resurrected and is forced to kill again to survive.  It is a bit of a cheesy and over the top zombie movie but it is entertaining at times and does have some decent action scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not the biggest fan of the "tough guy" genre, but in this movie I really enjoyed. It was very good! A nice blend of comedy, action and drama, it didn't have the same high production value as some of the other "tougher" movies, but I still enjoyed it. It is one of those movies where the jokes don't land on you, but it still gets a laugh out of me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so very, very good.   It was not so much about the main characters, but about the entire cast of the movie.  They were all believable and were all likable.  The story was very well done, and it had a lot of humor in it.  It is very sad to see that the world has gone so wrong and that it is just like the world of the 1950s.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies and/or knows the story of the great film "The Great Escape" by Steven Spielberg.

I am not a fan of the "I want to live like my dad" movie, but I like this one better. The film is really good. You will enjoy it and I hope that you enjoy it too. If you liked the first film, you will like this too. It has been a long time since I have seen a good film and this one is worth seeing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie.  There were some interesting ideas, but nothing that really stood out to me.    I'm sure that this movie is going to have a long shelf life, because the ideas were interesting, and it's not like a bunch of random people are being hunted by a giant, evil alien who eats babies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The plot is not that important, I don't think.     The movie itself is interesting, though I don´t remember what it was about exactly. It´s about a bunch of people who are stuck on an island. It is in the ocean. The story seems to be about a couple of characters who are separated from each other and then get sent to a place where they meet the rest of the cast. The movie is not a bad one but it is not very good either. I did like the music and I guess the movie did good at the same time.  The acting was pretty good.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love horror movies, you will love this movie!   It is scary, funny and creepy at the same time!  The movie is a remake of the classic ghost movie: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The plot is similar to the original except that there is an evil doctor, who is trying to get revenge on his victims by making them become ghosts. The movie is very violent, which is a little bit unusual in this genre, but it is great to watch.   I think that the remake is more terrifying than the original, because the ghost is much more frightening.  What more can I say about the movie, other than that it is a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great. It's a good blend of action, drama, and romance. It is one of the better action movies, it's fast paced and has great fight scenes. The movie has some funny scenes too, I especially liked the one where they take down the police helicopter, they use a couple of real helicopters too. It has a few moments where it gets too much for me. I don't like how the movie ends. I found it boring.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place in the 1960s and focuses on the relationship between a gay man (played by a very talented and sexy Richard E. Grant) and his girlfriend (played with great subtlety by Janet Leigh). I don't know if this was a straight love story or a gay love story (as they are often confused), but it's a beautiful, tender, and funny movie.   I've seen this movie more than a hundred times, and I think it is the only movie I have seen in which Janet Leigh is a top-notch actress.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen an American movie quite like this one. It's a little silly and a little crude, but it is a great love story.   It is about two guys who get involved in a drug deal and they fall in love. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It's a classic story of love, loss, and betrayal, but it is never overly sentimental. It is a well-made film that stays true to its roots and leaves an interesting impression of a time and place.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not a big fan of this movie, but I was glad I watched it. I liked the plot and how it made a movie that wasn't really about the war and it was a fun little movie. I loved that it showed the lives of both sides, the Germans and the French. I think that's what's so good about it. They were both interesting people who were both trying to fight against each other. There were a few parts that I thought were a bit ridiculous, but nothing that I could really take offence to. It's a fun movie and it's good to see the movies from the war.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a scene in this movie that I would like to describe as follows:    The "evil" and "corrupt" "businessman" (who is really just a self-righteous, bigoted jerk who is trying to save face) has a group of employees (most of whom are women and he has a "sex slave" of his own) who work in a store which he owns.   They are having a picnic when they notice a very large amount of money coming out of a door.  They all run to the door and see that a large sum of money has been dropped into a basket in the middle of the room.  At the time they all thought that it was a prank, but the next day the basket was gone and only a couple of dollars were left.  This scene is a little reminiscent of the scene in the original movie when they find a "money bag" with a very similar design to the one in the film, but this time it is a big pile of money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As you can see, I'm pretty much a film nerd, and a big fan of John Carpenter and his films. While the film is not exactly the best one I've seen from Carpenter, I'd still say it's a very good movie. The special effects are really good, the acting is good, and the story is good. There are some really cool scenes and it all has a sense of humour to it. It's really nice to see a John Carpenter film and one that is pretty much the same in terms of its themes and tone. The plot is pretty basic, but the way it's set up is interesting. I like the way that it's all set up, and then it jumps around and has a lot of different scenes. The story is pretty good, but I can't say I actually really enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it as a good film and not as a great one. It was good, just not a very strong film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the original movie, but I have seen it many times on the History Channel and have loved it. It is a really good drama with a lot of suspense. The cast is excellent and I can't imagine how much time and effort went into making this. This movie is not only a great film, it is an incredible work of art. The only thing I don't like is that the ending is not as good as I would have liked.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic. The whole story is well written and I liked it.  I had never heard of the name "Eugene J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really surprised by how good this movie is. The only real flaw I could find is the fact that the plot doesn't actually make sense. The movie is set in a city where there is a big fight every night about who should rule the city, so people don't actually like each other very much, which is why the fight is so intense. So the first time we see a fight, it's the king of the city versus the king from another city, which I suppose makes sense. Then we meet the "mafioso" who is really a nice guy, who is a bit on the low side in my opinion, but a nice man nonetheless. Then the movie takes a turn, and we find out that he's actually the king's son, who was kidnapped from his home city of Tarragona. The story is really good, it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not silly either. The character development is really well done, there are a lot of good performances from the cast, and it's nice to see that they didn't just cast someone from the old school of acting, like so many movies do these days. It's also good to see some old school film noir elements as well, like a good guy being betrayed by a woman, or a woman who tries to get revenge for the death of her son. So all in all, it is a good little film, and there's some nice action too. There's a lot more to see in the film, it just hasn't been fully explored yet, but I'd say that it's definitely worth the price of admission.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great.  You'll love it.    It's a really good movie, but there are a couple of things that I'd like to change.  First, I'd change the name of the school.  This movie is set in the 1960's.  I'm sorry but there was a lot of 1970's music in this movie.  We had songs about how wonderful the hippies were in the 60's. The hippies are now the hippie's. Second, I would have liked to see some action scenes.  They didn't get any action in this film.  The movie doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't have a story.  What was the movie about?   I was hoping to see a hippie fight a cop.  Who would be surprised to see the hippy beat up a cop?  I would watch this movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had to wait for over two hours to get to the movie theater where I went for the second time.  This time the theater was full of people.      This movie is good.  The movie is about a group of students who are trapped inside a classroom.  In the middle of the day, one of the students begins to have dreams about a giant monster.  After a short time, the monster is seen again.  This time the monster has come to Earth to destroy it.  The monster is defeated by the students who take the monsters body home.  These students live in a small town, but there are some who want to kill them for what they have done.  There are many characters in the movie.  Some of the people are likeable and others not so much.  I think this movie is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty good, there's no way to make this movie better.

The movie is basically just a bunch of random people getting murdered.  I was kind of disappointed that there was no music.  It's a bit hard to listen to the music. But at the end of the movie, the music came back.  But there's not a lot of good things to say about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** In a world where the human race is nearly extinct, a group of survivors decide to make their own island and live off the land. The problem is that the world is full of monsters. What do you do when you're faced with a monster in the flesh? You kill it! You go after the monster in order to get a piece of it's flesh so you can live off it. As you go, you learn that there are different kinds of monsters: the giant monsters, the big-eared monsters, and the giant insects. Some monsters you will not be able to defeat, and some you may kill with your bare hands. And then there is the one-eyed monster. You can only fight him when you have a little girl with you. That is, you must have a young girl with a pretty little body. You go on a quest to find her. On the way you meet many other monsters, all with their own story. This movie was not a good one for me. I did not like it at all. ***********************
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little movie, but a good one. I enjoyed this a lot more than the last one (that was the good kind of a movie, not the kind of movie that's so bad you'll want to see it again and again).  The plot is really good, and it takes place over a single day in a village in the Alps, where a beautiful woman (with a very strange name) goes out to find a lost friend.  It's not as good as the first one (which is not as interesting a story, although there is a lot of it), but it is not bad.  This movie is very similar to the first, but it's not quite as good.  The story is a little more interesting, but the characters are very stupid.   I'm not sure I would like this movie, or the first.  I like the first better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is one of those movies that is great and so many people hate it.  There is one scene where Jeff Bridges is driving in the desert, and he has a very bad feeling about something that has happened. Â He pulls over to the side of the road and gets out of his car.    The screen goes black for a moment, then a giant rock falls from the sky.  When the rock hits the road, it rips a hole through the top of the car.     He goes to investigate, but it is already too late.  The giant rock has fallen on top of him.  Jeff Bridges survives the fall.  This is the first of many "fatalities" Jeff Bridges gets throughout the movie.  He dies a couple of times and is also eaten by the leprechaun.  There is a scene at the end where Jeff is walking through a forest and sees a giant leprecha who looks exactly like the character he had played in the previous movie, the original The Big Lebowksi.   So that was one of the few times I ever saw Jeff Bridges in a movie that I did not hate it, but I didn't love it either.  In a way, this is a better movie than the original because it doesn't have the same over the top, campy, absurd humor.  That is something that you can't really say about the original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really like this movie, and if you are in the mood for a little comedy, then this is a good choice.  A lot of people are offended by the movie because it is a little too serious, but I thought it was funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice little sci-fi movie about a group of young scientists on a space station who are getting ready to go out into the universe for the first time. Unfortunately, the only way they can get back is to take a shuttlecraft out into deep space to a planet where the atmosphere is so thick it freezes solid at the temperature of absolute zero.    It's not as if they can't find a way to get back, but the technology they have at their disposal is pretty primitive.  This is an interesting premise, but I don't think it's well executed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Man Who Knew Infinity" is a fun little comedy about a guy who can make anything disappear. He is a very smart, but very silly, man. It is a great movie for all ages.   I like to watch a comedy about nothing. I don't like watching a comedy where the plot is not interesting, but the acting is.     You can not tell from this movie who the main characters are. We have a guy named "The Man" who is not very smart. He can make things disappear, but he doesn't understand how they get in there in the first place.  , but then the movie does not waste its time on the plot. It wastes its time talking about things that aren't really important, like The Man's favorite color is blue and how he thinks the color blue is very similar to the color infinity.   a movie that has a lot of funny scenes. The one that I found the most amusing was when The Man is trying to make a cat disappear. The cat just stood there. "You have to do it my way!" The Man yells. The Cat's head was moving around, but still he wouldn't move. The Man decides that he will get the cat to move by throwing a piece of cardboard at it. The head was moved, but not by The Man. The Head fell off and landed on the floor. The cats head was not moved at all. So, The Man took the head and threw it down a hole. The movie had to end and then we are treated to the ending of a song: "If You Can't Fly, Then Fly Away".   This movie is funny and the acting was very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A story about a poor kid who wants to become a fighter but only has a handful of moves and no talent for the ring. When his father dies, his uncle moves in to take over the family business. The uncle's cousin is a wrestler named Jimmy Snuka who is in trouble because of his behavior. He's got a long, hard road ahead of him and he knows it.   This is an excellent movie. It is a good action movie, but not in the way you'd think. The characters are real. It's not some cheap gimmick to draw you in. It was an authentic movie, not a cheap one, not some cheesy movie. You feel like a good man and a good fighter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a lot of fun, and it has a lot to say.  It has a really unique feel about it.  The characters, both the main and supporting cast, have a lot in common.  One is a "mascot", the other is a human, and they are both fighting to be "macho".  Both are trying to be more than they really are, to have some sort of "mood".  They both have a tendency to go off on their own, in their own world, and both are just as happy as the next to be a "hero".  The story is a simple one.  Two brothers are forced to fight each other for a very long time, and when they finally do, it ends with one brother having his hand broken.  He is left a cripple, but still able to do things.  There is a new cast of characters who join the battle.  These are characters who, although not very strong, are able to hurt the main characters.  But, at the end of the movie, it is the main character who finally loses.  His brother has won, and has gone home to his mother.  I thought it was a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little skeptical about this movie at first, because I was expecting something with a similar vibe to The Big Lebowski. I am so glad I got a chance to see it. This is a great comedy with an even better ending. I don't know if you'll like this movie or not, but I sure did! I have to admit, I was kind of scared the whole time. I have no idea what to expect, but it was great. I would give it a 9/10 if not for the fact that there's a scene in the middle that I can't get out of my head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this film to be a real "toughie", that is, it is both tough and funny, with the usual elements of good writing and acting. There are no real surprises, although we have an interesting and unexpected story line, but it's really not that interesting.   The film was shot in one day, but the production values are not very high, with a lot of very bad CGI.  I didn't like the story, but I also didn't care for the character of the "lovable" policeman (I never knew he was "lovin' it").   If you don't like police movies, you will probably like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a fan of these movies so much I'm actually making an entire list of them!  So here we go.  First up we have the 1978 sequel to the 1974 film.    This is a great movie, I like the fact that there is more of a villain in this movie than in the original, as well as the more dramatic change in the character of the lead, the main one being the great Stan Lee.      Second up is the 1985 film, which I also loved and was made on a very low budget (although not that low).     This movie was made in a style very similar to the original movie, the music was pretty good as well, although I wouldn't say it was as good as the original.  A good movie about a bad guy:   Here is a good example of how to make a bad movie about an evil person.  The villain in the movie is the master thief who steals and kills many people.  He is really a despicable character, he murders a young boy (which is a nice touch) and then he is arrested.  Then his girlfriend gets pregnant and is killed by a hit man hired to kill the thief.  When he's released on bail, he is sent to an insane asylum and is soon followed by the police.  Unfortunately, this movie really goes downhill.  There is a lot of bad acting and some scenes are pretty hard to watch.  However, there is also some good stuff here, such as the opening where a kid goes to see the thief, who has gone insane and murdered his girlfriend.  I thought the opening was pretty cool.  Another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to watch it to know what's going on.  For example, when the police come and arrest the thief (because he's insane) we get to hear a lot more about him, including what he's been up to, his family, his crimes, etc.  It really adds to the movie.  Third up is a film that was released the same year as the first, which was the same director, John Landis.  This movie had a lot going on, it was shot in Chicago and New York, and it had a big budget and stars like Richard Dreyfuss and Marlon Brando.  Also, this film was made to be an R-rated movie, and the only adult in the cast
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had never heard of the film before but when I heard it was about the Battle of the Bulge and it had an English-language trailer I was immediately intrigued. This is a great film and the fact that it is a documentary does not make it any less interesting. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. If you have never heard the Battle for the Bulger, then you owe it to yourself to watch this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this movie back in the 80s, I was not impressed.  The story was not good at all.    I am not going to go too much into the plot as there are other movies that will get the job done more effectively.  What I will say about this movie is that the music is pretty good.  The music is not exactly new but it is still very well done.  I especially like the opening scene.  You really don't see a lot of these films that have opening scenes like this in the big budget movies.  This movie is actually a good one.  If you are a fan of 80s action movies, then this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Babe" is a good old-fashioned, classic, good-looking romantic comedy about a middle-aged woman named "Babe".  Babe is an old woman who has lived through a lot, but is still living with her husband and their three children.  Her husband is an alcoholic, and is constantly in and out of jail.   They have a good relationship, and she does not want to leave him, but he wants her to leave.  She is very much in love with a young man named Jimmy (played by Jack O'Connell), and she is planning to get married to him.  When Jimmy (who is much younger than Babe) starts showing up at her house a lot more frequently than before, and showing signs of being more interested in her than in her husband, she decides to call off the wedding.  Then, Jimmy shows up at a party that Babe is hosting for some friends of his.  The friends and Jimmy are all in love.  Babe is still in love, but she can't figure out why Jimmy is interested in this younger woman.  And when Babe's mother finds out about this, she doesn't like it, and wants her daughter out of her life.  While Babe is having trouble deciding how to handle this situation, her mother suggests that she try out for a show that is being put on by a famous dancer, who is not only beautiful but also very rich.  Unfortunately for Babe, this show is being filmed by a film crew, and the actress, who has an interest in Babe, is in the film.  What does Babe do?  She tries to stop the film crew from filming her, but her mother gets angry at her and takes her out to the car.  After a long drive, the movie crew finds Babe and they take her back to the house.  There, Babe and Jimmy kiss, and Jimmy invites her to come with him to the Playboy Mansion.  A few days later, Babe is back at the house, and her mother comes to see her.  Her mother thinks that she has made a bad mistake by marrying Jimmy, but Babe tells her that Jimmy is a great man.  Now, Babe has to decide whether she should have the child that she is carrying, or to abort it.  In a little over a day, Babe makes up her mind to abort the baby.  It turns out that the child is a boy, who looks
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title says, this is a movie that really makes you laugh. It is very dark and creepy, and you really get to see the horror that the characters are going through. I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending really makes this movie worth it.   If you like scary movies, or have a fear of ghosts or vampires, then you will love this movie. It really has that creepy atmosphere that you can't really describe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good old fashioned western with a strong focus on the character development.   I like the characters and I like how they interact with each other.  If you are interested in a good Western this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ A lot of people in the world would have a hard time being part of a group that includes the two most famous and controversial people in this world.    One of these two men, Henry Kissinger, was the one who brought the Soviet Union to the brink of collapse by getting into a huge confrontation with Gorbachev. Kissinger would later have a hand in bringing down the Soviet empire. He would eventually find himself embroiled in the Iran-Contra scandal which involved illegal arms sales to Iran and illegal support to the Contras.  The other man in this movie is the one that was part of the group that brought about the downfall of the Soviet Empire. This was the man who was the mastermind behind the events that were leading to the downfall and eventual demise of the entire Soviet Union. This man was the leader of the United States in the cold war and was responsible for the deaths of more than a million people during the Korean War. He was also the architect of the policy of the CIA to arm the mujahideen to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. This would lead to the creation of Al Qaeda and eventually lead to 9/11.  Henry Kissinger was a war criminal, a traitor to the United State of America and a war monger. He has been given a Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama, but it was only given to someone who killed more than one million people. This movie is well made and shows the inner workings of the most powerful nation on the planet.  Kissinger's War of the Worlds - Movie Review   A film that has the ability to scare the pants off of you.  This is a good old fashioned scary movie that should scare the hell out of anyone who has ever thought about the possibility of a nuclear war between the United Sates and the SovietUnion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's nothing wrong with this movie; it's just that it's the least memorable of all of the "D.O.A." movies. I don't mean this in a bad way, because it is not bad. But there's not much going on; there's no great fight scenes; there are no memorable characters; there is no plot; and it's a little too long. It's certainly better than the other "Dora the Explorer" movies, but the others are better as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are not a lot of great movies about World War II, but this one is quite good. The cast is mostly pretty good, and I like how the movie is a bit more serious and not as comedic as other films.  It was good, not great, but it was a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not one for making movies, but this one was a treat. It's a bit of a romance that involves a little kid and a girl named "The Cat." They are on the run from a group of guys who want to steal the child. They are trying to get to a castle where the cat is held captive. There is a lot of action. There's a scene where the Cat is captured and they are about to hang her, but a man comes in and saves her. He's named "Captain K" and his job is to get people to join his cause. It isn't clear if he's a good guy or not, but he has some good intentions. The cat, though, has a plan that involves using the cat's special power to send people away from the castle. It works, but they are trapped. The Cat, meanwhile, gets a magic carpet to go with her powers. They're stuck in a house and there is a bunch of bad guys that have come to kidnap the child and the cat. It gets a little scary. There are some nice special effects, and some good scenes. This movie is very well made. I like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first saw the trailer for the upcoming film adaptation of David Nicholls' novel The Children, I thought it would be a pretty great film adaptation. It is a film adaptation that seems to have a lot of heart, and is one of those films that is worth the watch, regardless of what you think about it. This film has a pretty unique premise that you can't really go wrong with. The story revolves around a group of children who are separated from their parents at a boarding school and decide to take their own lives. The film's premise is pretty dark and it definitely packs a punch, and I can't wait to see this film again.  "No one wants to go to the dentist. You get to be the one that wants to."

There is some very dirty stuff going on in these sex scenes, and if you don't want to see it, don't watch it. It's just not worth it. But if you are a fan of old-fashioned Western movies and you like the cowboy, this is a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ A great comedy and a wonderful ending. _________________________________________________ _________________________________________  The movie is a comedy and it has a great ending. A group of college kids (including one that plays a character named Joe, who is also in the movie) get in trouble when they decide to play a game called "Don't Go Breaking My Legs." It involves running into a tree. The first time the group runs into a leg, it breaks. The second time, they run into another leg and it breaks, but the third time, a leg does not break. They decide to find a fourth leg to break, and they find a fifth leg and break it. The movie ends with the five legs being all together. This is a funny movie with lots of comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It's an extremely fun movie with great special effects and very original characters. I'm always impressed with the special effects, they really give it a unique feel to it. The main character is the only one who can see the future, but she's also very brave, and she tries to help the little girl in the way that is most likely going to save her life. This movie really gets a lot of laughs out of the characters and the special effect work. I think that it's the best movie of the summer so far.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good old movie about a young man who finds himself in a small town in the middle of nowhere and who begins to get involved with a girl who seems to know him, but is really a woman from another world who is in search of the mythical "Bolivia."   It's a story about two people, a man and a woman, who meet in a bar and begin to fall in love.   The movie is filled with strange, strange, and strange-looking people.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ _________________________________________________   This is a great movie. It is based on a true story, and there is much more to the story than is stated in the movie itself. The story is told through the eyes of three different characters. The first two, the one who plays the role of the "young man" and the one playing the part of the young woman, are not that different from one another. They are very much likeable, and I found them to be very good at playing their roles. The third, played by the "older" man, is quite different. His eyes are wide, and his mouth is wide. He speaks with a loud voice, and is very angry at the people around him. He seems to be a bit of a maniac. The reason why I love this movie is because it is not about just one man. It shows how this group of people came together, and why they are such a bad idea. I really enjoyed this movie, and it is well worth watching. ______________________________________

We came in early and I was able to sit her on the edge of the back row. The theater was packed. It seemed that everyone was enjoying themselves. The movie was pretty good. It was very well acted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The only thing that can kill a man is a good story"   -Mark Twain   I can say that The Last of the Mohicans is a very good movie.   It has many interesting parts, the film is really interesting. The acting is very good. The only problem is that the story is too short. It is not even about a battle. It's about the life of a man in the 1700s who fights with a British Captain.   a good man, who is very brave and hard working, who loves his family and his country.  .  This is a film that is very well made and it is worth watching. I like it and recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Muppet Christmas Carol is a good old fashioned Muppet movie, but one that also does some things differently.  It is the kind of movie that I have seen before, but the director was different and the story line is different.   The Muppets are still a good part of the film.  The story has a happy ending but not so happy that it is not funny.  There are plenty of great Muppet characters in this movie, especially Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and the King's men.  But, it is really the characters in the film that make it a Muppet classic.  It is really a very funny movie, a lot of fun to watch.  You get a lot out of this movie and even if it is just a short run time, it still is fun to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie.  It's a funny and funny movie with a lot of heart.    There is a lot going on in this movie that is funny, but it's also very poignant.  This movie is about a couple who are married to each other.  They live in a small town, and their kids are very close.  The parents of the kids get together for a dinner and a movie.   This is the first time that they have seen each other since they were children.    It's the same couple that's been married for twenty years.  When they come back to the town for the dinner, they find out that the old couple have died.  Their kids get to know their grandparents.  While the kids were doing this, the father tells the children that he knows that the new man in town is his father.  The kids are all upset at first.  I think they should have been happier.  And then there's this scene:   It's pretty simple, but that's the point of the scene:  This man (and he's a bad ass) has just killed two of the bad guys and he doesn't care.  He just wants to get back to his wife.  It's one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a long time.  But that's not the best part of the movie. That's right, there's a part where the dad gets pissed off because he doesn a wife and a daughter.  So he comes to his son and tells him about it.  Then, the son tells his dad to get the hell out of his house.  His dad doesn't listen.  Eventually, the kids tell their father what has happened.  In the end, the dad realizes he can't leave the kids to their own devices.  Well, he doesn' t, but he doesn't have to.  Because his wife is a very kind woman.  She helps him through it all and she even helps him find the real bad guy.  That's pretty much the story of the film.  There are other parts that are more serious, but they're still funny.  All in all, this is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love the movie.   The story is very good, especially the part where it was about the first man to walk on the moon.  The movie was a great idea, and a great movie to watch, but it didn't last.  I don't understand why the film didn't work at all.  At the beginning of the film, the people are talking about how they were all waiting for the man who walked on the Moon.  It was pretty obvious what the movie was going to be about.  And the people did walk on Mars and on the other planets.  But what the film had that no other movie had was a big set.  When the movie started, there was a group of people on the big screen and a group on the small screen.  They both looked very different.  We were supposed to feel that it was an alien planet.  So it was great that we could see the huge Martian landscape, and the other planet with its cities and deserts.  This is not something that was going on in other movies.  In some of them, the Earth is a desert.  All of these people have a hard time to communicate.  To me, that was one of the worst aspects of the movie; the people didn't speak a single word.  Instead, they were doing a lot of things that are completely unintelligible to me.    I was disappointed because I thought the film was going so good.  As far as the story was concerned, the first movie had a good story, and I'm glad that this one did.  After that, the film got terrible.  There were so many changes in the movie that I couldn't even follow what was going.  How did the people get on Mars? What did they do there?    After they got there, they all went back to Earth.  That's how it was supposed to be.  What was the big set?  It had a big wall on the side.  Why didn't the people speak English?  Why were they talking in this language?  They didn't have a language like the people on Mars.  Now, how did they get off the planet? They had a device that could be used to travel on a spaceship.  If they could find another planet to get to, then why didn't they do that?  I think that the film ended after they went to the other side of the Earth.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most recent James Bond film to be released was Skyfall. It was one of the best Bond films ever made, and the movie was set in the present day, just as in the novels, and it was a great Bond movie, as well as a good one. The Bond series had a number of very good films, and this one was one the best of them. I liked the idea of a woman with the ability to control the world, and then a man who was a genius and a very cool guy who was always in the right place at the right time. The plot was really good and I think that the actors did a great job, as did the cinematography and music. I don't think it is as good as the first two Bond movies, but I liked it. I like James Bond. I think it's one of my favorite characters in the movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hands of Orlok is an entertaining but not very original story of a man (Eli Wallach) who can manipulate his hands into doing the impossible, by manipulating a group of robots.  These robots (not as good as the ones in the movie) are controlled by a group called the Hands of Orlok, who have a strange bond with the humanoids they are created from.  I think the movie has a few problems, one of them is that it is not very well animated.    The Handed of Orloks is a lot like a more interesting version of the Honey I Shrunk the Kids cartoon.  There are also a lot of characters in the story that are more like the cast of the Disney movie.  The film is good enough though.  It's not one of those cartoons that everyone will enjoy.

I think I'll just say the main character and his girlfriend have a crazy romantic moment in a car and the end of the movie is the best romantic movie I have seen in a while. The movie was a little weird at times because of how the plot was built up and how it ended. The story itself was kind of interesting and I didn't really like the ending because it felt too contrived and forced. However, if you like a romantic comedy, I think this is one to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first movie of this director's "Gangster Squad" series. This is a movie about a gangster squad. The "Gangs" are made up of the best people from different parts of the city. The best of them are: "The Boss" the "Champion" and the "Safari". "The Champion" is the leader of the Gang. He has a great plan to steal the diamond. He gets the diamond from the "Turtle" the leader. The diamond is worth $30 million. The police are going to catch them and the diamond will be their only chance to survive. The gang wants to steal it before the police do. They make a deal with the "Red" (a hit man) and his girlfriend (a hooker). The "Red's" girlfriend tells him she wants to sleep with him. He agrees and takes her out to a place she will be very happy to be. They spend the night in the desert and then they are in a truck and off they go. They get to the diamond but it is out of reach. The Police are going after them. When the Gang comes across them, they are all surprised that they are being pursued by the Police. The Gang is in no condition to run away but they still have to get the diamond and out of town before the Police can catch them. After they leave the Diamond, the gang is attacked by the police. They have a chance to escape but they are captured by the "Blue" and his friends (the other "G" gang members). The gang is put in jail and the Diamond is taken from them. They are brought to the police station and the Boss is taken in for questioning. The Boss is accused of killing the police officer. The whole gang is in prison. There is a huge amount of evidence against them but they have no way of getting a lawyer. The boss is given a chance. They decide to put the whole gang on the stand. "The Blue" wants the diamond back and he wants to take revenge for his friend. The rest of the gang decide that if the Boss wants the Diamond back, they will give him the Diamond. The only problem is that the Boss will not have enough evidence to take the Diamond from them because he is a police officer and the police don't wear bullet proof vests. They need to find someone who does wear bulletproof vests so they can get the Diamond and they can

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always loved science fiction movies. I've seen them all.   But this movie blew me away.  And so did the writing and acting.  The movie takes place in the future. It's not like a science fiction movie in the sense that it doesn't feature spaceships, aliens, aliens etc. It is a science fantasy movie. There are no special effects and no flying. It takes place on the Moon and in a cave. It doesn't have any great special effects. The cave itself is filled with natural caves and caverns that are natural. It features the same type of cave and cave system as the ones in the movie Alien. The movie itself is based on a story by Robert A. Heinlein. It tells of a group of explorers who get caught in a trap and they are forced to survive and get to the surface alive.  This is a really fun movie to watch. It has some great action scenes and a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie!  You know how sometimes movies are so much better than the book and the book is so much worse?  Well this movie is the opposite.  There is so little plot to this movie. Â It is all about two guys and a lady.    So there is really nothing for a plot except that the guys have a problem and they just want to find out what it is and they don't have much time.    It is so short that you might just watch it and not even pay attention to the plot.  This movie is a little more silly than the books and it is really fun to watch.  I have seen this movie at least a dozen times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Chill" (1946) is a good and classic western (not the kind you hear about in movies).  The story is well-crafted, and the script is well acted, with the usual Hollywood melodrama.  The movie has many strong characters, such as the sheriff, a man who is too fond of whiskey and who always carries a gun, and a man called "Old Bill", who is an outlaw and who often steals cattle and cattle-trailers.  Most of the action takes place in the western, which is a very popular genre in Hollywood in the early 1940s.  There are some spectacular scenes in the west, and this movie has plenty of them.  In the end, the story ends in a cliffhanger that will have you on the edge of your seat for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of "dub" movies, like "The Goonies", "Aliens", "Predator" and so on. All of them are a little dull and boring. So when I saw this movie I was pretty happy, I had seen a few "dubs" but I thought they were ok. "The Great Gatsby" is a "dud" but a good one. I don't like it. I like "Pulp Fiction", I don´t like "American Graffiti", "The Wild One", "Dirty Harry", "Rambo" and "Dune". I think I will never like another "dude" movie, but this one is OK. The actor, Al Pacino is a good actor and a great director.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The movie is well made and well acted. Â It has a great plot and a well-developed cast.  The movie is set in a prison.    A man escapes the prison and is pursued by the police.  It is a fun movie.  I would recommend this movie to a friend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie so far.   I was a little disappointed that there were no more of the old school, good old days, as this was the last of the films that I loved as a kid.  Still, it's fun and has a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched "Wedding Crashers" last night.   There are some great moments in this movie, but also some scenes that are just ridiculous.  I really do not get the attraction for the bride.  It is just a weird situation and I feel that she would have more fun playing around in a porno mag than at a wedding.  This movie is great to watch if you like the "Walking Dead" or the "MTV Cribs" and want to see the two movies go head to head. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know what I expected from this movie, and I don't remember it being much of a hit. I think the most that it could have been, was a decent, but not great, horror movie, which was the only thing that I remember about this film.  It's not a terrible movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who like their horror in the dark, and the pacing is a little slow. ______________________________________________ Posted by The Midnight Stalker at 6:30 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "If you think that a film is bad you are wrong. It is a good, simple, straightforward film that is about one man who just wants to do something to be happy."   A man is a man, and a man is also a cat. He lives with his family and friends in the seedy underbelly of a small town, and he loves it. This is one of those films where the story is about the people and not the characters. It was an interesting idea and a fun movie.   But it is a story about a man that is trying to do more for himself than he knows what to do. He has a girlfriend and a dog, but he wants more. He is also trying to live a normal life and a normal family life with his mother. He wants a girlfriend, but it isn't going to happen. He also doesn't have a dog. He really doesn't. His life is really one big, boring adventure with nothing going on, but that is okay. He's a happy man.  - He loves cats.   and it seems like his dog wants to kill him every time he comes home.  ,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror, then you will like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a huge fan of the TV series, but I do have a soft spot for it.  When I was a kid, I had a favorite TV show called, The Adventures of Robin Hood.  That show was basically a spoof of Robin's adventures in a Medieval Europe where he was a member of a band of outlaws.   I really like this movie.   It's pretty short (less than an hour) but it is full of great moments.  It has a great script, a great cast, and a great musical score.  In the end, it's really hard to say who is the best of the group.  One of the best things about the movie is that the three actors all do a great job.  All three of them play their roles very well.  And while all three of the lead actors are really good, the rest of the cast is also really good.  I think the best part about this movie is the music.  Every time the music starts playing, it gets me really pumped up.  So, that's why I recommend this movie to everyone.  You'll enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. I am not a big fan of the movies and they tend to be very cliche and over the top. However, this is a good, fun, funny movie that I would recommend to all people who enjoy a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is one scene in this movie that really made me laugh out loud. There is a young girl who is being taken around the neighborhood by her father to a local amusement park. There she is seen dancing on a small stage and a man who is sitting in the front row begins to sing a song. His song is a parody of the popular "The Star Spangled Banner". The girl is so moved by the performance that she begins to cry and the man in the row next to her is so offended by her tears that he shouts: "Get back in your place! It's a damn song, it's a damned song! You're too silly to be a lady!" I thought this was just a good little gag and it really worked for me. I also thought that the guy sitting in front of the girl was rather a good looking fellow.    Overall, this is a good short comedy with a good song. It is not a great movie but it is fun and well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie in the early 90's at the age of 14.  The movie has it all: a bad guy (Michael Jackson), a good guy (Jerry Lewis), and a bad gal (Debbie Harry) and a little girl (Nancy Sinatra).   This movie had everything that you could want in a comedy: great dialogue, great songs, great comedy, and good acting.    The film was set in the year 1939, and the story was told in the style of a musical with Jerry Lewis playing a bad man (in this case, Jerry Lewis is an ex-Nazi who returns to America to wreak revenge on his old friends).  It's set in a small town, but the location really doesn't matter.  Michael Jackson plays a bad-ass, evil looking guy who is very evil.  He's a bad dude, but he also has an amazing talent.  This is a great movie, it's funny, it has good acting, and it's a musical.  It has everything you want in an entertaining movie: great songs and great comedy.

It was an interesting time to be a child, and it remains so to this day. I have seen several of these movies, and this is one of my favorites. I can't say that I understand it all, but it has a real feel of mystery. I always look forward to the next one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an adaptation of the movie "The Silence of the Lambs" by Thomas Harris.   I really enjoyed this movie and it was a good change of pace from the more violent and violent films that are out there.  The story is a good one and is told from the point of view of FBI Agent Clarice Starling.  She is a very talented FBI agent and does what she needs to do to get to the bottom of the cases that she is assigned to.  Clarice does not like the people she is working with at all, especially her own boss.  One of the characters is Jack Crawford, a violent serial killer.  This is not a film for everyone and it has violence and sexual references, so I would not recommend this to the kids.  If you are looking for a good horror movie then I would recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film in the series is pretty bad, but the second film (The Last Dragon) is a lot better. I thought it was pretty good when I first saw it in a small theater in San Antonio, Texas. The only negative thing about the film is that it has a lot of slow motion, and that's a shame, because it does a lot to set up the character development for the characters in the film. I liked it, and I'll definitely be seeing it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I like it because it's very good."   - John Darnielle (the guy who wrote the soundtrack)   I'm sorry to be a spoiler but... There are a lot of great moments in this movie and the way it's edited makes it seem like a movie that's been edited together, but that's not the case at all. The story is told from multiple perspectives and the film is told through the eyes of a very specific character. There's not a lot going on here in the story, but it's a really good time, so don't miss it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie,   is about a group of people who travel to another dimension and end up in a weird little town with a crazy cult and the leader is a strange old man with an evil smile.   There is a small twist at the end that gives it a bit of a different feel, but still a pretty standard fantasy tale.  It is not a bad movie by any means, it is just not particularly memorable, especially for a first time director, but if you are looking for a new fantasy movie, or an adventure story that will entertain you for a long time,  this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. A very well written and acted film. This is a great little film that can be enjoyed by fans of the great British drama of the early 70s. A great story, great acting, and a great ending. The ending is also very touching and makes me think of the end of the Beatles' second album.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** THE PROPERTY OF BEATRIZ: A FIFTY MINUTE MOVIE ABOUT A WIFE IN AN ARMS-WIDE MANHATTAN FAMILY IN THE LATE Sixties AND ETERNITY! Written, directed, produced and starred by BOB DYLAN, this is the movie you want to make your children and yourself watch when you are old! It is the classic movie that everyone in the world knows about. Bob Dylan is as great an actor as he is a great storyteller, and the movie is just as good as you remember it being. A movie that is not only entertaining but an honest and real look at what it is like to be a family in the big city and the small town you call home. If you are a lover of the old movie soundtracks, then you will enjoy this movie as much as I did. It is a fun little movie with a happy ending, and it is a wonderful watch. ***** I would recommend this movie to any one who is a fan of the original "Beatles" movie. **** This movie is a must see! *********** *********
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I was at the cinema last night to watch the new Bond movie and had a good time. The cinematography is great. It is dark but not scary. It has the same feel as the previous Bond movies. I loved the new characters too, and liked how they were created by casting them with a different actor each time. They were good to watch. I was not a huge fan of the plot and the ending. I liked the movie but not as much as I like the previous two Bond movies and they are my favorites. Â
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not an old movie (I'm over 70), but it's a good one.   The first half is very good.  The movie is told from the point of view of a young girl, so the characters are not really developed.  They talk about the old days when the Japanese did not wear uniforms and when the Russians did.  I didn't care for the old guy in the movie, though.        If you like a good old fashioned romance with a romantic ending, then this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was interesting, but I'm not sure what the point was. The main character is a man who is in his 30s and is married to his wife (who is very old) and has a very good job as a doctor. He is quite content with his life. He has a young son and a young daughter. The only thing he wants is to see his son and daughter grow up. One day his son has a bad dream in which he is abducted by aliens and is taken to a planet that resembles a cave. He sees a huge, alien face with four huge, three eyes and two ears on a huge body with a tail. He also sees a spaceship and a giant space ship. They also have a very strong smell that he describes as a smell of "the devil". He then sees a woman with two breasts and an extremely large body. She also has a tail and an alien mouth that she speaks through. He then meets another woman with a three eyed alien face and a very large body, and he meets another three eyed man who has a large body and a human face. The aliens are very friendly, and they want to help the man in finding his son. He goes to the planet with his son to see him, but they don't have time to see the child because they are going to meet a large space ship and the ship's name is "The Beast". The man is captured by the aliens and they begin to eat him, which is actually a great idea because they only eat the bones and the alien is the only one who can talk. The man wakes up and tries to get his son back, but his son is not in the spaceship and he doesn't know what is going on. He gets the spaceship ready and flies it towards the spaceship, which then appears to be the "Beast". He gets it ready and the man and his son enter the spaceship. As they get inside the spaceship they begin a huge battle. It is at this point that the movie becomes very confusing. The film takes place in a cave, so why would the alien have a spaceship? Why would the aliens want to meet the man's son? What is the Beast doing in the cave? Who are these aliens? Is it just a big space ship? Why is it so big? It is so confusing and hard to understand what is happening. At the end of the movie the alien tells the man to go back to Earth because they can't help him

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this in the early 90's, when it was in theatres, and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a unique atmosphere and is a good mix of science fiction and horror. The movie is not for the faint of heart, and has a disturbing and chilling plot. The main character is played by the late Peter Cushing, who was a very good actor. He has the same dark eyes and a face that looks like he is haunted. He was in some really good movies as well, such as the "Dawn of Man" and the "The Day the Earth Stood Still." I am glad I have seen this movie and I recommend it to all horror fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic. I like the movie, the song, the acting, and the plot.   The only problem is that there is not much action in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a lot of reasons to watch this film. The story of a woman who is going crazy and being possessed by the spirit of her dead mother is a good one.  She also gets to see her father (Burt Lancaster) for the first time since the death of his wife.    This is a classic and a great movie.  The acting is excellent, especially by Lancaster and Shelley Winters.  And the special effects are amazing.  This is one of the best horror films of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first part of this movie is good, not great, but it's not bad either. The movie starts off with a small little town in a small village. I really enjoyed the little towns in these types of movies because they tend to be filled with people who like the same things and the same music. It's not like these towns are filled with strange and strange people, they just like to listen to the same songs and talk about the same kind of things. This particular town is full of people who are on the move. They are traveling in a big van that has a little cabin in the back and the windows are all covered up so that no one can see what's going on inside. They have been in this van for two weeks now and they're only getting a little farther away from their home in the town. A young man named Ben (Tim Matheson) and his girlfriend, Jessica (Jessica Biel) are getting closer to their destination, a farm. Ben's sister, Beth (Gwen DeMarco) and Ben's brother, Dave (John Carroll Lynch) are still on their way and they are going to be late for their destination. The couple has some other problems too. Ben and Jessica have to get a ride with the townspeople to the farm. Unfortunately, they are picked up by a truck driver named Jack (Robert Duvall) who drives them all around town. Ben gets into trouble when he makes a bad joke and Jack decides to take him out on the road. While on the highway Ben and Jack run into some other travelers. They don't know that Ben and Dave are on their trip and they come up with a plan to get rid of the couple. They get a group of people together and they start to pull off some pranks on Ben and Jess, but not before Jess gets bitten by a snake. Ben finds that Jess is dying and decides that he has to help her. However, Ben's father, Ben (Fred Williamson) doesn't approve of Ben's decision. Ben goes to the doctor to get some kind of cure for his daughter. The doctor is unable to help and Ben and his dad find a cure themselves. Ben is still in pain, but he still believes that he can help his daughter with the cure. They go to the town to get help and a doctor named Dr. Krieger (Jeffrey Hunter) comes out and gives them some kind things to drink. Unfortunately for Ben and Dr.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a good example of what the film industry was all about during its heyday. The cast is all great and the story is great.   It is a nice change from the typical Hollywood fare of the day: no love triangle, no crazy plots or any sort of "bad guy". The story is just a good story with some clever twists and turns. The plot twists are also quite clever: for example, the main character's father is a famous doctor who treats a man who is very sick (he seems to be dying) but is actually a scientist who is trying to develop a cure. The scientist is killed when the man is too ill to survive the operation. It is a great example of the idea that the best science is when the science is "unnatural". The movie is full of these ideas: for instance, the scientist's research is done in a small town where the local townspeople believe that if someone drinks from a well, that person will die. The main character, a young girl who goes to the town to find out the truth, is a true believer in this belief. The doctor's assistant who is with her, a mysterious young man, is also a true skeptic. The film is also full of "what ifs". The scientist, played by Peter Sellers, has a very dangerous illness and is not expected to live to the end of the film. His assistant, played brilliantly by Steve Martin, has the same illness and it is possible he will die in the same operation. What if the young girl is also the main patient in the operation and she survives the operation? What if it is the main subject of the doctor's research and he gets killed by the townspeoples who think he is insane and that he is doing a terrible thing? What would the doctor do? And so on. This film has a lot of ideas and concepts which are just plain funny. The movie has a good ending which is a real surprise and is the best part of the movie. There is also some really good performances in the film: Steve Martin as the doctor, the young actor as the young assistant and the famous actor as his patient.  ,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of movies about the war on drugs, and most of them are terrible.   The movie I'm about to talk about is called   My Own Private Idaho, and it was released in 1994.  And, like most of the films about the War on Drugs, it was terrible. But, unlike many of the other movies about drugs and the War On Drugs, My Own Personal Idaho isn't just a bad movie, it's a bad piece of propaganda.  It's a movie about a bunch of dope dealers trying to make some money by trying to sell heroin to the kids.  What makes it worse is that this movie is filled with anti-American stereotypes.  The biggest example of this is the American hero, Steve Austin, who is an alcoholic, who never gets laid, who doesn't even want to fight in Vietnam, and who doesn the most badass, badass, man in the movie.  He's the only guy in the entire movie who is actually willing to use his gun against other people and shoot them in the face.  But that's not all.  His friend is a girl, and her name is Wendy.  She's from San Francisco, and she's pretty much the only thing in this movie worth seeing.  Austin's best friend, a former Marine, is also an alcoholic and a junkie, and is constantly getting shot up.  Wendy is a pretty pretty girl, who also happens to be a dope addict.  They also have a girl named Karen who's a pretty good shot, and Austin and Wendy's other friend is an Australian named Bruce who's an alcoholic who also gets shot up a lot.  There's also a bunch  of American soldiers who don't get any action in the film, and they get killed by some Vietnamese soldiers, which is pretty funny.  This movie doesn't have any redeeming qualities, and it's really not funny at all, so it's pretty easy to give this a 1-star rating. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts with a beautiful image of a man and a woman on a sunny morning. The scene then cuts to an outdoor concert. The camera focuses on a couple of women, who dance and sing and laugh and talk. The film then focuses on the man's friend, who is trying to decide whether to get out of the rain or stay in. The music stops. The man says "I can't wait for the sun to come up."   There are several different styles of music in this film, from country to rock to classical.   It's very funny and charming.  In the next scene, a young woman is trying out her new dress.  It is a pretty good film with a lovely soundtrack.  A good film that you should definitely check out.

They are very happy and ready to raise her to be a normal girl and she is in a good mood when they bring her home.  When they do find out she is a boy, they become worried. They realize they can't have a girl because they are only planning on having a boy to take care of their son. They go to a doctor to find out if the baby is a little boy or a little girl and it is a baby girl.  What is the most important thing about this movie?  It is a movie about a couple and their child, who is in fact a girl and they are happy to have a child who is a normal little girl. The ending of the movie is very cute.  I give this movie a thumbs up!

I was also a bit worried that there were going to be a lot more explosions, and this was a little off-putting at first.  But by the time the film got to the later scenes, it was well done and I didn't mind that. It also wasn't as long as I thought it was going to, which was great.  The acting is great and the film has a lot to offer.   I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh, and I highly recommend it to fans of comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was quite surprised when I saw this movie. It is a very well done movie with a good story. It really shows the life of a poor and very sad guy.  The story is very interesting, and you will get to know more about the man. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that you would have to pay for on a regular basis. The director, Tom DiCillo, knows how to make a film with an incredible amount of blood and violence. The movie is one of the most shocking and disturbing movies I've ever seen. A movie like this is supposed to be hard to see, but the film's quality makes it easy to see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of this movie is soooo much like the premise of the show, and I can't say anything bad about it, it's sooo original.     It's really great that this movie can go into the same territory as the original show (well not the same, but close) but at the same time it's a little different in some ways and also a little darker.  The story of the movie is about a guy who has this dream of being a cop in an American city, he ends up finding a way to live like a normal person in his city.  But as he goes about his normal life, he finds out that he has a very special power, one that can be used to solve almost any crime, it can be a powerful tool if used properly.  It's soooo awesome, I would totally watch this movie again, it has so many elements that you will enjoy, and it's all pretty much original.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a great story about a father who discovers the meaning of life, but who never has any of it himself. He was just a kid and grew up in the slums, a neighborhood in the Bronx where the police and the press are more interested in the bad guys than the good guys. So when his friend loses his father to a freak accident, he has no one to talk to. So he decides to start a street corner, with a simple slogan: "Where good men go to die." He's never had much luck with street corners, so he's in for a surprise when he meets a nice couple and they start taking care of him. They have their own problems, and they are in over their heads. The wife is a drug addict who is being monitored by her husband, and the husband is trying to be a good father. There's a lot of good scenes in this movie, with the good father doing good father things. The scene in the street with the baby in a carriage and a couple of men and women who are going to die. It's a good, solid movie. I gave it a 7. I liked it, I'm glad I watched it, and I'm hoping that I'll see it again. ___________  I'm pretty sure that no one in their right mind would call this a good story. But that's the point: it's not about the story; it's about the message. The story isn't even in the movie. It was added in post production. There are no actors in this story, and no one is even present when the bad guy (the kid) is being executed. It doesn't matter: the movie is about a man who finds a message in an everyday event, and decides to take it to heart. There is no plot in this film. It takes a message, and turns it into a story about an ordinary day. __________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An unusual, quirky movie.   The only thing I can say is that the ending is not too great.  It's just a little too over the top, and a little like the movie was trying to be a little bit more than it was.  A funny movie with a nice ending, but it's not a masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had high hopes for this movie. I was very pleased with the way it played out. I loved the ending and the way the movie was shot. I felt it was a fun and unique movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are several movies that I have seen where the "hero" saves the world from the villain. In the case of the film I am talking about this movie, and I don't know what it is about, but I really enjoyed the movie. The film takes place in the future where a genetic engineering company called Bioscan is developing the first genetically engineered baby. The child, the genetically engineered human named Kivran, is being raised by his mother, Astrid (Cary Elwes), who is a scientist herself. When Kivlan is about 6 years old, his mother and father are killed by a man named Aro (Ray Milland), who then takes Kivnan and puts him in the care of Dr. Nambu (David Duchovny). Aro is a terrorist who wants to destroy the biocomputer that is controlling the baby's powers. He and his goons kill Kivwan's parents, Aro and his girlfriend (Susan Sarandon) and take Kivlon to a remote place where he is trained to fight by a boy named Piro (C. Thomas Howell). Kivron learns to be an extremely proficient fighter and becomes a member of a team of heroes who protect the biopower. The special effects were good, the film was fairly fast paced, and it had good special effects and a great score. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never been a big fan of the movie "The Blues Brothers".  It's one of the most clichéd comedies I've ever seen.  But I did find it amusing how they would take all of the comedy elements and just make a really lame movie.   I'm a big sucker for old time radio comedies, and this one is no exception.  I'm sure I'll see this movie again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky enough to be invited to a screening of a movie that I loved, and that is a big compliment, and a compliment to all the people who worked on the film. It is one of the best films I have seen.   It is based on the true story of the life of an Irishman named Patrick Pearse who led a revolt against British rule.  The film was made in the early 1960's.  This is a film about Irishmen fighting for the independence of their country.  I found the script very well written.  In the film there are scenes in the house where you see a woman who is trying to escape from a man who is attempting to rape her.  You see an attempt by the man to get the woman to marry him.  She resists and the man eventually succeeds.  It makes a great movie because it is so real and because it tells a story of how the people of Ireland came together in a time of extreme oppression to fight for their country and to preserve their freedom.  The Irish have a great history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of movies are made every year that are supposed to be funny.   This one is one of the best.  There is no doubt that the film was directed by a good friend of mine.  I remember him and I laughing the hardest we ever have. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I just finished watching the new release of The Big Lebowski. This is my second favorite of the series, and my first one with the new director. It is a great homage to the original. The whole thing is a lot of fun, and has a nice ending. It's a little funny, but you can see why the makers made it. The movie is a bit short, but is worth the watch. There are a couple of minor problems in the film. The soundtrack is a little bland, and the movie starts off a little slow. The film is fun, but the production values are not up to the standard of the other Lebowskies. Here's a video of a live action version:
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've heard good things about the film. It's a nice movie and it's about a girl who wants to become a doctor. She meets a guy who has a dream of becoming a doctor, too. They fall in love, but she's a little too interested in him, too much like a girl in a dress. The movie isn't all that good. The guy isn't as interesting as he could have been. But the girl isn't so bad. The ending was a bit too abrupt. I like the music in the movie. The girl does get a bit more to herself in the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other night I was at a family reunion and my dad came in. I'm pretty sure he was talking about this movie. I was watching it with my dad. He has a bad memory so I can't remember all the details. It was one of those things that made you think, "What movie could you see this in?" It was a movie about a family. The characters are really well done. I can picture my dad thinking "What the heck is that guy doing here?" It's a good reminder of how many families there are in America. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the girl was supposed to be a virgin. It made it a little hard to take.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good looking movie.  The actors were good in the roles they were given.    The special effects are very good.  They don't really look like special effects, they look like something out of a science fiction movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci-fi.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very well-made. It is not a romantic movie, and I am sure that some people will find it a bit dull, but I really enjoyed the movie.   I like it, it's a good one and it's worth seeing!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is really fun, I can't remember when it was made, but I'm sure it was about 40 years ago, and it's definitely a fun and entertaining movie to watch, although the dialogue is a little silly at times, and sometimes the animation is a bit "old-fashioned" at times. But, as a whole, I think the movie is enjoyable and well-made, and I look forward to it again, because I think it's got some good jokes and a great action sequence, and you can't beat a good action sequence. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action. I hope to see the sequel sometime.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished a good, low budget movie.  It's about a guy who's looking for a little extra cash and he wants to buy a gun that looks real.   He meets a man who wants to sell a fake gun and they set up a deal.  Then the real gun shows up and the real deal is made.  It's just a fun movie and it's worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really a good one, the music is good, the story is good. This movie is like a horror movie, but it's a little bit different, because it's more of a drama. The story is about a man, who is a member of a society, which has an unusual rule. You cannot commit suicide, you must die of illness. This man, is a doctor, and he decides to find a way to commit suicide. The movie is not only good, it is funny too. I don't think I'm the only one who likes this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like to watch movies that are about things that are "obviously" bad, like a guy who gets a new dog and gets to do all the things he did when he had a dog. This movie is not that bad, although it's not as good as the first two.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie "Wolverine" is a fun action movie.  It is one of those movies that you enjoy watching.  Wolverine and his partner in crime "Angel" are traveling through Europe.  Angel has been given the mission of capturing the mutant known as Wolverine.  They have made it to Germany and are now traveling along the border.  The movie is a mix of action and comedy.   This movie is more of a buddy comedy.   Wolverine is not the only one who is a loner.  This team is made up of:    - Wolverine - Angel - Iceman - Valkyrie - Psylocke   The action scenes are fun.  Each of the characters have their own strengths.  I especially enjoyed Angel.  She had a very "Sgt. America" feel to her.  There are also plenty of humorous scenes.  The only drawback to this movie is that it is a bit long.  Unfortunately, it is over in about an hour.  Overall, it was a good action movie and a good buddy comedy movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't really say much about this movie. It was fun to watch, it was a nice break from the typical movie we all know and love. It took some things from the classic westerns and then turned them upside down. The cast was pretty good and the director had a great sense of humor.   I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I know I'll probably see it a couple of times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can tell that the makers of this movie had a great time making it. It has a great script, a great cast, and a great set-up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In an interview with a young girl, who's on a field trip to the North Pole to see the polar bear in his natural habitat. The young girl's parents have a new house built on the property and the girl and her brother go on the field trip. When the girl gets there she finds out she is a princess. She's the only princess on the trip and the polar bears are her friends. They eat her birthday cake and she does what a child should do. She kisses the polar king.  I love a movie that shows how beautiful nature can be. I also love that the girl was given a toy bear for Christmas that is very different from the real one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ In the world of the zombie movies, there are a lot of them. I can't remember any that really stand out to me. I'll admit I was intrigued. I don't normally like the zombie genre, but this one really had me intrigued. The script is pretty good. There are a few times when the story gets a bit weird and it's difficult to follow. It is definitely a fun movie and worth a look. If you have the time and the interest, I recommend this one.

This movie has some very cool action scenes and I recommend it to anyone that likes action and suspense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character is a boy who wants to become a good magician. He's a bit slow to learn and gets his magic moves a bit awkward at first. His girlfriend is a girl who wants him to do a show for her in a circus. He has an evil cat who lives with him. His mother is a witch who can read minds and use her magical powers. Her daughter, the main character's mother is an evil witch who uses a potion on him to turn him into a good girl. She wants to turn her son into a whore who will love her and do whatever she tells him to. He doesn't have much of a moral compass, because he doesn't feel the need to follow it. He also does a lot of bad things for no reason, but he is not evil. I really enjoyed the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie about a guy who is a little bit like an American Dad, but who's an Australian. There are some Australian slang, some funny lines, and it is funny. It is a good film, but I felt it was a bit too long and it just ended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) was a brilliant film, which is a little different from most others on the list (it's not a conspiracy thriller). There's a lot of action, a lot going on in the background (and sometimes in the foreground) and a lot happening right there in the present, in the moment. There's also a bit of the weird. The film is about a man who is supposed to assassinate a man, who is actually a US Senator. This is one of the most famous of all conspiracy films (it was actually the first one to get an Oscar), so it's not surprising that it gets all the attention, and is well-known all over the world. The Manchus are portrayed by the actors in the movie, so the audience can relate to them (they are, after all, the fictional government that does everything in the name of national security, as it says on the tin). The story is about the President of the United States (played by John Wayne), who is running for a second term. He finds out that there are some shady characters, some of whom are posing as Senators. And the only way to save the country is for the President to get them all killed. So he orders his trusted lieutenant to recruit a new candidate to be the man in question. He gets the man he wants and puts him on a plane to the US. But this time he has to take the train. And it is in this part of the film that the film truly becomes a masterpiece. This part is a thriller. A lot happens. The plot is convoluted, but it's well-structured. There are twists and turns, but the overall picture is very good. The actors play their parts well and the film is very well made. There is a lot to discuss here, but if you want to know about the movie "The Man Churian Candidates", you need to watch this. I think this film should be seen by everyone, not just those who have seen the others. It's a good film, with some excellent acting and a good plot. It is a good one for a laugh and a great way to spend a weekend afternoon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid film about a small town with no real heroes and a little too many villains.  It's about a group of local farmers who get involved in a feud with a group from the nearby town of Redman.   The film opens with a shot of the farmers and a couple of boys hanging out.  The main characters in the film are the farmer who was shot by the Redman gang, the young girl who fell in love with the Redmans gang leader, and the young boy who was saved by the farmer.  It's a fairly simple plot with no complicated characters, but it's fun to watch.  If you like the old western movies like "Wild at Heart", you will like this film.  There is some violence in the movie, but the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  This film was a direct sequel to the original "Black Belt".   I like this movie a lot and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys westerns or just plain old old adventure movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This is one of those rare, great "classic" science fiction movies that has an engaging storyline, a great cast, a strong story, and a beautiful soundtrack. The most exciting and intriguing part of the movie is the character of the Captain (Harrison Ford), who is an astronaut who is on a mission to find the secret of life on other planets. He is also trying to keep his wife and daughter from being killed by the evil corporation who is planning on making an asteroid fly into Earth and destroy the entire planet. It is a hard-to-put-your-finger-on-it sci-fi action movie, but it is a very fun one. Â The movie is set in the early 1970's, and there are a lot of different spacecraft, and lots of interesting people to meet. It's a good idea, and the story does not suffer from being too predictable.    This movie is a must-see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (1/10) __________ This movie is not the movie I expected. I thought it would be a straight forward, no nonsense action movie that would focus on the story of a bunch of mercenaries and their adventures in the world. What I got was a cheesy story about a group of mercenaries who are in the middle of a dangerous, yet comical mission to kill a demon in a castle. I don't know how this movie was made, or how anyone got paid to put a script together and film it. There is little to no story, and I have no idea why they even bothered with this movie. It is not worth the time and money, and the actors are not even good enough to make it worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens in a prison where a gangster is being held by the guards for a murder he has committed. One of the guards is a woman named Miss Larkin who has a crush on him. Her boyfriend is a guard and she has the job of getting to know the gangster. She is very beautiful and she seems to be able to get close to the prisoner. I would love to see more of this movie as it is a well-made movie and I really enjoy it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing that comes to mind when I think of The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is the name. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is one of those movies that, for some strange reason, never quite worked for me. This is a story of two con artists and the man who tries to catch them and make them pay. The first part of the movie is a fairly standard con job, the con artist tries to make the other man rich by using the wrong name, while the other con artist wants to get out of it and has to come up with a way to do it. The second part of this story is more interesting. This part is about the other guy. He is a gambler who has to make up a story to fool people into believing that he is in a good mood. He also has a bad temper, and when he does, it is only because he has been drinking. So, when the con men set up a trap for him, he has a hard time figuring out what is going on. This makes it all the more interesting when the men who are trying to catch him are killed in the trap. So the con man and the gambler are stuck together, and are forced to solve this con job together. I thought this part of it was a bit of a let down, but that might have been because I wasn't in love with the other part of their story. The next part is really a little different. The movie is set in a small town in the middle of the country. This town is the home of two very different people. One of them is a very good-looking woman, and she is also a gambrel. The other man is an alcoholic, and he doesn't have a lot of friends, so he does a lot to keep himself from being miserable. The two are forced together when the gambrel is about to be executed for murder. The only way he can save himself is if he can get a gun and kill the gambrol. So they work together to get a weapon and take the gambl to a safe place. This ends up being a bit more complicated than they thought, but at least they can get out alive. In the next part, they are in a hotel where a man is about get his money from a woman. He doesn't trust the gambol and gets her to tell him a story about him. Then, they get to the gambling
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ This movie is great. The plot is very simple and straight forward. It follows two people in the future who are looking for a cure to an illness that has destroyed their family. The people that they meet are the last surviving members of a race of humans who have been wiped out by a disease that only kills the weakest members of the race. The disease only affects males and is spread by female mosquitos. The two people are called Jack and Jackie and the story revolves around them. Jackie is the strongest and has the ability to regenerate his body in seconds. He is also able to control the mosquitos and has been able to wipe out the disease for centuries. When Jack is asked if he wants to be cured he is asked the same question. Jacky is able to answer by saying yes he does and then he dies. After that the movie moves along and the two people who are searching for a new cure are called Dr. John and Dr. Darrin. They are searching through the jungle for the cure and they end up in a jungle called "The Jungle" where the disease is still present and the mosquito's still spread it. Jack and Jackie find a man named "Pappy" who is the leader of the jungle and he is a master of the mosquitoes. Jackie asks him about the cure for the disease and Pappy tells them that he has been researching the disease to the point of immortality. He says that the cure is within a small cave that he calls "The Rock" and they go to the cave to find it. Once there they meet some new friends that Jackie meets while they are searching the cave. The movie ends with Jack and his new friend Dr. Fick that has become Jack's companion in the jungle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of days after the events of the first movie (yes, it's that long) we find ourselves back in the town that we left, now with a couple of new characters. It's nice to see how the people are getting along in their own way, and it's a nice change of pace from the events that have occurred in the first two movies.  The ending is very satisfying, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where the story goes from here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the year 2084, a small village in a rural part of France, known as the "Moor", has become home to a mysterious creature, known only as "The Beast" and a group of strange, strange creatures. When the local priest begins to believe that the Beast may be a creature from another world and that he has been possessed by the spirit of an evil demon, the inhabitants of the village begin to wonder about the strange happenings and begin to seek a way to exorcise the demon. And thus begins the story of the "Demon's Rejects" and the "The Curse of the Demon".  If you are a fan of "The Twilight Zone", "The Outer Limits" or "The X-Files", you have to see this movie.  This is a great movie for kids and adults.  My wife was so excited to see "The Demon's Rejection" on the big screen and she was thrilled.  It is a very good movie. I gave this movie a 3 out of 5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hush" is a fantastic thriller that does not shy away from the subject of mind control. This is a story about an ex-CIA agent (Mark Harmon) who has been sent to investigate a new form of torture called "hush" that has recently been developed by a company called NeuroSurgical, Inc. The purpose of the film is to examine the effect that the use of the "hurl" has had on Harmon's mind. He finds out that the torture is very effective and he soon finds himself having the power to control the other people that he meets. As the film progresses, we find out that Harmon's own wife has been subjected to the torture. When he is sent to the company's headquarters to investigate, we see that it is very well done and has a very nice soundtrack. "Hush", which is in my opinion a much better film than the original "Silent Running", is a must see for any true horror movie fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most enjoyable of the bunch, and an absolute treat to watch.  As with most of the movies here, it is based on a real event and is really well acted.    This is a great time capsule of a movie and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good, fun movie with a fun and upbeat soundtrack.  There is a nice moment with the main character and his dad at the end.    I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone that is a fan of Disney.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are no real surprises in this movie, the story is told in the first person, and the story doesn't make any sense until you have read the synopsis and realize that the story of the movie is a lot like a true life story, the plot is a little convoluted, and it takes a long time to get where you want to go, but the movie has a great ending.   - October 14, 2009I thought I was going to die
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I heard of "The Last of the Mohicans" was from a friend who happened to be in the same school in the mid-'60s. His father was a friend of the producer, Francis Ford Coppola, and a fellow student of John Ford. The Coppolas were all, in a sense, brothers. This is a story about a war and about brothers and about the nature of a true American character. I liked it a lot. The actors did an excellent job. I saw it at a theater in Chicago that was about to be demolished and was delighted when they offered me a ticket. It is a very sad picture. The Indians in the story seem to be doing the best they can. The hero is the last of the Indian Mohicans. His death is very moving. I also like the title of the movie, which, as a movie title, is an ironic one. I think of the Last of The Mohicans as a classic that shows the way things are done. It tells of the fate of the Indians in a world gone wrong, which they do not really want to be a part of. The story is also very well told. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't like "Django Unchained", but I love the movie.   The movie is about a man who is enslaved and forced to kill other humans for money.   a good character, the white man, who is forced to become a slave in order to feed his family. A good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good example of a film in which the actors play their parts very well and the story keeps you interested until the end. The ending is a bit of a shocker, especially when you realize that there is a huge difference between the film's characters and the characters in the book. I also liked the music, the way it is used, the style and the lyrics, which is quite well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Would Be King  is an entertaining but slightly strange comedy that is the sort of film that I might want to see over and over again.  This is a movie where a crazy person (played by Kevin Spacey) is offered a chance to play King Arthur.  And I am not entirely sure if the actor actually wanted to be King Arthur, or if it was the role that he was born to play.  Spacey plays a strange, somewhat self-destructive, and very strange guy.  I have heard some folks say that this film is so bad it's good.   I don't quite buy that, but the first half of the movie is a bit better than the second half.  It is not a good film, but it is entertaining and a bit unusual.  If you like Spacey, or have a sense of humor, you might enjoy this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't usually watch horror movies (they are too scary for me), but this one had me in stitches.  It was the first one I have seen by Robert Englund.    And this movie has some good gore. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I'm not going to lie. This is a very bad movie. It's a bad movie from start to finish, and there are no redeeming qualities to speak of. It is basically just a bunch of people sitting around and doing nothing.   And they're all idiots.   I'm sorry, but it was just plain stupid to make a movie about a guy who is on his way to go on a tour of the world, and then to have him stay in the same hotel for 6 months. He could have stayed in a nice place with a nice view of the city, but then he wouldn't have been able to take pictures and would have had to drive all the way to the other side of the country to take a good photo of a nice mountain, and that's the most boring thing I've ever seen.   the only good thing about this movie is that you can tell there's a story being told, but the script is so badly written it's not even funny, and the acting is terrible.  's acting is atrocious.   a character named "Gretchen" is the best thing in this movie. Gretchen is the only one who tries to stay alive, but she's a total idiot. She's so stupid that she can't even tell that there's an evil evil man in her room. I hate to think of her acting as anything other than terrible, but I guess I'm just as bad a person as her.   "The Evil Evil Man" is voiced by none other than the one and only Jack Nicholson, who I think would have been a good villain in this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of the original "Crazy Stupid Love" (1983), directed by John Landis and starring Jane Fonda. I also loved the 1985 remake "The Crazies". The 1988 remake "Carnage" is an interesting look at the '60s and '70s counterculture, and is pretty much an adaptation of a short story by Richard Bachman about a group of hippie kids who discover a buried gold mine. The movie is funny, weird and a little bit scary, but it's also a little hard to watch at times. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The characters don't really act like real people, and the characters are the same no matter who's in the film. The plot is pretty well done, and it's really funny in parts. It's just a little too weird for me to like, but the first half of the movie is pretty good, and then it becomes a little boring after that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cannonball Run is a very good movie. It's also a movie that takes a good long time to get going. The beginning of the movie is fairly boring. You have to wait about two hours before you get to see the action. After that, it gets pretty good. There is one great fight scene in the beginning, where the main character is trying to escape from the police and gets into a car. There's a nice long chase scene where the characters are constantly driving around. The characters have a variety of different vehicles. There are cars, motorcycles, cars, trucks, planes, tanks, and tanks. It doesn't take long to see a wide variety of vehicles. The main character of the film is a young boy who lives in the middle of nowhere. He lives by himself. He doesn't have any friends. He's never seen a movie before. When he is caught by the police, he has no idea what's going on. They force him to do something he doesn't want to do. There isn't much of a story here. There aren't any characters in the movie who seem to have a purpose. There doesn't seem to be a plot, which is kind of a shame, because the movie has a lot of fun. The movie is pretty fast paced. The action scenes are well done. It is really fun to watch this movie. The story is very slow, and the movie ends pretty badly. There really isn't anything bad about this movie, and I'm glad I watched it. If you like Cannonball Run, you will like CannonBall Run: The Movie. It would be good to have the sequel. I would watch that movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first heard that the third installment of the The Godfather saga was to be directed by Francis Ford Coppola I was intrigued.  The film was directed by a man who has shown himself to be a master at all the things that make an action film great.    The story was told from the point of view of the two youngest sons of Al's wife, Maria (who was an actress before she became a widow).   Maria is still alive but has a bad temper and is not the kind of woman you would want to marry.  It is Al who is the man that wants to marry her, he is in love with her, and so he decides to hire a hit man to do the deed.  After a few failed attempts, Al finally manages to hire the hit man who is called Joe Pesci.  Joe is the best kind of hit man, he does not kill the men he kills.  But Joe is also a man of few words and when Al and Pesci find out that Joe has a history of killing people (even if he had a heart attack), Al decides to go to the police to ask for help.  This is where things start to get really interesting.  The police do not think it is a real crime and do not take the case seriously, but Maria gets angry and threatens to kill Joe and has the police called on her.  Then things get really bad.  One of the policemen is actually Joe's father.  As the film moves on the police become more and more concerned about Joe.  When Al finds out that Maria has the gun in her hand (which she has stolen from him) he decides that he has had enough of the police and decides to kill her. This does not end well for Al and the audience, but it is the kind of story that Coppolas have made some of his best.  It was a very good movie but it was not as good as The Godmother (which is one of my all time favorite films). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very good, I don't think I will miss the sequel, it is a little boring. I am not sure if it was a good idea to put an actor in a character who is very obviously gay. But he was very good. The whole movie was great, a good story about a guy who had to live as a woman and who doesn't know what is happening to him.   What I liked about this movie:  The whole movie is about a man who had been living as a man for many years. But when his wife (who is a lesbian) dies of a brain aneurysm, he decides to live with his brother (a guy) as a female, even though he does not have any woman in his life. It is not easy, and there are some difficulties. He must learn to live and love as a girl.  , I liked the idea of a character in a woman's body, but it didn't work well, he just didn't seem to be a woman, but a man. The lesbian relationship was a little too obvious. He was just a man, not a woman. It was not a very interesting story.  . I liked how it was all about a male-female relationship. It could have been a good thing if they had kept it in the movie. It really seemed like they were trying to make the film into a love story. But it didn?t work. It just seemed like the filmmakers wanted to make a gay movie, and it just didn?T work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's always good to watch movies about the people who were born before the Second World War.  The movie is called "Ich bin ein Berliner", which means "I am a Berliner".  If you like movies about German people, or any other people, you will like this movie.    I like that the movie is about a guy who tries to get out of the Berlin ghetto, and how he does it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to put this film into my favorite list. It is a fantastic film about a man that finds himself in a car accident and is taken to a hospital. He is then told that he is dying, and in order to live, he must go through an extreme surgery to remove his appendix. This surgery, however, will kill him, as the appendix is the cause of his death. This film is based on a true story, but I am not sure if the writer was telling the story with an eye toward making money or not. If you are interested in seeing this film, then you need to get it on DVD. The director was also a great guy, and I am sure that he had a great time filming this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think there is a better horror movie than The Descent  (I think I'll add that The Cabin  has a good Halloween slant).  It's also the best movie I've seen in a long time.  The movie has great production values, great performances and great effects.    I'm a big fan of horror movies, so I'm glad I've gotten to see this one!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crimson Tide" is an awesome movie.  I saw it at a small theater in my hometown, and it was packed with people and they were laughing and screaming and clapping and cheering and jumping up and down.    The movie is about a man who goes out into the bay to kill all the dolphins, but he is stopped by the mother of the dolphin and a bunch of other dolphins.  They tell him that he is a "monster" and a "disgusting" animal and that he will never see the mother again.  He gets mad at them, but they all go away.  When he goes back to the beach, he notices a woman looking at him with disgust, and she runs off.  The man looks back and sees that she is pregnant, and he thinks that this is a good opportunity to kill the dolphin mother.  This is when he notices that she has a strange thing around her neck.  There is a strange creature inside of her.  It looks like a fish with legs and tentacles and a head.  She is in labor and the doctor tells her that it is the dolphin.    He does not believe her and thinks that she just saw a baby with a fish head. The doctor tells him that she will have a child with a dolphin.   This is what drives the man to kill his own baby, because he believes that a human is nothing more than a fish and a dolphin is nothing but a monster.  But as he is killing his baby, he is hit with a huge rock and is thrown into the water.  His mother is watching this, and is very worried about her baby.  At first, he refuses to leave the beach to get help.  Eventually, he does, and his mother is very relieved.  Then she sees that the dolphin is in the water, and the mother and son have a reunion.  I thought the movie was a lot of fun and the characters were interesting.  A lot of people have been complaining that the film was too violent.  Unfortunately, that is not true.  No matter what kind of violence there is in this movie, it never reaches the levels that the movie has been labeled with.  In fact, the violence is very tame and there are no scenes where a man has to be cut in half.  My only real complaint about the movie is that it has a lot more to it than a simple shark movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Giant" is a pretty awesome movie.  The script is great and the film is a nice mixture of the classic comedy/horror genre and the more recent slasher sub-genre.    "Giant," has the same sort of action/horrificness as "House of Wax" (1981) and "The Burning" (1991), but is much better in every way.  If you haven't seen either of these movies, or don't know what a slasher is, then "Giants" is definitely worth checking out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great film about a great man, John Wayne.  The film is about a famous actor who goes on the run after a string of murders and is hunted by the FBI.    Wayne plays a character that seems to be the anti-hero but in fact is not.  Wayne is a man who seems to get what he wants from everything he does.  He has a long history of criminal acts and then after a series of events he is arrested and put in jail.  However, the FBI are more interested in the murder of a woman named Irene Adler.  Irene was an actress and a very nice person.  She was known to spend a lot of time with John Wayne and was his girlfriend when he was a child.  When Irene died, she had a number of people looking over her body, and they were not happy about it.  John Wayne is in jail and there is a new sheriff who is determined to make a name for himself.  While John Wayne fights to get out, he is confronted by a man that is a member of the old mob.  The man wants John Wayne dead.  And the movie is all about how Wayne deals with this situation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original "The Godfather" is one of the most famous movies of all time. I have watched it many times and the best part is watching it as an adult and getting the experience of it as a child.  This is the movie that made me want to be a cop.  It has been a long time since I watched this film but I really like it now.    It has the feel of a great spaghetti western.  I think that the music is great.  This film has a great atmosphere and the film is very entertaining.  The Godfather is a great film and I recommend it to all who like a good spaghetti western or who just want to watch a good film with an old time feel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun and clever movie. It is set in a futuristic city where a giant space ship is being built to take humans to another planet. The crew of a space ship, headed by the captain and a beautiful, yet slightly crazed, woman, have been chosen to be part of the construction crew, but they find themselves on the wrong planet. A strange, alien species of the planet they are on, the Earth, has been ravaged by an alien plague. In the space ship they find a ship that has been crash-landed on the planet, and as they begin to make repairs the ship's computer begins to communicate with them, telling them to stop working. It soon becomes apparent that this is not the planet's only problem. This movie has a lot of good laughs and a few excellent special effects, especially for the time period. I think it is the most fun I have had watching a movie since I discovered that there is a whole other universe out there in the universe.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure that people have the impression that the whole movie is based on a true story. But it isn't. It's based on an old movie called The Three Wise Men. There's nothing to be gained from this movie. But, it's a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, even children.   The movie is set in the 19th century. Three men (one English, one French and one German) decide to go on a journey around Europe. After they set out they have no money and no guide. They ask a shepherd to take them on the path. When they arrive they meet a woman who's an old acquaintance. They tell her that they're going to see a castle. She doesn't believe them. But after they tell her the castle, she decides to take the three men to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Lost World" is a very enjoyable movie.  The script is good, the acting is good and the special effects are top notch.    I have to say the only downside of the movie is the fact that it took the actors almost 2 years to come back.  I think that's a shame as this movie was very good, it had lots of action and it had a lot of humor.  But for the actors to have to wait 2 years for their return is very disappointing.  And of course this movie will be very hard to find, and is worth a watch at least once. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the way this movie is set up. It's a good looking movie, the music is pretty great, the acting is great, it's a really funny movie, it has some interesting ideas, it works well. I would recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys good old fashioned humor. I think the best part of this movie are the scenes when the boys are trying to save the world. I don't think it's any wonder that this movie has made so many other people laugh as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very nice little story about a lonely boy and a lonely little girl who lives with his grandmother and her cats in the forest. She lives with her cats who are really quite adorable. The girl is a bit of a tomboy and does not get along well with her sister. Her mom has a huge crush on her and sometimes gets jealous when he goes out and comes home. He also has a big crush on the girl but can't figure out why. But she is always in the background and he is usually the one doing the talking. The movie has a lot of comedy and is very well acted. The director is not a very good one and some of his choices are just plain stupid. But he is the best of the bunch. This is a good little movie to keep you amused.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was very funny, and I really enjoyed it.  I liked that it was not about some dumb superhero, but instead was about a hero who is just a guy who's out to get his wife back, and the other characters all had their own kind of quirky quirks.  As a side note, I just finished a movie about the famous Russian spy, Yevgeny Kuznetsov.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! It is the best version of "The Wizard of Oz" movie ever made. The voice of Judy Garland is so realistic, it makes you want to hug her and she is so beautiful. I have never seen such a realistic and beautiful movie, I have only seen the movie "The Muppet Movie" and "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" which are both much better than this movie. I also have seen the original "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ" movie, which is also a good version. The movie is funny and very entertaining. I think it is the first movie that will make you cry like a little girl. The only bad thing about the movie is the music and the story. The story is not interesting, I mean you know that it is about the boy and his adventures and it is done well, but I do not understand why they would make a story like that into a movie. Anyway, the movie has a good story and it was very fun to watch, it was also nice to hear Judy Garland. Overall a good experience!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad I saw this. I really liked it. It's a good thriller, but I thought it was just a little too slow. I also thought it did a good job of bringing us all the characters we're already familiar with and putting them in a situation where it was important to get to know them, so we can see how the world is really like. I think I like the characters the best, and I really wanted to see the world through their eyes.   I liked the suspense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is based on a novel by a French author (Joseph Conrad) and the story is based upon a man (Robert Duvall) who is a sailor and who finds himself on a mysterious ship (the Nautilus) on the high seas. He meets a pretty girl (Gloria Reuben) who falls in love with him. The movie is told in first person by DuvALL and he is very brave in the beginning and also in the end. The story of the movie is a bit odd, the main character (Robert) seems to have a bad case of seasickness, but there is a strong story at the end which is worth watching. I found the movie quite relaxing.     A couple of notes about the movie:      "The Nautiluses" is a film that is good to watch with a good, relaxing and somewhat romantic plot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is pretty simple. There's a killer who is looking for someone who murdered his family. The murderer doesn't take long to find out who the culprit is, but it's not enough to stop him from killing. The killer is very sadistic and doesn't hesitate to kill, and is very powerful, both mentally and physically. The movie is a pretty good watch and I recommend it to anyone who likes gore and action.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a pretty good movie, but the story is too simple to be good. The movie starts with a police officer (David Strathairn) and a killer (Everett McGill) trying to get rid of the body of the missing boy. But the body is a girl (Sarah) who was left in the woods by the murderer to be found. She is not dead but alive and she is very curious about the murderer. The police don't know who the murderer is and have no idea how to stop the murderer and the body. So they don't. There is a little twist at the end of the movie and it is a nice one. This is definitely a movie that I would recommend to anyone who is into mysteries. ___________  The movie is very well acted and very well made. The story is very simple and the movie is short at about 60 minutes. The action is good, especially the chase scene. The villain is really bad and the police are good, so they have to try to catch the killer. There are a lot of characters in the movie, and it's hard to get a sense of who is who. But what's there is very good. David Strathain is a good villain and the way he is written makes you want to see him get his comeuppance. The actors all do a good job and I really like the villain. The music in the movies is good as well. I like the song "You Are The Night" the best, and the song of the girl that was left alive is very sad. Overall, a good little mystery movie. _________________

I'd gotten a little older, but the good times had long since passed. It had been three days since I'd last seen my parents, and now I was home. I wasn't sad. I was just sad for not being able to spend any time with them.   I got to talking to my mother about the things I'd done. I hadn't been the same after my sister died. I still wanted to be a doctor. I couldn't get the nerve to try, though. I felt like a failure as a parent. I also felt guilty for not doing more to make her happy.  , I thought. I don't know what I'd do if I were her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to say if this film is good or not. It's got a decent story and a great soundtrack (which I found in this one is better than that of the first one), and the visuals are a little strange, but I still enjoyed it a lot. The plot isn't great, but it's not bad either.   I really liked the main character, she's a young girl who wants to go to the city to see her aunt. She has a bad habit of making people feel sorry for her and she's constantly making jokes and trying to make them feel better.   the story is a little slow at times and I felt that the pacing could have been a little better. It seemed that the characters are a bit too far away from each other at times, and it's a little hard to get attached to them, even when they are fighting the bad guy.  , a film that was directed by the great Yojimbo (not really an exaggeration). Yojimo had a lot of influence in the creation of this movie and the story follows that of that movie, but also features a lot more action than the first movie. The film is very violent and bloody, so if you like that sort of thing, I'd definitely recommend this one. I really enjoyed it and I think that a lot people should watch it too, so I'd recommend that people do! It's a great film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  I thought the story line was good. It was a very interesting movie about a kid who is forced to take a journey through the world of the mind. The characters were interesting. I liked the fact that we never found out what really happened in the beginning. I didn't know if it was a dream or a hallucination. I think that the ending was very well done. The bad:  The characters did not have much depth. They were a little too childish. It could have been better if it didn't have to be a kid. I don't know why he had to have his father killed. The ending was a bit odd. I would like to see a movie about an alien who goes around killing people. It would be great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a classic science fiction movie.  The plot is pretty straightforward: a planet that is dying from a meteor shower hits Earth and it's up to a small group of scientists and engineers to fix it.    It's a movie about the importance of science and engineering, and a lot of that is in the setting and in the characters.      I'll admit, I've seen a lot better science fiction movies.  There are a few good scenes in the film, but the plot doesn't really get going until about the second half of the movie.    The main problem with the movie is the dialogue.  The movie tries to be funny, but there are only a few funny lines.  I didn't mind the script at all.  It had all the hallmarks of the genre: space travel, aliens, and aliens trying to kill the astronauts.  They even use a famous sci-fi story from the 50s for the opening credits.  This was a movie that I'd love to see again.  (c) 1984 by Steven Spielberg

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a fun, action-packed, and good-looking movie that gives us a lot of great fight scenes. It's hard to describe this movie without sounding like a broken record, but let me try: a big corporation has hired an evil robot with the ability to turn any man into a woman. They want this because of its potential to be used in a variety of ways. To keep its usefulness, they've had to use a lot more male-to-female transformations. In one of the first scenes, a beautiful young woman is used to disguise a man as a woman to kill a rival. In the end, he has to get the better of the girl to make her realize she's not a man. I thought that was a nice twist.  The robot also has a girlfriend, who is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar.  She's a pretty girl who loves to sing, and she's pretty hot too. It seems like the movie is about a couple of guys who are looking for love and a girl who is looking for a good time. It does take a bit to get used to the plot, but once it does, you'll get a good laugh out of it.  The movie is full of action, with the fights having a good amount of blood, and the movie has a nice pace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Long Goodbye" is a great movie about a retired military man who travels back in time to fix his wrongs. His only hope of success is to befriend the man who destroyed his life, and find a way to get back at the man he betrayed. The film is not for everyone, but it is a nice film that is enjoyable, well-acted, and entertaining. I like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good old-fashioned western. I think it was a little too slow, but still a good time. There is a lot of dialogue and it is funny. The movie is very enjoyable. It is about a cowboy named Sam who runs into a man who tells him he is the most dangerous man on the West. But then a band of outlaws shows up and they want him for themselves. Written by John Flesch
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good, but it's a little bit boring, and the plot is quite simple. There are two guys who are both in love with the same girl, but both want her for different reasons. They have a couple of fights, and eventually the girl says she is getting married and wants to be with a man she really loves. After she says this, she goes out and is killed by a car. The man is angry and wants revenge. But he doesn't want to kill his friend who is also in love, so he does a lot of stupid things to try and save her. The movie was quite entertaining, but I wish they had done something a little different. The only thing that was annoying was the song they played on the car radio. It was pretty bad and had a strange tone to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A young boy goes to a small town in the middle of nowhere and the local people don't believe in any gods. So he asks a local blacksmith to forge a sword and the blacksmith gives him the blade. This is a good film that is enjoyable, and you have to see it. It has some good acting from young actors like Michael Keaton and Peter Boyle and a young voice cast. I am looking forward to the next film in this series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins with a mysterious figure (a very pretty, very attractive woman) walking down a dark hallway. It's her husband (or is he? I don't recall) who appears behind her at this point and it seems that she is going to kill him.   She does kill him (and by some sort of bizarre twist of fate, he is resurrected) but not before a rather unpleasant incident occurs (more on that later).   While the film is full of many wonderful scenes, the film's strengths are mostly in its characterization, especially its portrayal of a woman who has very little use for anyone except her own husband. She is cold, calculating and ruthless in her pursuit of power and wealth. She does not care about anyone or anything but her own needs and wants. She even shows a certain degree of love for her husband who has been a loyal, loving and supportive husband. There are some very strange things going on in this film and I don' think I could really say anything about it that would be useful to anyone. It has been done, though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few months back I was looking at the most recent episode of my favorite series. The title made me think of the movie 'Jungle Book' and the trailer made me want to see the movie. It took me a while to watch, but once I did I loved it. I was expecting a slow build-up with lots of action, but that was not the case. I thought there was a lot of potential for the film, but the story was weak and the acting was terrible. It was a fun movie, but not one I'd recommend to anybody.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ _______________________________________ I am very impressed with this film, which I thought was the funniest of the three. It is a good idea to get a group of people together and play a game where a person has to try to be the first to get into the shower and then have the rest of the group follow them in. So, you are all getting wet in the shower when someone comes in. He's very shy and awkward and you wonder how you'll ever get to know him. He gets in the showers with the rest and they all start trying to act like a shower. The more they act the more they get wet. It's so good I thought I had to put a rating in here. __________________________________________________________ _________________  Rated: 4 out of 5 by mary from good fun, silly and silly good fun. it's funny that people can be so shy when you're in a big group of guys. it was a lot of fun, i didn't think it was as funny as it was but it was fun. the story was funny and well acted. there was a good time. ______________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part of the movie is the ending.   I'm sure most people didn't care for the ending so much because the ending just didn't add anything new.  But it was the best part!   That's what I love about these movies.  There is always something new going on, so don't be surprised when something interesting is happening.  I'd like to point out that the ending wasn't really the end.  It just meant that the story continued!  It wasn't over, it wasn't finished, and it didn't have a happy ending. It was just a beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** The original The Terminator was a masterpiece of the genre, a science fiction masterpiece in the true sense of the word. The first half of the film is about a woman named Sarah Connor (Sylvia Plath) who is trying to escape from the city where she lives in order to try and help her mother (Judy Garland) who's been kidnapped by a group of crazed humans who are looking to use her for their own means. She makes her way to the ocean where she finds a pod of dolphins. She is taken to a facility where she meets with a man named John Connor (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who she saves. He tells her that the machines have awakened and that the humans are being hunted. They have to get the machines and help Sarah escape. They set out to find a secret underground tunnel and a cave to escape into. But soon the cave begins to collapse and they have to hide from the machines. Eventually Sarah finds the tunnel and they find a nuclear plant. Sarah uses her new found power to try to save the people there and save her mother. Sarah has a bad time and soon becomes the leader of a resistance against the machines who are destroying everything. ********************** After that it becomes very confusing to me. Why did Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in the original Terminator get killed off? It made no sense. Why didn't Arnold have to be killed off in the first place? They never explained why his character had to die. They never said why. There was a lot of confusion in the movie. ************* It's hard to describe this movie because it's so strange. I don't know how it happened. I had never seen a movie that looked so real. It was very odd and very strange. *********
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is not a bad movie but it is not good either. It is the kind of movie that makes you feel bad when you watch it. There are some really nice scenes and good acting, but it seems that the writers just got bored with the subject matter and decided to make something like the latest "Happily Ever After" movie. I am not going to say that I did not enjoy it at all. The film is about a man named Bill (Michael Keaton), who is in a wheelchair. He has two sons and a wife (Rosie O'Donnell). Bill's wife has a very bad habit of forgetting her keys and she often forgets the time and place she has to go. Bill is so angry that he decides to try and find his wife by going to the police station. Bill and his two sons go to the station and they tell the officers that they have been searching all over the place and they cannot find their mother. The officer who has been assigned to the case is so sure that Bill and the sons are lying about the location that he asks the boys to show him where they have left the keys. Bill shows the officer the same location and the officer then gives the boys a choice: they can leave the keys at the station or they can return them to Bill and then they can find their mom. The boys take the keys and go back to Bill. However, before they can get back to him, they have to make a decision about who they want to stay with: Bill or his wife. They both want to leave the place because Bill is not the same as his former self. They decide that they are going to stay together. As the film comes to a close, we learn that Bill is still looking for his wife, and the movie ends with him going back to the house that he lives in and waiting for her to come home. It all ends in the way it does because the movie is over and there is no resolution to the film. The only thing that I think is worth mentioning is that Michael Keaton plays the role of Bill well. He does not come across as a bad guy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The film is a very good thriller. I was watching it for a friend who is not a fan of thrillers. I would not go as far as to call it a bad film but it is not what it was intended to be. I can see how this film was made, it was made in England and in the 60's and it is a bit dated, I do not think it will have the same effect as the others but the idea is good and the cast are very good, I enjoyed it. I give it a 4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, like a great novel, has a very clear point of view. There are no special effects. The characters are the same ones you've seen in countless other movies. The action is not especially thrilling, but it is pretty entertaining.   The ending is very sad and the ending is a bit of a spoiler. But this movie is a must-see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie a fun watch and I did enjoy the whole thing. The story of a man who wants to be a hero and to fight evil. The movie has the feel of a classic and is quite enjoyable.   It's a little hard to tell but you will find a lot of references to other films and also to comic books and cartoons. I did like the fact that the movie didn't seem to be based on a comic book or cartoon but a real movie and I found that quite refreshing.  .  The story is not really told from a storyteller's point of view and so you have a chance to see this movie from a different point of View. I found this to be an enjoyable movie to watch and the story is quite simple yet the movie is quite funny. I liked the way it played out.  ,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been a big fan of the Twilight movies since they first aired in the late nineties.   The first one was one of the best films of the decade and this one is no different.  The movie starts off a bit slow, but that soon changes as the action starts to heat up and the suspense builds.  After that it is pretty much the same story.  A vampire has come into the house of a rich family who have been living in the woods for a very long time.  But this vampire is more than a simple vampire.  He is a vampire who has a very evil side to him.  When he comes home the family is not happy to see him, but it quickly turns into an angry vampire who is very angry at the family and at his new home.  There are plenty of action scenes to keep you on the edge of your seat and I can't wait to see how things turn out.  I think the best thing about this movie is that it's the only movie where the main character is a woman.  If you are a fan of this movie then you will probably love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Carnivalesque is a fun romp that takes place in a small Mexican town.  This town is dominated by two families.    The first is headed by the ruthless Elvira (Maria Isabel) and the second is headed up by her daughter, Isabel.  The story follows their relationship as they try to survive in the rough terrain and the many obstacles in their way.  And it does a good job of it too.  The story is a good one.  I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie.  For those who haven't seen the movie, here's a synopsis:   A woman's best friend and her father have gone missing in the woods, and the daughter of the woman's friend has been kidnapped.  As they go to find them, they must deal with a mysterious stranger who has a strange connection to them all.  It's a fun movie and if you are a fan of movies like this, you'll enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all: An excellent action movie. The first half of the movie is just a great example of how the best of the best are able to create awesome action scenes in a low budget movie. If you enjoy action, this is a must see.   And the action scene:   We get the first half action sequence. It's pretty standard stuff with lots of explosions, lots of crazy gun battles, lots and lots of destruction. The only thing that seems out of place is the inclusion of an armored car chase and a bunch of helicopters. The helicopter chase was very well done but a bit boring to watch. I don't really understand why they added a helicopter chase but a couple of scenes after that didn't feel quite right. The ending is pretty standard. But that's fine.   is there any more to say about this movie:  - The action is pretty good   - The special effects are pretty good  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    We start off on a beautiful beach, and then the next scene we are in a small shack, and this is where we find out that the protagonist is a little girl who has been kidnapped by a man who lives in the woods and is trying to find her. This man is a bad dude, he is a very mean man, but at the same time he is good at what he does. He is trying, but he just can't get his hands on the girl. The girl is pretty young, and she is very innocent and innocent-looking, but there is something evil about her, and the bad guy in the forest is a master of disguise. The bad guy has been a hunter in the past and has a certain knack for making people think they are dead when they are not. He also can use magic, and he uses magic to create a lot of pain and suffering. So this guy, who is evil and wants to kill the girl, gets into a fight with the bad man. This is where the movie begins to get a little bit dark, and there is a lot that goes on in the first act, but the second act is the most intense part of the movie.   And it gets even darker, when the girl is found, and when she is put into a dungeon. The villain, who has made a deal with the evil witch who lives there, and is also a bad guy, is there to watch over the girl who is his slave. He knows he can't really do much to the girl because the girl has magic, so he is more than willing to give up his life for the girl's freedom.  The girl is put in a dungeon, and we get to see her naked, and see her tortured and tortured by this evil guy.  But this movie is not a movie about bad guys. This movie is about the little girl and her friend, and her father and his bad ass of a daughter.  And we also get to watch this little girl's mother, who does a lot more in this movie than her daughter does, and I am not sure I would have done anything differently if I had seen this movie. Her character is very funny and you root for her as she tries to get revenge on the bad guys who have captured her daughter. It is a really good movie that is really hard to watch, but you will be glad you did.

There's a woman in a van who knows who he is and she wants him back.  She's been searching for him ever since he left.  And this is the first time she sees him since he disappeared.  I love this movie.  Sure, it's a short film but it's good.  In the first 10 minutes you can see the style, the way they were doing it and I was hooked.  But this is a short story and in the end, it doesn't mean much.  They only had about 10 minutes to show the film and the ending is pretty weak.  Maybe it's because of the length, but it didn't really make me laugh.  You should try it, it will make you smile. ______________________________________ __________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ The Girl in the Van is a good short film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is about a high school senior (Ricky Schroder) who is in love with a girl (Maddie Ziegler) at his school. After a few days, he gets back from a visit to the beach. After leaving the house, he sees a girl named Maddie. She runs out of the house and onto the beach, but before she gets there, the waves take her away. She goes to the school to ask for a ride to the shore. He is reluctant to give it to her. After that, Maddie leaves the beach and gets lost. After looking for her for a while, he realizes that she has been taken into the sea. He gets on the boat and tries to find her. He makes it to the edge of the sea and finds her, but she is gone.  There are many moments of suspense as the boy tries to figure out how she has managed to get out of his reach. There are a few things that the movie does well: the characters are well written and have a depth to them that the filmmakers can show without showing them in a particularly horrible way; they do a good job of showing how the effects of the environment can have an effect on the characters; and, there are some nice moments of comedy.  I enjoyed the movie:     The film is a good horror movie. It's not an especially scary movie, but it's a fun one. The story is a nice one and it is easy to follow. It has a nice tone to it and is very well-paced. It is a fairly long film, so it isn't the most exciting of movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, no doubt about that. I'm not sure how many people will see this, but if you like movies about people trying to escape a Nazi-dominated America in a train, you should watch this. The story is simple: an American, a Holocaust survivor, has been assigned to the German train. A train of Nazis who are trying to find and kill American soldiers on the train. We learn that the Nazi train is a real train. The train has a real driver who knows the way. The driver also has a brother who is the head of a secret Nazi organization. The American is an idealist. He believes in the idealism that he is going to stand up to the Nazis. The Nazis are trying desperately to get rid of him. The Nazi-American fight has all the intensity of a movie like "Casablanca". You get a good idea of why the Nazis are so intent on killing him. But this movie has so much more. It has a great script. It was written by Richard Lester and Charles MacArthur. It is a good script that is based on real events. It deals with themes that I think are relevant in our day. It's a story about the human spirit and how it is a weapon and a means of survival. It really shows the way in which evil can take over a country if there is no will to fight it. I really liked this movie. It reminded me of a John Frankenheimer movie. If you like John Frankenheimers and you like action, you will like this movie very much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really excited to see this one come out. I was watching it the other day with a friend. It was about two high school boys (I think they were both 14-15?) that live in an abandoned shack in the woods. The two of them are obsessed with their dead best friend who they think is the reincarnation of the great Jack The Ripper. They go out and get their best friend to tell them if he was ever really murdered. It's an extremely interesting movie with a creepy soundtrack and a good story. The whole movie is really strange and weird. It is a great movie that will leave you thinking and maybe have you feeling a little strange as well. It would be nice to see a remake of this movie in the future. I think it would be a great way to add more to the "Jack The Rippers" franchise.

It was pretty decent.  There was a little bit of gore and some very well done effects.  If you like a good old fashioned horror film then give this one a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love sci-fi or just have a big imagination then this is for you.   The story follows a space-journey of a scientist who, having made a breakthrough in space travel, goes to the planet "Al-Om", where he is to find a way to stop the impending destruction of earth by an alien species called the Ommi.  A story which is completely in space and totally in science fiction, the film also has a fantastic soundtrack.  There are many things to be said about this movie and I think that you can find out all about it if you watch it.  The movie was made in 1970 and released in 1973.  I was in my second year of secondary school when I saw the movie, and it was the best thing I had seen at that time.  This was not a very popular movie at the time and was a commercial failure at the box office.  If it had been successful I think it would have been one of the great sci- fi movies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last weekend of July in Montreal is one of my favourite weeks.  I like to visit this place to get a taste of old Montreal, the streets, the bars and the beautiful Mont-Royal Park.  I have been to this place many times, but never knew how many people were out there.  The restaurant, the bar and the street are all in one area.  This is a good place to come if you are in the area and want a good meal and good drink.  You will find the best people out there, the best music and the best atmosphere.  I am looking forward to visiting the place again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Rock" is a great movie.  It is a story of a good guy who finds himself in a bad place.    He ends up in a prison camp where he finds out a lot of people are good guys.    In the prison camp, there is a lot about "The Rock."   The Rock has a big belly and a bad case of "The King's Men".   He can't tell a good story.  The guy doesn't know how to keep a man down.  There is no love in his life.  And he has a lot on his mind.  The story is very entertaining.  It has a great script by a good writer.  This movie is well made and has great production values.  If you have the time to sit and watch this movie, it is worth your time.  I give this movie a rating of 8 out of 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I thought the first few minutes of this movie were great, a little silly but also really fun. It was definitely a movie I didn't want to end. Â It is not a movie that is all about the action, but there is a lot of it, and it is a good action movie.  I think that if you liked the first movie you will like this one.  The movie has a good amount of action and you will definitely like it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a woman who takes a job at a brothel. The owner of the brothel is a strange character. He doesn't seem to be that interested in sex, but instead just likes to show off and get everyone to think that he is a rich guy. He is very rude and doesn't want to talk about his job. The woman, who works for him, is nice enough but she is not that good. The guy, who is the boss, is more fun. He likes to flirt and is not afraid to show his body to her. He has an interesting character and his character is very unique.    Director:  James Franco (2007) Cast: James Franco, Mandy Moore, Kevin Spacey, Robert De Niro, Michael Shannon, Ed Harris, Steve Buscemi
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The film's title is derived from a line in a famous poem from the poet and playwright Edgar Allan Poe: "It's a pity a man can't have his cake and eat it too". "It" in this case is the character of Thomas Harris and the place he is set in, the small town of Derry. This is a very well written and well acted movie, and a very enjoyable one. The performances are all very good and the script is a great blend of dark humor and mystery. "It is a long time ago since I saw a movie that made me want to do the unthinkable: murder a man I had been on the fence about. It took me a few minutes to decide, but I knew I had to watch this. And I can't say enough good things about this movie: it is so much fun.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film! I was excited to see a black and white film about the legendary 'Moses' because it's been a while since I've seen one. I'm not sure if this is the best of the 'Mose' films, but I'm glad I saw it. The acting was fantastic. I love when actors don't even need a line to tell a story. I loved that about the film. I thought the story was very interesting. I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes black and whites. The score by John Williams was superb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. The acting was great and we got to see our favorite characters. The script was a good idea.   I enjoyed the fact that this movie was a spoof on the 70's action movie and the way the people in it looked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a fan of old-school comedy, then this is a must-see. It's a comedy from the early 90s that has aged well, and that's not a bad thing at all. There are a few funny moments, and the characters are all unique and have a distinct voice. It was very hard to get through this movie, especially as I was expecting a lot more than what I got.  I would say this movie was an 80s comedy/drama that was filmed in the 80s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The film starts off as a story of a young man who had just moved to New York City and was looking for a job. He was introduced to a fellow who worked at a department store and he wanted to know how the job was done. The two were introduced to one another and quickly began to date. Things were not going well for them at first. She would not have sex with him for some time. The job she was trying to get was to make up for a previous job she had in which she was murdered. Her murderer was never caught. They moved to a large apartment building and started to have sex regularly. This is when things started to go badly wrong for her. She started to get a bad feeling about her new boyfriend. The feelings were mutual and she began to fear for her life. The apartment complex owner was the one to get involved in the case. He had seen her moving around the apartment building with a man in a hood. He asked her to meet him. They met in a darkened alley. He killed her and then he took a picture of her corpse. The man was never brought to justice. The police are also unhelpful. They have no leads on the case and they are unable to do much about it. One of the cops who is investigating the case is the only person who has any information. He gets very involved in this case and soon becomes the only one who can help. He tries to solve the case, but is quickly put off by the police. His only hope is that a mysterious man known only as "the Red" will tell him what happened. The Red is actually a woman. She is the one who was killed and the killer is still at large. The movie does not take long to get going and it is a fast paced thriller. The story moves along at a good pace and the suspense is kept up. The acting is good and the movie is a good watch. There is a great ending and a nice surprise for the audience. This movie is worth seeing and you can't go wrong with it. ___________ Summary: _____ The Red has been sent to NewYork to solve a murder case.

When she gets bored he throws a stone at the doll and the girl becomes a girl.  When she tells her mother what happened, the mother says she will never know, because the doll doesn't speak.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was born and raised in Michigan, and as far as I'm concerned, it was a great place to live. I grew up with a dad who was a World War II vet, and a mom who ran a small business that made a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. That's right, peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, and in my town they were really good. I was raised in a very religious household, and we always did something to make the week end special. Every year we had a huge family gathering, and every year my dad made a "big" sandwich, that's the kind he would take me to. I can still remember the smell of the peanut butter, the taste of the jelly and the sweetness of the gravy. It was a sandwich that you would want to share with the whole family. In fact, it made its way into my "favorite things to eat" list. That was until I discovered the secret ingredient. In my opinion, the secret was not the peanut but the peanut oil. I remember the day I discovered this delicious secret ingredient I was so excited that I could hardly sleep. I ate it with all of my family and friends, and it was great. Then I started trying it out on my family as well. I started to wonder if it would taste good on other sandwiches as well, so I began experimenting with different kinds of sandwiches. It's been years since I've tried it, and my family still loves it, even after all these years.  I was just about to order another sandwich when I noticed a sign that read "SOUTH BEND HAD A BOMB THURSDAY". I don't know what it is about this town, but they seem to have a lot of strange happenings in the area.  It wasn't until later that I realized it was actually the Bomb.  I went to the grocery store to get some milk and cream. When I got back, I noticed the dairy section was a total mess.   There was a milk carton on top of another milk cartON top of a milk can.  It looked like someone had smashed a couple of milk cartons together, and then used a milk bottle to get the milk from one carton to the other.  I thought it was kind of strange, so when I returned to my apartment, I decided to do a little investigating.  When I walked into my apartment I found out that the front door

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this one a few times now. I was only a little kid at the time. It's an adaptation of the book by E.L. Doctorow, and I have to say that Doctorow has some good ideas. I remember when I read the first few chapters I was very bored, but that changed. It was just so good. I'm not sure why, but I remember that this was the only movie I ever saw with a live band. It reminded me of a movie like " The Dark Crystal ". That is one of the few good movies I have ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My only real complaint about the film is that the soundtrack is all electronic music. I really don't care for electronic music (as the name implies) but I can understand the appeal of the style, and it can certainly help a film when it needs it. However, I can't really tell if the movie uses this music as a way of drawing out the atmosphere, or if it's just there because the movie was shot in a warehouse with only a couple of monitors. I'm not going to say that the movie has a bad score, because it does have one, and its not bad. I just don't like it. I guess it was necessary because it's the only electronic soundtrack in the movie. I'd rather have a good score, than a bad one. But, even if the soundtrack didn't work for me, it still does. I mean, it works for the movie itself, but it's a shame that the only place the score is used is in the background. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a mix of a horror movie, a thriller and a war movie. The thriller is a real gem and is worth seeing. The director, Stephen Hopkins, made a film that is worth your time. It is a true crime story, that will haunt you forever.

The story is not all that complex, and the ending is quite predictable, but it is a good story, and I like the way it ends.   I like it!   I really like the fact that it is based on a true story, which made me feel bad for the main character. I think the ending was too predictable, and this makes me not want to see it again.  The film does not have a lot of action and it has a very simple story, but this is why I like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not hard to find out that the writer/director, Michael Apted is a great one.  The movie is a masterpiece, it is a classic, and is one of the greatest films of all time.    The plot is the same as the one in the book, but it is much more interesting, because there are so many different characters to be found, and the movie has more of an epic feel to it.  In the end it is just a good, entertaining movie, and there is not a bad line in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the first movie I've seen in which you can see the true power of cinema in a short time. The story is simple: Two people, one who is suffering from an illness and the other who is a doctor who has the same disease, travel to a country where the people don't have a common disease. It's hard for the people to understand each other and even harder for them to accept the disease and the doctor. They travel to the country with a plan to cure the doctor and to get his help in finding the cure. It is a short movie but the story is very powerful.   The soundtrack was nice, I think the music is not very deep and it's not very colorful. But the music itself was very nice and I think this is one of the movies that the music has to be great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of Michael Bay, and I can't say that this movie is not worthy of his signature style. If you are a fan of the Michael Bay movies and want to see something different, you should see this one. This is a fun movie, and it is pretty well done. If there is anything that bothers me is the fact that we have two versions of the film. One that is presented on DVD and one that is in theaters. The DVD is a good looking version. It is the same footage, but the colors and the frame rate are different. There are some other minor problems, but nothing that is hard to ignore. This movie is worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's like a very good, yet still quite good, sequel to a very popular TV show, which was itself a sequel to one of the better films, in the "Masters of Horror" series: "Cabin Fever"  I'm not going to say much about the movie: it's still one of my favorite movies of all time, I loved the movie, and I love the series, and it's a shame that it didn't get a remake. The movie is set in a house where the only occupants are a little girl and her little sister, they both have a sick father and they're pretty sick too, I liked how the mother and the daughter got together and that they have a great relationship.  The mother and daughter are just wonderful together!  There's a great twist at the end that I enjoyed a lot: it wasn't about the mother dying, it was about the daughter going through her own illness and having to deal with it.  This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again, just like I will rewatch "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie a few times and I still love it. It is a story about a guy who finds himself in a strange world where the inhabitants are all people who have died, and are being reincarnated as animals, plants and insects. His name is Renton, and he is the last living human who has survived the planet's destruction. He has been on this planet for centuries and has lived his entire life there, until the Earth was destroyed. This movie is a love story that follows Renton and his dog, Finn, as they attempt to find a way back home to Earth. There is no way for Renton to get back on his planet, so he has to find another way.   It is not a good story, it is a tragic story. It shows how even the smallest and most harmless things can bring death to anyone, even animals. It gives a look into a world where everything seems to be against Renton. He doesn't seem to fit in with the other people and he does not seem to be a bad guy. He is just a guy that has lived so long that he doesn't understand what is happening around him. He also has a terrible memory. It seems that he is being told stories all the time and it is hard for him to remember the events of the movie. He does seem to have a good heart though.  , and I really loved it. I also loved the idea that the story is a true story. This is a movie about a person trying to find out what he has done to bring about his own death. He learns that he was the one who destroyed the planet and that the death is a part of life. It also has the same feel as "Patton".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best film I've seen this year is The Last Exorcism Part II. I'm not saying it's better than The Exorcist Part III, but it's certainly a better film. I've already reviewed The Last Day of the Exorcists, so I'm going to keep this short. I love The Last Days of the Last Ex-Osc, it's an odd film with a very weird plot. It's a strange film about a little girl and her brother who were born into a Catholic family that went on a trip to the occult. I like the little girl, she's cute and silly. I think it's sad that The Last Time I Saw Her was released after this. I loved it. I don't know why, it may be because it's so much funnier than the rest of the films I've watched this year. This is the best film this year, and I'm glad that it came out this year as well. I wish there was more like it. The Last Days Of The Last Evangelist Part II  - 5/5  (90% Rotten Tomatoes)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a group of high school students who find a way to escape a horrible world and its people. The world is a twisted place where people are judged and given the world. It's not just about a few people who can't help but try to get out of this horrible place, but it's about the world itself. The people there have no morals or conscience. There are no rules. And you don't even have to look hard to find a bad guy. It makes you wonder if this could ever exist in our world.   I like this movie. It was a great movie. I was not a huge fan of the first film but this one is much better. This film was much better than the first and I think I would give it a good rating. The story is much more interesting than the other two films. It has an interesting plot and the characters are a lot more interesting. The acting is really good. I also liked the music. The song at the end is good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this movie is about a group of men who are having a party and a woman (who is not even related to the group) comes in and tries to get them to have sex with her. She gets drunk, is trying to flirt with them, and gets them all in trouble. She starts hitting on the man that is the most popular one, who then proceeds to get into a fight with another man who had gotten in a fight earlier. This is when the movie turns to the first half where we find out that this is not a normal party at all. The men are not just having a night out but they are having sex with a woman who is a relative of one of them. The man that has the most sex is the guy that has gotten in the most fights in the past. This movie is very funny. The humor in this movie makes me laugh out loud. I thought it was so funny that I kept looking forward to the next part.   I gave this movie a 7.5 out of 10.

She was very attractive and it made me very curious as to what she was like.  I remember she had a big breast and a very sexy face.  This movie has made my life, because it is the best movie I have ever seen.  It is a classic in its way, as well as in the way it portrays the world and human nature.  One thing I must warn you about, this movie is a bit too long at 5 hours.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A couple of years ago, I stumbled across a movie that had me hooked, and I was determined to find out who the hell this mysterious and enigmatic man was and where the hell he came from. I'm going to start with a confession. I've never watched a horror movie before. I found that out right away when I saw the opening credits of the movie. Then the movie went on to be a little too scary for my liking. Then after the first half hour or so, I got bored with the movie, and went into my room and started reading. I came to a point in the story where the narrator started telling me the story of a man who is looking for a way to make it out of a world where the supernatural is a part of daily life. This man has a lot of psychic abilities and a very unique and unique ability to see things. He has no knowledge of how to control his abilities. So he's on a quest to find a way out of this hell that he's trapped in. So, you can see where I'm getting at. But then there is this other man, who is trying to get to this man and help him get out of the hell that the two of them are in. He's kind of a coward and is just trying to save his own life. He is also a good guy who has a love for animals and is really good at his job. The two of these characters have a lot in common. They both are kind of naive, and they both have a good heart, and have a great sense of adventure. But, the story gets much more interesting when the narrator tells the story. It starts off at a very bad place. The narrator is stuck in a small town, and he's been there since he was born. So a lot about him is set in the past. Then, one day, the narrator is in his car when he hears a very strange noise, and looks out the window to see a figure that is very similar to the one he sees in the movie on the movie screen. The figure seems to be dancing and making strange sounds, and the narrator starts hearing the sounds too. This is all that is left of a long dead vampire. So the two men are trapped in this town with no way out, and no way to stop the man from taking over their bodies. At this point, I was hooked. I didn't really know what to think about this movie, so I watched
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the movie, and I don't think it's a bad movie at all. The acting was good, the acting was very good, I liked the movie very much. The movie is set in New York City, and it is a nice place to live. There are many wonderful restaurants and shops here, which is a good thing. The best part of the movie is the romance between the main character and the beautiful female who lives on the other side of the street. There is a lot of sex in this movie, which I enjoyed very much, and the movie could have been a lot more. I'm sure the movie would have been even better if it had been about a woman who had a child with a man, but it was about a guy who got a girlfriend, so that was okay.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is the epitome of a good bad movie.  I can't imagine a better way to introduce a new character to the film world.    I can't wait to see what else they have planned for this character.  Overall:     I gave this a 3 out of 5 stars because I didn't like it very much.    If you're going to make a horror movie then you should be able to get a decent story out of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ (7/10)I saw this movie on a dare, which means I got a pretty good idea of what to expect. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. The movie is about a man named John (Jason Bateman) who is a little eccentric, which seems to be a recurring theme in his films. John is the head of a local club that performs at the local gay bar. He likes to perform his own version of a drag show, which involves him, his wife, and a girl called Jackie. Jackie is the one who keeps reminding John that he's not the real John. The story begins when John's friend John (James Caan) arrives at the club and sees the girl performing, and decides to come along. Things get more complicated when Jackie starts acting more and more like a woman, and things get even more complicated because John's wife (Kate Winslet) is also becoming more and less like a man. This is an odd mix of all of the elements I enjoy in a movie: funny, quirky, and silly. Bateman is good in this film, but I wish the film was a little more self-aware about its own silliness. I'm not a huge fan of gay comedy, and I think this movie would have been better off with a little less gayness. It doesn't seem like the movie is really trying to be funny at all, and even when things are getting silly, the jokes are either very obvious or overplayed. But this is a fun movie with a lot of heart. I wouldn't say I like this movie as much now as I liked it then, but it's still a good watch and I recommend it to anyone who likes good gay comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film about a man who is forced to work as a guard in a prison. This man has been through a lot and is quite a tough one. He has to keep a group of inmates out of the jail and out of trouble.   In a strange turn of events, the film ends with a scene where the inmates are in the middle of a fight. The inmates are all wearing their prison uniforms. It looks like they have all been through some serious trouble in their lives and this is the first time they are in a fight since their arrival.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never read a better science fiction novel. In the novel there is a whole world, and a whole system of things, and it is a system that operates in an extremely logical way. In fact, you might even say that the entire novel is logical. The novel takes place in a futuristic world in which there are no humans. There are no plants or animals, and there are absolutely no rocks or minerals. There is no time. There really is no such thing as time. But, there are other things that time does take, and we see them in the novel. It is an amazingly vivid and well-written novel. The author does a marvelous job of describing a world that is so different from our own, yet so familiar.   There are a number of themes in the book, such as the relationship between science and religion. The relationship between technology and religion is explored in a number different ways. The book also deals with the relationship of people to machines.  The world of the novel is quite interesting, with a number characters that you can really get to know. It does not take long for you to figure out who is who. And the book is a good example of how one should take a look at a world before jumping into a science fiction book. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all fairness I must admit I was not all that impressed by this movie, I didn't really feel like a hero either, I was a bit annoyed by the plot, but then again it could be said that it was written like a thriller, and a good one at that, however I must say that it's not exactly my cup of tea either, but that's just my opinion and I would have to agree with it.   This movie is probably the best one you will see in a while, and it's a good thing too, as I feel it's one of the better films made in the 80's, and one of those films that deserves to be seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I would like to thank David Lynch and the crew for the fantastic and unique work they did on this film. It is so much more than what we were given in the synopsis of this movie. It was a great surprise to me when I found out the story is about a man who wants to travel back in time and meet his father. I'm a fan of David Lynch so I was very intrigued. I loved the film so much that I watched it twice. Once in theaters I was so happy with the movie that I wanted to go back to the theater and watch it again.   This movie is a great blend of comedy, suspense, mystery, and emotion. I think it is one of the best of the year. I can't wait for the DVD release!   The only thing I would change is the ending. The ending was so unbelievable that I was just waiting for the end credits to roll! It was so much better if we saw the whole movie first.   of course I'm just a fan and I'm glad the film got a great reception.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a good film.  There are only about four good scenes in it, and there are plenty of bad ones.    There are no great moments in this film. There are only two scenes that I like: the first one is when the police officer goes into the house and is searching for a woman, but the woman in the house doesn't look like a woman at all.  She has long blond hair, a very large, very dark, very heavy body, and a very tight outfit.  I also like the scene where the mother, who has just had a baby, tries to explain to the officer that she doesn't have any money and doesn't know where her daughter is.     The rest of the film is not much better.  The acting is pretty bad.  It's not that bad.    The other two bad scenes in the film are when the father and daughter are searching for the girl and the police come and they both run away.  When the daughter runs to get away from the father, he shoots her in the head and then she falls to the floor dead.  When the daughter tries to get up, the father shoots her again in the face.  He's only trying to kill the daughter because she looks like her.  That's about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is the story of an unnamed teenage girl who lives in a small town with her father and brother. Her father is a police detective and she loves him very much. One day her brother, an officer, is accused of a murder. This causes her to leave the town and live with her uncle. Her uncle is a very sad and bitter man. He doesn't get along well with his father. She becomes a good friend of the uncle and helps him in solving the murder of the policeman. She learns that the murderer is her uncle's ex-girlfriend, a very beautiful girl. She also finds out that she can hear the dead bodies of the murdered people. There is a secret society of people that are able to hear the voices of dead people and the voices are all different. She begins to hear voices that belong to someone that she doesn't know. She soon learns that these people are not who they say they are. She knows that there is a conspiracy and that she must find out what it is. There are many good scenes in this movie. I found the ending to be very interesting.   There are a few bad scenes, but nothing that is too terrible. Overall, this is a good horror movie and I highly recommend it. I give this a 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Gothic" is a good film, although the first half is the weakest. The story is not very original, and the characters are not very well developed. There are a few interesting elements, but most of the story is about an old lady and her grandson. The grandson is a very smart boy, and he is the only character that is very likable. The old lady is not. Her mind is a bit cloudy, and her body is old and weak. She wants to stay in the house, but her grandson is determined to go out and see the world. The film is mostly about the old lady, and how she keeps her home and family alive.   The second half of the film is much better. It is a nice film with many interesting elements. I have always been interested in the characters and their interactions. The scenes with the old woman and her granddaughter are especially well done.   The performances are all quite good. The young actor, James Cromwell is quite good as the grandson. I wish I had seen this film earlier, because it is so much better than I remembered it. It has an unusual look and feel about it, and is very different from anything I have seen before. It deserves to be seen by all, but if you are only going to see one film from this list, it is this one.

If you like westerns or western movies and you like action, then you will like this movie!   I think it is good because the film is action packed.    The gun fights are great.  The gun fighting is very good.  The movie is about a man named Paul Kersey who gets caught in a battle between the Indians and the British and they fight for days and days and finally they run out of ammunition and he gets captured.  He is taken back to the camp and they are worried about his safety.  They bring him food and water and he is told to lie down and not to tell them anything about what he is doing.  Paul tells them that he is going to kill them all, but his horse is not good and he needs more water.  When he starts to drink water he falls and they get worried about him and he begins to run away.  But then he runs into a young girl and she is named Annie and he tells her that he has killed all the Indians.  Annie says that they are the bad ones and Paul tells her to go and look for a good horse and then they will all be dead.  She goes back to look and the Indians come out to fight.  At first they are not too bad and Annie gets some arrows and the Indian leader is killed.  Then she starts to run but the Indians catch her and kill her.  So Paul kills the rest of them and the movie ends.  This movie is fun and I think that it is a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this film because of a recommendation from my father. My father is a fan of movies that take a few cues from the classic adventure genre. This film has some good ideas, but they're not executed in a way that makes me interested in seeing it again. I liked the plot and I liked a lot of the characters. I have to wonder how much I'd like this film had it been made in the 1970's instead of in the 1950's.

My only complaint about the movie is the way the characters are portrayed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a very hard time watching the movie as the dialogue was very repetitive. The plot was rather interesting as we got to see the whole story from the point of view of the young boy who was born and raised in an orphanage and was saved by a mysterious old woman who was called the Mother of God. After the mysterious old women disappeared, the boy who had been brought up by the old woman grew up and came to the United States. The boy decided to take up a job as a laborer in a coal mine and found that the working conditions were very bad. One day, the coal mine was robbed by a gang of robbers who took a large sum of money and the coal from the mine. The child was able to escape from the coal pit and started to run through the streets looking for the robbers. He was successful and got hold of one of the robbers and killed him. When the boy was about to give the stolen money back to the gang, he saw that they were all dead and that the only person alive was the Mother who was waiting for him at the bank. The bank was robbed at gunpoint and the money was missing. The Mother of the boy went back to her home where she was waiting in a car for a ride back to California. She had to wait and watch as the boy ran through the city, trying to find her. After waiting for over two hours, the Mother finally found the boy and took him to the hospital to be checked for gunshot wounds. When she got to the place where the robbers were hiding, she was surprised to see that there was no money in the robbery, and she did not know what to do. She decided to use the boy as a human shield to protect her, so the boy would not get killed by the robbers but would not be able to leave the hospital either. The mother was successful in her mission and the boy survived the robbers attack. The robbers were not successful in their mission and were only able to take a small sum of the money. The hospital was attacked by a bunch of robbers, but the Mother was able take the guns from them. The Doctor, who had examined the boy, told the mother that the boy had a bullet lodged in his brain and that he would die if the bullet was removed. The doctors told the Mother that if she did as he suggested, the bullet would not kill the boy. The doctor also told her that the bullet could be removed by putting a tiny amount of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion, this is one of the best horror movies ever made, I can not say that about all horror movies (some of the most memorable ones) but this movie has a really good sense of humor, that is a real plus. It's a good film that will make you laugh and cry, and that's what a horror movie is supposed to do. It has some nice gore scenes but the violence is not overdone, which makes the movie more like a classic horror film. The acting is great, with an all-star cast including Michael Biehn and Carrie-Anne Moss. The cinematography is great and the editing is done really well, and the soundtrack is good too.  I don't really know what else to say, but if you like a good, scary movie with a good sense humor and a nice soundtrack, this one is for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to say that I really enjoyed this movie and I enjoyed it even more with a few hours of sleep before the next screening.   I will post a few things that made this movie a little special for me.  First, there are two very distinct and interesting cultures that live together on the island: the Shona and the Lefan.  I was not really sure which culture I should be focusing on during this movie.  When the Lufan first show up, they are really aggressive and aggressive.  However, after some time, the Lofan grow to respect and even admire the Shonas.  The only thing that is very different between the L- and the S- is the Lhian.  After a while, the Shonsas and the Shontas begin to live together peacefully.  In the end, the people of the island are all happy to live there.  It's just the first day, but they already have a different culture than the Ldfan.     So, I really liked this movie, but I was a little disappointed with the ending.  There was not much suspense at all.  And the ending left a little bad taste in my mouth.  This was probably my least favorite movie of the year.  Posted by Mark at 3:50 AM

I've never been able to put my finger on what is wrong with this performance. It's like a guy trying to play the guitar by holding his arm up and pointing at it. It isn't even a good performance. The writing is great, but it really is a bad acting job. I don't know what's wrong with it, but if they had a good acting coach they could have turned it around.

I wish they made more of the story because it is about time the US did something about the problem. It is not good to hear about how our kids are doing in school, and how bad things are in America. The ending is not very happy, but I think that is the point. The story is about a boy that is trying to get to the end of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at a movie with a group of my friends the other night. The movie was about a guy named John who was born a witch and when he turned 11, he was found with a bunch of dead babies and a witch named Gee. John went to school with Gee's husband and they were good friends. John was also good friends with a girl named Nellie and Gee was in love with him. They all went out to the big city and they went to the theater and John met a girl called Betty who was a dancer. When they went back to her apartment, she had a very ugly old cat named Mooch. When Betty went to bed, Nell and John's parents were watching a movie and the old cat attacked Betty. John came home and told his parents that a ghost was attacking a girl and they called in the police. When the police arrived, they found the cat was still alive and it was still attacking Betty. The police then had to use a tranquilizer gun on it to get it to stop. They tried to shoot the cat and then they tried to tranquilize it. The cat got away from them and went into a big old tree. The next day, John and Betty went up to the tree to see what happened. They saw the cat trying to attack Betty. Then they went home and John went out for some ice cream and he saw the old guy again and it wasn't the old man anymore. They both went back home and got some ice creams. Then John told his friends about the old ghost and the police came to the house and then he went out again. John and his friends came back home the next day to see if the cat would attack Betty again. Betty was in the kitchen when John went in and found her trying to make something. Then he ran out and got a fire extinguisher and threw it at the old crazy cat. It stopped attacking Betty and she went back inside. Then the old bat came and attacked John again and he went back into the house to go to sleep. After a while the old old guy appeared again and Betty said it was all a dream and that she was just sick and tired of having the cat in her house. The old guy then attacked John but John was able to kill it. When John got up to leave the house, he heard Betty saying that the old woman was still at the door. He went out and went to get a gun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie back in '87, when it was being promoted as a horror film about a woman in a mental institution.  I thought it was a pretty good horror movie, and I still have a fondness for it.  It's about a man who kills his wife and son and the police who are unable to catch him.    The movie is about a very odd little town in the South, and it has a really creepy, almost eerie feel to it. It also has an interesting cast, and a really good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Saving Private Ryan" is a solid World War II film, but it is the story that shines.  It is a simple plot, but the way the film moves at a fast pace is quite engaging.    There is a very clear point of view for the audience.  The film follows Corporal Jake Rettig (Mark Addy), a paratrooper assigned to rescue the downed pilot, Private Ryan (John Malkovich).   It is Rettige's first day in the jungle, and it is a tough assignment for him.  He is outnumbered, outgunned and outmanned.  Rettiger and the other troops of Private Ryan have no choice but to take their chances.  "Saving... Private Ryan", is one of those rare films that are so well made that the audience forgets it is being presented as a war movie.  It would be difficult to tell if the movie was ever in production at all.  There is no dialogue and very little action.  But what makes this film so effective is the performances of both actors.  Malkovich does an amazing job as the pilot, Ryan.  Addy and Robert Mitchum do an excellent job as their respective comrades in arms.  This film is full of action, but with such a simple story, it never becomes overly tedious.  And it is interesting to watch the men of the 82nd who are so close to their own deaths.  One of the things that makes this movie so great is the film's depiction of the jungle.  From the opening shot of Rettigrs' feet on the ground, the audience knows this movie is set in the jungles of Africa.  Then, the action unfolds, and the jungle becomes one of the more fascinating places to watch on the big screen.  For the most part, the jungle scenes are well done, and a great deal of them are filmed in excellent black and white.  Unfortunately, there are some scenes that are not as impressive.  At one point, there is a scene that seems to take place in a military cemetery.  However, it is not clear what that cemetery is.  In addition, a lot of scenes are shot from a very high angle, which makes it difficult to see what is going on.  On the other hand, a few of the action sequences are done in a realistic way.  Perhaps the most interesting sequence in the film is the one

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great, it was my first movie, so I have no idea what to expect from this movie, it seems like the people that are being shot and killed in the movie are from the real world. But then there is also a scene in the film in which the movie tells the story of a group of kids that are out riding their bikes in the woods, the kid's father is killed, and the kid goes after the killer and kills him. I have to admit that I was quite impressed with this movie.   The soundtrack was very good.  The movie is about a kid who is a good kid, he's a little bit of a loner, and he likes to play with his little friends. He also has a love of basketball.  He's got a little problem. His little brother was killed by a mugger, and this is his only brother. His father was murdered by the same mugger. The movie doesn't tell much about the movie. It is about what the kids do, but it is very brief.  It was great that the movie had the same sound as the real movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little girl gets a letter from her dad that she's not to come to school tomorrow and to come back by the next day, or else she'll be in trouble.  So she leaves home and goes to a carnival with her mother to see the circus performers and get some candy.  Once there, she is told that a big, hairy, red ape is coming to take her home, so she does.  When she gets there, the ape is actually a big brown bear.  He takes the girl into a tunnel and puts a ring on her finger, and they're off.  In the tunnel, they find themselves in a city with skyscrapers.  The girl's mother has been captured by a gang of monkeys and they make a fire in the forest and throw sticks into the fire, and the girl goes down into the tunnel and finds her mother.  She puts the ring on the girl's finger and they take off.  The girl comes back home and finds the mother with a gun.  They run back to the city and the bear comes to get the girl.  At this point, the girl doesn't know that her mother is a girl, but she knows that she has a ring.  It's not until she goes down to the forest where the bears are that she learns the truth.  It's actually a great story.  It's a short story, and it's not a very long story.  There are about 15 minutes of story that are not that great, but the rest of it is pretty good.

He goes to a town in the mountains, the only town there is, and he wants to live in peace. But as soon as he arrives there, he finds that the world he wants has no peace. There are no good people, and everyone is trying to take what they can. And what they are trying to get is the very people who are trying everything to get him to leave.   In one scene, the sheriff gives the man a gun to defend himself.  It's not enough. The man doesn't have a gun, and neither does the sheriff. So the sheriff shoots the man, and when he looks up to see what's happened, he sees a big man who is trying desperately to get a gun from the sheriff, and then it is all over. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is quite a bit more serious than its predecessor, with a more grounded storyline and a much better ending. While this is a good film, it is far from perfect. I do not know if the author had a personal axe to grind, but he did a rather poor job of presenting his main characters as real people. There is a lot of exposition, but it is not clearly defined. I thought that a lot was going on behind the scenes, and that a few details would have been explained, but the author did not go there. It is almost as if he wrote a book about a fictionalized version of a real person, and then he decided to take the liberty of changing a few of the names, and even altering some of the dialogue to make it all seem a bit like a book.   In the book, the protagonist is a writer. He writes about the horrors he has witnessed in the jungles of Indonesia, and his encounters with people who can communicate with the dead. The book is about the characters and their struggles, and the events that transpire are the stuff of nightmares. This is certainly a horror movie, but I can't say that I felt any of the dread that I thought I would. It was just a bit too much of the same, with the same things happening over and over again. I was glad to be done with this movie, and it will not scare me again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a pretty good movie!   The plot was a little slow and there were a few characters that I didn't like very much, but it wasn't a bad movie at all.   There were a lot of scenes in this movie that were so good.  I am a big fan of movies like this one! 
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** In a year when it's difficult to come up with new ideas or to come to terms with the end of an era, the old fashioned kind of adventure remains relevant. The film is a good mix of comedy, suspense, adventure and romance. This was a movie made for the fans, a movie with a great sense of humor and a lot of action. I recommend it to fans of adventure films. ********************
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You're Next" is a movie about a boy who doesn't know why he's alive. He is the son of a famous musician and his father is a famous jazz singer, so he is always seen as a genius and an amazing singer. He plays the piano well but has no talent and he is constantly ridiculed by his classmates. They all think he is a loser. He's really an awful, annoying person. He gets into a fight with a girl and is almost killed, but is saved by a girl called Lorna. They go to the school concert and Lorn a teacher who teaches the other students how to play the piano. They play and are amazed by Lorn's skill and personality, so they try to copy her. However, the other kids find out about it and they bully him to get him to play. Soon, Lorn becomes a real genius and is very popular.  One day, the kids at school discover that Lorn is a killer and want to kill her, so Lorn goes out to kill them all, which is a big problem as he doesn't want to die and thinks that he will be a great musician.    This is one of the few movies I have seen where there are no explosions.      The soundtrack is good and the plot is interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say that I've seen a better movie.   The movie is very realistic.  And the actors are great.  I think the movie was directed by the great Jack Arnold.  This movie is really good and it's not only for young girls.  The song is also very catchy and I love the ending.

It's a classic noir thriller, and if you love it, you should also love the art of film. The cinematography and editing is great, the characters are believable and the plot twists are exciting and original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great, fun little movie about a man named Billy Bob who was born with a freakish power. He can bend metal to his will and he has a lot of fun doing so. The movie is all about how Billy Bob gets his power from his grandfather and the old man's friend. Billy Bob is the only kid in town who can do this and his dad is not too happy about it. So, Billy Bob decides to run away from home and try to find his grandfather who can grant Billy Bob's wish. Along the way, Billy gets some help from the kids of the neighborhood. It's a fun, silly, good looking movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character of the film, a young woman named Svetlana is a bit of a bitch. She's an orphan, raised by a group of women in a house in a village in Russia. She has a very bad reputation. She thinks that her mother is a witch, and that she's a witch. But, as she grows up, she learns that she has a lot of friends in her village. She also learns that her grandmother was a witch and that, before she died, she told her daughter, who became a witch herself, that she had to marry the Prince. She tells her daughter that, if she wants to marry, she must have a child with a prince. It is an interesting plot. I think that there were a couple of plot holes in it, however. The most obvious is that Svetlia never even visits her mother and grandmother, only goes to her cousin. It's very hard to believe that, in the same village, there are only two women who aren't married, who aren�t widows, and who are all married. This seems a little bit far-fetched, but I'm sure that some people will be satisfied with the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** A good old fashioned movie with lots of funny dialog and a good cast. The movie is a comedy and the actors do a good job in portraying the situations they are in. ********************* I found this movie to be funny, and even though it is about a family with a dog that steals things, it is not a big deal. The family goes through a lot of hardship during the movie. This is a family that is very close. ********* I liked this movie, I thought it was funny, but the ending was a bit sad. I am sure you can find a way to make it a little happier.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  1. A very good movie about a guy who tries to break the ice with a girl (I guess) in the movie. He is the only guy in a group of guys that try to date a girl. His friend is a big douche. His buddy is a bit of a douche (he's the guy who always says "Oh yeah, we're all gonna be rich in 10 years, so we should party and drink all day!"). He is an ass, a drunk, a womanizer. The only good thing about him is he has a crush on the girl, but that doesn't last long. I don't know what to say about this movie. It's not good.   2. The best part of the movie is the movie's ending.  The bad:  1. I was not a big fan of this movie until I saw the movie poster.  2. I had high expectations for this movie, but this movie didn't live up to them.  3. This movie is about a group that tries to date women. This is a movie where the guy has no interest in a woman.  4. The movie is full of scenes that are funny, but they are not funny in the way they were supposed to be.  5. I found this movie to be extremely boring. I wish I had gone to see this movie when it was on television.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is a good old fashioned Western" I'd like to start off by saying that this movie is a masterpiece.  It has everything that one could want in a western: a well written script, a great cast, a good plot, and a fantastic action sequence.  The film is set in the late 1800s in the great plains of Texas.  A band of Indian hunters are traveling through the territory in order to hunt down the great white buffalo.  While traveling they meet a white man, and in their discussion about the buffalo, the man makes the mistake of mentioning the famous, but long dead, Texas Rangers, who fought the Apache during the great Texas revolution.  Soon after that the band comes across a lone woman named Mary.  She is a beautiful woman, but as she is only a young girl, the men decide to take her to be their bride.  They bring her to their camp and the men offer to teach her the ways of the west.  After they get to know her, she becomes a great admirer of the men, and is able to convince them to travel with her.  As the men start to leave the camp to hunt for the buffalo again, the woman is forced to decide if she will stay with the men or if she would rather return to her home, the great Plains.  There is a lot of violence in this film, and there are a lot more than I can possibly remember.  This is one of those films where the violence and violence are a perfect fit with the story, which is a well told story of the love between two men and the women that they care for.  For those who like to watch violent westerns, this is the film for you.  However, if you like a good western, this movie will not disappoint.  Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film opens with a montage of various scenes from the film's previous two iterations, followed by a new montage. The new montages show an even larger and more varied cast of characters, and this one is more of a love story. It's really good. I really enjoyed this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of years ago I saw this movie with a friend at a coffee shop in Manhattan.  The movie is about a couple of poor white people who find a box containing an old radio that they find interesting.    They try to sell it to the radio's owner, a rich black man.    The black man is kind of a jerk to the poor white guy who wants to get rid of the radio.  After a long fight, the poor guy gets away with the radio, and the two decide to go back to the place where they found it.      The movie ends with the poor whites being chased out of the city by a black man in a truck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't really have any words to describe this movie. It is a simple, but powerful, story about a man who's love for a woman is tested when she leaves him. This movie is about a woman who was born with a rare disease that makes her a walking skeleton. Her family and her closest friends are in complete shock and disbelief that she's able to speak, walk, and even swallow. They even think that she can walk and talk in an animated form, but she can't do it. She's stuck in a wheelchair. This film shows the life of a woman, a man, and her family in the early 20th century. They all deal with a woman whose only desire is to find a man to love and love him very deeply. The movie is not a romantic comedy, and that is what makes it so powerful. It's a very emotional film about a very sad and broken woman. The director has done a good job of showing the pain and loneliness that she is living through. This is not the type of movie that I would recommend to everyone, but it is one that I will remember for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very well acted. The movie was released in 1997. I had to wait until 1999 to see it. The film has some pretty cool shots. It is about a cop who gets a new partner in a new town, who is an old cop who is the local bully. The cops are also on the verge of being out of work. The cop's old partner is not there, and the bully is getting to be a bully himself. He is in trouble with a mobster who has a huge house. The gangsters are trying to get into the house so that they can get their hands on a lot of cash. The bully is there too. The bullies is trying to take out the gangster, but he has a friend there who has some money that the bully wants to take away from him. He uses his car to get to the house. It has a little bit of a climb up, but the bully gets there first. He makes his way in, and then the gangsters show up. The next scene is a scene that has been used before. A young boy is being beaten. The young boy starts to run to get help, and as he runs, the bully grabs him and kicks him in the head. The scene has been done a hundred times before. The only difference is that this time it is done by a real man.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the middle of the movie we have a young girl who comes to the town to play. The town is full of the very weird creatures that are called "Gnats". They seem like a group of big cats but are actually much more intelligent than that. They seem to know when you're getting too close to them, and they can talk to you, but they are very territorial and very smart. One of the most amazing scenes in the movie is when they come out of the water and start to eat the flowers in the flower garden.   I thought it was an odd little movie but very cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is really simple and you could understand most of it from the beginning:  A bunch of friends decide to play in the big park in the middle of nowhere.   They are all a bit drunk and the owner of the park (Mr. Munchkin) seems to be very generous.  There is a big hill where there is a huge pool and there is an open fire.  But the main attraction is the giant hole in the ground.  The friends are all very drunk and one of them (Brent) is the only one who can climb it.  When he gets there he finds out that it is a real trap.  In the morning a woman comes to the park and she asks the people to find her husband (the one who is missing).  When they try to he is gone.  Mr. Munkkin (the owner of park) is very angry with the women who were so stupid that they went to the hole in their pants to find him.  He tells the woman to go home and stay out of his park.  Later on one of the friends decides to try to climb the hole.  It is really hard to climb and at the end you have to climb through a fence (which is actually a fence with a little bit of a rope hanging from the top of it).  At the top there is the woman.  She tries to talk to the guy who is there, but he doesn't want to talk with her.  And it doesn't end there.  As you can see in the picture it is really easy to fall in the hole (it has no bottom).  As the woman is going down, she tries to make a little jump (which also doesn't work).  She falls into the hole and as a result is captured.  The owner of hole tries to use a fire extinguisher to kill her, but it is useless because it only works on people who are already dead (i.e. she's still alive).  The man who is trying to get the woman out of the hole is Mr. Sacks (an elderly man with glasses).  Mr Sacks is a very good actor.  After a lot of trying (and with the help of a bunch of people, including Mr. Gator) he manages to get his hands on her.    A little girl (Ruth) who was playing in the park the night before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure why I went to see this movie at all. I saw it the week before Christmas, at a theater in the same building as the original "Jaws" movie. This is a sequel that doesn't need a sequel. I think I went in thinking I was going to see the original and I was surprised to see how little there was of the original. I found the story very silly and silly. It didn't have any real suspense and I found it very difficult to sit through a movie that I found so much more silly than it should have been.   I saw this movie once and now I'm going to go see it a second time, I think that's a good sign.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of things are going on in this movie. One is a lot of sex, and a lot. But it's not a real sex movie. The sex is all over the place. You will be wondering what the heck was going on the entire time. And even though it's a good idea to have two women with two men in one movie, it's pretty obvious that the one that's supposed to be the hero, is not really the one to watch. She just has no clue about how to use a gun. And the other guy she's with, isn't all that much better. It's hard to believe he's the guy who's supposed be her boyfriend. The scene where he takes off his shirt is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. The girl's are really hot, but I'm just not sure they can pull it off.

It's about a group of people who are trapped in a hotel. The first day they try to get a hotel room but they can't find one because they are being watched. They find a room with a "sleeping" girl and she wakes up one morning to find that the bed has been changed to a shower with a shower curtain that comes down. So they have to do it all over again. The movie has a great ending and a funny ending too.

Â Â In the movie, you can hear a lot.  The voices are a little old, but not too bad.    For the first hour, the film is pretty good.  The acting is very good, and there are a lot more people who have voice over than in the movie.  They were pretty good in the TV show too, but that one didn't last too long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of horror movies and I don't like most of them. But the movie that I saw this weekend was a lot better than I expected. It wasn't like the others, I liked it. The movie is about a couple who move from New York to the mountains and find themselves alone. They find a cabin and get a room and they have a hard time in there. One night the two guys decide to take a shower in the middle of the night. After a while they come to and find that someone has moved in. The people in the house is very strange and creepy and it seems that they are trying to kill them. There is one of the creepiest things I have ever seen in a movie. I will tell you this, if you like horror movies or spooky movies, I would say this is one that you need to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie begins with a couple (Brennan and Tatum) in a diner. The guy (Dana Delany) is wearing a wig and makeup. He looks like he is in a movie, not an 80's movie. His name is Mike (Brock), and he has an evil grin and is holding a gun to Brennan's head. He gives her a cup of coffee and tells her that she looks like the girl from "the other movie". Brennan then notices a car parked outside. She goes in and asks if they are going to "The Big House" (the movie that was filmed in the early 70's). The guy looks at her and then walks away. He is now wearing a green suit and is wearing glasses. He tells her it is a good idea to meet someone who is like her. He introduces her to her new friends. The new guy (Michael J. Fox) and the guy (Kevin Pollak) are in a car that has been hit by a truck. The two new guys try to fix the car but it is in bad shape. Brennan thinks that they are in trouble. The guys start to get into a fight and they run away. They end up at a diner and they get a booth for the night. It is then that they realize that the movie they are watching is "Battleship". They also see the film on the wall. The next day they meet a guy named Donnie (James Caan). He looks a lot like the man from the movie and they go over to his house. Brennan goes in the house and is surprised by the woman that lives there. Brennan also meets a guy (Donnie's brother) who lives in the next house. He has a son named Ben. Brennan asks the two to play a game of hide-and-seek. The girl gets caught but Brennan finds out that the two of them are from "The Other Movie". Brennan goes to her house to talk to her but she refuses to let Brennan in. She wants to be with Donnie's son, and she doesn't want Brennan to know that they met. She also tells Brennan that her husband was in a bad car accident and that he was killed. Brennan comes back and tells Brennan to go away. She tells her to stay away from Donnie, but she does not listen. She sees Brennan at the end of the hallway and she tries to hit her with a chair. Donnie is there and he

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie about the people who are there at the right time.   This is the perfect movie to watch while waiting for a bus.  It is an amazing movie about people who really did the right thing at the end of the day.  I love how it has some great songs and great music.  The best part is that you can see the people behind the scenes.  If you like to see the little things that happened, then this is a movie that will have you wanting to be a reporter or a cameraman for a news show.  This movie is one of my all time favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a great movie and my favorite of the year.   The film follows a group of college students who have just moved into a dormitory and find that it's very quiet.  The group starts to investigate a strange disturbance in the woods, when a young boy comes out of the woods to find that he has been kidnapped by an evil clown.  As the group investigates the house, they find that the family had been murdered and a curse is put on the house that causes all of the furniture to fall to the floor.  In the end, the group is saved by a man who is able to bring them back to the real world.  It's a great film and I was amazed at how well it turned out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     If you haven't seen The Wolf of Wall Street (or if you haven'e seen it and you're a movie lover like me, then you're already in for a great movie) then you should go and check it out!   It's a story about a Wall Street investor named Jordan Belfort who falls into a world of drugs, money and hookers.   He is eventually caught and imprisoned but manages to escape.  The story is so good that I couldn't stop watching it.  But I won't spoil anything for you.  It has all the elements of a good Hollywood movie.  Jordan Belfart is an interesting character.  He's not a good guy, he's not an evil guy, and he's certainly not a hero.  And he is a complete and utter asshole.  His only motivation is to make money, and that is all that really matters.  What is even worse is that Belfort is a very good actor.  Even though he's an asshole, he is able to convey that he is very smart.  I really like the movie and I'm glad that I have seen it. I'm definitely a fan of Hollywood movies, so this is one of those movies that I recommend to everyone.  The Wolf of the Wall Street is out now! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not much of a fan of the horror genre but I liked this movie. I have never seen a movie about a group of people in a hospital who are all in coma and when one of them wakes up, it's not the best looking one and has a bit of a strange look to it. The doctor is pretty interesting and is in the hospital from the beginning to the end, I found him a bit odd but at the same time I enjoyed watching him and trying to get to know him better. The ending is very weird, I won't spoil it but it is kind of sad. It is very dark and there are some very weird scenes but it's pretty funny too. It does not hold a candle to other films like It Came from Beneath the Sea but it has a good cast and is entertaining and a bit disturbing. If you're a fan or have seen it, I recommend giving it a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about the American War of Independence.  In the beginning of the movie there are a lot of scenes with people that don't make any sense but we can tell that they are not really acting and they are probably acting like characters from a comic book movie.  It was a good start, but after a while the story gets confusing.   There are many scenes in the movie that don`t make any kind of sense and the characters are very flat.  The film is not good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie with a very unique and original plot.   It is an odd one though.  You know what that means?   If you like the idea of being a giant in a sci-fi movie, you will like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The last film by John Carpenter, the man behind the classics such as "The Thing", "The Fog" and "The Final Cut". It is very strange to see him back in this medium, and he still does it brilliantly. The story is very straightforward and the story of a family living in a small house in the woods, slowly but surely dying from an unknown disease. The characters are all very memorable and memorable characters, but they are all so different from each other. The wife is a bit of a whore, but I think the idea of the disease was a good one. This is a good little film and a must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am sure that there is no better way to end a great movie like this one. This is a movie that can only be compared to the great old classics like "The Wizard of Oz" and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" that I love.   As for the story:  Well, the story is great, even the beginning, which is just a few pages long.  The story is a little complicated, as the main character is trying to get to the treasure in order to prove that his father's story is true.  But, as you know, the treasure is hidden, as is the secret, so it's a difficult task for the young boy.  Well-done, this is a great old movie, and I can see myself going to see it again and again.

The wizard lives in a castle and is in a relationship with his sister, who is also a witch. She is in love with her brother and decides to marry him. After her marriage the wizard decides to leave the village and go to a distant land to practice his spells. When he arrives, he is very excited to see the beautiful young girl who lives there. He wants to marry her and take her back to the castle. The girl has an older brother who is jealous of her happiness. He convinces her to make him jealous by giving her a beautiful rose that she puts on the tree where he lives.

When she gets a little too close to the rose the wizard makes her promise that she will never let him have the flower again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw this movie, I was just thinking, "I love this movie". I watched it again a few years ago and it's still great. The special effects are wonderful, the soundtrack is a bit old, but it's fun and still a good time! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil's Backbone" is a film which makes you think, "Why is that guy sitting on the bed, wearing that long beard?" "The Devil in His Skin" is probably one of the better westerns I've seen, in that it isn't just "a Western" but also "a psychological horror".  This is a story of a man who, with the help of his wife, a doctor and his young son, goes on a hunt for a killer of a child, a boy who is said to have been killed by an old man.  It's a story that starts out rather well, and the first half of the film, which follows a young boy's journey to find his brother, is quite charming and entertaining.  However, the real attraction of the movie is in the second half, which is the story of the old man and the child's killer.  The old man is not a nice guy, nor is he particularly smart, but he is certainly a master of disguise, and he seems to be quite knowledgeable about the occult.  He's also quite violent, but his violence isn't particularly graphic.  His violence is rather calculated and very professional, and it has a definite purpose, though it's not really the kind of purpose that's pleasant to watch.  However, there are other parts of the story which are quite entertaining, particularly the opening scene, and there are some good performances from many of the people who play the roles.  There's also a fairly amusing song about the old couple.  In this film, I was reminded of "The Wizard of Oz", particularly the scene where the Scarecrow disguises himself as a red-tailed hawk and tries to scare the Cowardly Lion.   This is a good, entertaining movie, with an unusual plot and a unique approach to horror, that is a lot more interesting than many of its westerns which are more or less predictable.  I have seen many Westerns, but I've never seen a film quite like "The Devils Backbone".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a kid, I would have watched this movie all the time. It's always been on my top 10 lists since I was 9.  I don't think this movie is for everyone. If you're a fan of the old days, this is a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good film about a guy who lives in a trailer with his mother and his sister, and has to work at the local car wash. He is also a car salesman. The film is a little slow and a little boring. The character is not original at all and the plot has little going for it. It is only good if you are a fan of the movie "The Long Riders" or the movie 'Dumb & Dumber' (both of which are available on video).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a remake of a classic French thriller, starring Robert Mitchum, Audrey Hepburn, and James Dean.  The film is based on the novel of the same name by  Alain Resnais.  If you're a fan of movies about characters who have to go to war, then you're going to like this one.   The story follows a young British private (Mitchum) who is on a mission to save a wounded soldier (Hepburn).   After saving the wounded soldier, the soldier (Dean) is taken to a hospital, where the doctor (Hugh MacLaine) treats him.    In a last ditch effort to save the man's life, Mitchum decides to join him in his battle against the Germans.  In order to accomplish this mission, Mitcham and the other soldier will have to infiltrate the enemy's base.  The movie has a great script and a lot of action scenes, but it is still a pretty slow movie at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Last Song" is a good, but not great film. It has a great premise: a young woman dies in a freak accident and finds herself in a strange town with a strange mayor. The townspeople are a little too obsessed with the death of the woman to really be bothered by her passing. It's really a shame, as there are a couple of really great scenes here. The first is the beginning where the mayor gives a funeral for the woman. It seems odd to start a film with a funeral scene, but the acting is good. I enjoyed the scene with the mayor and the police captain (John Carradine) when they are driving around looking for a missing boy. The police captain is always looking for someone to blame for the deaths of the women. It doesn't make any sense, but it's funny. The next scene is when the girl's mother (Brigitte Nielsen) is looking for the boy. She tries to sell the film to the townspeclters, and they are not very impressed. This is a bit of a shame because it's a really funny film. I like the fact that the mayor is so obsessed with finding the boy that he does a lot of driving around the town, and has a lot more dialogue than you would normally expect from a mayor. Overall, the film has some good moments. It is not a classic, but a good time, I think.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was good and I liked the idea of the story.   It was a good action movie but it had a lot of problems.  I like that this is not a typical action movie.  They have to get out of the city, but the city was not very large.  It could have been done a little better.  The movie was a little boring and there were a few times that it looked like they were trying to figure out how to make this movie work.  There were also some very bad scenes.  All in all, a good watch but I don't think it was worth the price of admission. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie.   The movie begins with a beautiful sunrise, then the sun sets behind a mountain in the night and we see a young girl walking through a desert, it looks beautiful, the setting is lovely and the girl is very pretty and has a lovely voice. We then see a car drive by and a little girl comes out, she looks like the same one that was in the movie "A Night to Remember" about a girl who lost her mommy and the rest of her family in a plane crash. Then we see some of the kids playing, there is a kid who has a red nose and some other kid with a big nose, the little girl's mother is there and she looks very sad, she is very old and has lots of grandchildren. Then there is this girl who is very beautiful and has this blue eyes and she has a beautiful voice. Then some other kids and they are playing and they have a blue shirt on, then there is another girl, the same blue eyes, and a beautiful singing voice, the song they play is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and it is a pretty good song. Then a truck stops and the people inside are looking around, and then we see the girl again and she is walking through the desert and she does not have a red hat on, and she walks with her head down and we do not see her face, but there is something about her that looks very familiar to me, maybe it is the music, maybe the voice or maybe she is the same person, but I don't know. Then, there are more people in the truck and they all look very sad and scared, they are all very old, they have lots of wrinkles and they do not talk, and there is no music playing, and the truck stops again and the driver looks at the girls and the little girls mother and she says "How are you, are you okay?" and the woman turns her head and looks at him and then she looks at her daughter and then her son, and we hear a little crying and crying and the sound of a guitar and then some more crying and they go on.  When we see them again they are very old now, they don't have a big red hat and they look very scared and they run away, and they walk through the sand.  The truck stops some more times, and all the people look around and they get out and then they run back and
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't speak about this movie without bringing up the incredible soundtrack. It really is something to behold.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A brilliant, fast-paced thriller, set in a seedy motel in the dead of night. A man finds himself at the mercy of a vengeful ghost, who has a habit of turning up at odd times. If you like a good old fashioned ghost story, this one is right up your alley. If your a fan of Robert Altman or Stephen King, you'll also like this one."   In the 1980s, the motel was a notorious crime haven. A few years ago, an innocent man was murdered by a man who came to stay at the motel after a long time in jail. The man had a habit, during his incarceration, of returning to the motel for one last getaway. One night, the man comes back to the hotel for the last time and goes to bed. As he's falling asleep, he suddenly hears a woman's voice coming from the bathroom. He gets up and goes into the bathroom, where the voice asks him to get a towel and then she disappears.   A few months later, the same man, now in a new place, finds that the voice he heard during the night is the same one that called him out of the bathroom the first time. He goes to investigate, and soon finds the same woman. He has a change of heart and decides to leave the woman alone, but she comes back. He tries to escape her, but the more he tries to leave, the more she comes closer and closer. When he gets desperate, he gets a gun and tries to shoot her. She hits him with the gun, but he gets up again and starts shooting at her, even though she's standing right in front of him.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is really good.  There is some violence and some really funny moments, which makes the film even more funny and entertaining.    It's funny how the main character gets a "dramatic" ending.  It also makes the story better as the end of the film shows how the story ended, which is pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie at the cinema about a year ago, and loved it.  So many of the scenes reminded me of the ones in the movie "A Clockwork Orange".  It's a dark movie with a very dark theme, and it's really hard to not think about it at times.    And it was really hard not to watch this movie, since it's one of those movies you can't help but think about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great film. I was a little skeptical, but after watching it and seeing the trailer, I'm sold. I've already seen it twice, but I'm looking forward to the third time!  I really enjoyed this film, but it could've been better. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, but this one was quite good. I also didn't feel like the film had a lot of tension. It could've used more action. There's a few instances of things that could've had a bit more buildup, but overall it was pretty good. The story is simple, but good. It's a good time to watch this, even if you don't enjoy horror movies. The only thing I wish it had is more gore.

Then we get into the story and it is a great story about the good guys trying to do good things. This is a good action movie, a little slow at first, but once the action starts, it is great. I like the fact that the story was not so easy to follow. I would like to see more of these action movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - A great family comedy that doesn't let itself get too heavy or too silly.   The comedy of the week:  - The guy who runs the pool at the local pub.  This guy is in a bad mood and doesn't have the best of luck.  - He is so angry that his wife left him.  He's the only one who is able to make the money to pay his daughter's tuition.  But he's having a hard time getting anyone to buy his product.  It's a little hard to understand how this guy is able make a living.  So I'm guessing the guy who's wife left is the one who's in the pool chair.  I think he might be the owner of the pub and he's been complaining about how hard it is to get people to buy their drinks.  After that scene, the movie just kind of drops off a cliff.

It is a simple, very low budget, low quality production. It has an interesting story, and a few moments of suspense, but it is not very memorable. The special effects are not very good, and the sound effects are cheesy." - Review by David J. Karp The cast: _____ _____  - - - - "I am not a big fan of action movies, but I enjoyed this one a lot. The film is quite entertaining." - Roger Ebert  The story: The story is set in a small town called "The Village", where a group of children known as the "Villagers" have come to live. The village is a nice place to live, but there are a few problems. The people are not nice, and there are some strange happenings going on. The most notable event being a series of strange events that take place at the town cemetery, and then a murder in the park. The story moves along at a slow pace, with the kids and the villagers having fun at the playground and at school. A few of the kids start to grow up, and are not as happy at the village as they used to be. At school, the boys and girls have a rivalry, with one girl wanting to get into the boys' school. And then, the school teacher becomes a killer. He kills a couple of the boys, and kills a few of their friends. The movie has some of the usual action that you might expect from a low budget film, but with a very unique, interesting story and a unique, and entertaining ending. I will give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars. If you like action movies and like the idea of a group who are good, but have a few bad apples in their midst, this movie is a good place to start. ________

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those that just hits you from the first time you watch it.   The movie starts out with a shot of a young boy in a red car, a red convertible, and a girl, a young girl.  He gets out of the car and he looks up and down the road and he thinks to himself, "Wow, the countryside is beautiful." He is happy about the beauty and then he starts looking down and he says, "Look at that house." He looks up again and looks down and his eyes are like the most beautiful eyes you've ever seen.  And then he goes down and looks and he is not sure about this house.  Then a guy comes out and says,  "Oh, that's a nice house."  And he walks around the house and he sees a woman there and he doesn't know who the lady is.  The guy looks around and he decides to walk around the back of the house, then he looks around the front and then,   Then he walks up to the front door and he turns the knob and he hears a voice say,  "What's your name?" And the guy says,   "My name is  John Wayne." And the lady says,      Well, John Wayne is dead.    And the man says,  "Oh my God." And he starts to walk away but then he says to himself    "Well, I'm going to kill the lady."   So he looks over and he realizes that the lady's name is Elizabeth Taylor.  It's not really a movie.  There is no plot, no character development, no action, nothing.  What's there is John Wayne's face, the house the woman is in, the voice, and the car.  If this was a movie it would be a terrible one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure how many times I've said this but the movie has such a good story to tell that I find myself unable to put it down. I like the movie because it shows how good friends can be in this kind of situation. It shows how bad it can get when friendship gets twisted. It has a great villain, but it's a great and powerful villain and he is the villain in every movie. It's a little odd seeing him for the first time but I think that it makes him even more memorable. I liked the ending, but I did find it a little strange, because the end was kind of rushed. It also made me wonder what happened to the people that were killed, but maybe it's just me? It was definitely a movie I'll be watching again soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You're a terrible husband, and a terrible father." This film was made for an American audience. In other words, it was a romantic comedy. There was no reason for this to be made.   This movie has all the charm of the worst romantic comedy ever made. There is a very short film in which the two characters, who have been together for over a year, get married. The first scene shows them walking to the chapel. They are holding hands, walking up the aisle, and then the film cuts to the following scene. The groom, with his hair a mess, and looking like a clown, gets married. This is followed by a series of romantic scenes. This leads to the conclusion that this movie is a romantic-comedy. It is so funny that I laughed out loud several times. It was made at a time when the American movies were becoming more and more romantic. This movie would make an ideal movie for a school play, because it has so many humorous scenes that will make the children laugh their heads off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're in for a great time with the "Dumb and Dumber" crew. They've done a lot of dumb things, and a few dumb things are funny. The movie has some great moments that don't always come to fruition. I enjoyed the story and the humor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie that was pretty bad, but the writing, acting and directing was good.  The acting was not very good but that is not a bad thing.      The writing was okay but not good enough to make it a good film.  This movie was a complete waste of money.  The story was so poor, that you would think it was a movie about a woman in the 60's who went to war in Vietnam.  It was so bad, that even the producers of the film felt the need to apologize to their viewers, "I would like to apologize that our movie was made in a period in time when the American people didn't really know what was going on in Vietnam, nor did the Vietnamese people."  This is a shame, because if you go into this movie with any intention of watching a good war movie, you will be disappointed.    I would not recommend this movie, to anyone who is interested in war movies, and even to those who are not. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************** This is a good family movie, and a great example of the kind of movies I love. It is about the adventures of a young couple on their way to see a movie on their holiday. They are traveling through the desert with their baby and it's mother, and they encounter a number of people in a car that are a little off, like an old man with a mustache. They find the car abandoned in a desert area with no lights on and no one to be found, so they set off to find the family and get them home. It's a fun movie with a lot of action and adventure, and the family is full of personality. ****************************** This movie is about a young man who gets a job at a circus that has an attraction in a cave. The cave is full to the brim with all kinds of wild animals. They have a little guy who is a baby and who will grow up to be a bear or something similar. The guy, Tom, gets to know the wild animals and they get along. One day Tom gets into a fight with a wild bear that's been causing trouble in the area. He is then captured by the people who own the circus and he is taken to the city to get his job back. But the job isn't returned to him because the city wants it back. So Tom is forced to go to a circus in the country that has a wild animal attraction, and he gets his job. ********** My only complaint about this movie is that it has a little over 20 minutes of film left. It would be good to get a few more scenes in with the wild animal circus and to get to see the family. **************
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As stated in my last review, I'm going to say it again: this is one of the best movies of all time. If you're a big fan of the late '80s/early '90s, or at least have a nostalgic interest in this type of movie, then you should really see this movie. You'll probably be able to pick out most of the references to the late 1980s/late '90 and early '00s (especially the opening scene of a school play, and the scene where the students take off their clothes), and the movie itself is really well-done. The movie is a lot of fun, and while it is somewhat reminiscent of the films of the same time period (and of course, The Warriors), it is definitely its own entity. This movie is really not about what happens to the characters (although the movie is about a high school basketball team), but rather about the friendships that form between these kids as they move through the years. And the friendships between these friends are really special and memorable. This is not a movie for kids (at least, it's not intended to be), but for anyone who has ever wanted to see a good friendship develop over the years (or even just the fact that they can be friends), this is a movie you'll want to see again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't really remember the plot to this movie, but I remember it was pretty good. It has a lot of great fight scenes and the whole movie is well paced. It's not as long as it looks.  The ending is a bit weak and the ending is one of the worst things I've ever seen in a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised to see this coming out. I saw the movie in a college theater and I loved it. I'm not a big horror movie fan but I am a big fan of the movies that the director, Gary J. Tunnicliffe, makes. He does his own take on the slasher genre but I don't think that it is as gory as the old slasher movies. I think the gore is a little bit more realistic and the killer is a bit more likeable than the old killer from the 70's and 80's. If you like slasher and the gore this is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ "I wanted to go back in time. I wanted to get back to the time when I was a little girl and my parents let me dress up like a witch and scare people at the park." -Molly (Molly Shannon) Written and directed by the late, great George Romero. The film takes place in the town of Hill Valley, California and it's a very interesting place to visit. There are a lot of very nice homes here and a lot to see and do. I really enjoyed the movie and it has an almost supernatural feel to it. It's not a perfect movie and there are a few scenes that could have been done better. But for the most part, it is a very nice little movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes ghost stories. I was not sure I liked this movie at first, but I was pleasantly surprised and have to say it's one of my favorite horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie, but it has a few flaws. First, the movie had a very odd ending. It seemed to be a very short film, and then it went on a little too long. It really seemed like it was trying to make a point. The point was that no matter what, there is no reason to kill a man who has only committed a few violent acts in his life. Second, the whole "the world is full of violence" thing just doesn't sit well with me. The movie tries to show the horrible consequences of such a situation, but instead of using a true crime case, the case is an attempt to make people understand that there are worse things in the world. The ending just felt very off-putting.   Conclusion: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only movie i saw in theaters this year, but the best one. I liked it because of the acting and the plot. The plot was a little thin, but it got a little more interesting later on, and the movie was really funny.   If you like a good comedy, you should definitely watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a real treat! The story is not so original but the characters are so much better and so is the director. The acting is excellent, especially the voice of Mr. Ziegler. If you like horror movies you will love this one!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you think about the world of modern Hollywood, a couple of names will immediately come to mind:  J. Lee Thompson,  Robert Altman,  Billy Wilder,  Alfred Hitchcock.  I am sure that some of you will also be able to think of others, but I can't think of anyone else that could have made this movie a "good" movie, much less a "great" one.  It is a fairly good movie that is a bit over the top, a bit too over the tops.   But it is a movie that I still have a soft spot in my heart for, a movie which I have loved for as long as I can remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to describe the effect this movie has on me. It was such a shock that a movie like this existed. I don't know if I can ever go back to seeing a movie in a theater again, so I will remember this for as long as I can. I was scared to death at the beginning and didn't want to continue. But I did. The ending was shocking, but I didn't know what to think about it at the time. I have not seen a movie quite like this since. I loved the ending!

This is not a good comedy:  This is a film with a lot of bad jokes.  The script is weak, the comedy is weak.  This movie is really about a couple of guys trying to make it big by playing the piano.  It is really silly, and it is a good way to learn a few things about life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a nice movie, even though it is based on a real story. It is not a masterpiece but it is not bad either. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good old-fashioned "horror" movie that has been done many times before.  It is a pretty good movie and you can't go wrong with it.  The movie was filmed in 1983 and is based on the true story of a group of schoolgirls in England who are being stalked by a mysterious and evil clown named Mr. Gently (Robert Loggia) and the sinister Black Cat (Eddie Marsan) and it is all a bit of a mess and I can't quite believe how they made it work.    I'm not sure what they were thinking when they tried to have a character in a mask who looks like a real clown and a girl who seems to have an uncanny ability to see the future (and that she will one day be the killer of her friends).     The script is fairly good and there is a bit more to it than just the "clown" and the killer and the girl, but it is a mess.  And as I said, the script is rather good but the acting is not so good and it seems like they were trying to make it look good, but I just don't know how they could have.  But the good thing is that they are not trying to hide the fact that it is the old horror story, so you get the true horrors of the story, not the modern version that the producers probably wanted.  It is not a good film, but for those who enjoy the old classic horror movies, you will probably enjoy this one as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film. It is so very different from the films you normally see. It has a story about a man who is obsessed with his job.  He has a wife and a child.  In this story, he is working for the same boss who has an army of minions.   He is trying to prove himself worthy by trying to stop his boss from being taken over by a new one.  In doing this, he finds out that the boss is having an affair with the new boss's wife.  This leads to a confrontation between the boss and the new one where they have to fight over who will get the boss' money.  The movie is very funny.  It has an interesting plot, it is well acted, and it has a good pace.  A great film that is definitely worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that I should see this movie. The reviews are bad so I thought I would give it a shot. The movie is a comedy but at the same time, there are some serious moments. This movie is great. There is a lot of action and it has a lot to do with a lot. If you don't like a lot you will not like this movie and if you do like a little bit then you will love it. I think this is a good comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good one. I have a problem with movies about children. They always seem to have the same problem with the same story, which isn't too hard to find in movies about kids. The movie is about a little girl, Elvira, who, because of her great intelligence and her ability to play a game, gets invited to play with the great wizard, Merlin. Merlin is not only very beautiful, he is also very wise. His powers come from his magic ring which allows him to see all of the world. He gives Elvria the task of traveling with him to a magical island. This island is in the middle of the sea, and a storm is coming. The island is protected by a castle. Elvaria, who is the youngest of a group of orphans, must find a way to get the castle and the wizard's ring before the storm destroys it. The only way is to travel the land. The rest of the movie is just a group trip around the land, with Elvida trying to figure out how to get to the castle. In the end, it is decided that Elvriel's parents are still alive, and she will have to go to them to ask for their help. The ending was very good. I don't know if the movie will be any good for adults. It is a little on the short side, but the characters are interesting, and it is a nice movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this film, you'll get to meet a group of college girls, each of whom has a particular set of skills. A cheerleader, a gymnast, a barmaid, a pianist and a beauty queen all play a part in the show. The one who makes the most noise, and makes the best show, is the barmy and boisterous cheerleader. You can tell she's a little crazy when she makes her entrances by banging on the walls and screaming at her audience. It's really funny, but it's not as funny as the film is. There's also a great group of bikers in this film. One of them is called "The Dirt Road Express" and he rides a horse-drawn carriage with a "S&M Machine Gun" attached to it. It would be a lot funnier if they didn't have a lot of swearing in this movie.  The film was released in 1982 and is about as good as you could expect a "Puppet Show" to be. It has great songs, and the actors are great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The main character has the same kind of look as Tom Cruise. But the acting is good and the movie is well produced.   - The first time I saw this movie I was disappointed because the music was just too slow and I was wondering why I would pay for this. I had forgotten that there was a music video in the movie and I found it very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an old timey "spy" film in the vein of "Roots" and "The Manchurian Candidate." The film is based on the novel " The Great Game ", written by Joseph Heller.  I remember this movie being a big hit on TV during the '60s, when I was in high school.   It is a good example of a spy thriller with a twist.  The hero, "James Bond" (Lars Mikkelsen), is hired to steal a priceless painting from a museum in Paris.  This is no ordinary mission:  The painting is actually a painting of the Madonna by Pablo Picasso, who has been missing since 1911.  He is able to get the painting, but not before he gets captured by an organization known as "The Organization".  He meets a woman, Eva (Alicia Vikander), who is a member of the "Organization".  It turns out that the painting is really the Madonna, and the painting was stolen by a man named "Dr. No" (Ben Whishaw), who lives on a remote island in the South Pacific.  Dr. No is really a high-ranking member of a secret organization known only as "Olympus".  In order to retrieve the painting from "Dr No" and save the woman who is in love with him, Bond must travel to "Dr N", who has a secret laboratory in a cave near a volcano in the Amazon jungle.  I was surprised that the plot actually worked, as the film was pretty boring, but I was glad it worked at all.  In my opinion, the movie would have been much better if the plot was a little more subtle.  For instance, the whole thing could have been avoided if "Dr." No" had actually had a plan to kill Bond and if the woman that he was dating, the beautiful Eva, had actually been interested in Bond.  A much better movie would probably have been the "Jaws" remake (which was based on this novel) which was released in 1982.  But for a movie based on a novel that was originally published in 1959, "The Great Game" is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** * If you have a weak stomach, you might want to skip this one. It is so slow, so boring, and so unbelievable that you will not care that the title is ridiculous and so was the film. The story begins in a house and goes through the house and it is so boring. I think it should have been called "The House that Sits on the Corner of a Hill" because that is what it is. If I could have watched this film any other way, I would have done so. The director had the temerity to use two different endings. The first ending was the typical "This is my house and I am the only one who lives there" ending. But the second ending is so ridiculous and unbelievable that I do not know if this is supposed to be the ending or not. ***************** * I think this film is just like the movie "Tombstone" in that it is not an extremely good movie. But it is very good at being a parody of itself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the late 1950's, a young man named David (Burt Lancaster) travels to the big city to get married. Unfortunately, his bride-to-be is the sister of an influential gangster. With the help of a group of "saved" prostitutes (a term used for young women who are being rescued from the life of prostitution), he tries to win over the sister to his own way of life. Unfortunately for David, the sister is not so easily won over. This film is not the greatest I've ever seen, but it is a fun and enjoyable film to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is set in the future and it looks very cool and it is the best science fiction movie I've seen in a long time.   It takes the classic idea of the alien invasion and it takes it to a whole new level.  I was a bit bored the first time I watched this movie, but once again, it was a good experience and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good sci-fi movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you are not familiar with the story, the movie was a good one.  It was a little slow at first, but then we got the plot down to its core, and it just kept building and building.  The film is a simple story about two women trying to make it in the world.  They meet at a diner, and they meet the other woman, a waitress who is actually a ghost.  We then have the ghost trying to find a way back to her original body, and we also have a whole host of other supernatural things.  I would have given the movie more time if I could have, but the main characters are kind of cliche.  But the story is good, the characters are well written and it is easy to like them.  So if you are looking for a good ghost story with some nice action scenes, you can check this one out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place in a fictionalized version of the 1857 Boston Massacre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself laughing out loud at several points in this movie. There is a moment in the middle of the movie where a guy is being shot in the chest and a guy (maybe the main character) says "I'm going to get you next time!" The guy looks up and sees a woman standing behind the guy. The guy says, "Hey, you're the lady with the gun." And then the guy shoots the woman. The girl says, "...and you killed her!" And then she's gone. The guys says, ''That's what she was like in the beginning, then she changed." The guys goes back to his car and drives away. There's a lot of jokes here, but the movie is also funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts off with a very cool sequence of the aliens attacking Earth, which in and of itself is quite cool.  However, the film then shifts gears and introduces a bunch of alien races and their leader (played by a guy named George Lazenby) who has a problem with the humans, and how they are ruining his world.    I thought the movie went about as well as one could expect, with a few good action sequences here and there, and a few amusing moments.  The story is fairly interesting, as the film follows a bunch (but not all) of different alien races in their pursuit to reach a new planet.  One of the more interesting aliens (who's name I don't remember) is a man who is obsessed with eating, who then proceeds to go out and attack people.  Another alien is a guy who has an almost unbreakable sense of fashion and is constantly trying to find new clothes to wear, who ends up running into another alien who he accidentally destroys.  The film ends with a really fun scene where the aliens are trying to reach their new planet and the human race is trying to stop them.  I enjoyed the film, although it has a few flaws.  As for the movie itself, it was fun, but nothing really special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Carnie's Last Party"  is a classic story, one of the first movies that captured the American imagination, it is a love story, a story about the bonds of family, of love and the struggle to survive.  Carnivale's father is a carpenter, he works with his family all the time.    Carnivale has a dream about traveling with a famous singer in the backwoods of Georgia.  Carnivean dreams about being a singer.  He knows nothing about singing, he knows only how to play his guitar, but he gets a good deal with a great singing teacher and sings for a local crowd.  The singer comes to town, he has been singing since he was about ten years old and has been married a couple of times.  His wife's name is Susan, and her name comes from a local legend who died in the same place where Carnivales parents were murdered, so it is in his memory that he sings about his wife's death and the singer's life.  Susan and Carnivores father are good friends, they spend a lot of time together.  In the summer of 1964, the singer is having an affair with Carnivore's mother, who wants the singer out of the house.  But Carnivorous parents are too good for their daughter and Susan, they are against her.  After Susan's husband dies, Susan moves into Carnivor's house and it becomes her home.  It's a good story about love and family, a simple story with great performances by all involved.  A good movie, well worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a bit hard to believe that a film with a very serious plot, a plot that was pretty serious at first, but that it was also a very silly film, is actually a pretty good one. The film is set in a world that resembles a medieval Europe, but in a time when the world was a lot more peaceful and the knights had become very advanced. They are a very noble bunch of people, with a great sense of honour, and even a sense of humour, but when the knights go to battle, they are always a bunch of goofs who don't seem to be able to hold themselves together, and don't even seem to have any friends, which is quite odd considering how advanced they are. I'm sure most of you will enjoy this film, and I think it would be a great film to see if you like a good comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a fun movie, with a great story, well acted and written by the cast. A lot of action and some good gore but nothing too crazy or over the top. The movie is a good mix of comedy and action with some drama mixed in. The story is very different from what you see in most horror movies. The people in the town seem to be crazy and they are the only ones who can see this evil ghost that is terrorizing them. There is some great action scenes here and a few times in this movie you feel like you are really in the middle of a real fight. It has a good score and some great special effects, but nothing really too over the line. ___________ If you like the old classic ghost stories, but you also like a good monster movie, then this is a great movie to watch.

The boyfriend tells the police he doesn't know anything about it. A year later, his sister comes back to town and claims that she saw her dead daughter in a house the family used to live in. Her sister tells the story with a little bit of exaggeration, and her sister's husband also says something about a black cat in the swamp. It seems that there is a supernatural force at work in this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie! I was pleasantly surprised by how well the film held up for me, and I liked it a lot.   The film is about a boy, named John, who lives in a small town, with his two little sisters. He has a very poor father, who is a farmer, and his wife is a very mean woman. The little girls play with him, but they do not like him, so they run away from him.  This little boy, John, is very lonely, and very scared, because he has two sisters who hate him. John, and he is a lonely little boy.  He finds his way to a man named Don, who looks very much like a cowboy.  Don is a great friend to John, because Don is very brave and strong.  It seems that John does not like Don, because John is always being teased by the little girls, who are much younger than John, but who play with Don.  The other little girls also think that John is a nuisance, but John loves Don. John's mother does not approve of Don, but she knows that John must have some sort of reason to hate Don. In this story, John has no reason to do this.  John does have some reason, however.  In order to be accepted by his two sisters, John must take a job with a man who looks just like Don. When John comes to work for Don, he does not know who Don really is, but he is willing to accept Don as Don. Don is an old and very rich man, and Don gives John a job that will give John much money. John is very excited about this job, and is so happy to be a cowboy!  John, however, soon finds out that Don is not what he seems to be. Don looks just as he does on the cover of a book, but his real name is "Don" and he does many things for John. He gives John money, and sometimes even rides with John on his horse.  When John is riding Don's horse, John does something that he does when he is very scared.  At first, John thinks that he is scared because Don's face is not that of a cowboy, but then John sees Don's eyes. Don sees John, so Don is scared of John.  Eventually, John realizes that Don has seen something, and so he looks into Don's eye. He is afraid that Don
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about The Crow is that it isn't a movie. It is a story told through film and music. It has the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama. The story itself is not original but it is well done and well acted. The film does not have the same impact as the comic books and it does not feel like a rip off of the comic book.  It is very well made.    The Crow is a fantastic horror movie and I highly recommend it to all horror fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ (I can't help but think the name is a little odd. I thought "Grizzly Man" was an odd title, but at least it sounds like a bear movie.) I'm a big fan of the "Bearman" movies and this one is no exception. I'm not much of a fan of these movies, and I'm sure the people who love them won't find anything here that's worth watching. If I'm being honest, this is the worst bear movie I've seen. The story is a very poor one, and the bear is no better. The bear has no character, is completely devoid of personality, and is one of the more boring characters in the movie. The film is so poorly written and filmed, that you could make a movie out of the entire bear film. There's a scene where the bear gets his head stuck in a tree, and you could literally make a "Titanic" out of that. It's an ugly film. I was really disappointed with this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie. The story line is very well done and very interesting.  It will leave you wondering what is going on.  I have to thank all of the fans of the old "Battlestar Galactica" who have kept this show alive in our lives.  The fact that this show is now coming back to television is great news.  I love the old style of this show and can't wait to see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was so pumped to see this movie and I got a lot of laughs out of it.  The movie is about a man who is a big fan of the TV show "M*A*S*H."  He gets his head busted open by a grenade, gets a bad case of the runs, and comes home from the hospital to find his wife, and all his friends, gone.  He takes up the call of duty and gets a tour of duty with the famous 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a.k.a. the Mad Dog Battalion.  The Mad Dog is made up of some of the best soldiers in the Army.  It has the best equipment and is the most elite of the elite.    The film shows the soldiers getting in some serious scrapes.  They fight in some real dirty wars, get a lot more than they bargained for, and have some fun.  I also love how the film depicts the Army as a family and how they are very close and loving.     I was expecting more from a movie called "MASH" but it's more than worth a watch.  This is a movie that has a lot to offer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is really well done and it's a pretty good movie in the end.   This movie is really good in my opinion.  The story is interesting and I liked the characters.  I hope the movie will come to another release because it was really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised to see a trailer for the movie "Dirty Wars". I was also surprised to find that the movie was not made by the US military but by the CIA. So, I thought I would check the movie out.   The movie is based on a book of the same name.  The plot is very similar to the book and follows a former CIA agent who becomes a whistle blower and an FBI agent who tries to put him down.  When the CIA decides to "clean house" and get rid of all the old hands they need a new guy to do it. This is the story of that new guy: James Kirchick.  As you might guess he is a very odd man. He is a retired CIA agent and the only person in his office who knows anything about the Agency's activities.  He is an avid hunter and an avid photographer and he is not just a guy with odd hobbies, he has a knack for doing things in unconventional ways. This causes some conflict with the people in the CIA, who would like to get rid, or at least control, Kirchik.  His hobbies also put him in conflict with some people in his life.  In addition to that, he is also trying to find out about the activities of the other CIA agents in the country.  There are some funny moments in the movie, some of them were quite entertaining.  Overall, I found the movie to be a fun watch.  It is a bit hard to follow the plot, which is not that difficult, but you have to watch it all the way through to find the good parts.  I found it very hard to get into the character of Kirchic but he is enjoyable.  At the end of the movie we get a bit more insight into Kirchig's background and the events of the Vietnam war.  Some of the interviews are very funny and some are not so funny, but overall it is a good read.  If you are looking for a fun time with your friends, I recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is about a family with a lot of troubles: a daughter who's always missing, a son who is an alcoholic and an abusive father who can't seem to get out of the drunk tank. The father is a bad drunk, the daughter is a little girl with big dreams. She wants to be a doctor and her father doesn't want her to become a doctor because he thinks she will be a prostitute. He also hates the little girl and he has a habit of calling her names and trying to hurt her. Her mother is a prostitute who's also a bad drinker and is constantly abusing the little daughter. When her mother finds out about this, she takes the little one to a house where there is a doctor who's the best at what he does, the husband of a prostitute, the doctor's daughter, and a few other women. The doctor has a son too, who is a good doctor and is very good friends with the little doctor. They also have a housekeeper, a maid, and the father and the mother's daughter have an affair. The son and the daughter have a very good time together. The daughter and her mother are always together at work, and they are always having fun. They talk about all sorts of things: the little child is always getting into trouble and getting into fights. One day the little ones parents take her to a doctor to have her hair cut because she has a bad case of hair pulling. There the doctor has his daughter sit down next to him and has her pull her hair. The little doctor is so proud of her and thinks that she's a real doctor. The wife of the doctor is a really nasty drunk, and when she finds out that her husband is having an affair with the girl, she doesn't like the thought of that at all. She goes after the little Doctor and gets her drunk, beats her up and tries to get her pregnant. When the doctor tries to escape from the house, the wife gets mad at the doctor and the doctor also gets mad because he wants to have his daughter pregnant. This goes on for a while and then a woman comes to the house and sees the doctor lying on the ground and asks if he's all right. The man tells her that he's okay and she tells the doctor to get up. The woman doesn't believe him and tells the wife to go away. When she gets home, she asks the doctor if he wants her to come home with him. He
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie and will probably see it again, and I love a good mystery. This one was a bit slow, but had some very good acting, and a really great mystery. It is a little long at over 100 minutes, but there are a few great sequences and some nice action scenes. I was pleasantly surprised at the good plot twists, and the ending was pretty well done. The only thing I wish it had been longer is that there were some more sequences involving a certain lady and a certain man. The story is very well done, but I would have liked to see some more of it, maybe a bit more time spent with a particular couple. I know the movie is quite long, but it was a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is straightforward. A woman is accused of murder and the police and the media all believe her. There is a murder scene and she is accused.   It is a straightforward plot and that is what makes it good.  If you are a fan of horror films, this is a good one.  The film was made in 1954. The year was 1954 and it was a time when Hollywood still did some good films.  There were only two movies that were released in 1954 that were good and this is one of them.  The film was directed by Robert Wise and stars Joan Crawford, Robert Mitchum, Lee Van Cleef and Lillian Gish.  They are a pretty good ensemble and the cast was strong.  This film was well produced, shot and edited.  Wise was a talented director. He had a knack for making a story exciting and entertaining and that was what he did in this film.  With that said, I don't think this is the best film that Wise made but he was certainly a talented and interesting director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the same story as the first one. We are back on Earth and we meet again our alien friend, who now is the boss of our group. It's funny how they are all talking in different voices and it's just weird. It takes a while to understand the rules and the story. The alien is a lot more interesting now. It can be hard to watch because he is so annoying but it's fun and funny. The story and characters are really good and they seem very real. I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a great movie.  It's a great little comedy about a bowling ball that lives in a bowling alley.  There are two stories in this movie: The first is the bowling story.    The second is about a bunch of bowling balls, and a bunch more bowling balls.  There are also some very funny bits about bowling.  The plot is pretty simple: a bowling game is being played by a bunch, of bowling people.  A bunch of people are bowling a whole game.  And they have a whole lot of balls, like, a whole bunch of balls.   And then, they all get hit by bowling balls...   And it all goes down the drain.  So, it's a little more serious than I expected, but it's pretty funny.  It's a good little movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last night I went to see The Dark Knight Rises and I have to say it was good. It's very different than the previous films, with no obvious plot. We're told that Batman is the best defense against evil, and his only hope. We see him go from a simple, but well designed crime fighter, to a much more powerful and intelligent character, with a more complex backstory. It shows that Batman isn't just a good guy, but also a good thinker. We also see more of the villain Bane. He's a really interesting character. He has a plan to get power to everyone, and it's going to be extremely destructive. This is an awesome character. I'm glad I was able to see this film. It made me realize that I have a lot of things to learn about superheroes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very fun, entertaining movie that was directed by Brian De Palma.  It's a bit of a comedy, but there are a lot of references to De PalMA, the original.   The story is about a guy named Mike who works as a pizza delivery boy and has a lot to say to people about life and what he thinks about the world.  This is a movie you will want to show to your friends and have a good time with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really disappointed with this movie, it doesn't make me want to watch the original series again or at least I hope not. The story is boring, it's just a bunch of old guys talking about what to do and what not to do, and you get the feeling the story could have been a good one if it wasnt for all the crap in the story. And the acting is atrocious, the most pathetic acting I've ever seen, and it's even worse in the English version, which is what I watched. The music is pretty good though.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie has some great moments. The main character is an orphan, but has a great sense of humor, and a good heart. He's a very likable guy, and his mother has a pretty cool head on her shoulders. Her daughter, who's a little older than he is, is very smart, and I like the fact that she's a bit of a brat, but still a nice person to have around. There are a couple of kids in this movie, but they are only in the background and never have a real presence, and their roles are only there to be killed off at the end.  The movie is about a boy who's father is a "warrior" who kills things and takes them away to be hidden away in "special places". He also does this to the other boys in his village, so the kids in his neighborhood are afraid of him and his father. When the main character's father goes off to war, his mother takes him and hides him in a secret house, and he's able to go out with the other kids. When they get to a house where he thinks his father is hiding, he finds his father there, and they have a very nice conversation.    There are a few other kids, and the movie isn't really about them. The movie is a bit too long, so you might want to cut it out and just watch the movie.  It's not a bad movie, just not the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You're Not There" is a film that was made for a reason: to be a bit of fun. It's not necessarily a bad film (although it can get a bit silly), but it is definitely the kind of film that you'd be glad to have a few beers with. If you're looking for a film with an entertaining story and some great acting, you've come to the right place. If your looking for some solid, if not entirely original, horror, you'll find it here.

The movie is good, very good and the prison is a very realistic place.   I have seen a lot of prison movies, but I don't think I have ever seen a movie where you really feel the loneliness and desperation that this man feels.  The story is good and it does not waste the time.  A movie that is not easy to understand, but it is a good one, and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie about a small town where everything is normal, and everyone is happy.  There is a war, a murder, a family tragedy and a mysterious death.  A young boy named Charlie (played by Michael Gambon) lives with his father, who runs a butcher shop in the small town.  He is the one who tells Charlie that he must stay out of trouble.  Charlie wants to go out on a date with a pretty girl, and his father doesn't want him to, but the boy wants to have his own fun, so he decides to go on the date.  The town is full of odd characters and it is all happening in the early 1900s.  I enjoyed the movie very much and I am glad I watched it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot.   I think this is the best movie about a guy who takes a job to look after a little girl.  This is an original and funny movie about two characters, a little boy and a girl, who are not that much alike.  The story is a little different.  You have a little guy who is in a job where he is responsible for a little girls, so he gets to know her better and gets to have fun with her.  I didn't get the feeling that the movie is really about that little girl, though.  It is about the two characters and the little boy, who is a good kid.  They go out into the town, go to the mall, and buy some clothes.  We are told they are the best looking couple in town.  When they go out, we get a little glimpse of them.  The little girl is the little girl who always wants to be a princess and be in a castle.  But the little guy doesn't really like the idea of being in a kingdom and not being in control.  He wants to go home to his house and be a normal little boy.  So the story is about this little girl's life.  She wants to get her little prince and be princess and live in a huge castle. She wants her little baby boy to be able to get the prince.  And the little prince wants to find a castle that will give him a place to live.  There is no romance or romance between the two, although they have a few moments together.  One thing that bothers me about this movie is that there is not a whole lot of sex in it.  Why do we need sex when there are two people to love?  The sex scenes are very brief and not very interesting.  Some of the sex scenes would have made the movie better.  However, this is a great little movie that I recommend to people who are looking for a movie about little kids who love each other and want to live in big houses. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are times when the film is so good it's hard to believe it was made by a bunch of wannabe filmmakers with no sense of style or restraint.  The acting is great, the direction is great and the cinematography is great.    However the plot is just so contrived, and so completely stupid, and the fact that so much time is spent on the same characters is just ridiculous.  The movie starts with a series of scenes in which we see the characters of the film playing various video games and the like.  One of the characters in this movie has a rather odd job and the rest of the movie follows him as he tries to figure out why he's so good at it.  He eventually realizes it's because he keeps a bunch  of other people's money around.  When the characters find out about this they are upset at the man for getting them involved with a money making scheme, but the man himself insists that this is the only way he can get more money and that the only other way is for them to keep making his money.  As the movie progresses we learn about the man's background, his father is a wealthy businessman and he was raised by his father and his mother.  After his father passed away his mother decided to run off with the rich man's money to the point where he had no way to pay for the upkeep of his new home.  She left him and his new bride a large sum of money and told him to go to work for her.  The movie goes on to follow the man as he is constantly working to make his new house look like his father's, he has to keep the servants happy, the family pets, the friends who show up and so on.  At the same time he has trouble with the people who live next door.  There is a man named Mr. Johnson who lives next door and the man is a big fan of him.  Mr.  Johnson likes to play his guitar and there is also a neighbor boy who is a bit of a bully.  All of these people get in his way and when Mr.   Johnson finds out about the money going to Mr. Jone's new home he has a massive fit.  In the end the man decides that his new life is complete and leaves his old life behind.  We get to see him walk out of his house and onto a train as the movie cuts to black.  This movie is

This was one of those movies that was so awful, but at the same time, so hilarious.  It had a lot of laughs and it didn't have to be very funny at all.

The cast is great, the director is terrific, and the plot is a nice change from the norm. The pacing is a little on the long side, but that just gives it a more traditional feel.

While waiting at a gas station he runs into a beautiful lady named "Mama" (Rachael) and she helps him make some money to start a new life. It is a very sweet movie. The movie is not so much about the life of Derek, but about the love of a man and his relationship with his mother. I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially to people who like to see the life through the eyes of a young boy.

It was also a little weird, but in a good way, and a very enjoyable movie. I'll probably watch it again and again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say I am very impressed with the way this movie turned out.   This is a real thriller that leaves me breathless.    It was a very tense, intense, and thrilling movie.  In this movie the police chief and the FBI agents are very well-trained and have to find a way to get to the bad guy without alerting the people on the way.  The story is also told in an unusual way: the chief's wife is very disturbed by what is going on, and she keeps asking her husband about it.  This movie also has a lot of suspenseful scenes.  There are also some very funny moments.  I hope the director is given an Oscar for this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so happy that this movie came out. It was a beautiful movie and I loved it! It was not too long to watch and I really enjoyed it. I was a little worried that the movie was so long and it was hard to get through but it was very good.   The movie was about a young girl named Sarah (Renaissance) who is from the 18th century. Her father is a very rich man who is going to buy a large house and have a mansion for his wife. She loves the big house and her new life. When her father wants to move into the big place she wants to take a trip to the 19th century to show him her beautiful things and to be taken care of by a good man who will treat her like a princess. So Sarah is sent off to the 18-century and she is given a book and a little money and a nice carriage to go. I love how in this movie they did not show a lot of the details of what happened in the 19-century. It is about Sarah going to visit her father and he wants her to go with him and have fun in the old days. It has a nice romance and a lot to look at.  The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it is a little long and I don`t know how I can go on living in the 1800's!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie, I was really looking forward to this one.  I like the fact that there were no guns, just people shooting at each other with a pistol.  The movie is about a former Army Ranger (Mark Wahlberg) who is now a private investigator, and a former cop who is a retired Secret Service Agent (Kevin Costner).    The movie opens in a city that has a bad reputation as the home of a bunch of psychopaths and thugs.   When the FBI wants to move in on one of these thugs, a retired Army Ranger named Wahlburg (Wahlberg), and his assistant (Costner), they have to find a way to get in the city without being detected by the thugs.   The movie is well-done and very well done.  Wahlburger is a very believable guy.  His story is one of the most believable stories I have ever seen.  In the first act of the movie, you see a lot of Wahlbegers.  They look exactly like a bunch guys with funny haircuts.    Wahlbergh does a great job of portraying a guy who has been in the military for years, but is also an investigator.  He does a good job of playing a guy that is just as smart as the FBI guys.  The special effects in the movie are really well done and are well worth the price of admission.  If you are a fan of the films that are made by the late Michael Mann, then you are going to enjoy this movie.

The movie starts off with a bang, and not just because of the spectacular fight scene.  A big part of this movie is the romance between the two leads.  There is so much depth to their relationship, which is not just one-sided.  It is like they are a couple of lovers that have been through so much together.  The chemistry between the actors is outstanding.  Their chemistry is so good that it is almost like watching two people fall in love.  This is a movie that is a must see, especially with the way it is shot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight" (2008)  is a good example of what I like to call "the old school, no bullshit, hard hitting, gritty, no BS, no molly, no pretense" Batman. It is a classic and I've loved it for decades. The first scene is great and I love the old style Batman that is never out of place in any of his comic books.  There is nothing more satisfying to me than a story where the villain gets caught. The only other thing I can say about the story is that I wish the ending was a little bit better.    The film is full of great action sequences.  The one in the middle is pretty good, the other two are great.  I really like that they didn't have Bruce Wayne come back.  This could have been really cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's like a dream come true," says a girl who sees the film. "The most exciting part is when they are dancing together and when she is in the middle of the floor, they suddenly become a couple."   A new film in which two young people fall in love, is a very interesting and entertaining film.   It was a bit surprising that this film was made in Japan, although there is a lot of Japanese influence in the film, it is quite a different kind of film. This film has a lot more of a romance story than the other films in this series, but it has some elements that will appeal to many people. This is the second film in this film series and I like the ending a lot.  The cast is very good, especially the two young girls who are in love with each other.

I think this movie was a bit over rated, but I can see how a person who likes horror movies like the Saw franchise, would love this movie. The film is a bit of a slow burn, but once it starts to pick up, it does so with a vengeance. The acting was a little strange at times, but the character development was great. I also really liked the ending, but to be honest, I don't know why they had to do that.

He believes that all men have an appetite for women's breasts and that the man must sacrifice his right to bear children if he wants to go to heaven. His only method of getting women to get pregnant is by taking a girl to the beach and exposing her to the sun and water. This is done in order to prevent pregnancy, which the priest thinks will make her fertile. The girl then has the choice to have sex with a priest, or to go back home. When she returns home, she's immediately seduced by a young man.   There are some problems with this movie. First of all, the girl's name is only mentioned once and then never again. Her parents are mentioned in passing, but are never really brought up. The guy who's supposed to be the priest is played by John Candy. This guy has one of the most ridiculous looks I have ever seen in an American film. He has a very silly speech pattern, and he's constantly giving his mother the "oh, it's just a coincidence" excuse. He also has a great fake accent, and it's funny how much he sounds like someone from a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The only time I was really impressed was when he was on his knees asking a girl out.   the sex scenes are not all that hot. The girls are not very attractive, and they're all dressed in something like a schoolgirl outfit. They're also not all wearing swimsuits, so there's no great nudity in these scenes. The one scene that really stands out for me is the priest who seduces the girl. It's the only sex scene in the movie, and the sex is very brief. I found this to be a bit disappointing. There were a few other sex scenes that were better than this one.   "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a very good movie. It doesn't have all the things that I want out of a movie, but it is a good story, and some of the sex was very hot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the original Star Wars, but this is an awesome re-creation of the original trilogy.   As an actor who has seen a lot of movies, I was surprised at how many times I had to change my mind about things and get a good reaction from the audience.  The action scenes were well done and the plot and characters were well developed.  I also loved the way the director, Peter Chernin, handled the special effects.  It was as if he were in a film studio working with an old friend.  There were some rough edges but for me, the movie won my heart.  And I'm sure there are a lot more fans of the Star Wars franchise out there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very disappointed by this movie. I had not seen it in years. I do not know if I could watch it again. The story is a very strange one. I have read that a boy named Jack (not sure if he is the son of the main character) is brought up in a family that has two sisters. The youngest is a beautiful girl who is beautiful, smart, and very beautiful. She is a dancer, and she is also a very good dancer. This is very attractive to the other boys in the family, and is why Jack is called Jack the dancer. One day, the youngest sister is sent to the city of the future and is sent there by a man. The man, a man named The Man, is the leader of a tribe of people. The people that live in this future world are called "the People of the Future". When the little girl is sent, she is dressed in a very unusual and beautiful costume. The only thing she seems to have in common with the other children in the tribe is that she is intelligent. She has a special power, which she uses to hypnotize the other kids in the room. In this world, the tribe of People of The Future have been living in a city for about 200 years. This city is divided into a "People's City" and a "Government City". The People of this city are all "people of the people", and they have a government of sorts. They do not seem to have any sort of religion, so there is no real religion in this city. There is only one place in the city that is different from the other city, which is the "People of the People's City". This is a place where people who are special are taken and put into a special facility. This place is where Jack is kept. I guess this is where the power of the hypnotist is stored. The power that is stored here is that of the ability to hypnotise anyone who comes into contact with him. There are people who come into contact at this time who are not special, and the hypnotists are able to hypnotises them as well. I can not really say what happens to these people in the People of This City. They can do anything they want to do, but the only thing that seems to happen is that they are taken to the place where Jack the hypnotiser is kept, and put in a special room where they can never leave. This leads to them being
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun movie.   The movie was funny, but it was not just for laughs.  The main characters were likeable.  I liked that there was a little bit of a romance in the movie. I also liked the way that the movie dealt with the whole "death in the family" theme.  It is a good way to deal with a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it before but didn't quite know what to make of it until I saw the documentary, The Life and Death of Superman (1939), which was based on the novel by Joseph Heller, and which was a critical and popular success. It was filmed in 1940, when the War was just beginning and there was no shortage of stories about the exploits of Superman and his allies. This one seemed to me to be one of the more realistic ones, with the comic characters coming from the same world, with an occasional alien or two thrown in. The only real difference was that Superman was a civilian and there were a few other super-heroes of a more conventional kind, including a girl named Lois Lane.   In the beginning, Superman was being kept prisoner in a cave in the mountains by the Nazis and they wanted him for a special mission. When he finally gets free he finds himself face to face with Hitler, who is disguised as a member of the "Judeo-Bolshevik secret police" who want to assassinate Superman. Superman is too strong for Hitler but he is in no condition to carry out the task he is given. Superman can't fly so he is forced to get into the car of the Nazi, which is then driven into a tunnel that leads to a mine shaft. This shaft was mined by the Soviets. When they are out of the mine shaft they are discovered by a flying German plane which was carrying a bomb, and in the ensuing firefight Superman is wounded but manages to destroy the plane.  The opening sequence in which Superman fights Hitler in the mine is a classic example of the way that a superhero comic could be set up, with a villain and a hero and a mine, with Superman at the center of it all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Dark Knight Rises" is a great action movie. The film is about an organization called The Gotham City Police Department that is called to the home of a rich man named Bruce Wayne who has been killed in a car accident. It is a mystery that is not really answered until the end when a masked vigilante is sent to kill Batman. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan, who is an excellent action director. The story is really well written and has many twists and turns. I really enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to the next movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The film follows a young man named Max (Ryan Gosling) who is trying to start over in a new town in Colorado with his sister (Jared Leto) and her boyfriend (J.K. Simmons). He is looking to find a job and is having trouble with his accent, which is getting progressively worse as he goes through the years. The film is a little too serious to really enjoy it, but it is a great example of how not to make a movie. The cinematography is great (though it is not perfect) and there is a lot of action throughout the movie. I really enjoyed the movie, but I didn't really like it. I think the story is a good one and that Max will find his place in the world, but the story isn't interesting enough to keep me coming back. __________________________________________________________ If you enjoy my reviews, please subscribe to my RSS feed (http://www.emmyfawn.com/feed) or my Facebook page (http: //www.facebook.com/#!/emmy_fawn_emmyfox)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the year 2035, mankind has evolved to a level where the threat of extinction is no longer an abstract threat but a tangible one. There are those that would like to believe that it is a myth that we can ever become extinct, but the truth is that we are no longer human. In the world of the 23rd century, people are the only life form, and humanity is the most powerful and most dangerous life form on the planet. In this world, the human body is a perfect weapon. It is fast, strong, and durable, yet it can also be hacked and hacked away. There is only one way to defeat a human in a fight. Kill them in their sleep. With a gun.   One night, after having a few too many drinks, a bored man named Kevin (Bruce Willis) takes a long walk around the city. While on his way, he runs into a young woman named Samantha (Kate Beckinsale). They start to have a conversation and Samantha reveals that she is an android programmed to be his wife. He is surprised by this revelation and tells her that he doesn't like people with "goddamn minds."   As they walk home, he sees that there are three people waiting for them. One is Samantha's boyfriend, the other two are her parents, both of whom Kevin doesn't know.  After getting into a fight with one of the guys, Kevin realizes that they are not people. They are machines, designed to kill. He tries to kill the first one, but he gets caught in the crossfire. Kevin is able to get away from the other machines, but is too late to stop the first robot.  The robot is a female android named Samantha. She is also Kevin's creator, and she has programmed him to be her "husband."  Samantha wants Kevin to take her home to live with her. He refuses.  He tells her about the dangers of the human race and what the human species can do. Samantha tells him that the human mind is a dangerous weapon and that she will be the first to make it obsolete.  She tells him she is a woman and that he is to be a man. She asks him to take off his shirt and she tells him to strip for her. She explains that men are not human. He says he is going to take the machine's word for it. Samantha says she doesn't believe him and that men do not have brains. She shows him

The cast is very good and the movie is pretty good. It is one of the better horror movies I have seen. The music is good. The ending is a little odd. There are a lot of things going on in this movie and the way they are presented can be quite confusing. The movie does not end on a good note. I think that if you like a good horror movie this one is worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I just finished watching the movie "Losing My Religion" and I'm so glad I did! It is a funny movie about a guy that wants to be an atheist and he is trying to find a church to go to and ends up having a spiritual experience. I loved this movie and it is a must watch! I only wish they did more of it! I am a fan of the show "Seinfeld" and this movie was a lot of fun to watch. This movie is good enough to be watched on an airplane! I really enjoyed the movie and recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first real experience with the film was on the way back from New York after a long weekend with my family. I remember watching it and thinking it was pretty good and very funny.  In fact, I was so laughing I decided to go back and watch it again.    This time I sat through the entire thing!   Now this is a good comedy.  I found it very funny and was looking forward to the rest of it.  It is really quite enjoyable.  Some things that really stand out to me about this film are the ending where it gets pretty ridiculous, but at the same time you get a really good ending.  This is a comedy that is funny and entertaining, and that is always a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When it comes to action movies, I have to say that "The Expendables 3" is a must see movie.  The first two movies were great action movies.    I think the third one was even better.  The story is interesting, the action is awesome, and the characters are great.  When you see the three action stars go to war, you want to see what they will do with their weapons and how many people they will kill.  But they don't stop there.  They get back to their normal lives and have fun.  That's what makes a good action movie. "The Expeditions" is the third film in the series.  It starts off with the same group of people, but now they are in Iraq.  Then the group gets a new member named Kip, who has a bad attitude.  After they lose a few people, they decide to do some good by helping the local people.  This part of the film is great. You can feel the excitement of the three men who are about to start their next mission.  I didn't like the movie because it was a little repetitive.  At the end of the movie they are all going home.  Also I think there were too many scenes of the characters running around with weapons.  My favorite part of "The Exfiltrations" is when Kip is chasing after the leader of the bad guys.  He is a little like Han Solo in the Star Wars.  There is no better guy in the world.  There was a really funny scene in "The Last Days" where two guys who are being chased by a helicopter are running from each other.  One guy gets shot, the other gets knocked down.  To get them out of the way, the helicopter crashes and they go down together.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have a good ending.  If they were going to have a real ending, it would have been really funny.  You can see why they did this movie.   There were so many scenes where they were running around and they are shooting guns.  Like a really bad movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies and they aren't too scared of guns.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, it is a masterpiece of an adaptation of a great story, with the addition of a few minor details. I have not read the original version, so I cannot say if the film captures the spirit of the novel exactly, but I can say that it does a good job of capturing the tone and spirit of that story. The music is also very good, and a very strong point of the film.   It is not a very good film, but it is the best adaptation of The Old Man and the Sea I have seen. I give it a 9 out of 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the better horror movies of the year.   This movie was made for a lot of reasons and a good part of it is its setting.  The movie is set in a haunted house, the main character, a young boy named Will (played by James McAvoy), has been staying at the house for a few years, the house is pretty much haunted by a few ghosts. Will is the only one who can see them and they haunt him.  After some strange occurrences, Will finds out that the house isn't really haunted at all, and he goes looking for a way to escape.  Unfortunately he isn't the only person who has a bad experience in the house, there are a bunch of children who have been sent there to learn about their family's history.  Will is a little bit of a loner and he's really scared of the other kids, so the movie starts off slow and suspenseful.  It doesn't take long for Will to realize that this is the house where the ghosts are.  But not only that, the ghosts also have a connection with the young boy, and it's up to Will to find a way out before the house becomes completely filled with them.  There are also a bunch a other characters in this movie who are just as interesting as Will.  My favorite part of the movie is when the ghosts start showing up and Will has to run away.  What I like even more about this movie is that the acting is good, and the music is pretty good as well.  I think the story is good as the movie builds up to a pretty scary ending.  Overall, this movie was pretty good, but it has its flaws.  For one, it has a lot going on in it and it seems like the characters are thrown in there for no reason.  This doesn't make it any less interesting and I think that it would be a better movie if there was just one main character and a few others to talk to, or at least some of the ghosts were a little more focused on Will.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film opens with a bang, with a great montage showing the aftermath of the first nuclear war, and of a major nuclear war in general. This movie is one of the best, because it is so well-written, with the same great writing style from the original. There are also some interesting things that occur in the story, such as the death of the famous scientist and military leader, Professor Rabinowitz, in a bombing raid, while being on a scientific mission, and the development of an artificial intelligence that can learn human emotions. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old Western.   The scenery, the acting, the music, the writing, all the usual Western stuff is here.

I have a confession to make:  My first and only movie that I watched after I watched the original Star Wars.  I am not sure if I can ever get over it.  Star Wars is a science fiction film.  But in its own way it's also a fantasy film. This is the most amazing thing ever.  If you want a sci fi film then you should definitely watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the film, a bunch of boys are playing at a football game, when the game is called off due to the death of the coach. One of the kids gets injured and has to be carried off the field, while another player gets sent off the team. One player is injured even worse than the last and the coach decides to forfeit the game. When the player is carted off the scene, his coach runs over and tells him that he's not getting a pass and is going to play on the other team. He tells the kid he won't be missed and is very upset that he lost his chance to play. The next day, the kid is walking home from school when he hears the coach say "I hate to see you go", and runs to the school to see the coach dead. When he reaches the school, the coach's assistant (the dead coach's daughter) is on the roof with a gun. She orders the boy to get on the ground and take the gun from her. The boy runs off and hides in a locker until the assistant puts a bullet in his leg and she runs off. The last shot in the movie is the dead coach looking up at the sky with his hand raised up in victory.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** This is a very interesting story. It is told from the perspective of a young man named Peter Parker, a high school junior in Queens, New York. Peter Parker is a nerdy guy who likes to hang out at his Aunt May's house, which is located in the park in the middle of a small town called Spider-Man's Town. Spider-man is a superhero that is very popular in New York City. This film was made in 1990 and directed by Sam Raimi. The plot follows Peter Parker and his best friend Ned Leeds as they go on a trip to Spider-town to visit Aunt May. During their stay, Peter and Ned meet the Green Goblin, a supervillain who tries to murder Ned. As the movie goes on, we see that Ned's uncle is also a supervillian, and he is not very nice. Peter also meets Mary Jane Watson, an ex-girlfriend of Peter's, and she seems to like Peter a lot. We also get to see Ned's new girlfriend, Mary Jane's new boyfriend, and other characters. It seems that the people in Spider-world have a lot of fun and are not afraid to get involved with each other. The music in this movie is also great. There are several great songs in the movie. ********************** This movie also has a great cast of characters, and there are many scenes where Peter and Peter have a great time together. ************** ************************* ********** *********** ************* ********* I really enjoyed this movie.

I am a huge fan of the show "Grimm" and it was a shame that I did not get to watch this movie when it was first released, because I would have loved to know more about this town and the characters. The acting was great, and the story was a lot better than I remember it being. I think it's great that the producers of the movie have brought the show back, because this movie was definitely worth seeing.

I've seen several movies in which the main character is an older man, but this movie has something different about it. It's more of a comedy, and it is not a bad one. I think this movie was a big hit with some of the movie critics at the time, and I think it still is. I can see why it got a "good" rating.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out with a scene from the life of a young man. He was a good student and a good person. One day, he found a strange object that made a lot of noise when he moved around with it. It was a man, dressed in a suit, with a strange device on his head. His mouth had an opening and a hole in the back of his head and he was wearing a hat and a white coat.   As he was running around in the woods, the strange man suddenly jumped out from behind a tree and ran towards him. He grabbed the young man by the collar and started to push him towards the hole on his back.   the young boy was terrified, but managed to keep his composure and pushed the man into the hole, where the man had a horrible death. He then had a strange feeling in his gut and felt that he was being followed. He kept trying to escape, but the strange men kept chasing him. Finally, he ran out of the woods into a field, where he was found by a man. The man was an old man, who was not happy to find a body in the field. He asked if he was a scientist, and the young son said that he wasn't. The old man looked at him and said, "Well then, let me give you a quick lecture on how science works."   After the lecture, he put the young scientist in a wagon and took him home. There was a strange smell and a strange greenish light coming from the back door. The wagon started to move and the man in the white coat told the young men to leave. They ran to the back and saw the green light, which they had never seen before. They thought it was a lamp, but as they got closer, they saw a man in a green coat. The young scientist said that it was the man that was following them, but they didn't believe him.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are no real "plot holes", as the plot involves two people getting married, and a whole lot of drinking, and the movie is really, really funny.  The movie really gets going about midway through when a bunch of people who don't know each other show up and start talking about their day.   The funny part about this movie is that it's really not funny at all, and it's not that different from a lot of comedies.  If you like "Star Trek" or "Spy Kids", you'll like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other great thing about this movie is the fact that it was filmed by a man named Richard Dreyfuss. He is an actor who I've been watching movies with since I was a kid. He's a good actor, but he is known for being a bit wooden. That's why I like him, because he is able to make his acting look natural. The thing is, this is a great movie, a great ensemble cast and a great story. I wish I could say it was better than the other great Richard Drieffes films. I don't know what it is, but this is really good. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with a cast of talented actors.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Tales from the Darkside" is a movie about a couple of guys in their twenties who are in a gang of thugs called the "Dark Shadows." These guys are the "bad boys" and they do a lot of killing. The movie is about these guys. They have all these bad guys and they are all bad, but at the end of the day, they are still "good guys." The movie also features a little girl named Daphne (Linda Hamilton) who is also part of the Dark Shadows. She is part of a group called the Dreaming Girls and she and the Dark Shadow boys get involved in a robbery. Daphie gets into a car accident, but she gets back up and kills one of the gang members with a knife. The gangster dies but the Dark Lord (Gary Busey) wants to get revenge and he goes to Daph and tells her to kill the other guy who was in the accident. She doesn't know who he is and he wants to kill her but Daph refuses to do it. The Dark Lord kills the guy in the car accident and then he takes Daphine to a remote area where they have a big camp fire. The next day, the gang starts to get restless and the next night, Daph wants to have sex with a man she just met. This man is called "Bart" and he is a drug dealer. DAPHINE is reluctant to do this because she is afraid of being killed. The two of them go to a cave where they talk about the gang's problem and about a drug called "Fool's Gold" that they use. The drug can make you believe you are something you aren't. DPHINE is also on a lot that she doesn't really understand and she thinks Bart is lying to her about the drugs. Bart tells her about a guy who is a "loser" who has the power to see the future. Bart believes that the Dark Lords and the Dreamings are trying to take over the world. DPhine realizes that Bart is right and that she is going to have to kill him to save the world and that's when she tells Bart that she has to kill Bart. This is the beginning of a series of murders. She murders the Dark lord and his goons and then she kills Bart's friend, which leads to Bart killing Daph (which leads to the Dark lords killing Bart's girlfriend). Then Daph has to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a reason why the movie is named, 'Somewhere In Time' and it is a beautiful film, that is full of wonder and wonder is the perfect adjective to describe this film.  The main character, Sam (Matthew McConaughey) is a very strange man who is the only man who knows where he is and how to get back to the future. Sam doesn't know how to be human.  He is a man who just doesn't understand the emotions of the other people in his life.   When he is in the future he has to learn how to interact with people again and again.  There are many different people and many different emotions in this movie.  I just think this is a great movie, it doesn't have many sequels and it doesn' t get old.  This movie is amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not an expert on film, but I do know that I have watched this film at least three times, once as a viewer, once with a friend and once again with my husband. This is a classic of the genre, a film about a couple who try to have a happy marriage in a strange and mysterious environment. The film is a mix of adventure, humor and mystery. This film is fun, a classic adventure movie and one of the best films about love ever made. I wish I could have seen it again with a different group of people, a different director, and a different plot, but this was a very enjoyable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw this film, I was not a huge fan. I thought the film was too much like a film made by a teenage boy.  I didn't like the characters or the script.  In fact, I felt like I was watching a film by a teenager who has no idea how to act or what to say.  I also didn't enjoy this film.    The second time I watched this film I really liked it.  It was more adult in nature.  There were some great acting performances, especially from James Cromwell and the young Daniel Craig.  I liked the story, which was a bit of a twist. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We had heard that the film was going to be about a guy named John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) who is out to make a big score and take a woman named Katana (played in the film by Tilda Swinton) hostage. We were not expecting the action scenes to be so good, but even more than that, the movie is about an old man who is a hunter, and how he gets to know and respect people who know a little bit about things like that. We saw the man as a kind, gentle, good man who has lived his life without any fear of anything, but he has lost his best friend. His daughter, played by Keira Knightley, is played by Rachel Weisz. The film does a great job of setting us up to care about the characters, and we are drawn into the story by the way they act, and by how much we want to see them get away from the law and take revenge.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* It is a story of a young man who wants to be a boxer and a very bad guy who wants the same thing. ****************************** The movie is about a boxer named Michael (Logan Lerman) who has no good options in life. His mother (Molly Ringwald) is a drunk, his father (Michael Keaton) is an abusive alcoholic and his brother (Michael Stuhlbarg) is just a bit crazy. So Michael decides to leave home and go to the boxing ring. He finds a great manager named Eddie (Billy Bob Thornton) and he manages to make the big money. But after a few fights, the money runs out. Then Michael finds a new boss named Bobby (Sidney Poitier). They have a great relationship, but Michael soon realizes that Bobby is a bit of a coward. After a fight, Bobby is kidnapped by a gang and Michael decides he must save him. He does and in the process, he is kidnapped again and tortured by the gang. But when Bobby finds out that Michael has escaped, he tries to take the fight to Michael. ********* The movie features one of the best performances I have ever seen by a young Logan Lerman. He is a terrific actor and this is a good film for him. It is also good for Michael Keaton as well. The rest of the cast is all good, but not great. I guess that is to be expected with a movie like this. ************ This is a very good movie that you should see if you have a chance to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The End of the World" is a film about a family that's on the road for the holidays. When their van breaks down in the middle of nowhere, the family decides to head to the beach. There, they encounter a woman who is possessed by the spirit of a dead relative. Soon after, the entire family is possessed as well. The movie's premise is simple, but it has a lot of twists. The film is a supernatural action film with a lot to offer. It is a fun, action packed ride, but one that you'll want to keep your eyes open for as you'll see some things that will have you scratching your head.  As the credits rolled, I felt a little uneasy.   The film is directed by Paul Schrader, who directed such classics as "Fatal Attraction", "Eyes Wide Shut", and "Scream". "The End Of The World" was shot during the summer of 1990 and features a few familiar faces from the first two films.  The actors who play the family are all familiar as well, with the exception of Michael McKean, who plays the father. His character, however, is played by a newcomer, Steve Martin.  "The film's script was written by Paul W. S. Anderson and Jonathan M. Goldstein, and the screenplay is quite good. The pacing is slow and there is a lot going on in the story. This film was written to be a campy, over-the-top film that would appeal to a wide audience. The special effects are quite nice and I think that there is some really cool imagery here."    It is no surprise that "The Night of the Hunter" is also a camp film. It has a story that's all about camp and campfire. It features a large cast of well-known people, including a young Jeff Bridges, a great cast of young actors, and even a few big names in music. It was a nice change from the more serious fare of "Scary Movie" and "The Toxic Avenger". The action is great, and there are some great scares.  It's a great film.  I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original Star Wars  is not a great movie but it's a solid movie.  I remember the first Star Wars very well and I don't think it has aged all that much.   It's a classic, and a good classic.  It doesn't really look like a Star Wars movie, but that's okay.  I like to watch Star Wars movies.  There are plenty of good ones.  They don't have any special effects, they don't use the best sound effects, but they're still fun.  So what if there are no special effects?  I still like them.  What is special about them is the fact that the special effects make the movie look like it was made by a very talented movie director.  When I saw the movie, I was not disappointed.  The first StarWars  looked like a movie made by an ordinary person who knew what he was doing.  This was not bad, and I like the first one a lot.  After that, I got a bit bored.  In the movie we see a guy, a princess, and some other people from the future and the past.  We see a lot of ships, and space battles, and an alien invasion.  My favorite parts of the movie are the space battles.  Star Wars is not a science fiction movie, it's an action movie, and the space battle is one of the best action scenes in the movie.   The music in the first movie is good.  But the music doesn't sound like the music from the second movie.  I liked the music in this movie. It doesn´t sound like a music from a science fictional movie. The music from Star Wars 2 is better, I think.  Although I did like Star Wars, I think it was a bit boring.  If you liked the first, I don´t think you will like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a lot like a western, except that the movie is about a man with a supernatural power, and the guy with the power uses it to protect the girl he loves. This is a good one, and I like the idea.   I was surprised to see that this is a remake of a French movie (it was released in France in 1991).   It is the French remake of the TV series of the same name, starring Jean Reno. Reno is a famous actor from France who played a guy with supernatural powers in the TV show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friends and I have seen the original movie a few times, but never this one. I don't know why, because it is very good, but a bit on the long side for an animated movie.   We begin with our hero and heroine (as the name suggests) on a road trip in the movie. As a matter of fact, they are driving along a road in the middle of nowhere, a nice enough scene to begin with, except that a couple of weeks later they are in a movie theater, where the whole movie is shown, and they are sitting there at a movie, just as they did when they were on the road. We're introduced to our two characters as we see them being interviewed by a TV news reporter. He asks them about their adventures on the movie, and how they were able to find it. They are amazed that they could find it, and that they were in it. The interviewer asks them if they ever thought about returning to the movie once they got home. They tell him that they might, but they have a date that night. He then asks them what they want to do after they get home. It seems that they want some fun, so they head off to the local park, where they meet some other people and go to a picnic. They get bored of this picnic, so we are told, and decide to go to the movies. It is a good idea. They head out and start to get bored. They meet a few other people, and start drinking, but get bored again. They go to another movie, which is pretty good, except it ends before they get to the good part. They see a very interesting, and pretty good movie. The rest of the movie is just boring, except for the bad guy (played by a guy named "Barry") who keeps trying to get the girls to come with him, and he keeps beating them up. Eventually the bad guys (all women) get bored, and leave the movies, so the girls are left with Barry. After he beats them up some more, they leave, and come back to the park. As they go to go home, Barry goes off to look for a car, so he can go home with the girls. They come back and start looking for the car. He tells them that the car will be there in about 10 minutes, so it's time to go.  After this, the movie ends.  What a terrible movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "In a land ruled by the wicked, the good are few, and the evil more powerful."  -Hugh Nibley "The Great War is a classic movie about a young man who is a victim of a terrible war. The hero of the film is played by a very handsome young man with a great face and a charming smile. He is called 'Corky' because he is so cheerful and is so eager to be of service. The man has just enlisted in the United States Army and he is going to France. His name is Ben Groom, and he looks like a young George C. Scott."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a well-acted and fun action comedy starring Robert Downey Jr., as Tony Stark (who happens to be the first person to ever steal a nuclear weapon, and subsequently use it to fight evil), as well as Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Natasha Romanoff, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.  They all get to play off each other well, but I'm going to get into the main plot here:    The film opens with Iron Man (the character that has been on my wish list for quite a while) being in a hospital in Germany, where his hand has been amputated.   Iron Man is the guy who made the world a better place, and he's getting a new hand.  He then has to put on a disguise to sneak into a meeting with a scientist named Dr. Arnim Zola, who's looking for a new super-soldier to replace him.  Zola doesn't want Iron Man's original hand, so Iron Man puts on a new one.  Unfortunately, Zola's team, which includes a female named Arnim who's a master of disguise and the deadly assassin Hedy Lamarr, don't take too kindly to Iron Man and Arnim's "disloyalty".  So when they hear that Iron Man has a new and improved hand, they decide to kill him. The plan goes off pretty well until a small army of super-villains (notably the super-strong Man-Wolf, the super weak Giant-Man, and the flying super-dog called the Wasp) come to their rescue.  The movie then jumps back and forth between Iron Man, Zolas, and his team.  It's really funny, and has some really good action, but the action is pretty much all in the middle, where Iron Man does his best to get out of every one of their hands.  They're a good bunch, but they're pretty one-dimensional, and not very interesting to watch.  I think the movie could have been a little better if the movie had been cut a little bit.  If the movie was a little more focused, it could have made a lot more sense.  The movie doesn't feel very strong when you look at the cast:  This is one of those movies that really doesn't have a strong villain, and it's pretty much the same guy in every one, and this movie is no
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a lot of good scenes. The first one is the best: a guy gets out of his car and sees the train coming toward him. He climbs into the back seat of the train to get away from the oncoming train, but the train stops in front of him, the guy gets in the train again and they ride down the rails.  The train stops again, but this time it goes up a hill. The guy climbs out and starts to walk down the hill, but a bunch of people are yelling at him, and then he falls off the hill and dies. The people yell, "Die! Die! Die!" and throw rocks and other things at him. I like the guy, but they were way too mean about it.     Next we have the man who is the one who found the body of the guy who was killed.    He finds the body and he's a bit sad.  He tries to talk to the other people in the car, but no one will talk to him.  Then we have a guy, he looks kind of strange, he has the wrong shoes and he seems to have a strange smell on him. The man decides to look for a car with a woman who looks like he can be his girlfriend.  We have this strange car that seems to be full of people, but there are no seats in it. There is only one person in the back.  It turns out he is the guy that found the dead guy, who is actually the son of the man.  So, he runs out of the car and starts running.  This is where the movie gets really good.  The people chase him all over the city.  I really like the car chase scene.  There are a lot more cool things in this movie.  When the train gets away, the guys who are in the front of the cars are not happy with him. So, they start to shoot at him with a gun.  They are all really good looking.  But they are all trying to kill him. Finally, one of the guys that is in the top of the back of the driver's seat, takes out a knife and stabs the guy in the throat.  Now that's a good scene. The car chase is great too.  After they are done killing the guy and they have all died, the man runs back to the car with the girl and he tells her that he

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been fascinated by the science fiction of H. G. Wells. I think I was a bit young when I first watched the movie version of his War of the Worlds. It is an epic story that I enjoyed greatly. The book version of the story, of course, is a little different. The War of The Worlds, written in 1895, is set in a completely different world. It is a future society with no advanced technology, yet it is not a dystopian one. It seems to be a very stable society, yet the world is still being ravaged by the great and terrible war. It has been a very long time since I have seen the movie. This was the second time I've seen it, and I really enjoyed it. I also thought it was nice that it was set in London, rather than some place that would be unfamiliar to most people. There are some changes that are obvious: there is a different way of speaking; the aliens are a little more intelligent and the war is not as horrible as the book. I would say that the story is very much like the book, except that there are some differences. The movie version seems to have done more with the world, and in a way is a bit more realistic. The story is a good one.

First off the soundtrack is great.  This is an older movie, but I love it!   This movie is fun and fast paced.  It's a great action movie, with a great story, great characters and lots of laughs.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ This is a good old horror movie that has been used many times, but I never had any problem with it until I watched it. The movie is about a woman, Mary, who goes to see a man she has a crush on. She thinks he will take her away to the mountains. Instead, she meets him at the local train station and he leads her to the railroad tracks. She tries to run, but he catches her, wraps her up in a blanket and forces her to ride the train. As the train leaves, he makes her drink a cup of wine. Then, he tells her the story of the "Lone Ranger". The train comes to a stop and the woman screams in terror. A policeman comes on the train and sees the man tied up. He starts to pull him out, but the woman runs away. As he follows her, she runs up to the cliff and falls to her death. As she dies, she shouts "LOOK OUT FOR THE LONE RANGER!" It's pretty scary, but not as much as I had hoped.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Risky Business" is the story of a man (Michael Douglas) who, on the eve of the wedding of his daughter (Kate Capshaw), decides to get away from his life in New York to visit a man he met in a bar in France (Dwight Howard). After he is introduced to the man, he falls in love with him and begins to plan for the future of their relationship.  It is about a man who wants nothing more than to find love.  I really love the movies of John Huston!   The films I love about him are "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."   In "Risky", Huston tells the story in a very clever manner, using all the tricks that made his earlier films great.   This film is about an ambitious man who is living in Paris and decides to go back to his family and home in New Jersey in order to plan a new life for himself.    He finds a beautiful French woman named Jeanne (Kate Hudson) who works as a seamstress at a small hotel.  She is married to a man named Michel (Daryl Hannah) who is not interested in her.  When he discovers she is a dancer, he is very attracted to her. After a short flirtatious relationship, he decides to propose to her, and she accepts.  He takes her to his house where they begin a long and passionate love affair.  They both try to forget the past and concentrate on what lies ahead.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film.  I don't know why this was so poorly received in America, but I think the reason is because the story is very dull.    The story involves a group of mercenaries who are sent to the desert to take out a dangerous group of terrorists.  The mercenaries are led by a guy called Mr.  Hulks, who's a good guy.  He's a bad ass and seems to be the leader of the group.  Unfortunately the mercenaries are a bunch of jerks who just want to get some quick cash.  This group of bad asses is led by   Mr. ________.  Mr.________ is a guy who's in it for the money, not the cause.  It's not that the mercenaries act this way; it's just the way they are.  They're all very stupid and they act like they don't care.  You can tell that they don's care because they're acting so stupid.  There are other bad guys as well, but this one is the worst.  While this movie does have some action, it's very minimal and doesn't have much plot.  I was a bit disappointed with this movie because I thought it would have been better if it was a more action packed film. The characters were also very bad, but that's a small price to pay for the good action scenes.

It is based on the true story of a man who was able to survive on the streets of New York City and a story of how he did it.  This movie was a true story and as I watched it it made me sad to think how little of a life we get to live on the planet earth.  It has an old time feel to it, and I think this is what makes it so great.  There are also some very good performances, and a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. The main character is the usual one - very much like the one from "The Man With No Name". It's a movie of a man who can't get a good job, and is living in a small city called "Battleground". His best friend is a girl named "Ruth" (the "Man With No name" was a girl) and she tells him that there's a good chance he will get a job in a company in the city. The movie shows the main character's life at the beginning, when he has no skills and is not wanted in the company. He is given a job working in a store in the mall. But he doesn't have a friend in the store. He works at night and is afraid of people he doesn�t know. At the end, he's finally accepted in the "Barrack". He's working for a big company. There is a nice girl in the office, and she's very much in love with the main man. The rest of the story is a mystery.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This is one of those movies that makes me laugh, and smile, and then make me cry. Â It's so much fun to watch a movie like this, and the characters are so memorable.  There are a few flaws with the story, and it's not exactly a great story.   Â There's a lot of action and violence in this movie, and I did not see a lot done with that.  The story is about a girl named Sophie who is being stalked by a killer, and her friends try to help her by telling her about a murder that has occurred, but Sophie doesn't believe them.  But then a few days later she finds a body.  Then the killer, the "Gorilla Killer" turns up, and kills her, and they figure out that he's a serial killer.  He has killed and dismembered many people, and has become known as the "Sophie's Killer" because he was stalking Sophie, and he was killing because he had gotten bored with Sophie, so he went to the police and made up a story about how Sophie had been cheating on him.  There's also a guy named James who helps the group of friends, and helps them solve a case and find a killer. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror movies, or just any kind of movies.  It's very funny, and you'll laugh, you'll cry, and even you'll be feeling sick.  This is a fun movie, so if you like horror movies or are a fan of comedy, this is a great movie for you to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was the movie I was waiting for.  I know this sounds like a strange combination, but it's really quite good.    I can't think of any other movie like this one.  This movie is all about the fact that the guy who is supposed to be the bad guy is not really bad at all.    This is the most realistic and realistic bad guy ever made.  And it's funny as hell.  He's a bit of a snob, but his personality doesn't change throughout the movie.  It's pretty funny, too.  In the beginning, we see a couple of the other villains, who are even more ridiculous than the first guy.  They're the guys who play basketball and wear funny suits.  But, you can't help but love them.  That's why I like this movie.   I really like the movie, and it's definitely a classic.  I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first time I've watched a film which doesn't have a happy ending. I was expecting an ending where a young girl, a child who's never seen anything bad happen to her, gets into a car accident and gets saved by a man who's the only person who has ever shown her kindness, the same kindness she's been deprived of for most of her life. But instead she gets kidnapped, sold, raped, beaten, starved and abused and is used as a prostitute in a brothel. It's a very disturbing film. It doesn't make any sense. The film ends with a very depressing sequence of a girl, who was once such a nice, kind girl, being beaten, raped and being made to do all sorts of degrading things. It was like something out of a nightmare. This film is horrible. The only positive thing I can say about it is that the music in it is really great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this movie before, so I have no idea how good it is. But I'm glad I saw it.    The movie opens on a train moving through a dark tunnel. A young man (Jeffrey Tambor) is trying to sleep in the cabin. The noise of the train can be heard in the background, as is the distant wailing of a man who is clearly dying. As the train moves along the tunnel, the man is seen to be alive for a short time, then suddenly dies. As we watch the train, we can see that it is being held together with a rope.  A young woman (Jennifer Ehle) and her daughter (Lindsay Lohan) are watching the train from the other side of the tunnel. They are about to get off the train when they are approached by a man (Kevin Spacey) who wants them to come to his train. They don't want to go with him, so he has to make the decision for them. He tells them that he is a conductor and has been for a long time. He also says that his wife (Tessa Thompson) is ill and has to be in the hospital, so that is where they want to stay.

It is a good story about a boy named Paul who has a brother named Bob who is a great musician and a bad actor. Paul is the only brother and Bob is the best.  The movie was fun to watch.

It is about a group of students who take part in a science experiment and get more and more involved in the science and end up going through some pretty intense stuff and making some interesting discoveries.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is hard to say much about the story and the characters because I am not sure about them. I like the setting, but I like to have a lot of people in my head and I know it is a bad idea to be thinking about everybody. The actors do a good job in the story, but they don't get to do too much. I have seen the movie four times and I am still not sure what to make of it. It is a good film but I don't think it is going to have much of an impact on the film world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A nice, interesting film with a great cast.   The story is pretty interesting.  A good story and good acting.  I found myself looking forward to the film.  There are some minor issues, mainly that the story is too simplistic and lacks depth.  As a storyteller, the director should have given us a more complex story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off on a cliffhanger, and the first half of the movie is really good. We see the two leads as they're both being pulled in by the other and have to figure out what's going on. It is a very unique twist on a typical action movie. The two of them are going to get in some serious trouble, but they'll learn a lot about each other and the world that's going to be thrown at them.   But the movie never gets a chance to really get going. They end up fighting the same guy over and over again, and it's hard to care about the main character because the rest of the cast is so forgettable. We've got the boring but competent villain, the generic "hero" who is going to go crazy and kill someone, and a few other characters who are there to throw in a few jokes.  ....  1 0-0-0  It's been a while since I've seen a movie with this much action and excitement and it doesn't get any better than this.   is the best action movie of the year. It's a great movie and I'd recommend it to anyone. It isn't perfect, but it's a good watch all the way through.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Practical Magic" is a fun, entertaining, and surprisingly deep story of a man who, after an unfortunate accident, finds himself living a magical life in a magical place.  This place, known as the Magic Kingdom, is located on a magical island that's surrounded by a magical sea, but the only way in is to go down a magical path that is hidden by the foliage of the jungle.  The path is very winding and requires great skill and skillful driving to get to the destination.  Once there, however, the Magic King has a lot of fun with a small, but adorable group of his guests, including a couple of magical dogs.    This movie has a great blend of comedy and magic and it's great to see a movie like this made so many years ago.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Picture Show"  is a movie about a movie theater, where people go to see a new movie. The movie is "The Last Days of Disco", and the movie is really funny. The film is based on the true story about how the movie theater in California, California played a role in the downfall of Disco.  It was a popular show in the 1980's, but the show was canceled after the death of the lead singer.  The Last Day of Disco - The Last Days Of Disco is a film that is about how a movie that was supposed to be a big hit, ended up being a big failure.    The movie opens with a film director who is trying to finish a film about the last days of Disco in the year 1986.  After he finishes the film, the film director is arrested for fraud.  However, he manages to bribe a judge to let him off with a sentence of 3 years probation.  Unfortunately, the movie ends with a scene where a couple of people are trying to watch the movie.  The guy next to them has a problem.  He is wearing a disco shirt.  That means that he is wearing disco shoes.  It turns out that he can't find a pair of shoes that he has.  Because of this, the man is wearing his Disco hat and disco shirt, which he can not change because he doesn't have a disco shoe.  When the movie starts, it is a typical disco movie, with music playing in the background.  As the movie progresses, the music gradually gets louder and louder, until it is the end of the movie!   After the film ends, the person next to the guy wearing disco clothes gets angry.  In an effort to get the people to get off of their seats, he throws the guy who was wearing the Disco shirt and disco shoes at them.  "The last day of disco, and the last day the guy in the shoes will wear disco clothes."

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â This is the second movie that the legendary Richard Donner did in a matter of weeks, and as such this is a movie that you can watch in one sitting, or with one drink. Â The characters are all so well-defined, so well played and so believable, and the story is well-told and told well.  The ending is very sad, but the ending is a very sad ending to a very good movie.    The ending:   As I said, the ending of this movie is very, very sad.  I can't think of a better ending to the movie, and there's not a single scene that isn't sad. The acting:  The acting in this movie really is top-notch.  All the actors are great.  The only reason that I gave this movie a D instead of a perfect score is that I think that it's a little too close to the books.  This movie would be perfect if the plot was a little less close to what happens in the books, but for the most part the story, as told by the actors, is great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a couple of men playing poker at the local bar. As the night goes on, we find out that the owner of the bar is actually a female.  After some teasing, the guys get into a poker game.  The movie then moves on to a female who is a student and works as a prostitute.  She is a very sweet and sexy woman.  In the beginning of the movie, there is a flashback to the woman's past.  The movie shows how she was born in an American army hospital.  After that, she moves to America to live with her mother.  Her mother is a good-hearted woman who has many hobbies.  As she was growing up, she got the name of a man who was her idol.  When she turns 18, she meets this man and falls in love with him.   She gets married and has a son.  They move to a new house and have a beautiful son named Alex.  One day, she finds a man with a gun at her house.  He has come to kill her husband and take his place.  So she runs out of the house to hide from him. The movie is very violent.  At the end, the husband is murdered by the man who is now her new lover.  It is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone.

He just takes the gun out of the holster and points it at the guy. This really shows the gun being taken off of the person's body. It makes me laugh. I liked this movie a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************** "Mama, Mama, Mama" is a movie that will stick in your head and stay there for days. I found it to be an enjoyable and interesting movie. I thought the actors did a good job of portraying the situation they were in. The dialogue between the characters were clear, realistic and funny. I also found it interesting to hear how the family dealt with the situation. There were a few times when I thought that they were acting and the characters seemed to be having fun with the others. I think that if this was a movie in the 1950's it would be a classic. "Mamma, Mama..." is a good example of a good 1950's movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the spirit of the classics, "Maverick" (1968) is a simple, sweet, and touching story about a boy and his dog. There is a reason for this.  This film is so well done and is a great example of how to tell a good story.   The film begins with the narrator (Jack Lemmon) telling us about his childhood in Chicago.  He goes to the same school his brother was in and it is there that his love of the game of baseball came to life.   He was an exceptional player who would always be asked to do special things like throw the first pitch, bat the catcher, and play the umpire.  The first baseball game of his life is shown in the opening credits.  There are lots of scenes showing his brother, Jim, playing with the ball and the rest of the family watching the game.  After the game the Lemmons go out for lunch.  They have a great time, but Jim's dog (Ralph) gets upset and leaves.  As the narrator is walking home, a man (Frankie Avalon) offers to let the Lemmon family have a game of catch with the "fool" of a catcher (George Lutz).   Jack tells his father about this, but he doesn't think the catcher will be a big threat to the boys.  Jack, however, is not afraid to throw the ball with the best of them.  The next day, the catcher is a big hit with the boys and the parents.  Jack's father tells the narrator that Jack will be the first player in the minor leagues.  It is here that we see the beginnings of the boy's love of baseball.  Later that night, Jack's mother (Helen Hayes) comes home to tell him that the pitcher (Harry Carey) is going to take him to the game and they are going to win.   Jack's dad, who is watching the ball game from the bleachers, goes out to talk to the pitcher, Harry Carey.   At the end of the conversation, the father tells Harry Carey that he has made his son a good player.  This scene is used over and over again throughout the film.   In the film, Jack is still the star, but there is a love story that develops in the background.   The opening of the film shows us a baseball game between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A very strange movie with a good cast. A very strange story about a woman who is in a bad relationship with a very odd man, who has a strange fetish for playing in a circus. I found the movie quite odd and I felt that the story was a bit forced. There is a lot of nudity and the woman is extremely well developed as an actress. She was quite sexy and I enjoyed watching her get naked. I would definitely recommend this movie."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of the original Star Trek.   It was a very entertaining show, and I enjoyed watching the original show and movies.   This is a good re-imagining of the classic characters, but there are some minor problems.  Firstly, the acting is very good.  It's great that the actors are re-enacting their roles in their most recent incarnations.  Also, the show features a great score, and a number of familiar Star Trek songs are performed.  Finally, the special effects are very impressive.  The special effects were a bit too cartoony and silly for my tastes.  However, the effects are still very good, and the special effect work is impressive. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.  Posted by Michael Lacey at 6:07 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a fun movie. I like to think it is a cross between the "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" and "The Nutty Professor." The movie is set in a dystopian future where a giant robot (called the "Porky") runs amok. The robots are controlled by the people who build them, and the people are not allowed to go outside or do anything except work on the robots. The movie takes place in the near future where the robots are becoming more and more powerful and people are being killed by them. But there is a man who tries to stop them, who ends up having to go into a cave to protect himself. The cave is filled with evil robots and a giant pig. He tries to defeat them but he doesn't know how to do it. The people think he is insane and start to mock him. But then the Pig comes out of the cave and starts killing people. It is then that the man is given a chance to change his fate and become a hero. He is given some strange objects called "Dolls" that turn people into "Dollies" or "Doomsters." He also has a friend who is a boy called "Ralph" who is actually a robot. This is where the movie takes a turn into a comedy and a little more realistic. The humor comes from how insane the people in this movie are. The plot is funny and the characters are all good, and I would recommend this movie to everyone.

Unfortunately, the wish is to kill him. So, the old and feeble man uses the "magic lamp" to grant a wish to a poor little girl, who is very shy. But, it turns out to be a great fortune to the poor girl, as the boy is the one who will kill him! Well, it's a nice adventure movie.  The only problem with this movie is that the old guy never makes any sense whatsoever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last King of Scotland"  is a very good movie about the struggle between the Scottish monarchy and the Scottish people.  The film begins in 1783 when the Scottish King James V of Scotland dies.    He was succeeded by his younger brother James VI, the last James VI.  He is not happy with the way his brother is ruling Scotland.  James VI is a very bad monarch and is slowly losing popularity.  His father, the King of France had died in 1772 and James VI had been unable to convince James VI to abdicate.  This left the King with no choice but to put James VI on the throne himself.  When James VI was put on the Scottish throne he made a deal with the French government that they would keep the Scottish crown from the Scots.  They would also support the Scottish army in any war against England.  Unfortunately, James VI also gave away a lot of Scottish lands to the French.  The French were also the cause of the Scottish Civil War which ended with the King's execution.  In 1796 James VI married Elizabeth Queen of England and in 1802 the two kingdoms were reunited.  At this time James VI wanted to marry the English princess Anne of Denmark but he was denied.  So the French king Louis XV ordered the French army to attack Scotland. James VI decided to stop the French but they did not stop.  During the war Louis XV was killed and James VII became King of England.   The movie begins in a very violent way as James VI and his men are being attacked by the French and their allies.  While the French are trying to kill James VI they find a map that leads them to the Scottish country of Scotland. The French attack the castle at Glencoe and the Scots try to defend it.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when James VI makes a speech about how the Scots should not get involved in the civil war.  That leads to a great scene where James VI talks to the men who are defending the castle.  It is great to see James VI talk to his men and how he tells them how he is going to defeat the French Army.  After this scene we go to the next scene where the French invade the castle and try to kill all of the people who are in it. James and his supporters are not afraid of the French at all.  Then the scene changes to a beautiful view of Glencoe Castle and we see
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film has a few moments of action, but they are not really needed.  The movie starts out with a nice set up and a good story to tell.  A young man is in a very bad way.  After getting hit by a car he falls in a river and is carried off by the current.  He is unconscious when he reaches shore.  It is only later that we learn why the accident occurred.  This is an interesting way to begin a movie.  I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good adventure films, or who has a love of horror films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ A lot of people are complaining about the fact that they have to go to the mall on the weekend to watch a movie. That's fine if it's the one you like. But, this movie isn't good. I mean, I'm a huge fan of Paul Verhoeven and this movie is the best one he ever made. I can't believe that this is his last movie and that it took him this long to get to a decent movie. But this movie was very disappointing. Verhoeve is good at writing the characters but, he doesn't know how to use them in the movie. There are too many characters and there are too much happening in too short a time. I found it annoying to watch the characters talk about what they are going to do when they get there. They all talk about their favorite things and then they do it. It's not interesting. There is one great scene when Verhoeves is watching the TV news and the news person is trying to talk to a woman. The woman says something and then a man comes over and starts talking to her. Then, the man looks at her and then he looks at a man and then it's over. That was the only thing that was worth watching. It just wasn't very good. This movie has a lot of action but, it's a lot more of the same. There's no mystery and no intrigue. It seems like a cheap movie to me.

It has all the elements a great comedy should have: the jovial dialogue, the wonderful music, the great costumes, and the funny little characters that keep you smiling the whole time. It is not very dark at all, but it is very fun. There is a great scene where the guys in the black-mask are in the woods, looking for their missing friend, and they decide to go off on a long, dangerous road trip. They get lost in the dark woods, and it is all downhill from there! This is the best comedy ever made!

There are no big Hollywood actors. It's all local folks, so the town looks and feels real. And, most importantly, it is an action movie with a good cast.   The plot is simple: a bunch of criminals, including the bad guys, decide to get some cash by robbing a bank. That's the only plot of the film. There's some good stuff in here: some good special effects, some great acting and a good villain.

Riki's friend Natsu is the best, but Riki always loses to him. Then there is Shizuka, a girl with a cat and a strange looking face. I can't really explain how she looks like because she is so different than the other girls. I really liked the art style, it really is something different. It is a bit strange to see something like that done in anime, but I don't mind it because it fits well with the plot.  One of the best parts about this anime is the music. The opening and ending songs are great. The voice acting is really good. I loved all the characters. The animation was really good too. The movie isn't really good by itself, but there are a few scenes that really make the movie. The only bad thing is that the movie ends a little too abruptly.

The movie takes place in a very small town in Germany and the main character is a boy named Martin (played by Martin Short). The other characters in the movie are also German, but are not the main ones. There are a lot of German jokes that the Germans can't understand and this is just a result of the language. There is a girl who likes Martin and there is also a couple who live next door and are friends with Martin. There was also a dog that lived next door. This dog was a bit crazy and he could bite people. This is a very funny movie and the German jokes are just a little bit funny. _________
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good comedy with an unusual cast, which includes an actress who appeared in a number of films with John Wayne and a veteran movie star from the Western genre, the late Frank Sinatra. They play a gang of thugs who get together to rob a bank, and Frank is one of the few who knows the real identity of the bank robbers. This film is about one of those times when a man who has lost his way in life and is now in a bad position finds himself in a situation in which he has to take a stand against an evil force which is determined to ruin his life and the lives of others. This is not a classic Western in the classic sense, but it is a very funny, entertaining film, and a film which I believe will make a lasting impression on the Western movie fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I'm not sure I can give this one a "tune up" rating because it is really a good flick that is a little off kilter from what you would expect from a comedy. It's a pretty typical "good guy" plot, the bad guy gets caught in a plot to kidnap the girl of his dreams, the girl is in love with a pretty bad guy (I guess) who is just a bad guy. The girl then gets kidnapped, so the bad guys are out to get her. All is right in the world, until it isn't, because there is a "happily ever after" plot twist. The plot twists are just a little too ridiculous to take seriously, but you can't expect a film to be that funny, can you? This movie isn't bad, but I don't think it is good, and I don`t think it needs to be seen again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mummy (1968)  is a good old movie. It is not a horror movie, it is not the original Frankenstein and it is definitely not Dracula.  It is more of a horror action movie with a good storyline.   The main villain is a powerful sorcerer who is trying to control the minds of his victims.  The story revolves around a mummy who has been trapped in a pyramid for over 2000 years.  One day he is released from his prison and starts hunting down the people who killed his master.  He must find the three keys to open the pyramid and save the world.  This is a classic tale from the early 60s, with an amazing cast of actors including David Niven (from the original The Evil Dead) as Dr. Jacob O'Hare, an archeologist who must rescue the mummy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _______ _______  There are so many excellent films about the great American cities. I love how these films are so much more than the city itself. They are about a culture, a lifestyle and a way of life. They're about how a city is created and maintained, how people live and how they interact with each other. This is a great, very funny, moving film about the way a city works and how the people who inhabit it think about and relate to each other, as well as with the world around them. This film is a very important film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I think I have a special place in my heart for the movie "Wicker Park", Â because it is the only movie I've ever seen where the cast is all African-American. Â The film is a biopic about Wicker Park, a community in Chicago that was torn apart by the AIDS epidemic.  The movie starts out with the arrival of a young girl named Annie (Lorraine Bracco) who is born with a birth defect.    She is put into an orphanage and is raised by her uncle who is a doctor.      In the orphanage,   the uncle has a young boy who is also a ward of the state.  The uncle has been married to a young woman,  who was an adult before she died of a drug overdose.  And his son is a gang member who is looking to get into the big leagues of the street life.  It is a great little film about a child trying to find her place in a world she can never leave.  I like the movie a lot.  In fact I think it is a pretty good movie.  My only complaint is that it is only about 2 hours long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the story of the movie.   The characters are well portrayed.  The plot is good and it makes you think a little more than usual.  It is hard to believe that this is the first movie in which a man has a sex with a bear. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must see if you like the genre.   It's about a young boy who is living a boring life.  He's going to school everyday and doing chores for his family.  When he goes home at night he's just bored and has nothing better to do but to read books.  The next day he's on a train to school.  It starts out a bit slow, but as the train passes through the small towns and towns nearby, you start to get a better sense of the places and the people.  Eventually, the train stops in a town called "Aurora" and you can see all of the houses and the towns and everything.  After all this, you can imagine that this little town will grow a lot.  So the train goes on to the next town and the boy is on his way to school again.  This time the train is going to be going fast, so it's not that hard to miss the train when it leaves the station.  Then, the boy goes to school, and there are only a few people in the school and the only one who notices him is his teacher.  She is the only person who notices his existence.  Now you can start to notice that there is a very odd little girl at school. Her name is Sarah and she has a very strange personality. She doesn't talk much and she doesn't act like the other kids.  In fact, she is the most popular kid in school. When she's not being friendly, she's going around reading books, watching movies and playing games.  You know what?  The movie really does have a bit of everything. The story is a little bit cheesy, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie's pacing is excellent and it never drags on.  There are many strange and funny things going on and you're never bored or bored by anything.  Also, I have to give props to the director.  His style of making movies is really unique and he really puts a lot of effort into the story and the animation.  While it is not a movie for everybody, it's a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens in a dark and dingy little restaurant that doesn't look like much, but has the largest selection of burgers in town. The owner of the place is a little mysterious but friendly and willing to do favors for everyone. The burgers are made with the finest ingredients, which is not to say that the ingredients are the best. However, the hamburger is still a good deal. The fries are cooked perfectly and very large. You can easily get a whole meal for the money.   I don't have much to say about the story, other than I am sure it is a very interesting one.  I was very surprised at how well this movie was made, it was very well done and a very entertaining movie.  The music is very good too, it's very upbeat and upbeat, which fits the movie very well.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I just finished the movie and the entire cast was amazing. I enjoyed it a lot. There was one line of dialog I didn't get but I didn´t mind it much. The movie was great and I am happy to be a fan of it. It will be one of my new favorites. The music was great too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** I think I may have found my new favorite movie: "A Christmas Story" is about a family who decides to spend the holidays together. They decide to take their little girl to the movies to celebrate her birthday. At the movie, she gets into a fight with a little boy. The little boy has the same name as the little girl, and he is named Santa Claus. He and the little boy are the only ones who remember Santa Claus' name and birthday. So Santa Claus gets angry and begins to get more and more mad. Eventually he beats the little kids to death. The mother, Mrs. Claus, is in such a bad mood that she doesn't notice the little children are dead until the next morning. Santa Claus realizes that the mother is the one who killed the children and he kills her. He then goes to his room and has a vision in which he sees himself standing on top of the North Pole. He gets angry that the North and South Poles are the same, and so he sets off to destroy them. The last scene is the little Christmas trees, and Santa Claus tells the little people that they must never forget the North or the South Pole. *************************** I was a little disappointed that the special effects were not the same as in "A Charlie Brown Christmas" and "A Little Mermaid". In those films, you could see the trees moving, and the snow falling. In "A Santa Claus is Comin' to Town", the snow and the trees are not moving. But, the special effect is not bad. It is just as good as "A Night at the Opera" and a bit better than "A Winter's Tale". I'm sure I will be watching this movie again when I have the chance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a nice film and a good story.   I was surprised how well it played out.  I found the movie quite good and enjoyable.  The story was interesting and the acting was great.  I liked the idea that it was a "cinematic thriller".  The movie has an interesting plot and it is a great story to tell.  There is a scene where you can see how this could have been a real thriller.  What I like about this movie is that it is quite well acted and the film is not rushed.  It is a very good film and I would recommend it to a friend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Tower:    A film with a few problems.   The movie is about a man who can see the future, who goes into the future and sees things that will cause the world to be destroyed.  He goes to the future with a man and woman that look like a couple of young kids.  The future they are going to live in looks very like the future of the film I have seen.  Then they meet the mother and father who look like the parents from the movie The Ring.  They have the same voice as the people in the movie.  When they leave the future they find a place called the Dark Tower and it seems like it is a very good place.  It is a town that looks like the movie Oz and there are strange creatures like the monsters from the film The Thing.  There is also a man that looks very much like the man from The Dark Tower.  But this man looks a lot like Eddie Murphy in this movie. He has a funny voice that sounds like a man from the 80's.  In the film there is a guy who has the same type of hair and looks as if he is from the 70's.     But the movie has a few flaws.  1.  First  the story.    The story was not really that great.  I liked the idea of the man who has visions of the future but it just did not have the heart to go with the idea.  Second  there is a lot of people who are not who they are supposed to be.  Third  I am not sure if the movie really was about the future because there was very little about the real future.  This was more about the people that look a lot alike.  Fourth  they use a lot too much music.  Fifth  this was a film that was supposed to make you go back to your childhood.

The story is pretty well told, there are many little details, like the fact that the people of this world, even the most evil ones, have a soft side that can be easily touched. I think the acting was fine, and the movie looks pretty good, if you're not looking for the best. I was, but if you are, this movie is definitely worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the story of a young couple who were once a famous duo called "The Flying Dutchmen" and have been together ever since. They now own a flying school where they teach students how to fly. The husband is very good looking and charming. His wife is more of a dutiful wife. She has no idea how to love and her mind is not as sharp as it should be. She is a little naive and the husband tries to teach her how to think. He is an amazing teacher, he teaches the students to be true to themselves and to trust in their hearts. I think that the film is quite sentimental and beautiful. The music and the acting is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film. It is a classic in that it takes a group of people, all of whom are "fucked up" but each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I like that these guys are not necessarily all that bright. This is a story about a guy who tries to find out what happened to a man that was murdered and finds out that it is his best friend's brother who is responsible. I just found it to be a great movie and I am sure that everyone that loves a good old fashioned gangster film will love this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie very much. It is a simple and funny story about a boy and a girl, who find themselves in a strange town in the middle of the woods. The boy is a boy from the future and the girl a girl from the past. The past girl is in a comatose state in a very small and very old house, and she can see only through the small window on the left side. The future boy, however, is very tall and looks like a giant. He is called "Giant" and he is very powerful and his giant strength is a major attraction to this young girl. At one point he picks up the comatosed girl and takes her to the house of the old woman who owns the house. The comatoped girl is told that she is the only living thing in the house and Giant, who is a very powerful person, decides to let her live there. The old woman is very sad and lonely and she asks Giant for help. Giant seems to be able to make anything come to life when he touches it. She thinks that he might be able find the house where she can live with her comatoposed mother. This house, however is filled with strange people who are very cruel and want to kill Giant. Giant gets to know the town, the old people, and his "loyal" friends. One of the people who have a strong liking for Giant is a woman called "Miss F" who can see the future through her fingers. Miss F, who can't actually see the past, does her best to protect Giant. This is a good story and it makes you laugh. The movie does a good job of showing how strange the town is. It's really very creepy and the little boy's parents are very good. The girl, Miss F is very much like the little girl in the movie. She's not really funny but her character is very nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished watching this movie, which is a classic.  The plot was simple.    It's a man who is trying to get a picture taken of his wife, who is also a photographer.    He asks a young girl, who has a camera of her own, to take a picture of him and his wife.  This would make for a great movie if only it had been made in the 1930's.  The film is made up of a series of still photographs and a couple of animated films.  It's hard to find any good images of this movie.  I think that the images are more like animated films, than photographs.  Some of the images look like cartoons and some look like still photographs. The animation is rather bad.  For example, the cartoon of a guy walking on a bicycle is just a series of two photographs, that are then placed together to form a series.  Then the cartoon is put on a rotating wheel and the bicycle is thrown in the air, then a guy in a cowboy hat is on the wheel.  When it is all over, the guy on the bicycle walks off, and a girl riding a bicycle comes around.  They walk down the street together, the girl riding the bicycle has a small dog and the dog is wearing a cowboy suit.  There is also an animated film that is in the background, and in this film, a guy with a dog is walking down the road and the girl in the cowboy suit is following the dog.  All of the animation is fairly bad, and the music is also very poor.  But this is a great little film that deserves to be seen again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a good laugh, you'll love this movie.   It's just a good little comedy with an endearing love story.  I saw the movie when I was very young, I have a feeling that I must have seen it before.  This is a short, sweet comedy about a woman named Ann who works at a hospital. Ann's husband died, and she doesn't want to go home because she is so afraid of the hospital. The hospital is run by a great, but eccentric, doctor.  I was amazed at how he got away with all the crazy things he did.  As for the hospital, it is run like a family business.  The doctor is the only one who gets along with the nurses, the nurses get along with all of the doctors and the doctors get along pretty well with the other doctors.  There is a lot of humor in the movie and I laughed out loud a few times.  It was a great movie to watch as a child, I remember being very curious about what was going to happen in the next movie, which was not too long ago. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last night I watched "The Longest Yard" with my daughter. I can't believe how good this movie is. I never would have thought it possible that a movie about a small town in Kentucky would be as good as it is. This is a film that will stay with me for years to come. It has that little town feel of the Old West, the good people and the bad people. I also love the characters in this film. I don't think I have ever seen such a real portrayal of a hard working man. The man is so real that I thought he was a real person. I am glad to have seen this movie and I hope that more people will see it and make it a part of their lives. I feel that the people who worked on this film did an amazing job and I'm sure that they'll be happy to have it all in the past.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think it's fair to say that "Mister Smith Goes to Washington" is a great movie.  It's got a nice balance between action, comedy, and romance.   The story follows the exploits of a character named Smith (played by the great Christopher Plummer), a former cowboy and now a traveling salesman.  His wife, Lucy (Dorothy Lamour), is an old maid who lives in their house with their son, John.  It's not until they go to Washington, D.C., that Smith meets up with his old friend (played with great energy by Henry Fonda).  This story is very similar to the story of the book "I Have a Dream" and the movie does a good job of keeping the elements of that story intact.  While the movie has a few flaws, the overall quality of the film is well worth the viewing.  "MISTER SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON" is another great movie that you should check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************** I'm a big fan of the 80s and 90s. The 80s were amazing and it is a real shame that we are losing some of the best of the movies, like The Lost Boys, Die Hard, Commando, etc. It is a sad day to be a fan of these movies, but they are still awesome. The 1990s were even better. It was the 80's and 90's that was the golden age of action films. The 90's were a lot of fun and exciting. The nineties were not as good, but still were very good. The current 80's are boring and not very exciting. It just seems that the 80′s are getting more and more boring. I hope that the 90's will be better. If they don't, then I will have to go back to the 80-90′s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is a great movie, but it does not take place in the real world. The movie is a fantastical retelling of a novel written by Miguel de Cervantes and adapted into a movie, in which Cervante plays the lead role.  This version of Don Quijote is not only a better adaptation, it is also a better movie.    I like the movie so much I've seen it twice in the last month, and I like it more each time.  I've never been to Spain and I have never read a book about Don Quiquote, so I had to watch a lot of films to learn about him, and the only way to do that was to watch the film.  This version is more faithful to the original novel than the English version.  Cervantes has never been as good at adapting his own books as the one he wrote for the film version, so his adaptation of DonQuixote isn't quite as good.  It's not bad, but I would have liked to see some more of the characters in the novel.  A lot of the time we just see Don Quic, the knight, and some of the men who accompany him on his journey.  Don Quizit was also based on a novel, so there are a lot more characters in it, and they're all more interesting than in the film adaptation.  But Cervans' Don Quiqote is still a good read, so it's worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you first hear that the plot involves a gang of thieves stealing a huge statue from a museum and transporting it to the sea, you would think that you have seen this movie before.  Unfortunately you have not, but if you liked  The Great Escape, then you will probably like this one.  There are some similarities between the two movies, but the Great Escape was filmed in black and white, while this movie is in color.   The Great Rescue is a bit of a sequel to the first movie, and there is a lot of similarities.  The Statue of Liberty, who was an actual statue when the movie first came out, is now a metal sculpture in a glass case.  After the robbery, the group steals a boat and go to the Statue, only to discover that it is not the Statue of Freedom but the Statue the group stole in the first film.  So what do the thieves do?  They put the statue in a steel container, put a metal plate on top and carry the statue out to sea.  It was a pretty cool idea, and one that the filmmakers should have used in the sequel.  They also have a submarine, and it's really fun to watch the thieves steal the submarine.  In the end, however, the movie is not as good as the first, but it is still a good action movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen several bad movies that have been made about the Vietnam War, but none as bad as the one that came out in 1964. This movie is the worst thing that I have ever seen, I wish I would have seen it in the early '70's when I was young. It's really bad and it's only about a half hour long. The film is about a bunch of kids that get to be in the war and the bad things that happen to them. This is the only movie that has ever been made that I feel is bad. This was made in 1964 and this was just the beginning of what I thought would be the greatest war movie ever made. The kids are very much like the kids in this movie. The actors that play the kids are bad as hell and the effects are just horrible. The movie was supposed to be a Vietnam War film but it was more of a propaganda film. I hate to say it but the movie makes no sense and it is just awful. If you have never seen this movie I suggest that you stay away from it. If this movie had come out in the 1960's it would have been a hit. I know it's a long review but it is necessary.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that it is hard to find something that's really different about the movies in this trilogy. I guess the first one is a little bit more lighthearted but the third one is probably the darkest one out of the three. I really liked this one. I mean I'm a big fan of James Gunn so I can't say I'm surprised to see him in another movie. I liked how he brought some humor and action in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best and most honest film about addiction and its consequences is a very powerful film.  If you are thinking about addiction, it will make you feel that you are not alone.   This is a film for the young adult audience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an avid fan of all of Stephen King's work. He is one of the best writers of our generation, period. When I saw this film, I was so very surprised to see that he still had the same talent as when I was a child. This movie is filled with horror and dark comedy. The ending is shocking and I don't think there will be a better ending to a horror film than this. This film is a must see. If you have the time, don't miss it. It is not for the weak of heart, or those who don't like dark humor, but for everyone who loves a good horror film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The film is really good and is not that bad. It's just really not. The story is not very original, but the characters are. The film was made by a Korean guy, but it seems that the American film studios don't like to work in Korea, because they didn't get a very good version. __________________________________________ The following text is an excerpt from a book written by John Wayne: The scene in which the American military men are being fired upon by a machine gun on the high ground of Seoul, Korea, is a classic scene in Western cinema. The scene is not the most dramatic one, but its beauty is indescribable. The American soldiers are in the middle of a firefight when the machine gun starts blasting a shot from the rear, and it seems as though they are completely out of ammo. The machine gun, mounted on a motorcycle, is an absolute nightmare for the American soldiers. The motorcycle is a hulking beast of a machine, but is also surprisingly maneuverable. A Korean soldier (played by Kim Seung-Jin, who won an Academy Award for his role) on the machine, sees a lone American soldier running into a building, and he decides to join him, hoping that they will be able to outrun the machine. They make it to the end of the building and are about to be caught in a trap when Kim Seun-Jung (who won a Golden Globe for his performance) stops the machine and runs to the American soldier. The two men start to fight, and Kim Seunk-Jiun is a tough little fighter. After a few shots are exchanged, the machine takes off, leaving Kim Seum-Jun, the only one left standing, to be captured by the Koreans. The movie does a good job in showing the difficulty of fighting a machinegun. _____________ The film has a lot of action, but not enough to be called a Western. It is a film made in Korea and does not take place in America, but rather in Korea. There are some western elements, like the soldiers riding around on motorcycles. The only other western element is the Japanese invasion in World War II, but they did not play any significant role in the film. It does not try to tell a story about Korea and the war. It just has a good action scene, which is not surprising, since it was made in a country with the largest military in the world, and there is

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun movie and the first one we've seen in a long time.   The plot follows a young man named James (Harrison Ford) who is an alcoholic and is constantly trying to find a cure for his addiction.  When he meets a female doctor, he is fascinated by her and the two of them become a couple.  Once the girl leaves, James decides to live a simple life and find a way to cure himself.  James meets a guy named Tom (John Cassavetes) and they become friends and eventually decide to get married.  The two of their friends decide to move in and make some noise in the neighborhood, so the three of them start to get to know each other and have fun.  They decide to throw a big party and invite everyone who is in the area.  Unfortunately, when the party gets out of hand, they start to become suspicious and James is forced to put on a brave face for the sake of everyone else.  While everyone else gets drunk and does whatever they want, James gets to know a young girl named Cathy (Karen Allen).  They start dating and when they do, they both get into a lot of trouble with the local police.  During one of their police encounters, James runs off to hide in a dumpster.  In the dumpster he encounters a girl named Kathy (Jean Simmons).  Kathy is an undercover cop who has been undercover for some time. She is also married and has two children, a son named Mark (played by the late Tom Selleck) and a daughter named Laura (played in a pretty decent performance by Anne Baxter).  James and Kathy get into an argument over a stolen purse and the police come after them.  Kathy's undercover assignment is to find out where James is hiding and get him to give them the information.  This doesn't work out too well and the story drags a little bit.  It was fun at first, but it was a little boring.  One thing that I did like about the movie is that I'm pretty sure that it would be a great movie to watch with a bunch of young kids.  I also really enjoyed the soundtrack.  There is something pretty cool about hearing music when you are on the run and in a dark alley.  After watching this movie, I can't help but think that it could be a good choice for a summer movie.  Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Grimm" movies, from the first one to the last one, are all the better for being true to the source material. If you like the book, this is the movie for you. The movie, like the story, is not really about the Grimm but more about the world around the Grimm. This is a movie that is full of action, suspense, romance, humor, action, romance and even an interesting political element. The action is the best thing in this movie. This movie is a must-see. It has a great mix of horror and action, but it is a Grimm movie, which makes the action even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We're told that a man and a woman have been on a train going to the town of St. Louis to attend a funeral. They're in the first car of the train and they're both feeling pretty nervous. They have just come from the train station where the funeral is being held and they haven't found a place to stay yet. They start talking about the death of the victim, a boy who died of a brain aneurysm. The man is a mechanic, but the woman is a housewife. She tells the man that she feels so bad for the boy, and that she just can't believe he's gone. She knows that the man's wife is a very good housewife and she is a good mother, but that doesn't mean she isn't a bit worried about her son. She wonders if he died at home or at a hospital. When they finally get to the church, the pastor is there to give the boy a funeral service. The funeral is a short one, but it is well attended. The people that attend the funeral don't seem to think too much about the boy's death. It seems that the boy had an accident and died at the station. The woman doesn't seem too troubled by the news of the boy being dead, and is actually glad that the train came so soon. After the funeral, they stop at a place called "The Grove." It seems like it's a great place for a picnic. It is the most beautiful place they've ever been to. They sit on a bench and the woman asks the man about the time he was at the Grove with her. He says that he had to spend a few days there and that he was not too fond of it. She replies that it wasn't that bad. The boy is brought to life and brought to a grave that is in the woods near the Grove. The preacher is at the grave and he says a few words about his life and then brings a casket to the grave. He tells the boy that he is not going to see him again, and then he brings the casket back to the woman. They get back on the train to go home. After they get home, the woman tells the husband what had happened. She says that she was very sad about the incident. She knew that the priest was not very fond of the Grove, but she couldn't blame him. She was just a good housekeeper and a good wife. She said that it
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â It is a very good movie that is good for children, but adults will love it. Â If you are an adult and love a good story, then this movie is perfect for you.  The story is a great one.    It is about a boy who was born to a poor family.  He was brought up with love and kindness by his family and all the children in the village.  One day the boy has an accident and his family is very sad about it. He went to the village to visit his brother who was ill.  But when he arrived he saw the people are all very happy.  So he asked the elders of the village why are they happy. They replied that their parents have given them good education and a good life.  And the boy then asked why they are happy. The elders replied that they are now rich.  When the boy was in his early teens he met a woman who was very happy about the life she was living.  She told the boy that if he would like to be with her he had to be good and follow the rules. So he did and they fell in love.  The movie ends with a happy ending and all of the characters are happy that the movie ended happily.  If you like a good family movie, then you will love this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film with a pretty good plot and good acting by its main cast. However the problem is the way the director tried to use his acting to the most ridiculous point to make the film. In the end of the movie the director is forced to let go of his character, and the film ends with the same conclusion it had before. I liked it more when I read the original Japanese story about it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is hard to believe that this movie was actually made in 1978.   The story is interesting and the actors are all good.  I'm not sure if it is the movie's best scene but I would certainly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of how to write a good thriller, with the usual 'tricks' and 'jokes' that you'll find in any thriller. This is a very interesting movie about a man who is able to kill his own wife and has the ability to kill anyone, no matter what the crime. He has his own personal rules and is a total badass. I think the movie has a lot of potential to be a great movie, but the writing is a little hard to follow and sometimes the 'hits' just don't hit, but at the same time there is a lot to like in this movie.   The Good:  A very good movie with some great twists and surprises.  The Bad:  The pacing could be a little faster but this is not a big problem.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts off pretty slow with a lot of boring exposition and the usual story line.  That was a bit annoying but still not a big deal.  The only thing I would criticize about the movie is that I feel that it could have used a bit more story line and less exposition.  There was a lot going on but I don't feel that any of it made much sense.  I was just glad to get to the action sequences.  After watching this movie I would say that the action is good but it's a bit predictable and that might not be a bad thing.  It's a good enough movie to watch in a movie theater or if you want to get a laugh.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of The Good Shepherd is not very original. It has all the elements of a good story: a troubled boy with a broken heart and an older sister who is willing to help him out. The film starts off with a good shot of a small boy walking down a road. There is no music, just a quiet and peaceful background. Suddenly, the boy is run over by a car. The car then runs over him again. The boy is dead, but the car keeps on going. The next day, the driver of the car gets out and takes a look at the dead boy. He says, "Oh, this is not the kind of life I have chosen. But now that I see the way the world is, I have to make the best of it." In a flashback, we see a young man who has a terrible disease. He is always sick and never gets better. His family has no idea how to help this poor sick boy. Finally, his father goes to the doctor. The doctor tries to get the sick man to stop crying, but this does not work. The father gets angry and tells the doctor, "Get him out of here! I don't want him here. I want to leave him." The father then gets a shotgun and goes to his son's room and shoots the boy.   This is the first time I've seen the movie and I have no idea what to think. It is a good idea, but not original. I am not sure what is going to happen with the boy, the father, and the doctor next. I don' t think I want this movie to be part of my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I have always been a big fan of the Star Wars films and this is another great one. It is set in the same universe as the Star Trek series and features some great characters such as Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. The story is set at the beginning of the rebellion against the Empire but not as well known as Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. This is an excellent addition to the Star wars saga and a great watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie! The ending was unexpected, but it's nice to see the villain get a taste of his own medicine, and not the other way around. The ending did make me think of some of the more violent episodes of "The Twilight Zone". I also thought the music was great! I'll be checking out the DVD release when it's available. I've seen a few episodes of this show, and I really like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Giant"  is an excellent comedy about a giant who wants to be a giant.  It is based on the story of a giant called "Giant," who was given a big house by his dad and lived there with his family.    When his dad died, Giant became depressed and wanted to be big.  Then he found out that there is a giant next door.  But the big next door can't be moved and Giant keeps trying to move it.  The movie starts with a bunch of jokes that are funny and funny and then we get a huge action scene.  Giant has the giant next to his house, and he decides to go to town and see what the big can do.  After that Giant has some fun and then he wants to get a big one that's much bigger.  Unfortunately, Giant can't move the big one, so he has to move his own home, which he calls the Giant House.  There is a lot of funny parts in this movie, but the action is amazing.  I'm not sure how many of you have seen this movie.  It's good to see Giant again and to see a big action scene, but you will probably see Giant a lot more in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a real eye-opener. Not only is the movie about a blind man who is an accomplished martial artist, but also a man who has lived for a long time. The film also tells about a little girl who had a lot of pain from the time she was born. She had a big accident and the doctors had no idea what to do. She is a pretty girl, but she has a lot to learn about life. And then, there's a blind guy who had just come out of the hospital after an operation. His eyesight was damaged during his stay in the hospital and he can't see. He is in a lot pain, but he does his best. In fact, he can actually read a lot. He also has a friend who is deaf and a deaf girl who is his best friend. The only problem with this film is that the actors are not so good. You will be watching this movie with a lot expectations and you will be disappointed. However, I did not mind at all. I found this film to be an interesting story and I hope that more people will see this movie so that they will understand how blind people are like. I think that the story of this film was pretty good, and it will make you to think a little bit.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's not really bad at all, it just lacks the "wow" factor. It is very funny, but the humor does not translate very well into the "real world". This is a movie about two brothers who live in a house together with their dog. One brother is an unemployed "bunny" (or a "butterfly") who lives in a little room next to his brother. He is a little dimwitted, and he often tells the little brother about his "lucky day" which is when he came to a gold mine and made a lot of money. The other brother is a very handsome man who likes to smoke, and is a well known "bouncer". He is always looking for the best "buns" (as the men say) and likes to "charm" the girls. When he gets the girl, he kisses her and they have sex right there in the living room. There is a small movie theatre in the house and the two brothers sometimes go there and sit there, watching movies. It was very funny to watch these two brothers, and even more funny to listen to them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is one of those movies that I always wanted to see, but could never make it happen. I think the best thing about this movie is the music. I was a huge fan of the music from this movie, which I think was actually done by Michael Jackson. I like how he sings. I don't know why he was such a big star, but I think he was the greatest. I also like the way the movie takes a different approach to it's comedy than the first. This movie is funny, and even though it's a little bit slow, the characters are funny, the comedy is funny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with a couple of kids playing in the middle of a field, a young boy with a red baseball cap on, and a girl who is covered head to toe in a red hood, with a long white skirt and a pink hat. A little boy and girl run off into the woods, and they are chased by the boy's father. The father grabs his baseball bat and he beats up the boy and the girl, and the boy runs off into a tree, and falls into a hole. The girl falls into the hole, and she is saved by the dog. The dog follows the boy into the house and follows him to a window. He sees the boy running to the hole and he starts following him. Then the boy turns around and gets a knife, and runs back into the forest. The little girl, as she tries to find the boy, falls into an old woman's flower pot, and is rescued by a little boy who is playing by a stream. The boy has a red hat and a red cape, and he has a sword. The two boys meet each other at the waterfall and the little boy has red shoes, and red socks.   At this point in the movie, you know there is going to be a lot of violence, and blood, and sex. There is a lot to take in. The movie is told in first person, but I do not know if this makes it better or worse. The characters are likeable, and I liked the movie. The story is told very quickly, and there is not much in the way of exposition. There are very few twists, and not much action.   in the end, it is a good, if not quite great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to this movie, especially because I've never seen a comedy with a main character like Dwayne Johnson. And there is a reason why, he's just hilarious. He's a good guy who's always thinking of what to do with his life. He lives in the fast lane, and he likes it. He thinks he can just get by, and yet he gets a chance to run into a friend who might help him. I think I speak for all of us when I say we love it when he gets to do what he does best. And even though he doesn't think he has what it takes to be the most amazing athlete in the world, he thinks he's the most interesting man alive, and we all think he's that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the movie very much. It's very dark, very violent and very violent. The characters are well written and the violence is not overly graphic, though there is some pretty intense action. There are some very dark themes and I like the ending. I think that this movie is definitely a little dark, but it's pretty interesting. I thought that the ending was really well done and I really liked the ending theme, but the ending wasn't as powerful as the rest of the movie. It felt a bit like the end of a good book or a good film. The movie is really a nice, dark and violent movie that I enjoyed very much, but there's not enough of it to make it a masterpiece. I don't really think that a movie like this could be a classic, but if you like a lot of violent violence and you like good, dark films then I think you might enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of horror movies, The Strangers is a little too obvious, a little self-conscious and a little over the top, but in the right ways. This is a film that's been around for a while, and it's certainly been made more relevant than in the late '90s. If you like the "found footage" genre (as I do), then you're going to enjoy The Stranger.

Â LachANCE is trying to find a place in the underworld so that he can take down the mafia bosses that run it.  He has a new car, but he still needs some muscle.    Carradines is very easy to like, even though he is a little arrogant.      When the boss asks about his new car and tells him that he needs a good one, Lachances looks at the car and thinks it is a toy.  He tells the boss that it is actually a real thing and gives him a test drive.  The Boss gives the car a good test drive, and gives Lachancing a job.  It is very clear from the beginning that Lachrance will not be a hero for long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crazy, I know. But not for long. It's the last film in the series starring Dennis Hopper, the iconic "Happy Gilmore". It was produced by George Roy Hill and was filmed in San Francisco in 1972. I believe the original film ran about 120 minutes. The final cut of the film runs about 90 minutes. I was not at all a fan of the first "Happy" film and was not a huge fan of "Crazy", but I think this is a fine, if slightly under-rated, film that is worth seeing. It has a nice mix of comedy, romance, and some dark drama. There is a lot of talk of drug use and drinking in the film, which is typical for the series. I don't recall any references to the drugs being particularly strong in this film, and I was more impressed by the comedy. "Candy" is a great character in this movie, and she seems to be enjoying herself very much. She is very smart, and is a good actress, but she's also a bit of a slacker. It is her boyfriend who does the heavy lifting in this particular scene. I also really liked the fact that the police were involved in the drug bust, as well as the cops involved in this scene. In general, it seems that Hopper and Hill had a great time making this film. I just wish I had seen the original.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a movie about a boy who wants to become a hero, but gets caught up in the war that is taking place around him. His father is a farmer who is also fighting, so the film is about the boy's mother and her husband and son who are all taking part in the fight.  It's a good old fashioned war movie about good and evil and the good guys.  The movie is shot in black and white and is a bit hard to watch.  Some of the action scenes are not very impressive.  There are some decent performances from most of the actors, but none of them are very memorable.  A very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other night while watching the movie  Gremlins  I was amazed at the amount of details that were thrown into the film and what a great job the filmmakers did with them. The story is a classic and one that is easily relatable to anyone. A family of gremlins is forced to move into a small house to protect their children from the creatures that are out to kill them.  The story is great and is also very scary.  This movie is a great example of how not to make a movie.    It is filled with so much wrong ideas that you wonder how anyone could even make a good gremlin movie. The gremlins are a very silly and stupid looking creature and they are all of the same size. I have never seen a creature that is smaller than a baby gremlin.  The film even shows how the creatures can use the same thing to frighten people that are much larger than they are.  And of course the monsters that are shown are gremli monsters and not the real thing.  There is no way to get away from the fact that this movie was made by the same people who made Gremli.  I would say the same about any gremling movie made before this one.  As a matter of fact I would recommend this to anyone that thinks they have seen everything. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a sense, I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had a lot of interesting things going on: a lot on a good guy, a lot with a little girl and a little boy, a great ending, and a great little boy.   There are a couple of things that really bothered me. I didn't like how the parents weren't told about the danger and how the father was so angry when his son killed the snake. He also doesn't have much time for the girl and doesn't seem to care about him much. I think that's a little sad.  It was interesting seeing the father and mother trying to make it work. It's hard to believe a lot is going on in this little town.

They don't act like they are from the future.  They act like normal kids.  There are plenty of jokes and funny things in this movie.  It is a little slow and it may take you a while to get into it.  However, if you like slow movies like this one you will enjoy this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this film. It is not a bad movie. It was well acted and the script is very good. I also liked the fact that there were three female characters who played a part in the story. The movie is about a mother and her daughter who find themselves in a foreign land. The mother wants her daughter to go with her but she tells her not to go. Then the daughter gets into trouble and it all ends in tragedy.   The cinematography was very good and I liked the lighting and the scenes were beautiful. The film was not too long and it was good.   a good film that is worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not the biggest of James Bond fans, but I loved the first Bond movie. I think it's the best Bond movie ever made, with a great script and great acting.   In the middle of this movie, we see a brief cameo from Sean Connery in a very interesting scene. He's in an underground tunnel and he's running for his life from a huge shark. He does a really nice job of hiding in the shadows and only comes to light when he's about to be bitten.  It's a nice cameo, and it shows how much of an impact Connery had on the Bond franchise.  It's also interesting to see that Bond has a bit of a temper.  Bond has been a really cool guy all his life and this is the first time we really see him have a bad day. He gets so angry when he finds out that his mother (played by Maureen O'Hara) is in danger.  He takes a shot at the shark, but the shot doesn't hit. It hits his boot. The boot starts to grow back on the shark's body and then the shark turns and jumps away.  The shark's boot becomes the key to the plot. When Bond goes to look for it, the boot grows back on Bond's boot, which leads to his adventure to find the missing key.  I liked this movie. It was funny, action-packed, and pretty cool. I would like to see a third Bond movie, but there are a lot of good ones already. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are some movies that are more than just a movie. It's as if the movie was created to be watched over and over and always the same, so that you could never get bored.   But the main story is what's interesting. A young man (Kurt Russell) is sent to the island of Oahu in Hawaii with the purpose of finding a woman named Anna (Mia Farrow) who disappeared there years before. What makes this movie interesting is the fact that it's one of the rare movies that does not follow a typical plot. It takes the form of a novel with a plot, but the story itself is very unique. It has no one defining point or theme, and it goes about as far as it can without going too far. The story begins with a young man named Tom (Russell) who was raised on a small island, and is still trying to fit in. He's a bit of a loser, but he has a crush on a girl named Anna, and the only way to get her attention is to go on a mission to find her. But first he must deal with his brother's best friend (John Cleese) who doesn't want Tom to join the mission. It isn't until the second mission that Tom realizes that his brother is a very odd guy, and that he's also a bit odd. His brother is obsessed with his own little island, which is basically a small paradise that's about as big as a swimming pool, and there are a few other people living there. But the island isn't as idyllic as it seems. There's a gang that rules the island, including a few young boys, and an old woman who rules the whole place with an iron fist. Tom and Anna are assigned to be the protectors of the island against the gang. There is also an old man named Frank (Eddie Murphy) who wants to take over the island and has a huge army. And a woman who lives in a cave who is always trying to get back into her world, which she thought she left in the 20's, and Tom has to save her. And the whole time Tom has a few oddball friends (including Tom's brother, who is a bit insane).   The acting is great. There are some great performances throughout the movie, but Kurt Russell is the star. He has a lot of charisma, and his character is always a bit off. His character is quite eccentric,
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â  It was the last scene of a movie I had seen previously but had heard about in passing: "In the beginning, a man is shot by his brother in law, his wife and daughter in law come to the house to find out why, but his wife is a nurse and the kids are grown. He is lying in the back yard covered with blood and his brother-in-law and his wife are at the front door." The movie is a little bit hard to follow and the dialogue is a bit difficult but I was not too disappointed with this movie. Â Â

It's not that it is a bad movie, it's a good one.  If you are looking for a good story with an interesting premise and a great cast then you should check this one out.  I had to go back to the theater to watch this one again, I had so much fun with this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really good and has a strong message, and some good action scenes.   I think it was a really good idea to make a movie about a group of people trying to take on a "big bad" who has a huge army, a lot of money, and a lot people trying too hard to kill them, and the leader is the baddest man alive, but the group of good guys just keep getting better and better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to watching this movie as it was being released in the UK and it is an excellent action movie with some great special effects.   The story is pretty simple, we have a bunch of people, some good, some bad, some not very good, but we are introduced to the various bad guys and their schemes.  After the bad guys are defeated, the good guys go off and try to find the good guy that was with the bad guy.  I thought this was pretty cool.  The good guy, played by a very good Liam Neeson, and the bad, played a little like Bruce Willis.  Both of them are cool and fun.  This is a pretty good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen an American film that I liked so much. The director, John Ford, knew what he was doing. He knew the difference between a good American story and a great American story. He did the opposite of a traditional Hollywood hero. The hero of his film is the antihero. He is not the good guy. He isn't a crusader. He's not a hero. He has no cause. He doesn't feel anything about the people who do things to him. He never does anything about them. They are monsters, and he is just the monster. I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a real gem, I have seen a lot of these "Cajun" movies over the years, and this one is really great!  It is set in a Cajun town, and it has a lot more to it than just the Cajuns.  The movie is set up in such a way that there is an opening scene that really makes you get to know the town and the people.    And then there is a really cool scene in the end that really shows you how good the acting is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a fan of the classic science fiction/fantasy films from the 70s. There's something special about this film, the specialness of it comes from its music. It is a dark and intense film with a powerful performance from Bruce Campbell. I also enjoyed the use of the song "Hocus Pocus" by The Who and the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had me laughing out loud, and I can say it has the funniest opening sequence.  The main character is a woman who has a bad case of bad luck, and is constantly looking for a new opportunity.  She goes to a casino, and gets a huge tip for her troubles.   She plays some high stakes games, but is outplayed.  Then she comes up with a plan.  First she gets her friends together to "bring the luck" back to her.  And she sets up the plan. First, she goes to the casino and gives her old partner a $50,000 bet, and she wins.  Next she goes back to the old man, who now is a rich man, and asks him to get her some new cards.  They have a great time playing some games.  But the old gambler won't go for her new cards, so she calls the cops and says she has been cheated.  The casino manager asks what she wants, and the old boss says he wants his money back.  He also tells her he doesn't want to get arrested.  So she tells him she won't take the money, but will take his name off the book.  Unfortunately, the old manager is a real stick in the mud, and will not accept the name change.  When she asks him for his name, he gives her his own name, and says "I'll take your name off my book, too."    So, the lady's life is not going to get any better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have always been a fan of the series, and I must say that this is my favorite of the bunch. The story is very good. The movie is set in a very futuristic setting. The main character is a girl named Nia who is a member of a special military group, called the Knights of the Round Table. The Knights are a very elite group who are not allowed to leave the city of Avalon until they are old enough to join the royal court. But the Knights are not what they seem to be. It is not just that they have no regard for human life. The knights are actually vampires. They feed on the blood of human beings and transform into powerful monsters. They are powerful beings who do not hesitate to destroy the city to get their blood. The film does not really focus on the Knights. Instead, it focuses on a group of human rebels who are trying to overthrow the kings and queen. The King is a greedy, self-centered ruler who is in the grip of an evil evil spirit called the Beast. The Queen is an incompetent queen who does not care for the people and who has become a slave to the Beast to the point that she is willing to sacrifice her own life for the Beast's. It takes the Knight's to finally stop the Beast and the Queen and to free the people. This film is very well done and has a very good storyline. This is the first movie to really capture my attention. I would definitely recommend this film.

A short but fun action movie about a killer who gets his revenge on the cops who killed his father.  The film is good fun, but a little over the top at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're right: it's not an obvious and simple comedy, but the story, the characters, the comedy...all great.  I found it a bit odd that a bunch of guys in their forties who were very famous and rich, who could afford a private plane and lots of other luxuries, would take a rather long vacation, spend it in a very beautiful place (where, by the way, they had a really nice beach, which I didn't realize was actually a beach) and then have a very public affair with a pretty girl who had been brought up in a really strict Christian family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a hard time seeing myself in this movie. The character was interesting. He was a former slave that was turned into a slave again. I wasn't so much surprised by that as I was by how his character developed. I don't think that he should have been able to turn into a human again after he was turned in the first place. I mean, I don 't know what kind of surgery he went through to turn back into a snake, but it is not the same as having the soul. The movie also had a strong ending. I think that this was a good way to end the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I was at the screening and it was great. I have been meaning to see this movie for a long time. It is a fantastic example of how not to make a good film. Â It was shot like a video game and in a lot of ways it was.  It was pretty good looking too.    The action scenes were done like a bad video game.  It was not a good video game, but the action scenes that were shown were not done by a real professional like in the movies.  The story was boring.  No action or anything interesting.  This movie is just about the action.  There were many things that made this movie, that is not a bad movie.  I would give it a 4 star rating, but there were several things that ruined it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a group of high school girls who are having a great time. One of the girls, Emma (played by Lizzy Caplan), is a virgin and is only in love with one of the boys, Jeff (played on screen by David Hyde Pierce). This is where the movie gets a little bit weird.   I thought the movie was a little boring but it didn't stop me from watching it. I thought that it was a very well written movie. I liked the way it kept the audience interested.  The movie also has some great songs which made the movie even better.  It had great dialog, great acting, great songs, and a great ending.  The music was a nice change of pace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm going to be honest, I didn't expect much from a horror movie with a bunch of dead people.   It's not bad, and I found it pretty creepy.  It gets a bad rap from most critics, and while I found the movie to be pretty creepy and scary, I don't think it's the worst horror movie I've ever seen.  I think it has a few good ideas, but I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ If you like a good old fashioned Hollywood flick about a guy who wants to get rich in a city with an enormous budget but can't, you'll love the original, the remake, and the new "Greed" from Warner Bros. A great movie with lots of humor and lots of action. I think this is one of the better "gangster" movies of the last 20 years. The script is brilliant and the action is a bit over the top, but I really think that the story and characters are really well done. The movie is pretty violent and the ending is rather ridiculous, but the movie is still pretty good. If you are looking for a movie to "get your blood pumping" in a good way, then I think you'll like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (as the movie itself is named) is a comedy about a group of stoner friends who are trying to find a missing missing person.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I found this film to be a really enjoyable film and a pretty good movie overall. It's a story of a man who has to come to terms with the fact that he has a son that he just lost and a wife that he is left with. He is left to find a new job and find a way to support his family. The film was shot in a very realistic way and there was a certain realism to it. The music was great and there were a lot of shots that made you think. The movie itself was pretty entertaining. It is a very interesting story and the characters were all interesting. It was a bit confusing when it came to who was who and who knew what when. I also thought that it was a little hard to follow. There were a couple of scenes that just didn't seem to make any sense at all. I'm sure that people will enjoy this movie but I think it might be a little confusing at times.

This movie is a total piece of crap.  There's not a single good thing to say about this movie.  It's an old school horror movie where the killer has a baby, the baby is a ghost that sucks people's souls and is the reason that everyone in the town is so obsessed with killing the killer.  One of the characters in the movie tries to kill the killer and gets killed by him.  This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last 2 years of my life were spent with a guy who was so attractive that his looks were always the center of attention, and with this movie his looks are always on the front burner. I'm a big fan of John Huston films and this is one of his finest. There are some truly great scenes that are well shot and well acted, but the real highlight is John Hustson as Mr. B.S. Haldeman. I can't imagine a more compelling villain. I was reminded of this movie again and again, because it is one hell of a ride and it is worth every second of your time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like to watch a really good movie (and I like to see a really great movie, if only for its sheer audacity), then this is one of the best you can get. It's a thriller about a man whose wife is kidnapped by the FBI (in this case, the fictional CIA) and then his father is murdered, which is why he has to come up with the money to get her back. But the best part about this movie is its use of its source material: The books and the movie are so similar in so many ways, that if you watch the movie without knowing what the books are about, you might have a hard time figuring it out. This movie was so good that I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially to people who are fans of the books.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the epitome of a great movie. There is a lot of action and excitement throughout this movie, but it never goes too far. The movie is a real time event.   The movie starts with a guy named Steve who is getting a little tired of his life. He is bored and wants to move on to the next adventure. So he decides to take a little trip to the woods in the hope of a bit of adventure. After this adventure he starts to feel guilty for what he did. So when he decides it's time to leave the forest, he asks a local woman named Jessica if she can help him out. Jessica is the one who helps him out the most throughout the movie. She is the most level headed of all the characters in the movie and she is always thinking about the consequences of her actions. The ending of the movie is very good.  This movie is one of the best of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this world of superheroes, you don't have to be the best to get noticed.  And the great thing about The Flash is that he's a great guy with a great heart and a good sense of humor.    The Flash, a.k.a. Jay Garrick, has a great sense of justice and a very strong sense of what it means to be a superhero.  It's hard to get a sense of who he is without seeing him in action.  In this first part of the film he's working for a corrupt government, but he's good at what he does.  He makes a deal with a criminal called the Red Hood who is a villain in his own right.  While working with the Red Hood, Jay gets into a fight with another bad guy called The Trickster.  The Trick is the son of the Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, and he's the leader of a gang called the Sinestro Corps.  With Jay's help, the Sinister Six come to the rescue and the villains are defeated.  Jay then leaves with the Sinisters in tow.  Afterward he meets up with his old friend, the Atom, in Central City.  When they meet, they realize they have a lot in common.  That's not a bad thing.  Both men are kind of like Superman: strong, intelligent, with a sense for justice.  They're both also very smart, but a bit more reserved.  And, in fact, they're both a little nuts.  This is a good film.  But I wouldn't necessarily call it a great film.   I've been spoiled by some great superhero movies over the years.  My favorite superhero is Batman, and I'm glad to see him back on screen.  Batman Begins was also a great movie, but I was underwhelmed by it.  I don't know why.  There are things I don the Batman suit and it doesn't seem as good as I remembered it.   And I don's my Batman is a lot more dark than I remembered.  If I ever get to the point where I have to choose between a Batman film and a Superman movie, I'd probably take the Superman film.     So who am I kidding?   I'm not really a fan of superhero films.  Most of the ones I've seen were pretty bad.    It's true.  Like, really bad.

He is the head of a drug cartel, and he is trying to take over a small town, by killing off the inhabitants. He takes the girl of the town, the wife of the Sheriff, and makes her a prisoner in the house, and uses her to kill anyone who tries to stop him. This is the only good part of this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man who is on a journey to get his life back on track gets into a car accident. The accident kills his passenger and his dog. He wakes up to find his dog missing, and finds that his friend, a retired detective, was killed in the accident. Now the detective is a bad ass. He is also a very skilled thief and a good fighter. He has to deal with the killer, a serial killer, who wants revenge for the murder of his wife. The killer doesn't want to get caught, so he hires a guy who will help him: a young girl who is in love with the serial killer. They have to get back to their hotel in time, because the killer is coming to get them.   This is a good thriller and I like the way it is structured.  The way the story unfolds, it is pretty much an open ended mystery.  I thought that it was a good way to tell a story, because it didn't get bogged down by a lot of unnecessary characters or situations.  I was interested in the detective because he has to go through a lot. He can't just stay home and keep an eye on his job, and he has a lot to do.  And the girl who works for the killer doesn`t have a lot going on in her life.  But the story is good enough that it didn`t bother me too much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no expectations to watch this movie at all. I had never seen the movie and I was just going to say, that's an ok movie, I just don't get the theme.   The movie opens with a young man talking to his girlfriend about the old movie.  He is talking about how he and his father had seen the film and it had been a big movie in their house and it was the first movie he ever saw with his dad.  I can't remember if this movie is in fact a movie or not, but it certainly looks like a movie and sounds like a very bad movie. I'm not going to spoil it for you by giving any of the plot details.  So anyway, the movie begins in a hospital and we learn that there is a mysterious disease that kills people within hours of being infected. The people that die are usually the very young, the very old and the very sick. So the main character has just arrived at the hospital and he's going to be one of those people. But first we are treated to a beautiful, sad and disturbing movie. It starts out with a beautiful girl, whose name is Rose (Carmen Bell), in a restaurant, getting ready to go home to the apartment she shares with her boyfriend. The boy, who's name is John, who is a young boy, plays in the kitchen while Rose is getting ready. Rose notices that he is watching her while she's in the bathroom. Rose leaves to go back to her apartment, but John is still there watching her. It's at this point that John notices that Rose has been getting close to him and he can't resist it. They go into the apartment and John begins to kiss her, but then he hears something strange in the room. It sounds like someone is trying to drown the boy, but Rose isn't able to get the boy out of the bathtub. Rose gets upset, but her boyfriend is not. So Rose goes back to the bathroom and tries to call John, but he's not answering. Rose is trying the whole time, but there's no response. John is now trying to get out of his apartment and the movie stops.  In a way this movie seems like it would be good, but the whole thing just seems so silly and unbelievable.  The theme of the movie is that there's a sickness and that's the only thing that can kill you. But it's something that you don't really understand

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film in the Star Trek series I've seen, and I was hooked.  I loved the idea of this space-faring ship that has to get through the Klingon's territory.    They also give us a few interesting characters who all have their own individual reasons to be on board this ship, but all of them have to be dealt with, which is a good thing.  Star Trek Into Darkness   was released in late 2012 and it was pretty good.  It was a continuation of the first film, and in my opinion was a bit more action-packed than the previous installment, although that may have just been because I was watching it in 2-D.  However, it was still good and I would highly recommend it.  I would also suggest that you give it a watch if you have never seen the first one, it's pretty good!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite character is the old lady in this movie. She's so much fun.  She is so nice, and funny, and a bit of a loon.  The Old Lady:    This is a movie that I don't usually see.   I saw it recently, and it had a good script.  The actors did a good job.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not looking forward to seeing this film. I saw it the other night and I was impressed. I am a fan of classic horror movies and I don't usually care for them, but this film has a very nice cast. The production value is excellent and it is well made. I liked the gore a lot and the effects are well done. The acting is also very good and the movie is well worth the watch. The music is nice, but I do not know the songs.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I was a little disappointed with how the film was presented in the theater. It felt a little like it was filmed in a dark cave.Â  The opening scene is a little bit more colorful than I had anticipated.Â    At first it looks like the kids are in some kind of science experiment gone awry.Â This is a great beginning and gives us a great glimpse of the future and the kind of people who will live in it.Â However, after the opening sequence we are back to the future.Â We are in the year 2050.Â The story is set in a suburb of New York and the kids have moved back to that suburb from the future in the 1960s.Â As the movie progresses, we are introduced to a lot of strange and wacky people and places in that future.  Â The movie is also pretty silly at times, which isn't really a bad thing.Â When the movie starts, you don't realize how much it has already been done.Â I thought there was a great deal more in this movie that could have been added to it. Â It does a great job at giving you an overview of the current social and technological environment.  It also has some pretty interesting things to say about the future society.    I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first three quarters of this movie are actually pretty good, and it's actually very interesting to watch a guy who's a member of a secret organization (The Order) try to figure out what they're really doing and how it all ties in with the larger picture.   Unfortunately, as it turns out, there are a lot of loose ends and it is a little confusing as to where everything will end up.  It's not too bad but it could have been a lot better.  I was expecting more from this film.  But, the ending was unexpected and the ending itself left me wondering how it's all going to come together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of David Lynch. I am also a huge Lynch fanboy, I have been since the early 90s. My favorite Lynch film is the infamous Blue Velvet. This was his last movie.   It's a very Lynchian story about a guy named Jeff, a man that had lost his job, his girlfriend left him and he is now living with his parents, and his pet rabbit. He is having some trouble in his life, his dad and his mother are still very angry about his past, but at the same time he is trying to be more adult and responsible, even though he is very immature.  He does have his good days and bad days, but he's still a good man.  I thought that this was a very good movie, but I would like to see a little more of the movie. The plot is pretty good.  The acting was excellent.  It has a very weird ending, but it's still very good. I will definitely be watching this again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good film. It's got a good mix of comedy, horror, and drama, and it's great to see a movie about a ghost with no explanation.  The ending is pretty good, but I wish the film would've kept going until the end.  See more ▼ See less ▲ Ghosts of the Past -    I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a "The Exorcist" or a "Paranormal Activity" with ghosts in this film.   It's really a horror/comedy that has all the elements of a good ghost story, but it's really just a good story.  A lot of people have said this is a "found footage" movie, but that's not really true.  It has some good found footage, but the rest is just good storytelling.  I thought it was a little slow at the beginning, but once the characters start doing what they do, it really picks up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good old fashioned horror film and has the usual  Hollywood set dressing,  the monster is very well drawn and scary and the story is a good one.  The plot goes like this:   A scientist and his assistant are studying the mysterious disappearance of an elderly man who is supposed to be dead for a week and who suddenly comes back to life in his apartment.    He is a very sick man and the doctor wants to get to the bottom of his sickness, so he begins to investigate.  He begins to think that he might be able to help the man and his wife and daughter.  Then the doctor begins to have visions of a black dog in the house, who seems to have the same abilities as the doctor and the assistant.  I don't know how it ended up on the silver screen but it was a fun film and I think I will see it again.

His wife died in a tragic accident when he was very young, and he and his son, Jim Jr., had to raise themselves in a hostile world. They are not perfect, but they are a good family, and that's why they survived the longest. After many years of imprisonment, the Shawshanks were freed and were finally able to be together, in a world they knew was still very much dangerous.

It has some great comedy as well, especially when the police officer is trying to figure out how to get the kids home after their mother was killed in the accident. I loved this movie, and I really hope to see more movies like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the first of a trilogy that will take place in the 1980s, a time when the United States is falling apart from the economic problems that have gripped the nation. When two high school friends, Jesse (played by Jesse Eisenberg) and Lisa (played brilliantly by Laura Linney) get caught up in the corruption and greed of the corrupt Mayor (Jeff Daniels), a powerful New York City political figure, they are faced with the difficult decision of whether to take him down or let him continue to destroy. It's a pretty dark and bleak movie and one that I highly recommend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie is the plot. The only bad thing about the plot is the characters.   This movie is about the same guy that was in the "Dawn of the Dead" remake. He is an asshole. He drinks, smokes, and has sex with anyone that will have him.  He is obsessed with his "family" and only thinks of them when he gets his kicks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â   Â The first half of the film takes place in a hospital and the second half in a prison, both places in which the prisoners are tortured and humiliated. Â These two prisons are located on opposite sides of a mountain, in the middle of a desert, the only thing in between them is a small town, which contains nothing but a church and a tavern.  The main character, Â a young, blond, fair-skinned, red-headed girl, has been sent to a small, remote village to work as a servant for a farmer and a butcher.    She is also the daughter of a rich farmer who was executed in the village because of the fact that he had a large, beautiful daughter.     When the farmer is killed by a mysterious assailant who is wearing a dark blue coat and a hood,   the villagers find the young girl with a wound in her back.  In the next few days the girl slowly recovers from her injury, but is still terrified of the dark and her life.  She also feels lonely and unhappy and soon begins to cry.  At first,  the village is not concerned about her injuries.  The young girl continues to work at the farm until her injury heals and then she is sent back to the village.  For a while,    the villagers are happy to see her again,  but the young woman also begins to be afraid of the man who is slowly killing her family.  Eventually the villagers begin to realize that she is a danger to them and try to kill her,  though they are unsuccessful.  But the villagers can not take this kind of danger from a little girl and they also try to run her out of the village,  however this only makes the girl more suspicious of them.  One day,  the man, a mysterious man named  Bertram,  steals the girl's baby and the villagers fear that he is going to murder her.  However,  it turns out that   Bertram is not the murderer.  After a series of strange happenings,  B Bertram is forced to leave the village and the people of the town think that he has been a guest and have no idea who he really is.  Now the people decide to capture the man in order to find out who he is and to kill him.  And so, the film begins to explore the meaning of life, death
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure if this is an action movie, but I would consider it an action film.  The premise of the film is simple:  A young man (Bruce Willis) and his mother are driving home from a trip to Mexico and are struck by a hit and run driver (Mark Wahlberg) who drives them off a cliff.  They end up in a hospital where the doctor (Bill Paxton) has a mysterious gift (he can turn people into animals) and a strange cat (Robert Redford) and the doctor and the two animals are trying to figure out who is responsible for the death of their parents.    I have to say I liked the action scenes.  It was really intense and the cars looked great.  They are really well made.  The acting was not great, but it wasn't bad either.  Some of the scenes were just silly (one of the animal transformations was just plain weird).  The ending of the movie was very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been following this movie since it was first shown at the Cannes Film Festival. I was always looking forward to it since it seemed so different from the other Hollywood movies. It is a movie about a guy who travels to a city called Siam to see a famous director called "Nelson" who made the movie "The Great Santini". The movie has some wonderful scenes and a great performance by a young actor. I think that this movie has a nice ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to be depressed, you'll get it in the first 5 minutes of this film.  The film takes place in the near future, where a man and his wife are trying to save money by selling off a small farm.  The plot is quite simple, you can tell that the filmmakers didn't want to do too much with the plot, but they didn't need to.  You'll be able to predict almost everything that happens to this couple, so you can feel depressed if you haven't seen a depressing film before.  This film is about as low as the lowest lows can get.   A pretty low-budget horror film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said in the beginning, I'm a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters movie. I'm not sure why people like to rip it off (well, they probably do) but it's not that hard to follow. It was a solid Ghostbusters movie, and I would say it is better than the original.   The only bad thing about the original was the ending.  The movie ends with an abrupt jump to a new location. Well, I don't know if the jump was necessary, but it didn't really make sense. I also think that the plot line was changed a bit.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** ******************** This movie has a lot of great things going for it: great acting, great action, a great story. There are a few issues with the story: one is the fact that it doesn't really get into the main conflict. The main conflict is a lot more obvious in the second half of the movie, where the characters don't have as much of a reason to be angry at each other, but it's still very much in focus. I can see why they would have wanted to keep it a mystery until the end, but in the end it's a little too obvious. Also, the ending is kind of silly. ********************* ****************** I can't say this movie is without its flaws: it's not as strong as it could be, it's kind of slow, and there's a couple of weird moments, but the story is a very good one, and the acting is good. The only thing that bothers me about it is that the film does seem to get a little boring in the last act or so, but that doesn't happen often.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie has all the usual trappings of the genre:  a boy, a girl, a boy's house, a big house, lots of animals, etc. The movie is set in a very large house, and the set and props are very impressive. The cast is very good. The boys are all good actors (the main character, especially) and the girls are all pretty good, too. The house is full of great stuff. There are lots of rooms, and lots of different animals, including monkeys, tigers, and all kinds of birds. There's a large garden, a pool, a lake, and a small river. The whole thing is so large that it looks a little small at times, but it's all in the right place. I especially enjoyed the music, and even though there are lots and lots and tons of little jokes, they are all very funny. There is some pretty good singing, too, especially the song about the monkey, which was sung by a girl. It is, of course, the last song in the movie. It's not really a bad movie, although it's not a great one. The writing is a little clunky and the acting is a bit inconsistent. The music is very catchy, though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say this is a fun and exciting movie that is worth the price of admission. It's not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, but I'd like to think the first half is more of a roller coaster ride, and the second half is much more like a real, gritty and action-packed movie.   The movie is about a group of bad guys trying to rob a bank. One of the guys has a gun and gets close to the bank teller, and then is chased away by a security guard, but he finds a stash of cash.  - The first half starts out with a bad guy shooting at a guy in a car, then he gets out of the car and shoots at the guy on the ground, then comes up behind him, puts a gun to his head and shoots him, and a few shots to the head, but then the bad guy gets away.   in the next scene, the bad guys are sitting in a big truck and are in a fight with a police officer, then they drive off and then one of the bad dudes pulls out a gun. the baddie has a mask, so you can't see who it is, but it is a guy with a long beard. The bad guy has a bad back, but is in decent shape. He is also in good shape because he is not a bad ass. the first shot hits him right in the back, and his back starts to fall apart. But he keeps going and eventually he gets up, and fires a shot at the bad dude, but misses. he fires again, but hits the badder. The next shot hits the back of the second bad guy's head, and he falls over, but the badguy continues.   and the baddies keep going.   the baddy in the truck is very tall, but not too tall. the guy with the long beard has a really long sword, but a really bad one, the blade is made of metal and looks like a sword, it looks like it was made by someone who wanted to do a good job and then had a bad idea. the sword is in the shape of a spear, but has a point at the end. he also has a long wooden club. and then he also gets a gun out of his truck. he uses a gun in the first scene.  , but in the second scene, he uses his gun to try and shoot the baddude who is
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie. It's a classic story about a young boy who is sent to a boarding school and learns to survive the horrors that come with being a kid.  The only problem with this movie is that it's not very good.  It's just really cheesy, and there are a lot of characters who don't get much screen time, and even fewer who get much development.  I was really looking forward to this movie because I've seen it a couple of times and always found it to be very entertaining.  But the fact that it is just so badly written, and the fact it doesn't have any real characters really ruins it.  If you don't mind that it isn't very good, then this movie might be for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good because it's got some of the best lines and it's a little dark at times. The character's are well written, but sometimes it seems like they are written to give the illusion that they are doing something good. But they don't. They don't do anything good. They aren't funny. They are not realistic. They have no redeeming qualities. They all do bad things and are bad at everything. I liked the movie, but it didn't mean a thing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie I have reviewed above is a pretty good movie about the history of the war, about the battles, about some of the important and important characters and about the war itself. There are some interesting characters who are in the movie: I like a guy who was a big fighter in the beginning and later on became an actor. This guy, played by a nice German-speaking guy, also has a very interesting story about the battle of Stalingrad. The movie has a good and entertaining story and is very interesting and enjoyable. There is also some great action scenes, a lot of funny moments, some interesting situations and also some very interesting scenes about the different soldiers in the war.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out with a great song that just makes the movie.   They show us a little girl and her friend playing on the swing set.  They get a little excited when the little girl gets a small frog and eats it.  This is a great little scene that really shows the kids imagination.  They make the frog dance around on the ground and the frog's arms and legs start to move.  In the movie, a boy has a frog named "Duckie" and it is his only friend.  The frog gets scared of the boys and he starts to climb out of the bed.  Duckie runs to the door and ducks behind the door but the boy and his brother catch up to him and they start to beat him up.  When the little frog gets beat up, Duckie falls into a hole.  There is no way the boy will let the frog go and he decides to use the frog as a baseball bat.  After that, he is ready to play and throws a ball at the frog.  He hits Duckie but the frog keeps running and the boy finally catches up to the frog and kicks him in the back of the head.  That is the beginning of the movie and it makes me want to watch it again and again.  The frog makes a lot of good choices and is a really nice character.      If you want a good story about a little frog and his friends, look no further.  It is very short and easy to watch and the kids love the frog, Duck, and the other little friends that they meet.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I've been waiting for this film since I was a kid and now I'm older and even more nostalgic. Â The film follows the lives of a couple who are married in a small town in Kansas, with the husband being the sole breadwinner.  The film is set in the 1950's and the town is located in the mountains and has a strong Christian background.    In a small farming community the husbands work the land and their wives work the fields.  The wives both have the same job, cleaning out the barns.    The men are the head of the household, they both work on the farm, but they aren't as successful as their wives, they make less money than they should.  I love this movie because it is just a classic, but there are a few flaws that make it a little disappointing.  There are a couple of times where the film just stops moving, and the characters just sit there, staring out at nothing.  One of the men gets hit in the head with a rock when he tries to leave the barn for a hike.  He walks off the trail, but then gets hit again by the rock.  At this point the film loses its interest and doesn't seem to know where it is going, it just continues to walk around and stare out at the woods and the mountains.  A couple of other things that don't help is that the characters are just a little too close together and one of the husbands gets really angry at his wife, when she starts talking about him and the way she dresses.  After a while the husband starts to beat his wife and he hits her pretty hard.  These are a little frustrating to watch.  It also doesn't help that the movie is set on a very small, rural farm with only a couple hundred people, and it takes a while for the film to really take off.  However, I am glad to see that it is still around and that it can still be enjoyed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite of the "Vampires, Werewolf's, and Supernatural" movies is The Beast Within.    It's not quite the horror film I thought it would be, but it's not terrible either.   The film is told in a semi-documentary style, and there are a few interesting points about the film (the way that people can tell you that they have seen the movie before even though they haven't) and the movie does have a few good moments.  The actors are all very good, with Gary Busey in particular being excellent.  Also, the film is not afraid to show its violence and gore, which is great.  This is a pretty entertaining movie, and it's worth seeing.  I give it 4 out of 5

The story follows a group of four friends, all of whom have a passion for skateboarding. They are all extremely gifted at it, but it is the way in which they do it that truly defines their personalities. The film is really well made and the music is really good.   The film has a great cast and director. They manage to capture the spirit of a group who enjoy their sport very much and are happy to show it to the world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Road Warrior" is a good Western.  The main character, John Marston (played by Mel Gibson) is a tough, hard-drinking, gun-for-hire who has to drive across the desert with his two young sons to find his estranged wife and their three children, who are being held captive by the evil General Wade E. "The Roadrunner" Baker (played in the film by Tom Sizemore) who is trying to become president of the United States.    When Marston finds his wife and his kids, he fights his way through a series of dangerous, yet fascinating situations, until he is able to capture the Road Runner and bring him back to civilization.  It's a good story with a lot of action and a lot to learn from.  But "The road warrior" isn't the only Western Gibson does, there are also "The Running Man" (1976) and "The Passion of the Christ" (1989).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only positive review I can give this film is that it had a great soundtrack.   This film is so much more than a great comedy and a great thriller.  This is a film that is so entertaining that you will have to stop watching it to get your fill.  It is so good that even though the ending was a little strange it didn't take away from the rest of the film.  The plot is really good, you have a little bit of everything going on and there is a lot of fun to be had with the characters and the plot.  There are some odd characters in this film, the lead character in particular is quite odd but in a good way.  If you like comedy you will like this film. If you do not like comedy then don't watch this film as you will not like it.  I have seen this film a number of times now and it never gets old.

This time, the kids don't have to worry about the evil Krunk, and don't even have to wait for him to show up.  In the meantime, the Goonies have a lot of fun with some of the local residents: a woman who wants a good man for her husband, a cop who thinks he's a real man, and a couple of young children who think they're the only ones who remember them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts off with the usual suspects: a police officer, his wife and son, a young couple, a girl who is on the run from the police, a prostitute, and a little boy who has a toy gun that he shoots with. The girl runs off, and the little boy is killed by the police. It seems to be an everyday life in New York. After a brief chase, the cop is found dead in the woods, and his son is being interrogated by a man who says he is the police chief. The film then goes to a bar. There is a guy sitting at the bar with a girl, who seems to like him a lot. At one point, a gangster comes in, and she seems to have no idea who he is. The movie then goes back to the cop's house, and we learn that he has a gun and is shooting people. He finds out that there is a child, and he has to get the child. The police get involved in a car accident, and they come back to his house. He says he has two other children, but they are dead, so he has the police come in and shoot them. He then tells the police that he can get the police off his back. The cop says that he cannot do that because he has killed innocent people. The gangster shows up and tries to get his guns, and is shot in the arm. The cops start to shoot the gangster. They get to the child and see that the child is dead, and that he was not the gangsters child. They then go to the bar and find out that the kid has a box of his toys in his room, which he never had. Then they go to a hotel room where a man has been murdered, and find that the dead man was a hitman who killed the hitman. The killer has a dog, but it turns out that it is just a toy. The man was trying to find out the killer. He goes back home, and says that the dog was not real, but that the man was. The woman comes home and finds that the father has died, and so the little girl is now the girl's mother. She then goes on to kill a couple of police officers. She kills one, and then goes over to the kid's house to see that they have been murdered. She goes back into the bar to see a man that was killed in the bar. She tells the bartender
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a classic: It's a good film, and the script is great, it's the cinematography that makes this film stand out. The film is set in an American town during the 1930's, where the town's people are in a state of deep depression. They're tired, they're sick of their miserable lives, and they're ready for a change. They go out in search of a new life, and in their quest they stumble upon a beautiful young woman who is willing to do anything to change her situation. They don't know it at the time, but she is a member of a secret society of spies. She is a very dangerous person, because she knows more than they do. They have a job to do, and that job is to keep the secret of a very important operation from the authorities. They can't do it alone, though, and after a while, the only ones who can succeed are the members of the Society.   This is a good spy story: It gets the job done. There's a twist, and it's all right, but the twists are not over the top. There are some scenes that are a little strange, but it's not an over the edge thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Came Back" is a good, if not the best movie about the war in Vietnam. It is based on the true story of a British officer named Jack Reade, who went to Vietnam in 1967 and served in the Vietnam War. Reade was a veteran of the Second World War who returned home in the 1970s. Rejecting a military career, he decided to use his talents as a reporter and photographer to document the war. However, the war had not been won. As Reade's reporting took him from a village in the jungles of Vietnam to a city in the city of Hue, he was caught up in a civil war. Rejection by the American military, Reade returned to Britain. After he was forced to give up his career as a journalist and photographer, he turned to photography again. Reades work took him to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR). In these countries he filmed people and events, and in 1989 he went to the DRC. While in the country he came across the body of an African woman who had been beaten to death and buried by the Congolese army. Reanade returned home and his story was featured in newspapers and magazines. In 1994, after his article on the rape of a woman in Kigali, Rwanda, was published, the British government banned Reade from leaving the country. This resulted in a lengthy legal battle with the British authorities, who argued that Reade had acted unlawfully in photographing the crime, and thus the British ban was an unlawful restriction of freedom of expression. Reate was finally allowed to leave the country in 1996. He now lives in the United Kingdom and is retired from writing and photography.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie has a lot of violence, which is very entertaining.  It is very disturbing, but not as disturbing as the first film.    The movie has many references to the first one, and there are many things that are similar.  One of the scenes is very similar to the original, and I loved it.  I have only watched the first movie a few times, and they both really are good, and have a lot to do with the future of the country. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Night Stalker" is the story of a man who is a night stalker. In his case it's not a matter of a few years but a decade of stalking the night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies (I'm not even a huge fan of the genre) but I liked this movie very much. I think it has a lot of potential. I also liked the way it played out in the beginning. It was slow and it felt very creepy. I can't say more than that. I was able to enjoy it a lot. I don't think I could watch it all the way through. The movie is very well acted. It has a very strange and eerie feel to it. There is a scene where a man is in a very old house that is completely dark, and there are noises coming from upstairs. There's a man in the closet with a flashlight and a man standing in the corner. I had to go back to see if they were in the same scene again. I wish the movie was longer. I felt like the ending could have been a bit better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic movie about two brothers and their father's love for the "Ugly American" (John Wayne) and the bad blood between the brothers. The movie has an original story that involves the assassination of an American General in Mexico, the subsequent Mexican War and the final death of John Wayne, the General. John Wayne's character was based on the real John Wayne (1866-1940) who served as a Captain in the Union Army during the Civil War. In a scene in the movie the Mexican General is portrayed by an American actor (Oscar-winning actor and star of the movie) who was a great Mexican actor. "I know the good American soldier, and I know he never kills a Mexican!"    John Wayne's great strength was that he was both brave and a good man, he was an honest man who always stood by his men when they were under attack, he took no prisoners and when his men were outnumbered he made them all the way to the Mexican capital (Mexico City). He would always stay with his men until the end and was always there to protect them. John did not like to fight with the Mexican Army, he always thought it was better to keep his men and let them fight for themselves. This attitude was why he lost his life at the end of the Mexican War.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of the movie and its sequel.  The film is about a group of college kids who go on a camping trip to a new resort, but soon find themselves in a race to find the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle.    This movie is great and it has a lot of laughs and action.  The movie is about the group of campers who go to the new resort and meet a group that looks like the mafia.    The mafia is in fact a bunch of hippies who take up camping trips because the cabins are really big.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As much as I like horror movies, I'm not really a fan of the slasher subgenre. I've never really enjoyed them that much, but it wasn't that long ago that I was really digging them. The fact that this movie manages to combine the best elements of both of those genres in a movie that is more than a little scary is an achievement in itself.  Rating: 5/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't really think of a better movie than this. This is the most realistic portrayal of a Vietnam war I've seen in a long time. The war in Vietnam is an all too familiar story. The people are dying, but the government is corrupt and evil. The US government is at war against the people, who have been resisting the oppressive government for years. The country is still recovering from the war, and a number of veterans are still living out their old lives in the countryside. They are not the only ones who remember this war, as the film is also told from the point of view of those who have returned home. The movie is about the people of Vietnam. This war is about people fighting against a government that is trying to take away their freedoms. The film is told from their point of views, and from the viewpoints of those people who have seen it all before. There is a lot of information about the war in the film, but it doesn't bore you. You see the war all too clearly. It is a very realistic portrayal, and very sad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a bit of a shame that this movie didn't last for much longer because this film is pretty damn fun. I love when a film is done well and this one is great. There's not much action in this one but you don't need much to make a good time. The story is pretty basic and I think the movie could have been longer but there's plenty of laughs. It has a good soundtrack and a great story. I'd give this one a watch if you're looking for a fun, fun action film.   - - - - Out of all the movies I've seen that were directed by Akira Kurosawa, this one was one of the most interesting. There is no fight in this movie but it's pretty cool. You'll get to see a little of Japan and see some of the characters from Kurosawas movies like "Yojimbo" and "Seven Samurai". The characters in this film are all pretty much like the characters in "Yajimbo". The only difference being that this one takes place in modern day Japan. It's a good watch and it's definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ If you're looking for an enjoyable time with a laugh or two, this is a good place to find it. The plot is a little too on the nose, but there are some great characters, and a fun time is had by all. There's a scene where a guy goes to a movie, and he's in a bar with a bunch of guys, and one of them tells him he should give up smoking, and that he should probably stop drinking too. And then, the guy comes back to his girlfriend and says, "What's the matter? You've been watching too many movies about guys who smoke a lot of cigarettes, but you never see a guy who drinks a lot too!" And she says, (in a mock-southern accent) "Well, there's a lot I'm not interested in! I don't care what they do! I've got to get on with my life!" So there it is! (If you're a guy, you might want to look away now.) _________________________________________ __________________________________________________ _______________________________________ This movie is fun. It's a comedy about a guy named Doug (Chris Tucker) who is about to go on a job and meet the girl of his dreams (Minnie Driver) at the bar. However, Doug is not the most social guy. In fact, the first time he meets her, she has already left. He goes to the bar and finds her, and they get along great. Then Doug is at a party and he runs into a friend (Ricky Nelson). But it seems Ricky doesn't really like Doug, and decides to take a different approach. He starts talking to the girl he likes and trying to get to know her a little better. The problem is, that the girl is the girlfriend of a guy that Doug knows. So the guy gets jealous, and is about ready to tell Doug that he's going to get him fired. It turns out that Ricky has been looking for a way to impress the girl with a little bit of dancing, so he gives her a dance lesson. But then, he realizes that his dancing has been a little rough and he can't really do the "samba" he's practiced so much. But the girl seems to like him. So Ricky goes to see Doug, to try and figure out what he can do to win her over. And this movie just keeps getting better and better. There are several scenes with Doug and Ricky

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was really good! It has a nice mix of action, comedy, suspense, romance, drama, and action, and there was plenty of it. The story is well done, with a good balance of action and romance. The movie does have a few things that I thought were odd:   1. The characters are very generic, not too different from the other characters in the movie.   2. I was disappointed by the ending, it was pretty much a rehash of the ending to the first movie, but at least it had a happy ending.   the other ending to both movies was a pretty bad one, I was very disappointed with it, so I thought that the other endings were just to make up for that.  , Overall, I thought the film was good, although I think that it should have had a little more action. It did have a lot of action. The romance was good too.

The film had an extremely low Rotten Tomatoes rating, and was not that much fun. I don't think that was the fault of the director, but the writing, acting and direction are just not very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun, if slightly dumbed-down, movie about a guy who, by the time he is 14, is the leader of a gang of kids who take out petty thieves. The movie is full of stupid, cheesy jokes, which are all pretty good, but the movie itself is pretty dumb, especially considering it's about a bunch of kids, who are too young to be in a gang, let alone run a gang. They also take a pretty dim view of the police, and have a tendency to get into fights with the cops.   In all, this is a pretty good movie, although I can't say I'm a fan of its comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know it at first, but this movie is not just a pretty girl with a beautiful voice. It's a good looking, and I must say, a very good movie.   This is one of the few movies that I saw that actually made me want to laugh.  The girl is beautiful, and you can tell she was born to sing. The guy, on the other hand, is a loser.  As I said earlier, this is a pretty good movie, so why not give it a shot?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure this is the first movie in which the protagonist, the hero, has a name that starts with a "k".   He's also the first person to use the phrase "you know it when you see it" in a movie.   It's a good thing, because it's a very bad movie. I mean, there's really nothing here.    The plot involves an old lady who wants to be taken to heaven by a priest.  That's about it.  She falls asleep, gets a bad case of amnesia, then wakes up again, and is now a nun.  When she learns that her priest is a bad man, she decides to go to hell with him.  It sounds like a bad story, right? Well, there are only two things wrong with it. First, the priest is very good looking.  Second, the movie has only one good idea.  But it's too bad.  Don't bother going to the movie:    This is a film about a woman who falls in love with a bad priest, but falls asleep in the convent and then wakes again as a nun (well, not really).  This woman then finds a way to get to heaven, but not by going through the priest, who is very bad. Instead, she has a friend who is also a bad person, but is a very good man, and she convinces him to go on a quest to get her to heaven.  And there are lots of good ideas in this film.  First, there is a priest who is a real bad man.  Secondly, there isn't much of a plot, and the movie is about a bad woman.  I know, this is a movie about a nun, but it's not as interesting as it is about the bad priest.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was entertaining, but the ending was not what I was expecting.  As I said earlier, it is not a "good movie" per se, but it is a good example of how not to make a movie.    The story is set in an isolated area of New Mexico, and it focuses on the life of a family of ranchers.  I enjoyed the movie, but if you are looking for a good "camp" movie, look elsewhere.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old movie. I've seen it so many times that I have forgotten how it all started. The first time I saw it I was in my late teens. I was fascinated by the film and the characters. The movie had a very dark plot. It was about a young boy who is in a hospital for the last time. He is about to die. He was in a coma for over two months and it was only with the help of a miracle that he survived. The other characters were also very interesting. I liked them all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Crazy Stupid Love" (2012) is a romantic comedy/horror film, which is also a musical. The plot is a mix of all those elements in one. A girl is being stalked by an insane serial killer, who kidnaps her and rapes her, but then he meets another woman, who is in love with him, so she turns on him and kills him. It turns out the killer has the same last name as the girl, so he decides to kill the other woman instead. It is also funny how the serial killer has a very odd accent, so it is really strange, especially considering that the killer is not a local character. In a nice touch, the film also features a singing nun, who sings and dances at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just saw this movie a few months ago, and loved it. It's a pretty good movie. There are a few things that need to be mentioned: 1. The main character, the protagonist, is a very smart and funny guy. He has a pretty big sense of humor and doesn't take himself too seriously. The other people in the movie are pretty fun to watch too. The movie is also funny enough to make you laugh at the bad guys as well as the good guys. 2. The ending to the movie is a little too long. I'd have liked to see a little more of the movie. 3. There were a few plot holes, but I didn't find any of them annoying. 4. There's a little bit of nudity, and that doesn't bother me too much. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** I was in a serious funk when I was first introduced to "Ender's Game" at the theater. I'd heard about it, read the book, and had a vague idea of what was going to happen. This movie is not only a "classic", it is an action movie, that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat! I'll leave you with a few quotes: "The only thing that I fear is death" "We've done all we can do. Now it's up to you. You can do the rest." "We're the last line of defense. Do you hear me? We are the last lines of defense." The movie is so good, I couldn't stop watching it. I even found myself laughing at a few of the lines. This is one of the best films ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts with a little girl being dropped off by her father to go to work.  Her boss (Jack Warden) gives her a hard time for being late and a lot of questions.  She does what she is told but the boss is also a very bad man who wants to make sure that the girl stays out of trouble.   Then she meets a boy named Johnny who she becomes friends with.  He wants to go home but his mother has locked him up in the basement.  His mother wants Johnny to go and help her make a potion.  Johnny is in a hurry to get out but when he gets to the basement, he finds a horrible room filled with dead children.  This is not the only horrible place that Johnny will find in the film, but the point is that he will see a lot more horrible things in the next few days.  In addition to this horrible basement, Johnny will also see his mother being killed by a woman who uses the dark magic that the kids have in this house to do whatever she wants.  As bad as the basement is, it gets worse when Johnny and the other kids discover the body of his mother in the bathtub and they are forced to escape the house.  However, Johnny and his friends run into a group of people who also want to make a dark magic potion. This is a good point because the people who want to use this potion are really bad people who will do horrible things to the people they are trying to take over.  The bad people use their dark magic to kidnap Johnny's mother and bring her to a strange place where they have a big bonfire and make some really bad music.  Then they put a dead girl into a bag and they tie a chain around her and tie a rope around her head.  When they have done all this, they take the bag off and Johnny's mom is out.  There is a great opening scene where the people of the house are making a big fire and Johnny and Johnny are at the fire.  They are in a circle and Johnny is sitting on a rock and he is crying because he has lost his mother.  After that scene, it starts getting bad.  First of all, it is really hard to get the audience to really believe that a girl can be a witch and that she can make a bad magic potion out of a dead body.  It is really bad.   Then they make a girl out of the dead

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When a group of friends get together to watch a film that's not even made yet, one of them finds a very rare and expensive movie about a girl who gets married to a very rich man. It's only for a few days before the wedding, so they have to find a way to make the wedding happen. Unfortunately, this movie is full of bad movies that just won't stop running around and the girls are always complaining about how hard they have it to make a living. It starts off pretty good, but after a while it just gets worse and worse and the end is really ridiculous.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a pleasant surprise that a good film had been made.  I found the script, acting and direction to be very good.    The special effects were pretty good too.  It was a little long, but that is not the main problem.  The problem was the story.  For a movie about a vampire who kills his victims by drinking their blood I expected a good horror movie.  This movie is a parody of horror films.  Instead of being scary it is just silly.  I don't even remember the ending.  A movie that I am glad I saw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say anything bad about this movie, but I can say something very good about it. There is a certain tension that runs through this movie that can't be put into words. The movie is about two men in a war. The war is over and the men are coming home. They come home to a very strange country, a country that doesn't seem to understand what it has done. The men get out of the military and they start looking for a new life. They find a job at a movie theater that doesn�t work and the job is an easy one. They start going to see a movie on a weekly basis and they meet some very strange people in the theater. They learn a lot about the strange world of movies and they get a little closer to each other. They also learn a little about each other and I think that the movie does a pretty good job of showing the friendship that forms between these men. There are some great scenes in this movie and I just love this movie. It's a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "If you've ever watched a bad movie, and then a bad television show, you've got a pretty good idea what The Simpsons Movie is about.  It is a story about an old man and his family, living in a cave, and how the cave came to be and how they have been living there ever since.  A long time ago the cave was used as a burial ground and the old man (John Agar) and his wife (Kathy Bates) were the only family there when they discovered it.  As the movie begins, the family is still in the cave, although the cave is not what it was.  There are a number of things that have happened since that led to the cave being transformed.  For example, the old couple is in the hospital, and the son is working at a restaurant.  The son wants to be a fireman, and his father says no, as he wants him to be an engineer, so that he can make a better house.  His sister-in-law (Barbara Eden) has had a few kids of her own, and is now a single mother.  Her two young daughters, a girl and a boy, were both born out of wedlock.  She also has a dog, a dog-like, big black dog, named Boo.  After the cave's history is revealed, the movie moves quickly to the present, and we see the family in the present day, including the girl, Lisa.  Lisa is a bit of a loner, and as such is a great sidekick for the old guy.  I loved her, and her sister, Lisa Jr., was also a lot of fun, and I was very happy to see them both together.  They all seem to get along quite well, and Lisa Jr. was quite cute.  John Agar's voice is a little grating, but he does his job well.  In fact, I found myself wondering what it would be like if the voice actor had a different accent, and if there were some different characters, so I could relate to some of the characters.  One thing that was pretty cool was the scene where the family comes back to the house from the hospital.  We see them all in the house, including Lisa, and their house is full of various things from their past.  This was an interesting and pretty fun scene.  Also, the cave has many items from the past
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. It has a good sense of humor and is entertaining and is very faithful to the book. There are some odd and humorous things in the film, but that is what it is. There is also some interesting and disturbing things about the movie, but those are minor details. I will not give the film a perfect rating. The acting is good, and there are some good songs in the soundtrack. There were also some scenes in the movie that were not entirely enjoyable. I did not like the ending. There was nothing bad about the film. If you are looking for a good science fiction film, then you should watch this movie. It will make you laugh, but it also has a nice twist at the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title is "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and it is true, as far as this movie is concerned.  There is a lot of violence in this movie, but it is not very graphic.   It is mostly just some of the usual bad guys getting caught by the cops.  It is funny and entertaining at the same time.  I would recommend this movie to any action fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ A great film that will leave you breathless at its end. _______________   It's not hard to figure out why the director wanted to film the story of a man who has spent the last 20 years trying to win back the love of his life. He's a young man living in a small town. One day, a beautiful girl comes to town. He is instantly attracted to her. They start to fall in love and the girl begins to come to the town more often. After a couple of months, the girl returns to her home in the country. When she gets back, the man is heartbroken. He begins to look around for other women and eventually finds one in the form of a waitress. When he asks her out, she turns him down. He leaves the waitress and heads back home to look for a job. After two weeks, he is able to get a job and start looking for a girlfriend. It's a simple story, but the storyteller does a wonderful job of bringing out the beauty in it. He even makes a great villain out of the waitress. He makes her seem so attractive. _____________________________________ This is a good story about a man and his attempts to win the love he once had. _______________________________  I loved this film. ____________________  This movie is very well done.   _____________________________________________   The story is simple and the film is beautiful.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What the hell is that?" The movie itself isn't really that special. It's about a group of students at a small college in Ohio that decide to start a club for their school's sports teams. The problem is that they have no idea what they're doing. It seems like a good idea at first, but they get so much shit for it that it turns out to be a bad idea. One day a bunch of their sports teams come together to play a football game. The students decide to change the team name to the Buckeyes, but then it turns into an all-out brawl. I'm not sure I like this movie very much, but I can't say it's bad.

This happens and then the scene changes to a small village. There is a man on a bike. He goes to the house and there is a little girl, and she is crying and crying. There are a couple of men walking up the hill. The first man asks for a water jug. The man gets in the bike and they ride up the road. Then the first man looks back and sees the little girl crying. Then he starts to cry too. This goes on for a while. The little girl starts to get angry and tells the man to leave her alone. Then she starts to walk towards the man. Then a car comes and the little boy gets out of the car. The woman tells the little child to get out of her car and they run away. The mother of the little one tells the woman that she will get a job if she will go to work for a couple days. Then there is another explosion. The people in the village run and hide in the trees. Then all of a sudden the woman and child come out of hiding. They start to run and run and they end up in the forest. The father tells the child that there is an old man who is on his way to the village. The old man sees them and stops and then he says to the little man that he should be ashamed of himself for not coming to see his little child. He tells the young man that his father has gone to the city. The wife tells the mother that the old man has died a long time ago. Then they see a tree that is a lot taller than them. The tree is a real tree that was growing on the hillside. The husband says to his wife that he will find a way to get them out of this tree. He finds a way, then they get out. They go to the place where they used to live and the father shows them the way to their old home. The next day they start to live in the old house. Then one day the old woman is standing in the doorway of the old home when her husband shows up. She looks up at him and asks him what is wrong with him. He says that the little tree was on the road and it was about to crash down. Then his wife runs out and starts to tell him that he did not know the tree was going to crash. She runs off

He replies that he is an actor and he is a director. He invites the boys into the room and introduces himself to them. John asks him what he is doing there. He responds that he does not know what he will do. He shows them a book of scenes. The book has a short story which is about a man named John who has been sent to the country to become an actor. John wants to find out what is in that book and why he is there. The boy asks the man why he does this to him. The man replies that it is his job and that he will take care of John.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm sure you're familiar with the movie: It's a pretty good story about a man named Frank who has a problem: his wife is cheating on him. He is a pretty simple guy who loves his wife and kids. Frank doesn't want to go through another divorce. So he decides to start a business and take on the "old timers" who have been around the block. That seems like a good idea, right? The problem is that Frank has no clue how to run a business, and the "younger" guys he hires are just as bad as he is. He does make some money, but then the company gets into serious trouble. It's like a bad sequel to The French Connection.  The movie was originally released in 1981 and I have to say that it is pretty good. The movie is very entertaining. The story has a lot of heart to it, and it's a good script. The plot is quite simple: Frank wants to start his own business and hires some of the older people he knows. Unfortunately, it just isn't meant to be.  A really bad movie. It has a good story, and I think it's funny.    It doesn't have much going for it, but it's still worth watching if you like good stories and good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie is The Great Santini   This is the movie that brought me to love the classic film genre and to know it is a good film to enjoy.   The film is an old story of a small village, who is under the threat of a demon and a dark sorcerer. The village leader is played by the legendary Marlon Brando.  When his daughter has a miscarriage and the villagers want to sacrifice a baby to the demon to save it from death, the villagers seek out the best doctor they can find.  The doctor, played by Paul Muni, brings the baby back to life and saves the village.  After the village leader has a heart attack, the doctors decide to kill the demon.  They kill the child, and a new baby is born.  There are many other characters who are played by other great actors such as John Gielgud, Alida Valli, Paul Munis, John Cassavetes, John Huston and more.  This film is about a little girl, who must decide what to do when she is told by her mother that the village needs to sacrifice the baby.  As the little girl is about to decide what she should do, she meets the sorcerer and the demon, who she has never seen before.  Written by Tom

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen any of the movies made by Michael Mann before. The first was a great film, the second one was a little weak. This movie however is great. It starts off very strong with a great opening scene. The story follows a couple, who have a little son, who they raise. The father is a brilliant physicist who is a great father to the son. The son is a young boy, who gets into trouble with the police, because he is stealing from them. The film then follows this son throughout his life, and his parents life as well. It is a good story, and has a lot of heart. There are some great performances in this film as well, with some great acting. The plot is really solid as well with some good ideas in there. This film is a very enjoyable film. It has good characters, and an excellent plot. It's a good film, and is a lot better than the first one, which I believe could have been better.

Â The movie is set in the 50's and takes place in the early days of World War 2 when a group of kids are sent to England to serve in a special military school.  As the kids go about their mission they are introduced to a few odd characters and also learn to deal with a very strange and strange British Army.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first two-thirds of this movie are just a typical slasher movie, but then things pick up.  When the girl goes missing, she is supposedly going to be killed by the killer, but instead he goes off on his own, and the girl's brother, a doctor, tries to help him and the other victims find their way home.    As usual, the film has a lot of "shocking" moments.  One is when a group of men are killing the animals in the woods, and they stop to look at a very old woman, who is apparently a witch.  Then she casts a spell on them, which causes them to attack each other.  The other scenes are quite good.  I like that the movie isn't over-the-top.  There is a real sense of fear.  It also shows the danger of the woods when the killer appears out of nowhere, and you can sense the danger he will pose to the girls.  This film is an example of a good, horror-inspired slasher that is not over-done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie and it was a good time.  It's a little bit over the top at times but I felt like the action was well done.    There were a few instances where the plot was not as solid as it could have been.  It was a movie about a small town that goes to war against a big city and is really not all that special.  The people are not very realistic and the plot is pretty lame.  I also didn't feel like I was watching a very good movie.  In my opinion this is the first movie I've ever seen where the action scenes were very poorly done. It didn't really add much to the movie at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â "Jury Duty" is an amusing, enjoyable, and quite clever piece of work. The screenplay by Paul Schrader, the screenwriter of such films as "Stripes," "A Clockwork Orange," and "The Big Lebowski," has a dark, funny, and touching plot. This story is set in a small town in the country, where the population consists of a few hundred people. Most of the town's residents are lawyers, but there are a few jokers and a few bad apples as well. The jokers are all lawyers, most of them in the court system. Â The bad apples are the town sheriff and his deputies.    They are out to make an example of the joker, and to punish him by sending him to the county jail.  A few days later, the sheriff is in jail, and the jokers decide to go out and get him before he can go free.  The town is a good place to go if you want to see a good lawyer.  This is a wonderful comedy, with a great cast of characters, and a very amusing plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny that the film was made in the year of its release in the UK.   A British production with some British actors.  The humour and the action are well done.  In the beginning the film is rather slow but soon it ramps up the action.  As the action intensifies and the characters get more and more crazy, the humour seems to be going up a gear as well.  Overall, it's a good film.

As a bonus, it has a nice cameo from a little known actor by the name of Ralph Richardson.  If you enjoy the wonderful 1939 film, then you will love this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about a guy named Jack who is a pretty good poker player and an even better loser. His wife, a pretty beautiful, pretty intelligent, pretty good looking girl named Beth, has been married to Jack for years and he is a good guy. The movie starts off with Beth and Jack trying to sell some paintings to a friend. This turns out to be a bad idea, but it isn't until Jack is about to lose a large amount of money that he realizes that he has a very good chance of winning if he doesn't give up the paintings and play for a small stake. After winning a few hundred dollars, Jack decides to keep playing and the movie gets a little better. Jack eventually starts winning the big money games and eventually he wins over a hundred thousand dollars. The thing that I really like about this movie is that it isn\'t about how good or bad a person is. It is about how much one can play and what one can do with it. You have to remember, this is a guy who is pretty good at poker. He can outplay anyone and he can beat them down too. But when it comes down to it, he is still a pretty bad loser.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the way they show a very small town in Indiana.     The only downside of the film is the music.    I do not care if it is just one song or a couple of songs.  I just love the movie and the music, and if they had not used it, I would have never seen the movie.   As for the plot:   I like the fact that they did not just make up a bunch of people.  The characters are real people, and they are portrayed as they would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to believe that this is a remake.  In the first film, John Travolta is playing a Vietnam War veteran named Harry Callahan.    He's been on the job for a long time and the only job he really knows is to be a man in a hurry.  When a chance meeting with a prostitute (Pam Grier) sets him on the path to an even bigger payday, he decides to take a break and go to Europe.  Harry decides to stay in a small house in a tiny village called Nogent, France.  A young girl named Christine (Christina Ricci) lives next door and is not happy with her neighbors.  Christine's mother (Jean Harlow) is always complaining about her daughter's behavior.  After all, she's a bad child.  I thought that the film had the potential to be something special, but the story didn't hold my attention.  The plot is fairly simple and the acting was not bad.  It's just not enough to make me want to see the film again.  5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This movie is pretty good. Â If you liked Â The Matrix or Â Iron Man then you'll like this.  And if you liked any of the previous two movies then you're going to like this as well.    It is a little boring in a way.  It has a lot of stuff going on but it's not anything new.  But there is a lot to like about it.    It's very well acted, very well written and very well directed.  The only thing I don't like about this movie is the special effects.  And the soundtrack is very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very entertaining and full of action.  As a fan of the movie "The Running Man" and the comic book "The Man with No Name" I was excited to see this movie.    The movie is set in the same city in which "The Walking Dead" is set.  There are some similarities in the way the story is told, the zombies are very aggressive and in some parts very frightening.  The acting is excellent.  I especially liked the performance of Christopher Lloyd.  It is very hard to imagine a better actor to play the role of "The Butcher".   As for the story.  This movie is full of twists and turns and a very intense climax.  In some parts it can be hard to follow, but the movie never loses its interest and I loved the ending.  While I think the movie is a little long I am glad I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. It is an old, but great story about a young man who goes to college to become a doctor. His sister, who lives at home, tells him that she has a surprise waiting for him, that is a bit shocking and will give him a new view on life. This is a good story with a great ending, which made me happy. I recommend this movie for all ages and all lovers of good movies. I enjoyed this movie very much!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first two minutes of the movie, a couple of people get into a car, and when the car hits a pole, the guy in the back seat gets out, and yells "You guys! I don't know what's going on, but I don´t want to get in it. We got some bad guys here! There's a lot of them!" And he runs down the road. It's not a great start, but it picks up quickly. The bad guys are not that bad. They are bad guys who are very smart, but they are not too bad. I guess I was just hoping for a really good action movie, and I got one. I would like to say that I liked this movie a lot. It was a lot more interesting than it had any right to be. The action is fast paced and fun. The story is a little weird, and a little bit confusing, but if you are going to watch a movie about the evil gangsters, it is better to watch this than to watch the movie The Big Lebowski. I have not yet found out what it is about this movie, but that is not a bad thing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Airbender is one of the best animated movies I've seen.  I mean, it's so much better than the cartoons, even in the 90's.    The animation is so good, and it's not a kid's movie.  The storyline is also very interesting.  I'm not sure if this is an American or a European animated movie, but I like it a lot.  It's good for both kids and adults. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is set in a fictional town called the "Mermaid Mile" where a mysterious, dark and mysterious woman known as "the Muse" lives in a house near the beach. When the girl's lover, Mr. N.D. is murdered in a mysterious house accident, the Muse begins to take revenge.   While there are a few twists and turns, it isn't really hard to figure out what the Muse is doing here. There is some serious psychological undertones going on here, and I think it is well done. The ending, however, is very abrupt and it didn't really make sense. If you have read "The Da Vinci Code" or read anything by Stephen King, this is an excellent and very well written story. It has a great blend of mystery and psychological undercurrents, and the author manages to create a great atmosphere for the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been almost 20 years since I've seen this movie. It is still a good one. It does have a few flaws, but I still like it a lot. The story is a lot like a horror movie. You get a call from a doctor who wants to get to the bottom of a series of unexplained murders, but before he can, he is called back to his hospital in the middle of the night to investigate a possible homicide. The first half of the movie is about a murder investigation, and the second half is about the investigation. There are two investigators who are working on a case, but they have very little information about the crime. The movie takes place over the course of a few weeks, but it is very short. I don't know how the movie ends, but the ending could have been very different if it was more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a shame that so many of the good movies have been made so that we could watch them with the original cast again.   The movie takes place in a prison in the early 70s.  The lead actor is a tough old man who has been in prison for over 60 years. He is visited by a female inmate named Rosie (Molly Ringwald).  Rosie is the only inmate that can see a real prison.  She has an old time radio show and plays it for the inmates.  Rosy likes to talk about the good old days of the inmates in the prison. One of the guys in the cell next to her has a great sense of humor.  This is a good story that has a happy ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm really happy I watched this film because it has everything that I want in a good horror film: great scares, cool acting, excellent camerawork, a great soundtrack, and a really cool story. There's a couple of parts that can be really irritating, but I guess it was meant to be like that.   The film is about a college kid who goes camping with his family. There he meets a mysterious woman and after a series of strange things happen they begin to get along.  It's really interesting how the film is really a coming of age story but the film doesn't have the emotional weight that would make a film like this really stand out.

A great story about a young man with no money trying to help the people in a remote village. He is called to a small village that has just lost its sole source of water. The villagers are desperately poor and there is no food or water for them. The old woman and the two girls are desperate for any help they can get. This is a beautiful film and a great read.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title says it all.  This is a very good movie.    It tells the story of a young man named John Wilkes Booth.  He is a young Confederate soldier who was sent to Richmond, Virginia to kill President Lincoln.  The plot is pretty standard stuff.  You have the usual, a young slave girl, the typical plantation stuff and then the Civil War begins.  This is the period of the war when the southern states have started to secede from the union.  Lincoln tries to rally his southern army to defeat the secessionist states.  There are lots of characters in this movie. Booth is the protagonist.  Booth was raised by a plantation owner named Henry Lee.  When Booth was young he had a crush on his cousin, who was a white woman.  His parents don't like him much.  A couple of years ago Booth gets a job in Richmond, but there is no money for him.  One day he finds himself with a woman who is a relative of a local plantation owner.  I found this part of the movie to be pretty good.  It has a lot of comedy and romance, but also drama.  While this part is a bit more humorous than it was in the novel, it is still pretty good, especially for a movie.   The movie has some good music and is fairly good. The only negative that I have is that the movie starts off too fast.  However, the first half is pretty good and the second half of the film is very good as well.   This is one of the better movies of the 20th century.

As it stands, this movie is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about a couple who move to a new town to start a new life with their daughter. However, they have no idea what life is really like, because they don't know their neighbor's son, who they meet at school. He turns out to be a genius and a terrible liar, but his biggest sin is that he is gay. But he's so good that he's soon considered a member of the "cool kids", so everyone thinks he's gay too. One day, the boy is in the teacher's lounge, talking to his friend, and he starts to tell him about how he has a girlfriend in the town next door, and the two girls in the class are jealous of his girl's relationship with his classmate. His friend, however, is a bit of a jerk, and decides to tell the whole school about their relationship. Well, it doesn't go very well. It all ends up in a big fight, which results in the boy being suspended for a week. When the boy's father comes home, the father finds out that his son has been suspended and decides that it's best to get rid of the boy as soon as possible, so he calls the school, and informs them that his boy has been expelled. But they don´t believe him, and they decide to investigate the boy, and then decide to put him on trial for the crime. However...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the year 2054, an alien lifeform arrives on earth to find the last remnants of human civilization on a lifeless planet. It was the beginning of the end."  This movie isn't too good, but it does its job and the alien has a few funny moments in it. The film takes a few twists and turns and has a lot of great action scenes that are just great to watch.  The plot has some twists and surprises, but I never really understood what was going on. Â Â It is hard to explain why the aliens are so hostile to humanity.   What is the connection between a robot and a human?    I think this is a movie that needs to be seen, but not too many people will. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's about a family that comes from the big city to visit relatives in a small town. The father is a doctor who wants to take a vacation to the beach but there's an earthquake and the family can't go back. The mother wants to have a rest and the kids are excited about going to the town and seeing the townspeople and their kids. It seems like it will be a fun day but things take a turn for the worse when a boy falls off a cliff and gets injured. The parents are upset and don't want the boy to get hurt but the child is dying and the parents won't allow it. When the child dies, the parents realize it is their only child. The next morning the family gathers around to see if there is anyone left alive and the boy's mother tells them about the boy who fell off the cliff. The mom and the dad have a discussion and it is clear that they are both very hurt. The kid's mom asks the dad if he loves her and he answers "I love you too." The parents leave and the wife tells the kids that they will have to come home soon and she will be waiting for them. It is a bittersweet ending and a pretty depressing movie. It's about two families coming together and it's pretty sad."   I just can't say enough good things about this movie. I was just about to watch the entire film before I read a review that said it was awful. I guess it depends on how you define awful. It was just okay, but it was not terrible. I liked it enough to give it a two. It would have been better if the kid had survived the fall off the cliffs, but I'm not complaining.   The story was very well done and well told. It didn't feel rushed. It just went on. It made me sad that the mother wouldn't let the kids see the town. It seemed like she was trying to be nice, but she just couldn't. It felt like it was a mistake to let the parents go to the big town in the first place. I'm glad it ended with them going home, because that would have made the ending much better. The ending wasn't very well told, but that was okay because I liked the ending. I would recommend this movie to people who like a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an adaptation of a short story, a short novella written by the Swedish author Sven Sandin, about a man who is in love with a beautiful woman named Margarete and has to hide her away from the rest of the world. It's a sad, dark, yet heart-warming story, and one that can be read and enjoyed with an open heart. I had a good laugh out of it, and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys sad stories and stories with a bit of romance thrown in.   P.S. If you're into sad stories, there's a good chance you'll like this as well. It may take a while to get into it, but the story is very entertaining and a lot of fun.

This film has a really great story line. The music and sound is very well done and you can tell how passionate and sad the guy is about this girl and how he is really in love. I liked this film because it was very sad and emotional and you really feel for the guys and what he is going through.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dukes of Hazzard"  was the first episode of a series which lasted five seasons, the fifth season aired in 1973 and it's a classic of American TV.  The plot is pretty straightforward, the Duke brothers, John, Jr. and James are a racing team and a good one.  In the last episode of the series, the three of them have been competing in the Daytona 500.  The race is in a very difficult place with a lot of obstacles.  It's the first time that the brothers will participate in a race of such importance.  As a result, they will be on the wrong side of the tracks.  But they still manage to win.  This is a good episode which is also well-made.    The Duke brothers,   and   are   three racing brothers.  John, Sr. is the oldest one. He is a retired police officer who has the same job for all his brothers. He lives in a small farmhouse in a remote area of Georgia.  His son, John Jr. is a driver in the local car race, the Daytona 200.  James, the youngest of the three, is the youngest driver of the Dukes. He has won a lot in the races.  He also drives a red Corvette and is a very good driver.  Their older sister, Barbara, is a cheerleader.  Her role is to get the boys to have a good time during the races by singing and dancing.  She is not very good at these activities.  James, Jr.,   is   the oldest of the brothers. It is a fact that he is very good in the cars.  And he is quite clever.  After the race, James decides to take his car to the next race.  Barbara tries to stop him, but he is able to go anyway.  Later that night, the brothers decide to get a beer and watch a movie.  They are at the movies when Barbara asks them to watch a new movie which has a female lead.  "The Daughters of the Dust" is a film about a young couple who take a house in a desert in Arizona.  When they arrive at the house, they find that it is completely uninhabitable.  While they are trying to fix it, the woman who lives there begins to attack them.   She uses a knife to stab their mother.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of the series or even if you don't like the series (and don't bother with it) you have to watch this.   The plot is the typical shounen/action/romance.  It is set in a world that has a war between two groups of humans.  The two groups are called the Light and the Dark.  Their goal is to fight each other to the death and the most common means of doing so is by getting into a fight.  However, the Light (who are the good guys) aren't fighting the Dark (who have evil motives) with swords or guns or even magic.  Instead, they are using science to bring about a peaceful world.  They use a robot that they built to be a messenger between the two sides.  When it's time to battle it's decided to use a person called the Messiah.  He is a man that was given an ability to bring peace and order to the world. However, his power has one flaw.  His body is unable to feel pain and his heart is incapable of feeling fear.  After a certain incident, he is given a second chance to be the Messiah that he was made to be.  Unfortunately, he's given this second chance when he's about to be killed by the evil Dark who want to destroy the Light.  Fortunately, his girlfriend and best friend, the girl called Lillia, decides to give him a second life.  While fighting the evil forces, the Messiah also has to battle the evil that comes to him.  This movie is a classic in my book.  One thing that makes this movie stand out is that it's just the perfect blend of all the classic elements that are needed to make a good shounon.  If there's one problem, it's that it gets repetitive with the action, but there's a reason for that.  I'd love to see this movie in a theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new entry in the great movie series (from 1989) starring David Carradine. I was going to watch the first movie, The Outlaw Josey Wales, but then I thought to myself, why? Because it was terrible. This was not terrible, it was just a good story about a bad guy. There was a lot of violence and sex, which was good, but the story didn't hold a candle to the first film. This is a fun movie, it has a good soundtrack and the fight scenes are well choreographed and the dialogue is always hilarious. It is a comedy, which is great for all the kids that loved the first one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This is a really interesting film and it's a good idea to make a movie about the history of a very unique type of car, which has been around for quite a long time.

It was a really fun ride."   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6hW_Z7pX3s   I'm sure it's great to hear an old car story again and I'm glad it's an old story. I also loved the ending which left me thinking of something and a little sad. The ending was great. I really liked the film. It has an interesting story, and it shows a lot of historical information about this little car. I think it was great and it had a nice ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said, I'm not sure what to think of the plot. It starts out well enough.   First off, it's a thriller.  There are a couple of twists and turns and even a little character development.  But what really bugs me is that the ending doesn't make sense. There is a killer that kills a few people in the beginning and then the movie cuts to the end. There are also two murders that happen in the movie and we never see or hear about them again.  It's like the movie just took the lives of the victims in the first act and ended it.  And the ending is just weird.  I would have liked to see a little bit more of the backstory on the killer, a little more on how the killer was able to get to where he did.  The movie also has a few strange scenes.  One of them involves a woman (a killer) who wants to take a shower, but she ends up in a pool full of blood.  Another scene involves the killer driving a car that looks like a small helicopter.  They really didn't give it a chance to be funny and the acting was all over the place.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie a lot. I was very impressed by the way it was shot, the special effects and the acting. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Sci-Fi movie with good special effects.   (review of free book) I enjoyed this film a lot, but not a lot more than I enjoyed "The Time Traveler's Wife". I think this is a better movie, but a bit slower and a bit less entertaining than "The Wife". This movie is about a man named Ray (played by William Shatner). Ray's been living on a distant planet for years, having done nothing to impress anyone. Then he meets an alien woman (played in the movie by Ellen Sandweiss) who lives a few thousand years ahead of him. They get along quite well for the first half of the movie. But things start to go wrong as Ray starts to experience strange events. His wife disappears. Then a strange old man comes and tells him that he must travel back to earth in order to save his daughter. At first, Ray is happy about this idea. But when he arrives in our planet, he finds that it is a planet much different from the one he left behind. And the people who live there are a bit different too. At this point, I think the movie goes too far, but it is still a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a very good movie, but in a different way than I expected. The movie opens in a world of fantasy and the first thing we see is a castle and the king who is a little old and very wise, who is surrounded by a group of young women, all of whom are dressed in costumes, each of them a different color, and they are dancing, the king and all of them are looking at each other and smiling. So the king says to the young women " I am happy to see you. I am old, and it is time for me to die, and I think I shall be happiest when I die at the feet of my wife. And her name is Mabel." And he says that very happily, and then we see the king's wife, and her name was Mabel. And the queen's name was Mary, and she was the oldest of the group, and in this movie we meet many characters, and some of them we really like, and we think they are good characters. And we think that this is the beginning of a very, very good story, but it is really not, it is a different story than we thought it was going to be.   I thought this was a good first movie and I would recommend it to any one who wants a good fantasy movie, and who wants to see some dancing, and to meet many different people, and all in one, nice movie.

She is a good friend of the mother of the boy. The movie is good fun with plenty of laughs.  The movie is very good, but I would like it to be a little bit longer and with a little more story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Happiness is an act of will"  -Aldous Huxley  is a classic British film noir about a man who lives in a world of perpetual war. His wife, who is suffering from cancer, gives up her job as a nurse and becomes a waitress at a tavern called the Hanged Man. In this tavern she meets the Haunter and the Hairy Man, a pair of sadistic bar patrons who have been murdering people in an alleyway in a nearby village. One day a mysterious man arrives at the tavern and announces that he will kill all of the customers in the tavern if the Houndsman does not stop killing people. The only solution is to find the Hootenanny (a mythical castle in the sky), which is located in a far away place called The North.  Huxley's noir film is filled with allusions to real world horror.   There is an element of truth to the legend, although it is not the real Hauntean castle.  I think it is a bit of a misnomer.  There are actually several castles in the area, one of which is called the Old Manse (The Old Man's House) and there is a story of a "Houndman" who once visited this castle in a dream.  However, there is no Haunting in the film.  The film does a good job of making the viewer think about real world terror and fear.  The Haunters are a good film noire.  Huxleys film is about the horrors of war and war does indeed exist in the world today.  In the film, there are many parallels between the Houndmen and the soldiers that the viewer can imagine in his mind's eye.  If the viewer is willing to look beyond the surface of the film for an insight into the horrors that our world is facing, he will find the film a good piece of noir cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little movie that is worth checking out for some fun times. The plot is pretty simple, you play a girl named Jessica who is a cheerleader and is in love with her team's quarterback, Matt.  It's kind of a silly love triangle that doesn't get much deeper than that.    The only real issue is that the director of the movie had to have a pretty good reason for Jessica to be in a strip club.    There are a few other scenes that are just a bit too obvious for the movie to have an interesting plot and I think that the plot was more than enough to carry the movie.  This is a very silly movie, so I wouldn't recommend watching it for those who don't like silly movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scene is reminiscent of a classic western. We see the townsfolk are eating lunch. There are cowboys, Indians and an old woman with a pipe.   Then a lone cowboy arrives and announces that he has lost his horse and is going to look for a replacement.  The townspeople gather around and ask him if he has found the horse and what it is.  Cowboy replies:  " It is a beautiful horse." They then get to the point.  "How did you know that?"  The old woman says:    " It's a horse that belongs to our dead friend."  Cowboy then replies: " I'm going to bring it to him."   After this Cowboy goes on a search and finds a man who claims to have a horse and will sell him to Cowboy for 200.  After a while Cowboy comes back and tells the man he has made a mistake and it is not the horse he is looking for.    The old lady then comes out to say:  "Well, I don't want it, but you will take it, because I told you the truth."  Then she walks away.  This scene is very well done.  It is very good to see a cowboy and a man walk into a town and say: "I'm looking for a horse"  The cowboys and Indians are well done as well.  They are the same as the ones in the western movies.  I especially liked the way the cowboys look when they are riding their horses.  For this scene they are made of real wood and there are horses in them.  Also the Indians are made out of wood and I liked that they looked different than the others.  In the next scene we see a man carrying a beautiful mare.  As Cowboy gets closer to the mare, she gets up and runs off.  He then follows her, but then he sees a man.  Then we see that the man is the son of a woman who died in a car accident.  So Cowboy decides to give up and follow the mares and their friends.  Now we see the mared in a field.  Soon after, a large group of people come along.  First they want to see the horse.  Next they want the horse for their own use.  Finally they want him so that they can ride him and get some good pictures.  By the way, the only horse in
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! The first half of the movie is a lot of fun! The movie starts with a man being pursued by a bunch of bounty hunters and some other bounty hunters, but they don't seem to care that he's a man, just that he can fly. The bounty hunters just want to kill him and then steal the gold that he has. The movie then moves to the second part, where the bounty hunters are hunting him. They come to his village and steal the villagers' gold, but he escapes and they are after him now. He meets a young boy named Pecan who can fly and he is a big help to him. This part of the story is really good, because it shows us that Pecin can be a very valuable asset to anyone. The third part is where the action starts, when Pecans father is murdered and his mother flees. She takes Pecany with her and flees to the desert, and we follow them there. In the desert the bounty hunting people have set up camp and are waiting for Pecanas father to return from a hunting trip. When he does, they start the hunting. They start by shooting at him and his horse and then the bounty hunter that is following him and killing Pecandans mother. They then try to find Pecann and find Pecaandans father dead. When Pecantans father does return, he is angry and tries to kill them all. He tries to shoot them, but misses and misses again and again. The other bounty hunter is in the next tent and the bounty is still on him. He then shoots the bounty and the other bounty man goes down and dies. The next bounty hunter then starts shooting at Pecanias father, but hits Pecana instead. He runs to his father and Pecania and they start to fight. Pecanic is able to kill all the bounty men and the people that are hunting them. Pecaans father goes back and is happy because he was able to catch them all and kill them. The last bounty man comes and shoots Pecanto, but Pecano jumps out and kills him too. The father is very happy because Pecanta was able capture the bounty. The woman in the tent that Pecaantanas father is in has a baby, but it dies in the process of being born. They go back to the bounty, but then there is a change of plans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, and I don't mean that in a negative way.   It was a fun movie, filled with laughs, good acting, and a good plot that had a great ending.  The film is well acted, and has great dialogue, but it was just that: a movie.  It wasn't a great movie, but I enjoyed watching it.  This movie wasn't really that much of a movie, it was more a short film that ended with a good ending. This film is a bit more than a movie in that it was a short.  There were a few different characters that had more than their share of laughs, but the movie didn't really have much of an ending. I found it funny how there was a girl in a dress, but when she got naked it was all that she had.  A couple of people have mentioned that there were a lot of references to the film "Porky's" (another movie I've never seen).  This is a movie that I will watch again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a guy who lives with his grandmother. One day she dies, and he is left alone. The next day, he gets the mail, which contains a letter from his grandmother, and the mailman tells him to go to his house and open it. It is the letter she wrote to him, when she was still alive. When he does, the letter reads: Dear son. I know it's been a long time since I wrote you. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for coming here to see me. I was so sorry to hear about the accident that took my husband away from me. But it was my fault. I should have been home at least a few weeks ago. I've just been thinking about you and about how much I love you. But you know how I am, and I'm sure you know. I just couldn't help myself. I loved you more than anything in the world. I hope you can forgive me. So here's to the happy reunion you'll never have. And so much more. (I'm sure this movie was shot in California because the scenery is amazing, and there are lots of good looking people in it.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the first one, then you'll like this one too. The first one had a story that wasn't too original and the sequel takes it to the next level. The new characters have more depth to them and the plot is interesting. It's also more action packed, and it's not as easy to follow as the first.   I'm not going to give it a bad review, but I'll say this is a good sequel to the first film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad I found this movie. I don't know why I never saw it before but it's a good one. The story is good and it is just good to see that some of the old-timers like me are still around.   The only thing that is bad is that the people in this movie don't really get along with each other and I just wish that they had been able to work together more and that they would have had a few more scenes together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The first part of this movie, which I think is called "Distant Star" (the second part of the movie is called  "Wish You Were Here"  and it was made by the same director and screenwriter) was pretty decent and I think the story was pretty good and the performances were good. There were a couple of really good one-liners in this movie: "This is my last trip to New York!" "I'll be a millionaire by the time this is over!" I really liked the concept and I really enjoyed the movie. I think this movie has some good action scenes and I'm really glad that they decided to do a sequel. I really hope that they make another one in the future and I'll definitely check it out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the first one. This is a similar story. There's a bunch of baddies in the town and they are all out for money. The baddies also are all in a good mood and are out for more money. In this case, they're all in it for the money.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ _____ _____ The year is 1987. The world of video games has become a very competitive place and it is now down to a handful of companies to create new hits. As such, a small upstart company called Nintendo has been trying to break into the industry with their home console the NES. The game they came up with called Super Mario Bros. was a big hit and was the catalyst for Nintendo's resurgence. The company is now the biggest and most powerful in the industry and has a good track record. So how is this film going to play out? _____________ _________ ___________ This film has a very simple story that is told in a very straightforward way. We follow Mario (played by John Lithgow) who is now back in town after living away from it for years. He has a lot of money, a new girlfriend and is trying to get back into the gaming world. He also has a girlfriend named Luigi (played wonderfully by Kate Winslet) who he meets at a local bowling alley. Mario's first challenge in this new game is to collect all seven stars on a challenging course. This seems simple enough but after the game starts the story takes a very unexpected turn. ______________ _______________ ____________ It is a shame that there is not more to the story. There is some very cool action going on in the film but we get very little explanation as to how Mario and Luigi get around and get to the end of the game. The only other character that gets any real screen time is the dog that lives at Mario's house. The dog gets a bit more screen time than we would like and it seems like the dog was designed to get the audience to sympathize with him because it is a pitiful dog. This dog also gets a lot less screen time then we would also like. There are a couple of cool scenes with the dog and Luigi but the rest of the film is just a boring parade of characters that you know are going to die at the end. _______ _____ ______ __________ A couple of things about the story: The game that Mario is playing is very easy and has the same mechanics that we all know and love. This is one of the best things about this film because it makes the film more accessible and it allows us to focus on the characters and what is happening. The movie is also very interesting and very funny. There have been several films that have been made about video games over the years but
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this at the last night of the Toronto International Film Festival. The film was called The Golden Years. It is about two brothers from the Midwest. In the mid 60's, they both were in the Air Force. Both of them were drafted into the Airborne. They were sent to Korea. The first film is about the brothers getting to Korea and trying to live a normal life. The second film is the brothers living in Korea and the war. There is a great deal of action and violence and there is a good deal of nudity. The brothers fight a lot. It wasn't until later in the war that they began to learn that the war wasn't worth it. This was one of those films that made me laugh a lot, but the film made me think. I thought that the film was good. I was looking forward to seeing more of the brothers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man with the Golden Gun" is an interesting little actioner that features some great special effects.  The film is set in England in 1938.  "The man with the golden gun" is about the English soldier, George Lazenby, who is sent to France in the middle of World War II.  Lazenbye has a bad temper and a bad memory.  The Germans are trying to stop the British from using a new type of weapon called the "Golden Gun."  This gun is able to fire a bullet that is so powerful that it will destroy anything in its path.   In order to protect his country Lazenbee must find the gun and stop the Germans from using it.  This film has great special effect.  It is very hard to find a copy of this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out with a woman on a train traveling to New York and it is a dark and creepy place. But after a couple of minutes of travel, the train stops in a small town where the woman is raped and murdered. Her corpse is then brought back to the train. A few weeks later, a strange man with a strange power (and a dark past) shows up and is the killer. But not the only one. The movie ends with a man and a woman having a conversation and it seems like a dream.       The movie is a little slow paced, but it has a good story line. It is not too long, but there is enough there to keep the viewer interested.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to see a nice movie about a nice guy who wants to be a hero, you'll enjoy it. If you're a fan of the show and are tired of it being about a kid with no real issues and who just wants to get back to his mom, you might want to skip this one. But if you're looking for a good character and good acting, it's worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Witch Hunt" is an excellent movie that doesn't rely on any particular plot line, but is a story with a definite moral and a definite message. It is an old story about a man who hunts witches in the forest, and how he finds out he is being pursued by a witch who has killed the man's father. This is a very different type of movie, in that it does not try to be a horror movie or a science fiction movie. It's a story of a man that doesn�t want to be hunted by a supernatural force, and his decision to flee to the forest is the best choice he has. I've seen it several times and it is still one of my favorite movies. The acting in the film is also great, but it would be hard to beat the acting of Richard Arlen as the hunter. It also wouldn�t be a bad idea to cast Christopher Lee in a role. The story is about the hunter and the hunter�s daughter, but they aren�t the only characters. There are some very interesting characters in the movie, including a witch named Lady Mary, who can turn people into wolves. This movie also has a great score, which makes it all the more entertaining.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people will tell you that the most important character in the movie is "Hercules" the centaur. But I will say that there is not a single character in this movie who is bad. The movie is full of good fights, a nice story, a good ending and a good performance by a good actor. I think this movie is better than the original Hercules.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other two movies in this trilogy are not as good as the first one, but I'll give it to them anyway.  I've watched all three, and it's always fun to watch them all in one go.  "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" is an interesting film that I haven't seen before.  It tells the story of an American girl, Alice (played by Susan Sarandon), who was born in Russia.  She has lived in America since she was 3, and has been living with her mother and her sister.  The movie is set in the mid-80's, and focuses on Alice's friendship with her best friend, Wendy (played very well by Joan Allen), who lives across the street.  Wendy is very intelligent and has a great sense of humor.  Alice and Wendy are both very shy, and have never spoken to another girl, or a boy, until Alice meets Wendy.  This is a very nice movie.    I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes very smart, funny women.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. The movie has a great plot, good acting, great scenery and the ending is great too.   The movie doesn't really start off too well though, it seems that all the characters are either very stupid, or are very stupid in an extreme way.  I found it very annoying how every character kept telling each other to get the hell out of their own house when there was no one in it, or that they were not going to leave when there were no cars in the street.  This movie also takes itself way too seriously.  There was also a whole bunch of "fakes" in the movie.  The fake cars were not all that great.  All in all, I really liked the movie, but I can't wait for another one.

This is the classic film from a classic filmmaker.  I like this film a lot because of the fact that it is a bit of a slow burn.  There is a lot of buildup to this movie, but there is no payoff for it.  It's a nice film, but nothing great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The best of the year so far." - John Kricfalusi "This is a film about an all-American family who move to the big city. The father, a police detective, is married and has a child, but the family is poor and living on welfare. The family is torn by conflict between the father, who wants the city to be safe for his family, and his son, who is growing up in a gang-ridden neighborhood and who is learning about violence. The film is set in the summer of 1970, and tells the story of three young men in the city who will come to be known as the "Gangster Trio." The film was written and directed by William Friedkin. The screenplay is based on a novel by Richard Russo and William Goldman. It was Friedkin's first film, and was released in 1973. The director was influenced by his own experiences growing up, as well as those of his friends, in Chicago, and by the social unrest in the US in the 1960's. It also features one of the first appearances of the classic music group the Eagles. The production was very good, and the acting was excellent. The soundtrack is by Michael Cimino. This film is definitely worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to believe that this is the first time a movie based on a book has been adapted to the screen. And I can't say that it was a bad movie. The story is very well told and, if you are not already a big Harry Potter fan, you are likely to like this one.   The story follows Harry, an orphan boy who wanders the streets of London one sunny day and gets involved with a gang of street urchins called the "Mudbloods". These Mudbloods are the offspring of muggle parents, have no magic powers, and no knowledge of magic whatsoever. Their father, a man who has no magical powers, is murdered in front of their eyes by the muggle police. It is at this moment that Harry finds his calling. He sets out to find the murderer and stop him from doing anything else to his family and to the innocent Muggles.  ....   I enjoyed this movie immensely. I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. It has a very dark and gritty atmosphere and it really adds to the overall mood. I am not going to lie and say that I thought this was going to be a good adaptation of the book. I have read the book a number of times and it just didn't do it for me. I thought the film version would be a much better one. This film is different enough from the book that it could have been a hit. And it was. It was a very good film and it kept me entertained throughout. It's dark, gritty and gritty. I like it.

It has a little of everything: a good story, a nice girl with a great voice, a good soundtrack and a great ending.

It does have a nice ending, though, so I guess it was worth a watch."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good story about a guy who is a member of a very special organization. It is a story about people with the same abilities that exist in the real world. It seems like it is a movie about people who are "faking" their abilities. But it isn't. The people are real and I found it interesting to watch this movie. The story is about the guy who tries to become a member, but the organization is too big to handle. I thought it was funny that the guy is a real member and the leader of the group. I also found it funny that a man can be a member and a woman can't. I found this movie funny. It isn't bad, but it is not really a good flick.

If you like to watch a movie about a little boy and his friends who all hate each other, then this is a movie you should check out.

It takes place at a school for the super intelligent, but it gets more interesting as the movie goes on.    There are plenty of jokes and plenty of action and fun to be had.  This is a great film to watch with the family.  If you like "The Goonies" this movie will be a lot of fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an interesting, action-packed and funny movie.  The lead is a former fighter pilot who was injured in a plane crash, and now he is living with his daughter in a tiny cottage.       He also has a daughter who is an excellent fighter.  This film is fun and funny and I think it will appeal to both kids and adults. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "In a time when every movie has to be like the latest installment of a video game series, this is a good one. There are so many different parts that I could never get a handle on them all. But what I like about it is that there is a balance. A lot of the humor is about a man who has his wife killed and a daughter who believes in him. The other women in the neighborhood are the real heroes, and the action is well done. It is a movie that you can watch with a good friend. I would like to see a sequel with a real hero, because the story is so great and the cast is so good, I can't wait to see what happens next."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of the Best is a classic, a perfect piece of American cinema. It is an instant classic. It's a film that everyone should see.  It is a very well-done movie and it has everything a movie can have: action, suspense, romance, suspense-thrillers, comedy, horror, a great score by John Williams, and, of course, the amazing Johnny Cash singing the film's title song.    The Best Of The Best   is one of those rare films that has everything going for it.  The film is an excellent action movie.  It is a story about an aging, retired hero who finds himself in an unfamiliar city and is challenged by a young woman who wants to see the world.  I also love the way the movie keeps the audience guessing about the hero's identity.  There is a lot of talk about his past and about the city he is in and there is even a few shots of a train that runs through the city.  Johnny Cash singing The Best Of the Best      The Best of The Best is also a great romance.  Johnny Cash does an excellent job at giving us a love story that is more than a romance. It has the elements of romance that make a good story and it also has a lot more to offer than romance.   The Best of the Best  has the best musical score of the year.  This is the best American movie I have seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this film, a man is arrested for stealing a small amount of cash from a pawnshop. While in the back of a police cruiser, he discovers that a large amount of money is missing. He takes the cash to the police station, where they tell him that the police are not allowed to investigate any theft under that amount. They give him the money back, and then they arrest him for the theft. The story is not very interesting, and it is a rather simplistic and silly plot. The only character who is interesting is the pawnshop owner, who is a very bad guy. I found it hard to care about the police, who were not very good.  The only way I could see it being a success is if the actors did well, and if the director, David Cronenberg, could bring out the creepiness.  I like Cronenberg. I like his movies.

This movie is fun and a good time to be had. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's an old saying: "If you think it's a good idea, then it's too late."  It's an observation I always find amusing, but it's also one that can be applied to some of the movies I've watched recently.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie this good.   The plot is simple: a guy, and a girl, and an alien, and the world they live in.  The world, to me, feels very old, and is filled with so many things that I don't understand.  I mean, why is there a space station, a moon, a planet, and three different civilizations?  Is it because they're all trying to colonize each other?  Why is the Earth not just another planet?  How is a person able to see a ghost, but not a dead person?  These are questions I don'se for the movie, but the answers aren't all that interesting, which is why I find this movie so engaging.  If you're into space, sci-fi, and aliens, then I would suggest checking this one out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie with a friend who is a film fan. This movie has some of the most beautiful, beautiful, and exciting movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed it so much I had to get a second opinion. This film is just that. It is an exciting, entertaining, and beautiful movie. The only thing that is disappointing about this film is that the director, Christopher Lee, who was in all other of his movies, was not in this one. I think he had something else planned for this movie. I would have loved to see more of Christopher Lee and his famous, famous, and famous voice. If I had any complaints about this movie, they are that it's not as good as the other films he has done. I guess that is why it didn't get an Oscar nomination. I have not seen any of the other Christopher Lee movies. I really wish I had. I thought this was one of the best films he ever made. I will definitely see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a family and its life in the city. The family members, like any good family, have their own quirks and weaknesses. One of the weaknesses is a young girl who is a tomboy and very tomboyish. She is very rebellious and she doesn't like her father. I mean she is in the house when she's not supposed to be there. This girl is not afraid to be a real woman. She loves playing with other girls and I think she likes men a lot. I have never heard of this kind of movie before and this girl is the first one that I have seen that I found attractive. I loved her character and she was a joy to watch.  If you like movies that are funny, but with a happy ending, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An absolute classic of the genre. It is a true story about the adventures of two young men in the wilds of America, one of whom is a native, the other from New England. Both are out to find the gold rush of the 1870's. The film opens with a train speeding by the title location in the mountains of Montana. The title is meant to evoke the feeling of the wilderness. The two men are driving across the plains in a wagon when they stumble upon a trail which they take, leading them to a small town in the desert. In the next scene they are on a train bound for California, where they must try to get back home. The main characters are the two brothers, who are a couple. They are of the same age, but have a difference in their interests. The younger one is an outdoorsman, while the older one is a student of philosophy. One of the most memorable scenes in the film is the one where they are traveling through the desert when they come across a group of Indians. The Indians are being attacked by some of the horses, and a shot is fired at one of the Indians. After the Indians are killed, the older brother runs back and forth between the two men, and he and the younger brother kill a few more of the enemies. The older brother's name is Hank, and his brother's is Hank. In a later scene, they are shown talking with a man, who is a medicine man. The man tells them about a large cave in the north of the state, where there is a very beautiful woman who is the treasure of the tribe. After having talked with the man, they decide to search for the cave. They make a number of detours, and when they arrive at the cave, they have to wait a while until the men of the other tribes come and take care of the wounded men. This scene is so interesting because the film seems to be trying to show a little more about the tribe than is really necessary, but the plot is really rather predictable. The story seems to follow a rather predictable pattern. The brothers travel from one location to the next, and then the plot starts to take shape. When they finally get to the cave they find that the cave is filled with riches, but only the women are inside. When the men come back to take the women, the brothers are furious, because they are supposed to be the ones who should be taking care of them. When one of them
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this film was a great combination of old and new.  It's set in the late 1800s in the early 1900s in a small town in Indiana called Paintsville.   The town was a mining town until the 1920s.  After the mine closed, the town lost its business.  The locals were all poor and the old people were dying off.  This film is about the small town life and the people that lived in Paintsville.  I loved the fact that it was set in a tiny town that had a lot of history and that it took place in a rural area.  For those of you who don't know, Paintsvillle was a small mining town.  When the mine shut down, the miners were not allowed to stay.  They had to move on to other towns.  As it turned out, Painsville was the last of the mines.  Painsville was built as a town in a way that the old houses were all interconnected.  Each house had a small room where the people would go to sleep.  You could still see the lights and sounds of the old days.  I really like how the film did a good job of portraying the small community.  If you like a good period film, then I would recommend this movie.  "I am a man of the people"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I've seen by a director who I was sure would be great, but I couldn't be sure.  The film follows a man, who is very angry at a woman who has been making a fuss about him not paying enough attention to her.  She goes to the police and complains that she is raped in the cinema, where a guy she is with watches and makes the man she is having sex with rape her. The police do nothing about it, but they do notice the guy watching the movie raping her, and they arrest him.    The man she was with was also arrested, and so are several others, but the rapist is released. The rapist is a member of the local gang called the Deadheads, and a few years ago they were given a new leader by a rival gang called The Fears. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows two characters in the midwest who are the parents of two boys: Jack (John Travolta), the hardworking, loving father, and his loving, devoted wife Diane (Sylvia Plath), the beautiful and nurturing mother. After Diane's sudden death in a tragic auto accident, Jack takes over the family business and the family lives in relative comfort. But things change when Jack's brother, Ben (Robert Duvall), moves to Los Angeles. Jack, who's not quite ready to settle down, and Ben who's had enough of Jack's selfishness and lack of empathy, are now on opposite sides of a seemingly intractable battle.   There is a lot of tension and drama in the film. I especially loved the scenes in Jack's house with Diane in a red dress and Ben in his suit. It's a nice change of pace and keeps the film moving forward.  There's a lot to like about this film and I think it would be a good fit for the film lovers in your life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The final fight between the heroes and the evil Doctor Doom takes place in the final showdown scene.  We get to see how the hero's fight with Doom has changed him over the years.    I don't know if this movie is a good idea or not.  The idea is that the heroes are going to travel to the past to save the future from Doom.  Doom wants to wipe out the entire future in order to build a utopia.  Doom also wants to use a special weapon to destroy the heroes in the future.  However, in order for Doom to have the weapon he has to destroy a small portion of his future and his friends in the past.  That is why we see that the villain is trying to make Doom fight in the wrong future. I just thought this was an idea that was never going to work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to like this movie, but it's actually kind of nice.  The movie's a bit silly, but I like the humor in this.  I'm not a big fan of science fiction or action movies, so I wasn't expecting much, but this is pretty good.  It's got a very nice cast, and they make the movie very enjoyable.  This movie has a bit of a long runtime, but not as long as most other Sci-Fi movies.  Overall I thought this was a good sci-fi movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a bit strange in that the characters all have very different attitudes towards the people they meet and the place they live. At one point, the girl (played by Susan Lacy) decides that she wants to become a lawyer because she's a woman who "knows how to fight". This attitude changes once she realizes that she's actually not a lawyer but a prostitute who gets a regular gig working in a brothel. She has a boyfriend (played with excellent acting by Jack Klugman) who is very nice and is just trying to keep her from going down a dark road. Then there's the man who lives next door to the couple (played in a rather creepy manner by Charles Grodin) and his wife. He's a bit of a creep but is actually a pretty good guy who is trying to help the couple. He gets involved in a situation when his wife is kidnapped by a gang of guys who are trying to kill the couple because of the money they have. It's a good example of a typical gangster movie and the whole thing is pretty much ridiculous. It does have some nice scenes (the guy who has the money is the most interesting character) but the rest of the movie is just silly.   So, in summary, this movie is not a bad movie but it's definitely not something you'll enjoy. It has a nice story but the actors are just terrible and the plot is a disaster. If you like gangster movies then you'll probably enjoy this. If not, then you probably won't either. But then again, that's a pretty common complaint about gangster films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie's name refers to the first person point of view, which is quite unique in the horror genre.  This is a very original approach to a very popular genre, and it does what it sets out to do very well.  A group of teenagers (not teens, they're kids) are camping and looking for food when a bear comes out of the woods and starts attacking.    I haven't seen a bear attack so many people so quickly.  It's hard to say how scary the bear is.  One of the kids tries to grab a bear, and as she does so, she turns into a zombie.  They try to run for their lives but the bear keeps chasing them.  But it's not all about the bears.  There are other scary things about this movie.  The soundtrack is great.  This is a movie that is just as scary for its humour as it is for the bears and zombies.  I have seen the movie several times and each time it's better than the last. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie that doesn't need much more of me talking about.     I know, I know!   This is a film that needs to be seen by everyone.  The film is a classic tale of a man who goes to find his missing son and the two men who are chasing him.  I loved this film.  There is a lot to enjoy in this film, but the fact that this film is so different makes it more enjoyable.  It's a film about a man, a family and a child.  But it is not a film for kids or anyone who doesn't care for a good story.  This film is more about the man who went on a journey to find and save his son and he will do anything to do that.  You will also find a couple of moments of humor and it's well worth it.

I had seen it on DVD a few years before and didn't know much about it at all. I've heard it's a good one and that's about all I can tell you. I didn't realize it at the time but it was a brilliant film. It has a real story arc. The characters are really likeable. I was really amazed by the performances and how they handled the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always had a fascination with all things scary. I can watch scary movies for hours and never get sick of them. This is the best one I've seen.   I saw the movie in the cinema a few years ago and it's one of the few scary movies I've ever seen. It's very good, very scary and is probably the only scary movie I've watched in years. The ending is a little bit ambiguous, but the ending is still scary.  The movie was released in the USA in 1985 and has never been released in any other countries. It has been translated into several languages, but I haven't been able to find a good English translation. It probably has a cult following around the world.

Overall, this is a good, well-made movie and a very interesting story.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The plot of the movie is fairly simple:  a group of kids are kidnapped, tortured, and killed.  They have the bodies of their victims stashed around the house. Â This is the kind of thing that happens in the movies all the time, but the kid characters are so well developed and well acted that it makes the movie a real treat.    This movie was filmed in Japan and is an example of how people there can put together a plot that is good and even better when the movie was made in Japan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil's Backbone" is a great movie, but it has to be watched with an open mind.  I found it fascinating, but a bit difficult to follow.    The film follows a young man who is a descendant of a famous blacksmith.  This is a tale of a man who had a terrible childhood, a wife who died in childbirth and a son who was raised as a slave by his master.  He was given a choice: live a life of crime, or live with the family he loved.  To survive, he had to escape the bad life, but at a terrible price.  I was intrigued by the characters, and the story, but I have a hard time following it.  In the end, the story was about a man trying to escape from a terrible past, and it was a good one.  If you are interested in the history of the blacksmiths in the area, or a good story, "The Devil�s Backbone'' is a good place to start.  The cast:     The movie is about a blacksmith, a former slave, and a former convict who has an uneasy relationship with each other.  The cast is filled with interesting characters.  William Daniels played the part of a violent convict.  John Glover is a man with a violent past.  Robert Duvall plays a master of the trade.  Tom Cruise is a tough guy, who does things his way.  Edward G. Robinson plays the part that we see from a distance.  It is a hard movie to follow because it is a story about a convict and a black man who are trying to change their past.   It is about the good and the bad in each character.  But it is not a bad film, and I will give it credit for that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a 1960 Western based on the story of John Henry Faulkner.  It's a very good film but the best part about it is the characters.    There's no way that I would have thought to make a movie about a guy who was an outlaw and a gambler, and who was also a murderer.    However, that's what makes the story so good.  The movie is about a man who has been on the run from the law for years.  He has killed his last victim, a beautiful woman who had been his mistress, and has set up camp in a cabin to try and survive.  When the local sheriff finds him, he doesn't recognize him at first.  After a brief talk about the "good" man, the sheriff lets him go.  I would say that this is the best Western I've seen, but I don't want to ruin it for you.  There's also a great song that the band sings in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title is a bit of a stretch. It's not an action movie, or a thriller. It isn't even an action-thriller. It has some action, and a bit more action than it should have, but the plot is the most interesting part of the movie. It is about a detective who is given a case to solve in a small town, where the murderer is a local preacher. It involves a murder, a pastor's wife, a police department and a murder.   It is not an easy movie to watch. It was made by a team of four directors: George Miller, Christopher Doyle, Joe Dante and Alan Silvestri. The movie's plot is extremely convoluted. It includes a number of twists and turns. The story of the murder is very simple, and it doesn't have much depth to it. It feels as if it is an action film more than a story of a murder mystery.  The acting in the movie is not bad. There is a number in the film who look like they have been cast for the part. The acting is good, but there are a number who are more suited to the role than others. The soundtrack is pretty good. The film is very dark, and the actors are the only ones who seem to be having a good time. I found this film to be very interesting. It had me laughing, but it was also kind of frightening. It doesn't make a good first impression, but then you learn to appreciate it over the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think this movie is a great one. The writing is horrible and I think it was done to cash in on the fame of its star (who was already very famous). The acting is bad too, the acting in this film is atrocious. But I didn't even like the movie because the plot was horrible, and the acting is atro  I've never seen a movie as bad as this. The plot was terrible, the writing is terrible, and I don;t think the acting was good either. This movie is absolutely horrible.   This is one of those movies where you feel as if you are watching a bad reality TV show where some people are being forced to do some horrible things.  I had no interest in watching this movie.  I would have rather watched a real documentary about the subject of the movie, instead of watching a terrible movie. This is an extremely bad movie. I recommend that you avoid this movie if you have no interest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a kid who lives in a giant mansion with his brother and his father. The kid gets to the top of the house and sees a bunch of people hanging upside down. They have no way to hang themselves, so they get to the end of the rope and then the ropes give out and they fall to the ground. Then the kid sees a little girl and the kid is scared of her. He decides to go up to her and tell her what's wrong with her, and she says, "Don't you ever leave me, and don't you look back!" The kid is very disappointed in her, but then she tells him about the other kids that died, and how they were all sad that the kid couldn't do something about it. The little girl tells the kid that if he just leaves her alone, she'll be happy and the two of them get into the house. There are many scenes in this movie where I was looking at the kids and wondering why they were there, and why they had to be there, but the movie is so well-acted and funny that I can't help but look at the little girl. I had a really bad time at first trying to figure out what the hell she was talking about. I couldn't figure out where the other people were coming from or why she wasn't there, which made the movie a lot more confusing and hard to follow. But after a few more minutes I realized that she was right, and the other children were sad that they couldn't help the kid. They were all just little children and they didn't really know what they were doing, so I guess that's why they are sad. The ending was really funny and I was laughing the whole time, but that wasn't enough to make up for the confusing ending. I found myself looking at her for the entire movie and I couldn the first time I watched it. So I guess the movie wasn't for me, but I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie once before, a little bit before I knew what it was about. I was about 13 and I had been told that it was a story about a girl who lived on a farm in England. Well it wasn't until a couple years later when I saw a little boy on a bicycle ride by the house with a bag of vegetables and a horse that I realized it was more of a story of the life of a boy and a girl on a little farm in the countryside.  The film is told in three acts. The first act is set in the early 20's, the second act is the late teens and early twenties and the third act is a story from the early 30's.  This movie is based on a book, The Wartime Years, written by a woman called Mary Bridget Jones. She is a writer who has lived a very difficult life. She has been married to a man who was very sick and died when she was only in her twenties. She was then married to her brother, who also died when he was only a teenager. This is a sad story. It is told by a girl called Jane Bridget who has been brought up in a world where everyone is dead.  The story is told with a combination of prose and verse, the narrative is fairly clear but the language used is a bit clunky. The actors are good, some are even very good, the lead character is played by the lovely Sally Field and it is her character that the film is based around. There is a young boy called Tommy, he is played well by Michael Caine.  It is a good film, it is sad but it is also beautiful.      Grade: A
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the first two films in the series, The Ring is a dark fantasy with some good performances.   The Ring   is a tale of the destruction of the Earth by the evil wizard Raghava (played by the great Peter Cushing) and the good guy Lord of the Rings (played again by Peter Cushman) in order to get his ring back.  Raghva's ring is the source of all evil. He takes all the souls of the dead and places them in his ring. Once the ring is taken out of the earth's orbit, all evil is freed from it.  When Raghavan and his army of demons are defeated by the good guys (including Gollum), the evil is released and all the bad guys are killed. Raghavanda is imprisoned on a dark island and is soon to be killed by a mysterious warrior (played with a lot of menace by William Kircher). Lord of Rings is released into the world. Lord of Lords     is the first installment of the trilogy. The first Lord of Lord of is a lot like Lord of Shadows.  It is a fantasy with a dark atmosphere. It deals with the story of a hero who travels to the land of Mordor and tries to bring back the Ring of Power. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a shame that the final act of this film didn't live up to the first act. The film was pretty much done, there was no reason for this to be over. It was a very good action film, but the story was weak. It's not an epic tale that you won't see in the cinema very often, but it's not a bad movie either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit that I am a sucker for the old school action movies like the ones from the 70's.  It was the 80's that I first saw a classic like this, in the movie "The Karate Kid" (which I was fortunate enough to see in the theater as a child).  So it is nice to see a modern action movie, in which there is a great deal of comedy and it has a pretty good fight sequence.  What I enjoyed:    The story is very simple.   It is the story of a high school kid (played by the excellent Bruce Willis), who has been kicked out of school, and has come to a city to live with his uncle.  He works as a bodyguard for the mafia boss, (played brilliantly by Sammo Hung) who also happens to be his uncle's brother.  The boss gives him a job, which is to find and kill a very dangerous killer.  At the start of the movie, this killer is not very well known to the public, but he has a reputation as a very nasty guy.  There are also a lot of other people who are also after him.  So Willis and the rest of the gang set out to find the killer. But as they get to work, they learn that the killer has a secret of his own.  They find that he is a very good martial artist.  And it is not long before Willis finds himself fighting an old school martial artist who is much, much stronger.  But the real action begins as the gang realizes that the old man is very good at what he does, and they have to stop him before he gets any further.  Unfortunately the old guy is so powerful that even Willis and his gang are not able to defeat him. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Willis does the karate fight and gets a bit of a kickback in the groin.  This is a pretty cool scene.    Also, I thought that the bodyguards in the film were pretty good.  I always like to see good martial artists.  One of the best is the young, and rather clumsy, James McAvoy.  Of course, they could have made this guy a big, bad, villain instead of having him be a minor, incompetent thug.  Anyway, I like the way they handle the martial arts in the story.  In a way, it seems like a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a pretty good one. The movie is set in a world where there is a race called the "Spirits". The story starts with a race between the Spirits and the race known as the "Rouges". The Spirits win the race. They get a new world and a new race. But the only race that can challenge the Spirits is the "Eternals". They get the same world as the Spirits, but have a new set of rules. So they fight. They also have the same race as the Spirit Spirits. So it is like they are the same species. This movie had some great fights. I was very impressed. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good story with good fight scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a man who is given the gift of time by a scientist to travel to different eras of human history. When he arrives in 1894, the time of the American Civil War, the people are living under a rule that allows the wealthy to kill each other and the poor to be killed by the rich. It's a bleak, depressing world. The film shows the struggle of a man to maintain his sanity, and of a woman to make her way through a world she never expected to be living in. It also shows the great human ingenuity of the people, especially a man named Henry who can travel through time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is a great film, but I would give it higher than that if I had seen it with a group of friends and had a little wine or beer, and a movie projector. It is a marvelous movie, especially for a first viewing. It starts very good with a terrific prologue and then the action begins. This is one of those rare times in movies where there is not a "spoiler alert" and you don't even know that you are about to watch a movie, and that is exactly what happens in this film.   The story begins when Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Gimli, and Legolas of the Fellowship of The Ring, are being hunted by a fearsome band of Orcs who want to destroy the Ring. Sam and Frodo have to fight their way out of the Lonely Mountain and then take their way to the city of Minas Tirith. There, they find a mysterious cloaked figure in the city, and Frodos is taken to the council chambers of the city to meet the "Wizard". This is a terrific film, not for the most part, but for its opening sequence. It has a very nice feel to it and is very effective in showing the great dangers and danger of the situation.  , but it is very good, and in a way, I liked it better than "The Lord Of The Rings". I have seen it a number of times over the years and it has always been the best of the series. The acting is very strong in this picture, and it is really quite an exciting movie. It opens up with the introduction of the Wizard and the wizard's companion, Gandalf the Grey. It also has a great opening scene with the Ringwraiths and their leader, Saruman the White. Then there is a lot of action in the mountains. It was an excellent introduction to the series, and one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen. The ending was a bit abrupt and not quite as satisfying as I had hoped. This was not a film I expected to be so good, but as I said, it is a wonderful movie.   in a nutshell: The Lord of The Rings: A New Beginning is a fantastic movie that shows you the excitement and danger that the world of Middle Earth faces when a mighty evil is revealed and the world is set on a collision course with a powerful and evil force.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of the movie "Tombstone", and I can't really think of anything bad about it. There are two things I don't like, however: the first is that it is an uncharacteristic scene of violence. You have the three guys from the gang going to a town called Tombstone to take a girl to a party, and then the next thing you know, it's two of them in the dirt, with no gun or any kind of weapon. I can understand why it was done in the film, as it was supposed to represent a more realistic version of the time in the late 1800's. However, it still doesn't feel right to me. The second thing I don the scene: a girl is tied up to a tree and repeatedly shot with a pellet gun. Now, this scene has nothing to do with the movie's plot and is only there to create a more intense and realistic image of the past. It was done to make the film more realistic, but I feel it makes the movie a little too unreal.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first saw this film, I was not really impressed. The movie was very well shot and the story was interesting but nothing spectacular. I found this film a bit too formulaic. It seemed like the characters were just trying to get from one place to another. The only character who I thought was interesting was the main villain, the evil dictator. I just think he was a bit over the top and he didn't have much to do. I didn't think the rest of the cast were very interesting and I'm glad I didn,t have to see this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a film about a boy named Harry and a girl named Harriet who are cousins. Harry has always been an extremely shy and insecure child. When his mother dies he moves to an orphanage where he is soon adopted by Harriet. They begin a relationship and Harry is soon taken under the wing of his aunt, who is also a witch. Harry soon learns the ways of the witches. The film starts off with a wonderful scene in the orphanage, where Harry, Harriet, and the other children have been enjoying a picnic. The orphans are having a fun time. Then they see a witch, a tall, slender woman with long white hair. She is wearing a white long-sleeved dress and white gloves. When she walks toward them, Harriet and the children run away in fear. The witch then laughs and says that this is her favorite way to entertain children. This is when the witch reveals herself to be Harriet's grandmother, who was also the witch's great-great-great grandmother. They all laugh and say that this witch is the one that is really scary. Harriet then turns to Harry and says, "He is not scary, is he?" The witch says yes and that he is the only one who will ever scare her. She turns to Harriet and says "Don't be scared! I'll make him disappear!" Harriet is terrified and screams. The rest of the children are very scared as well. When the witch is done with Harriet, she is sent away to be a servant to a wealthy man, who happens to be her great-grandfather. The woman's name is Mrs. Potter, and she has been around for a long time. It is also revealed that the woman has two little daughters, one is a girl, and one is about to be. In order to protect the girl, Mrs.Potter uses a curse to make the girl grow to a young woman. Mrs. Potters son, Harry, who has a younger sister, is very fond of the girl and has wanted to become a witch since he was a child. He becomes very good friends with Harriet and Harry's sister, and also has a crush on Mrs.Sutton, who also happens to have two daughters.   When Harry is about eleven, he decides to look into a house that has been haunted by a horrible spirit. This house has been closed for years and no one has ever been able to get inside. Harry and Harriet begin looking around and come across

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's no way to review a movie about a girl who has an affair with a male stripper without mentioning how incredibly realistic the movie is. I'd never seen such a realistic depiction of a relationship between two people, one of whom is married and the other a stripper. The movie is like a story in which you can follow the characters' actions from the moment the stripper meets the married woman, who doesn't mind at all, and who is completely willing to go out with the strippers and sleep with them. The strippers are all real, with the exception of a man in a long, thick coat. He doesn't seem to have any personality at all. The couple don't even talk to each other; they just get into each others' space. I can't even imagine a relationship like this; you can imagine a strippers' relationship between a married woman and a married man, but the strips' relationship seems to be based on mutual desire to have sex with each other, with no interest in each other at all! I really don't know what to say about this movie. It's just so realistic!   Posted by John at 11:06 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an amazing movie, that takes place in an alternate future, where we have a new president named Ronald Reagan. The movie is about the new president's life and his political career. The story is told through the eyes of the president, as he travels across the country to campaign and win the presidency, and then to run for the presidency himself. The new president is very smart and very brave, and very intelligent. He learns from the mistakes of his predecessors and takes action to correct them. The film has a great balance of humor and tragedy, as well as political commentary. It is the story of a great man and a great president.   I was in high school at the time, and I watched this movie with a group of other friends. This was my first movie. I watched it over and over again. It was amazing. This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I think it would be great for a birthday party.  , the director and writer of this movie are the same guy, and he did a great job on this movie.

I don't know why it had to be about a guy who was supposed to be a great magician but he doesn't have any magic tricks. It was all pretty boring. The second one was the best one. It's very interesting to see a guy in his 30s that is so good at tricks. He can fool people so easily. I just wish that it was more like the first one. I loved this movie. It took me back to when I was a kid.

It is a very well done movie that is full of adventure, and laughs. The movie also has great animation and a great soundtrack.

In the end, the boy finds his way home.   I give this movie a 10/10.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a moment in the middle of the movie where I was watching the movie with the sound off.  I could see the screen, but it was dark.    The movie's plot is pretty simple.  The main character is a little girl who goes to the big city to attend a special high school, and it's there that she discovers that she's really a little boy.  It's pretty easy to follow the story, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but there's something very sweet about it.  My favorite thing about this movie was the fact that the character names were all in Japanese.  My favorite part about the movie is that it was a film about the child's coming to terms with being different.

I watched it on a train ride to Chicago. I liked it. It was not a great movie but it was interesting. I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good story about a shepherd who helps his fellow sheep and a young man who gets into a lot of trouble. It would be a good time to watch this movie, especially since you will see a lot more of the same old things as the shepherd tries to help his sheep and the young man is trying to get out of trouble by working at the railroad.

It was a bit slow at times, but there is no real hurry in the film. The whole story is really interesting and is really worth a watch.   I have seen many "man who fell to earth" movies, and "The man who fell" is the best of the bunch. The movie was produced by George Pal (The Godfather) and was directed by Steven Spielberg. This movie really has a sense of mystery to it. There is so much about the characters that you just want to know what will happen to them. There are also several amazing space shots in this film. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I was not familiar with the book "The Da Vinci Code" or the movie of the same name. I was familiar with its author, Dan Brown, as a novelist who wrote a few novels which I have enjoyed. I wasn't really familiar with Mr. Brown when I read this book, although I did not read the film version, but I have since read a number of reviews about it. I thought it was a well written novel, with an interesting plot and a lot of mystery to it. This book has a somewhat confusing plot, but it is not difficult to follow. There is a great deal of mystery in this book. The story revolves around a book of secrets, the Codex, which the narrator, the main character, has had a copy of for over a century. In fact, there are no words in the book and the book does not have a title. When the narrator was a boy, he wrote a book about a book, which he named the Codex. The Codex contains a number, which have no meaning, and the narrator has a number that he keeps secret. One day, the narrator's friend, who is a scholar, comes to him with a request to give a number to a person. The number is one hundred and sixty-nine, and he is unable to find the person who has the number. When he learns that the number has something to do with the Da Vin-ci Code, the man who was given the number goes to the narrator and gives him the number and the Codex for safekeeping. The man who has received the number is a man who is not able to control his temper and has to be confined to his home. In his house, the number tells the man's past. The book also has a great many mysteries, which I found interesting, such as the Codex being a map, the Da Vincis being an organization of a secret society, the story of a man named "The Blue", who has been known to use a code name to hide his identity, the secret language that the Da Vicis use, and a mysterious organization that the narrator learns about. There are many mysteries in this story. However, I thought that the story was not really that complex. It was a good story and I would give it a four or five. However it is a bit confusing.

I was glad that the kids are getting a lot more time to get used to the place they're going to. I'm glad they didn't just stick with the first movie, they have some really interesting stuff in store. The story line is pretty interesting too. It's not going to be a "let's get the kid to safety" kind of movie, but I didn't mind. The only problem I had with it was the amount of time it took for the kids to get to the school and start playing. I guess it's a good thing that there isn't much of a plot here because otherwise it would be boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way, the first act of the film is a little weak: you don't even know who you're looking at, let alone how they look at you. It's just a simple story about a man who loses his wife in the wilderness and finds her, and then is able to save her by using a gun he has just picked up. It does not take long to find out why it's a bad idea to save someone who is trying to kill you, and this is where things get interesting: the two men who find you are not your husband, but a man named George, and his wife, who he was supposed to kill, but instead saved from an evil witch. When George is shot, he wakes up and gets to know who he is. It isn't until the third time they meet, that George finds out the witch is an old woman who has been living in the forest for a long time, and has been looking for someone who can help her get back home. There are several ways to tell a story about people trying to find themselves: you could use the word "lost", but that's boring and doesn't capture the feeling. There could be a lot of action, but that feels a little too much like a scene from an old horror movie. There is a whole lot of symbolism going on here, and the only way to understand what's going on is to think about what the characters are saying: George is the symbol of a man's self-destruction, while his wife is the representation of a woman's desire to be free. In the third act, they are reunited, and a new adventure begins. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only complaint I can have about this movie is that I wish it was a little longer. I mean, we're talking about the only time a couple of guys are in a car together for several days. There's no way that the car could have held two more people for that long. However, the movie still has some great moments. For example, the car chase at the end. It's a nice touch that we're never sure whether we're driving or riding. I also liked the scene at the beach, and the ending sequence.  I think it's a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why I liked this movie so much more than I thought I would.   It's a simple story about a father and his son who get into a big fight and the mother of the son decides to go out to get a bottle of wine.  The father's car breaks down and the son tries to take the car back, but the son's father stops him and they get into an argument about whether the son is going to take over the father's business or not.  Eventually, the father goes back to his home and tells the son that he needs to be more careful, not to drink so much.  There's a scene in the movie where the father and son get into another argument about the son being a bad son.  At the end of the movie, I was disappointed because it was a very long movie and it had a lot of repetition.  Overall, I think this was a good film to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I was at the theatre when the trailer started, I remember the theater being packed with a lot of movie fans. I remember thinking "wow, this movie will have to be great. This is a good, well written story." I loved the idea of a team of teenagers, trying to save the world by saving a little girl who has fallen into a well, and also being a good kid who gets into all kinds of trouble. I loved watching the action scenes in the well, the characters all having unique and unique personalities, and I loved how each character was an interesting person, and had their own unique characteristics. I was also impressed by the fact that they chose a real well, to set the movie in. It was a nice touch.   I was also pleasantly surprised by the movie's overall quality. I felt it was well written, and with the right amount of action, and well-done plot lines, it was a pretty good movie. I thought the ending was well done, and that the whole movie was well-written. It had a nice story, and a good cast of characters, with a few interesting characters, and some nice action sequences.   a movie for fans of the genre, and one for kids, to see.   of course I haven't seen the movie, but I thought it was really good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this movie in a long time and I enjoyed it.  The film does not follow a simple plot line but rather one that has a lot of twists and turns.    This is a film that can make you feel like you are in the middle of a jungle and watching animals running around.  This film is a true jungle movie with a plot that is not too complicated but rather very interesting.  The story is about a scientist who has been trapped in a jungle for several years.  He is captured by the locals and taken to their king.  They have never seen a man before and have decided that the king must be killed.  So the king has the scientist bound to a tree and then he cuts off his hands.  As the king's army enters the jungle, the scientist is tied to the tree and is slowly getting weaker.  It seems that the scientist will not live very long.  When he gets down to his last breath, the king takes him and sets him free to die a slow death.  But the scientist's son and daughter come to rescue him.    The film is very sad as it has a tragic story about the people that were involved in the story.  Also the ending was very sad.  I liked the film as it had a lot to say about the jungle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of the effects of the "War on Terror" (with US support of the CIA's Mujahideen in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia's Al Qaeda).   I found the movie quite entertaining.   The movie's story line is very good, it's not so predictable.  It's quite funny, and there are a couple of very memorable scenes.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes good action movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a couple of bad movies in this series, but none that are truly bad.   It's an extremely good movie with a really great story.  It was filmed in Germany by a great director (Oskar Werner), and his camera really does the best to capture the atmosphere.  The only complaint that I have about the movie is that it was over-long.  I understand that there were some special effects, but they could have been used a bit more sparingly.

"A truly original science fiction film." "One long and very enjoyable science fiction adventure." "It is the future and we're the first humans on the moon. And the rest is history. In the year 2145, the Moon is the only place where man can go, the only source of clean water, and the only way to make a living. But something goes wrong. The Earth is in danger. A great disaster has befallen the world. The people have been infected by a strange virus, a deadly bacteria that turns them into hideous, blood-thirsty monsters. It's the end of the world and only the brave and the strong will survive. "Director Richard Matheson is an old time science fiction fan and he has come up with a unique story about a new species and the new way to conquer the world: the space invaders.

It is the space aliens and they are coming in their flying machines. They are the last line of defense for the Earth. The aliens are coming, and they will destroy all mankind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first read this book, I was surprised that it was only 5.25 stars on Amazon. I'm sure I would have read this more times if I could find it. It was a bit over long at about 70k words, but the writing is wonderful and the characters are interesting. There are a lot of "What if" type things in this story. It's a bit of a slow burn and the ending is a bit strange, but not as strange as I thought it would be. It still leaves a lot unanswered. The only thing I don't like is that the movie never shows what is behind the door in the kitchen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple: a woman is pregnant with twins and the twins are twins. The whole movie is about the woman's baby, who is only three months old. The movie starts out with a beautiful scene of a woman standing next to a lake with her children and a friend.   She looks at the water, she looks at her baby, she puts her baby in a cradle and she walks off.  Her children walk off too.  This is just one of those wonderful, sweet, sweet moments.  The movie doesn't take long to get to this point.  After the woman puts her child in the cradle, she goes to a small shop and buys a bottle of "baby oil."   In the beginning of the movie, we see that the woman is a nurse and her job is to bring life to the dead. She is trying to do it through her pregnancy and birth.  It is interesting to note that the movie doesn`t show the woman giving birth. She gives birth by the skin of her teeth, without the aid of a medical assistant.  She goes into labor because her baby is so weak.  When she gives birth, she uses a caesarean section, which means the baby is cut into two pieces.  There are a couple of scenes where she gives the baby a bath, but we don't see what happens to the baby after that.  We are left with a picture of a very happy woman.  I found it very interesting that this movie is a true story. The director was based on a true event, in which a woman gave birth to twins.  In another movie I saw that same director, he was making a movie about two men, who were both doctors.  These two men have the same problem that the real woman had.  They both had a problem with the woman`s pregnancy, so they both gave up their careers. They had two sons, and the only difference between them is that the one who gave up his career went to a different city, and lived in a very different way.  So there is a lesson in there for the rest of us, but it was a nice movie.

The gore is pretty much non-existent and it is very well done. The music is creepy and haunting and has a very eerie atmosphere. It's a good, chilling movie that should not be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best is a wonderful movie with a fantastic story that takes place during the last days of the Roman Empire.  I loved the story and the characters.    The plot is a simple one, but it's well executed.  I especially enjoyed the fact that this was set in the Roman era and I really enjoyed watching the various scenes where the Romans would be in battle and the Roman soldiers would be running around with their swords drawn.  And the fact of the matter is, the Roman army would be pretty much unstoppable.  If you like history, especially historical, action, or even romance, this is definitely for you.  The only problem I had was that the movie doesn't do much in terms of setting up the story.  That's fine, because it really isn't a story anyway.  But it is still a really fun movie and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves historical films and wants to see some awesome fights and a really entertaining plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an old favorite that I have enjoyed watching since it came out over 30 years ago.   It is a very well written film about the life of a young man, a Vietnam vet, who is sent to Vietnam by the U.S. Army and ends up having to fight the Viet Cong in a battle he did not ask to be in.  It does not get a lot of time to be a story about war and how a young soldier must deal with his past.  I also think it is very realistic in depicting the battle and how the Vietcong is doing their best to destroy the army.  The battle is well staged, with plenty of action, including a great sequence in which the Vietcans go in, shoot their rifles into the air, then come back and fire at the Americans.  There is a wonderful scene where one of the Americans gets hit in the head by a grenade.  When you look at this film, it has a strong emotional core and it is one that I think most people will be interested in watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought the whole movie was great, it was a good idea, but a bad execution.   It was supposed to be a movie about a group of children who get trapped in a museum, it ended up being more of a kids movie, and it worked well.  I loved the part where they get trapped, and the characters all looked really cool.  The ending was a little disappointing though, it seemed like the movie just ended.  A good movie that didn't last long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of this movie was great.  It was pretty simple.   Two guys, two guns, some shooting, some jumping, and lots of yelling.  I really didn't like the last half, though.  They kept trying to get a plot going, but never really managed to do so.  And it really wasn't much of a plot either.  The main character, "Cookie" is a really bad shot.  He always gets shot, which is a good thing in my book, but the way he always gets killed is a bit silly.  When he gets shot he runs like a headless chicken, and when he dies he just hangs there and dies.  I mean, come on.  This is one of those movies that has its fun, but then just runs out of steam pretty quick.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything great either. What really bugs me is that they made this a TV movie instead of a theatrical movie.  That just doesn't make sense.  But that's the problem with this movie. You have to have a movie in the first place before you can make a TV show.  Then you have to keep getting new movies.  These movies are like children playing in a sandbox.  There are some pretty good ones, but they are all too short.  My rating is a 5 because I think the first half is a great action movie.   I would like to see them make a second movie with the same basic premise.  If they do make a sequel, it would be good if they did it in 3D and didn't have the "deadly" sound effects.

I can see the evil in the word "God" and how a person can not be a good person and even when they believe in God they are a little bit different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't like the movies that are about a bunch of people fighting monsters in a big city, but this is different.  This movie is about the city of New York as a monster's lair.    The movie is also a metaphor for New York.  One of the things that is funny about the movie is the fact that all of the New York City buildings have a "T" in the street.  They all have a monster on them and it is called "The T".   You would think that New York would have its own monster in it, like it does with "The New Yorker".  The monster is a New York woman who has been given a gift by a god, that she can see a way out of the city.  This god gave her the gift so that she could take over the city and bring back the city to it's glory.  However, the city is not the same anymore, and the city has grown up around her.  She has been "haunted" by the New Yorkers, and she is trying to kill them, but she has no idea how to do it.  If I had to give a bad rating for this movie, I would say that it is a little too slow paced.  The ending is really cool, but it is not really a great ending.  There are so many things that happen that I don't remember.  It was also a little confusing when I started watching it. I was watching it at 9:30 pm on a Tuesday night, so I was confused as to why I was supposed to be watching a movie about the New Yorker.  In fact, I had never seen a New Yorker movie before and I don;t know how I missed that.  Overall, I think this is a really good movie.  You should check it out.

The music is pretty great as well.  It was kind of nice to see a movie where there weren't any vampires and werewolves.  The action scenes were pretty cool, and I enjoyed seeing a movie that was pretty similar to  The Last Unicorn  from Disney.  This was a great movie, and worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first movie I have ever seen that I was not interested in seeing.   I think this is a good film with good acting and a great plot, but it really just doesn't work.  The story is basically the same as all the other "horror" movies of the past 10 years.  What is new is the characters, and this one is just about the most over-the-top and crazy character I have seen.  In the beginning, he was just an average kid with a normal family, until the father is shot by a madman, leaving his wife and child to fend for themselves.  It doesn't take long for the kid to become obsessed with the madman and decides that the only way he will be able to stop him is by becoming a psychic.  Well, I can tell you, this is not an easy task.  He doesn't know anything about how to use a gun or even how to spell his own name.  So, he starts practicing.  But that isn't all.  After his first kill, the mad man appears in front of him and tells him that he will help him if he can find a woman who has died with no one around to claim her body.  I am not even sure what to say about this.  You have the typical teenage girl that is kidnapped, has her body chopped up, then is buried in a shallow grave, and then her head is put on the top of a car.  This happens to a bunch of other people, too.  There are also some other bad guys, who want to do the same thing, and who have no problem using their guns and grenades.  Not only is the story stupid, it is the acting that is even more so.  One of the main actors, who is supposed to be the kid's friend, doesn't even know how to act, and doesn't seem to know how he is supposed be able get the gun.  If I could have given the guy a B-movie makeover, I would have.  Even worse is the character of the evil doctor.  All of his lines are delivered like he is speaking in a thick Russian accent, and when he tells the kid, "I'll make a small hole in your head," you can just hear the accent.  And what kind of movie is this?   The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, but then again
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good story about a couple of misfits who get a job as a roadie for the great band, The Beatles. It's a bit of a hodge podge of all the best Beatles songs. They play together and the two lead singer/songwriters are not really singers, they just seem to sing like that. The music is good and it's hard to not get into the songs. The acting is OK. It gets really good when the lead singer sings "I Wanna Be Your Man". I think the ending is pretty good too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is about a man who, after an accident that leaves him paralyzed, is left to live a lonely life in a hotel room with his dead wife and her family.   He meets a man named Joe who has a room just like the one in the hotel where the man is staying.  But this is not a happy ending.  When they finally get back home, Joe is in a much worse shape than the man in the room.  While Joe is at the bedside of his paralyzed wife, the wife gets a call that a neighbor is threatening to kill her.  The next morning, Joe and his wife get ready to leave for the hospital.  There, they run into an old friend named John. John and Joe get into a fight, and John is killed.  As they leave the hospital, they see the man who killed John.  This is not the end of the movie.  It does not stop there.  They discover that there is another man in town who has been murdering the people who died from his poison.  What is the point of this?  Is there any?  It has been suggested that the ending is symbolic of the end times, and that the man with the wheelchair is Jesus Christ.  That may be the case, but I do not find that symbolism very strong.  I found the ending to be very interesting, but also somewhat confusing.  At first, I thought it was a bad movie, but later I realized that the story was not bad, but that it was too simple and that there was a lot of unanswered questions.  If you are interested in the story, you should watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at the cinema this afternoon with a couple friends, and there was an opening and a closing which I missed. The opening was a little slow but then there were a couple of scenes which I loved. One was about a young man who is trying to take over a local bank and trying to find a woman who will put up with him for a few years and then leave. There was also a scene where he was going to get a divorce. The woman he had been with, a woman called Laura, left him because she had no money. The guy was really trying to get her back, but she just said, "No". Then he took a job as a porter, and the guy who was taking over the bank found out about the affair and he got rid of him. But then he found out the man had a secret wife, and then he was about to find out the secret too. Then a couple went out to a dance and the man was going out to find his wife, but he met a girl who was going the same way. He was then going to find her, but then the other guy who had been taking over took her, and when he did the two of them had an argument, and they separated. So now the guy was out of work, and he had to find some way of getting Laura back. So he got a job in the office of a doctor, and at first the doctor didn't like him, but the doctor's wife told him that the doctor was a very nice man. So the doctor put the guy in an exam room, and as the guy came out of the room a woman came in and said, 'Oh, you're the guy with the secret wife'. So the man said, yes, I am. And then the doctor got his wife to come out. So Laura was with him, and she was not a bad person. The doctor had her sign a document, and that was it. But the doctor said, well, I don't want a wife, I want a friend. So I'll go to jail and I'll find a wife for the guy. He took a friend and gave him a job, and Laura was still with him. Then he was to take a girl home, and get her pregnant and then the baby would be taken to her, so he took her to the park and the baby was taken there. So then he took the baby to the doctor and the doctor gave

It's not the type of movie that will blow your mind. It is a fairly basic story. There are a few twists and turns and a few good acting performances. It isn't that special or anything. It just goes along with the movie. I would say that it's better than the first one.   The characters are a little older and the plot is a little more complex.  The story is very predictable.  I wish I would have gotten more of the characters and more of what made this movie great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** * I'm sure that many of you are aware of the film "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", the movie which has been called the "American Hitchcock", but which actually wasn't. While I agree that the film is definitely a masterpiece, I don't believe that it is as important to Hitchcock as he would like you to believe. The movie was directed by Michel Gondry (who directed "Cries and Whispers" and "The Royal Tenenbaums"). The film opens with the narrator (Jim Carrey) explaining his love of life. He explains that he is going to be late for his date with the girl who loves him more than anyone in the world, and who also loves him back. But he does not know where he is, nor does he have a way to find him. He does not even know what time it is. Then he realizes that he isn't really alone, and that there is someone waiting for him at the airport. He meets this person (a young man named Tom) who is also waiting at the same airport. After meeting Tom, the narrator realizes that life is worth living. After that the movie starts with a dream sequence, and then we meet the young man who is waiting for the narrator. This is a very interesting scene. The young man (Tom) seems to be very different from the narrator in that he seems to have no sense of time. But the narrator is very much the same person. So they talk about their love for life and then go to see a play. The narrator explains to Tom that he was going to the airport to meet a girl who was his lover, but that he couldn't find her. So he decides to go to a bookstore and buy a book about the girl, and also a book that explains what time is. The bookstore is filled with book shelves, and all of the books are numbered in order of publication. There are three books on the shelves, all numbered 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. In order to get to the number 2.4 book, the young narrator must go to the bookstore. There he meets a young man, named Peter. Peter introduces himself to the narrator and explains that this is his way of explaining the time. The narration is now in the future, and he is now able to understand the future. The old narrator then explains that the young person he was looking for is already here, and she is waiting in the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting, intelligent movie.    The story follows the relationship between a father and daughter who are both working in the hospital. The father is a doctor and the daughter is a nurse.  The father takes a trip with the daughter to see his daughter's ex-boyfriend who is a surgeon.    The daughter decides to go along with the ex- boyfriend so she can get some experience.  It turns out that he has been cheating on his girlfriend, the nurse who is the sister of the ex boyfriend.  The ex boyfriend is about to be discharged from the hospital and the ex girlfriend is angry that he is leaving and is planning to get revenge on him.  At the hospital, the father and the son decide to get away from the exgirlfriend and the nurse so they can go to the airport to meet the ex boy friend.  After the ex wife goes to the hotel to pick up her husband, the mother goes to pick her daughter up at the hospital to take her back home.  The father and son then head off to the hospital where they decide to go to see the ex partner.  But the ex husband is at the hotel with his wife.  Now the mother decides to get a gun and shoot the ex guy.  She gets the gun from her ex-husband.  When they get there, they find the ex lover with his ex girlfriend.  While the ex friend is talking to the ex woman and the girl, the ex brother is getting ready to kill the ex girl.  A policeman is also there and tells the mother and the father to leave and go home. The mother and father get a little bit into an argument, and the mother then starts to shoot the brother, who is still talking to his ex.  Eventually the mother kills him and then the father kills the ex. The wife is arrested and the family is reunited.  There are a few things that are a little disturbing about this movie. For example, the relationship of the father with his daughter was never explained.  Also, the way the mother was treated at the end was somewhat disgusting.  However, the movie was really interesting.  I was able to see this movie in a theater and there were a few people in the audience who could not get out of the theater after the movie ended.  This movie has a lot of things that I could say are disturbing about it, but that does not take away from my enjoyment of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last two years have been hard for me. I've tried to move forward in my life, but I've been unable to get anything done. I'm still not sure what I want to do with my life. I don't want to be an actor, I don the life of a normal guy. I just want to enjoy my life and take it easy. I am happy to say that my next goal in life is to work for the local theater. I want a normal job. I have a good job as a computer tech. But I need something a little more exciting. I need to learn something new. I think I can work for a theater company. Maybe I'll be lucky and I'll get hired and learn something from a real professional.  I'm ready for my new career. I'll keep trying to get better at it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not going to say that this movie is a masterpiece, but I'll say it's definitely a good one.  It's got a pretty good story and a pretty solid villain.   The cast is really strong.  This movie does a great job at telling a story in a relatively short amount of time.  The art is a bit dated, but it still looks good and is enjoyable to look at.  I don't think I can give this movie a rating higher than a 4/5, because I find it to be a bit too long, but if you want a good action movie, this is one you can watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the perfect example of why the big city is not always the best place to live.  The movie begins with a woman named Jan (played by the late Marlene Dietrich) waking up to find a note left on her door, asking her to come over to her house.    There is no explanation why she is coming over, but she does.  Jan's life is ruined when her new boyfriend, a young, handsome musician named Bob (Robert Mitchum) arrives in town.  Bob wants to meet Jan in her home.  The house is filled with the music of the great jazz players, a painting of a blonde woman, a giant jug of beer, and some pot.    Jan doesn't really care for Bob, and he doesn't seem to like Jan either.  A few drinks are in order, but Jan is still hung up on Bob.  She has trouble dealing with him, and she doesn't know why she wants to be with him in the first place.  One day, Bob's wife, a brunette named Mimi (Elizabeth Taylor), invites Jan to spend the night with them.  They start an affair.  Things take a turn when Jan learns that Mimi is pregnant, and that she is to give birth in a week.  While Jan and Bob are having a good time, Mimi's baby is stillborn, and Mimi begins to wonder if Jan is to blame.  Soon, she is in a life threatening situation.  When Bob learns that Jan is pregnant and is to deliver her baby, he will leave town. But he doesn t want to leave Jan behind.  After a few nights in Mimi s house, they decide to try and go back to Jan's house.   Bob finds a way to escape from the police, but is soon followed by Jan, who is being pursued by Mimi and the police.  At the end of the movie, Minka and Jan go back home to find that they have been arrested for murder.  This is a good film, and it is well made.  It's the perfect film to watch when you want to feel like the good old days.

After getting a bad break he is forced to go into the city to try and find his lost dog and his money. The film has a nice mixture of humor and drama, not too much in one movie but still a good one.   Posted by A.H.M. on 05/13/2002 09:13 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know how to describe this movie. It is one of those rare movie that will stay with you. The plot is nothing special, it is a classic spy movie. There is a small twist that the agent was an undercover agent for his country. His father died, so he left home and went to the Soviet Union. The movie is about a spy named Kolya, who is supposed to be an undercover spy for his mother country. Koly the agent is not a bad guy, he is trying to get to know the Soviet agents and the general staff. But things are not going too well for him. He is being watched by a man called Kudinov who is a good guy but is also an undercover. Kudynov knows all about the agent, so the agent cannot get a clear view of what is going on. It was a good idea, but not the best movie in my opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this film, a gangster (Barry Manilow) has a love affair with his boss' daughter (Melinda Dillon) and it's up to a team of special forces (led by a menacingly sexy David Carradine) to track down the villain.  It's a very stylish, violent movie, especially the sequence in which the villain is shot from above and falls out of the window.    I've always loved Manilows work and I have to admit that I have a weakness for this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always enjoyed The Last Starfighter.  It was one of those classic 1980's space adventure films where a group of rag tag adventurers from Earth, Earth Prime, and a few other planets go on a mission to rescue a kidnapped astronaut, the Last Starfighters.   They end up on a world that is an oasis in the middle of a desert where a race of flying people called the Starfuries live and run a sort of society that is similar to a pre-Christian society, but with a twist.  I'm sure that a lot of people like the film because it is a fun ride to watch.  A very low budget film with a nice soundtrack.  This is not a bad film.  But it is also not a very good film. The Last Ship was a much better film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Gremlins" series has always been a low budget, cheesy, low-rent film that was released in the late 70s. It's no surprise then that they made another one in the early 90s, and it's even more low budget and cheesy. There's a great scene where the "Gremlin" steals a car, but it's only because it's stuck in a swamp and needs to go back to where it came from. In the meantime, the owner of the car is getting very tired of it and gets fed up with the Gremlin and wants it to be stopped. But it's too late.  That's when a couple of kids come along to help.  The kids, who are all named "Danger" and "Dawg" are a group of children who live in a house in a nearby swamp.  In the beginning, the Gremlins take over the house and use it to make their home.  They are all very dumb and can't even get around without getting stuck.  And I love that they're dumb.  But they can't be trusted.  I guess the Geminins have a lot of respect for the Gimp.    And the Gens do too.  "The Gremlin"

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film, I really enjoyed it, it's a great thriller. The main character is a woman who is on the run from the law and the mob. She is in trouble when she goes to see a friend at her place of employment who has gone insane and is now trying to murder her. She does not take the job too seriously because she knows she is about to be killed, but she is not going to let her friend kill her. A few days before the murder she is hired to kill a man named Richard. She goes to Richard's apartment to kill him and gets caught in the act. She manages to escape and then hides out with a cop named Mike and gets a job at a small store called the Big Bear. There she gets to know a nice old man named Billy who is trying to sell his old car and make some money to buy a new one. She also gets to hear about a guy who is being chased by the mob, and he has an old woman who seems to be very helpful to him. When the mob comes to kill the man, they find the old woman hiding at the Big bear and Billy is able to get them all out. It is a great film that has a good plot, and a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, entertaining movie. The script is very funny, the plot is not.  I don't think the director and writer knew what they were doing when they wrote this. It's a lot like a bad soap opera or a bad romantic comedy, but without the humor. The plot is about a woman (the main character) who decides to go on a trip to New York with her husband (played by William Holden).  They are to stay in an old hotel in the Village that has been turned into a "hotel of the week".  The hotel is run by a nice guy who is a real hunk.  At first the lady gets off to a good start.  The hotel is nice, the food is great, the rooms are nice, etc. But there is a problem.  He is not a good guy, or a good hunk... The "Hotel of New York" is a hotel of the wrong kind.  It's run by an old lady who doesn't know what a man is and has never been married.      The guy that runs the place has a wife, a son, and a few other family members.  She is the boss, the man is the worker.  This is a woman who does not know what it is like to be married.  The old lady (played beautifully by Mary Richards) has no interest in the husband or the son and the son is not interested in the wife.  I found myself thinking this was a bad movie from the get go.  And then it got worse.  A few weeks later she finds a letter in the mailbox from the husband.      It turns out that he and the wife are going to be leaving the hotel.  They leave the hotel for the last time.  There is no wedding.  (The husband never gets over this.)    He decides to stay and start a new life in New York City.  Then he decides to try to have his wife back.  We see the old lady at the airport on her way to New Jersey.  After she gets there, she gets a job as a waitress at a local restaurant.  When the waitress is fired, the old woman is furious.  But, the woman's only plan is to get her husband back.  She hires a detective to find him.  Meanwhile, the husband tries to make a new living in New Jersey
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that this movie was about a group of soldiers in WW2, I was not impressed.  I didn't think they were very good.  I think this movie is great because of the amazing acting.  The movie is a little too long.    This movie is definitely worth watching if you like World War II movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I were looking for a movie to watch at the local mall in our small town in central Michigan, and the movie theater had a screening of The Terminator and was showing it for free. The movie was very good and the special effects were good, but it was missing something that made the movie special. The special effects are a little too much and there were too many people in the movie. The story is a little over the top. The main character is a soldier who comes to terms with the fact that he is a cyborg and is about to join a squad to take out the robots and aliens that have been invading the Earth. He gets killed by one of the robots but comes back as a robot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this film, it is the late 1920's and you are a young man with a new wife who is pregnant. Your new wife is a good person and is not mean spirited like many of the other women in the town, and so you are happy in the relationship. Then you are called to a meeting and a man walks up to you, tells you that he has been a good friend of your late wife, and asks that you please marry him. You say that you are interested, but you also tell him that your wife was a very good person, and that she died a good death. He replies, "Well, it was your mother who died, and you can't be blamed for that. But I am sorry that your mother has gone to such a bad place." You then go on to say that your father is a very bad person and that your brother is not as bad as your father, and he says that he will help you and then you are told to come over and meet your brother. The next day, you find out that your sister has gone with a man and that you must find her. You then travel to the man's place, and as you get there, he tells you he has to leave and will not be back till late in the afternoon. You tell him, "Oh, you mean to get away and don't come back until late?" He replies that he does not have to return that night, but that he is going to stay the night and that he can get a job for you in the morning. You are so excited by the idea that you will have a job, and will have some money, and won't have to stay at home that you decide to stay there. However, the next day you find that your friend is not there and that it seems as if you have left him behind. The man returns the next night, and tells you to meet him in his room. He says that his sister is still at the man´s place. You go over and find that her husband and son have left the place and are out in the woods. You ask the man what is wrong with them and he replies that his wife is sick and that they are out to find a cure for her. When you get back to your room, you go over to your friend and tell him what has happened and that there is nothing to worry about. He then asks you to go back and see what you can do. You stay

The only problem is that zombies are coming. The survivors run for the hills. They run for some good old fashioned, American-style, American cowboys and Indians. They start shooting zombies. They have no choice but to get to the next town and to the railroad. They get to that railroad and the railroad is overrun by zombies. A zombie is shot by the railroad guards, and the zombies are about to overrun the town, when the railroad guard runs over a zombie with a shotgun and the zombie starts crying. That's when the zombies start eating the railroad train. The zombies don't get far, however, because one of the railroad guys shoots the zombie with the shotgun and kills it. And with that, the zombies get to town and they're pretty much out of the woods. Then we get to see some of the survivors, who are not very good looking people. The one thing I loved about this movie was that I got to see the actors doing a lot of funny stuff. It wasn't like a comedy, or like a melodrama, or anything like that. It was a little bit of everything. The movie was a lot funnier than the book, but still a little less funny than the film. It didn't have the same feel as the book. I loved it! * ****** * ********************* * The Walking dead is a fantastic book and a very good movie. I would like to add that I have only read the book (and the TV show), and I have seen both.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is fairly good, but the second half is quite good too. It is a simple story about a man who tries to get his girlfriend back after she left him and then he is saved by a demon who says that they are going to be together forever. The demon says that the only way to make this happen is by taking her back to his house. This is a typical love story. But it is not just a love story, it is a story about love and love is so hard to find. It could have been so easy to write a love-story like this one, but it wasn't. The movie itself was decent enough, but there are many problems with it. First off, there are no actors in this movie. They are only called in for a couple of scenes. It isn't like the movie can't have actors in it because it would be so much better if they were there. The acting is very bad, and even worse when the movie turns into a horror movie. The script is awful and has very little in it. The story is good enough, and the movie has its moments, but unfortunately it isn't worth the time you put into watching it.

It is a very interesting movie and I would like to see more from this director. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a good film.

I don't know how the series was supposed to end anyway. The movie is great, but it's just so... boring! I'm sure that it's a great movie for the fans of the series, but to me it's completely uninteresting. I don a lot of people who were fans of this movie. I'm one of them.

This is not an easy film to understand, but the characters are interesting, the story is interesting, and the action is interesting.  The film is interesting for several reasons: the idea of a boy being raised by wolves, a man being raised in a cave, and a girl who is not very happy with the human race.  There are a few funny moments, such as when the woman says that she is not a wolf, but she is like a wolf.  It is important to understand the characters and their situation before watching this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know about you but when I was a kid we'd sit around the TV with a book, a bottle of soda and a magazine. My dad was the booker of the station so he would get me to sit in his lap. He would read to me while I read the newspaper. When I was old enough to sit on the lap of my dad and watch television, I'd read the news to him. The old man would always make a joke out of something and I'd have to come up with the pun. My favorite was when the police chief was caught with a prostitute on a public street. The chief said, "How would you like to come and get me for three weeks?" Then he added, "If you can't get me, I'll get you." Then the police department made a huge fuss about it. But the chief said he had a great idea. He said, 'Why don't I get a prostitute and take her out to a nice restaurant?' I said, that's not funny. But he said, don't be ridiculous. He wanted to have a nice dinner with a nice lady and then have a little bit of fun. He thought of a few jokes and told them to me. I don't remember all the jokes he told me but one of them was that when a cop sees a man trying to cross a street, he says, 'Don't cross the street.' But when the man says, "I know that," the cop says, "'Why, what's the matter with you?' The man says 'I know I'm doing the right thing.'" So a little while later when the officer came up to the man he said," 'I didn't see you try to cross the road. But I know you were doing the wrong thing.'" My dad told me I was very clever and a real "talker." That's how I came up with my own sense of humor. But if you want to find out about funny police work, watch the movie. It's all in there.

If you have seen any of the old Star Trek shows, you'll recognize a lot of it. If not, you probably won't. The sci- fis are done well, with a few flaws. The movie has a good sense of humor, but I was never a big fan of it at the time, and I find it a bit cheesy now. If I had seen this in the mid 90's I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Lonely" is a classic thriller about a married couple who travel to the remote woods and discover a strange and eerie community.  It's a well made movie that has a lot of interesting things going on, but unfortunately, the story doesn't really build to anything. It has the classic thriller plot: husband is traveling and wife is home alone, husband kills a neighbor, husband is arrested and wife and neighbor are killed. It's a pretty simple plot that doesn't require much creativity to make it interesting. The film is pretty well made, but it's just not that great of a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw the trailer for this film I immediately went to see it. It wasn't too long into the movie before I started getting really intrigued. I was actually surprised by how much of a great movie this was. The movie is a mixture of genres. It's a western, action, and adventure. It also has a romance in it. This film is pretty short and has a good amount of action. The main character, Nick, is a boy who gets a chance to be a hero and the movie follows his life as he attempts to save the town from a witch that has been attacking it. There are a lot of characters that get involved in the story and they are all very well done. The story isn't overly complex but it does the job it needs to do. The romance between Nick and Mary is also quite strong. The only flaw I have is that it's a bit too short and it's probably only for a 1st time movie viewer. I recommend this to any movie watchers out there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie about a guy with a dog who has a lot of problems but can't seem to fix any of them. This is a true story about how a guy who is in a bad marriage and a bad relationship with his dog gets into a dog fight and beats up his opponent so badly that he loses his mind and starts going after everyone he can find. The movie is about a man who is an idiot. He goes around looking for trouble and his problems only come to him when he's not looking for them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel is a very good movie that is about an ex-convict who moves into a new town to try to forget about his past and find a new life. He is joined by the charming young waitress, a woman named Alma. The town is full of rich people who are in the business of making money, but he is able to avoid the money trap by avoiding the people in the money business. This is a movie about a real life character, but it is not an easy movie to watch. The story is very good. The acting is superb and the movie is very entertaining. The film does a good job of showing how people act and react to the circumstances that are presented to them. The actors all are superb and all are able to convey the character and their own feelings. The only thing that could have been better is that there is not enough background information about the place that we see, and that the movie seems to be taking place in a little town that is very isolated. This movie does have some very good acting and it is a good way to get your brain wet while watching a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know what it is about this movie but it is very good. This movie is very different from most other movies out there. I have seen most movies that have had aliens. This is different because the aliens are from other planets that are different from ours. This alien's are very intelligent and they know what they are doing. I love this movie and I think it is one of the best movies out at the moment.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. It was really well done and it was a good time for me. It's really a good idea to put a lot of good movies together into one movie.   This movie was made in 1976 but it's a good thing that the plot is still good. It wasn't that great but it was still entertaining.  It had a good story and a good plot.  I didn't know much about the movie and I was happy to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people complain about the plot but I think it's quite good. There's a nice amount of gore and some nice blood. I also really liked the little girl in the movie and her role in the whole story.   There is a lot of swearing in this movie. If you're not going to watch the movie for the plot then it will be good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My son and I have been watching this movie since we were very young. My son had the first film and I had the second film. I really enjoyed both films. It has a good balance of humor, action, and adventure. The film has a very good plot, especially the beginning. It was great to watch the three children of a rich family, grow up and learn a little about life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this film back in 1996. I had heard a few reviews of this film. I think it was good.   The first thing you should know about the film is that it is about a man named William (John Hurt). He is a man who has an abusive wife who keeps trying to take his life. She keeps trying, and William keeps trying. In the end she has an idea. She wants to have her way with William one last time. When he refuses, she threatens him with a gun. William keeps fighting back. He manages to get the gun from her. She is shot and killed, and he goes to a psychiatric hospital. When the doctors find out about his wife's murder, they realize he is a psychopath, and they try to cure him. But it seems he is not a psychopath. William has a secret. He has a child who he wants to protect. It seems like a very nice idea, until the day that William finds his child is not his. He runs away from home and becomes a prostitute. He finds his way to an old friend, and together they try and make a life for themselves. The film does a good job of showing a good part of the life of a prostitute in the 1920's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of the people that have seen it, especially the older people, are saying it is the best movie ever. I can't say I agree, and I can say I think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is like a bad movie in a bad part of town, with a bad lead actor, bad acting, and bad acting. And bad acting is a big part of it. But you will still find some great scenes here and there. But it is really the worst movie I have seen in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was so excited to see this film at the local theater in New Orleans.  The story is good and there are a few good jokes, but nothing really stands out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie, and it's the kind of movie that I always like. It has an intelligent and witty script with a good ending, and a nice cast of actors who really do play their roles. I like the story, and I like its characters, and the actors, but I don't think I'll be recommending this movie to anyone who doesn't know what to expect. The film is set in the late 19th century and tells the story of a gang of thugs who get their start in the opium trade, but who eventually develop into some of the best gangsters in London.   It's a story about the ways in which the gangsters try to be the best that they can be, and about how they overcome their own personal issues. It's about how the opium business affects them and how it has a lot to do with their rise to power, and how they eventually get themselves killed. I liked the movie a lot, and am looking forward to seeing more of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie about four times now and it's still one of the best.   It's set in an alternate reality where the Cold War never happened and the Cold war never ended.  While it has the same type of comedy as a lot of the other movies in the "Cold War" series, it's very different from them.  The Cold War is just one facet of the "Soviet Union" in this universe.  There are two other countries that are more or less "Soviet" in nature.  As you'd expect, they're very similar to the Soviet Union in terms of the people, their politics, and their way of life.  Also, unlike the Cold Wars of the past, the Cold wars are all about espionage.  This is not a "what happens in the movies" movie.  It focuses on the people that live under the Soviet "beneath the earth" system.  That means, there is a lot more intrigue to the story than there is in a movie like "The Red Violin."  The story isn't really a very good one.  We have a spy in charge of a secret organization, and he's an extremely arrogant, overconfident jerk.  He's the most "evil" person I've ever seen.  However, he's also the most likable character I've seen. He's a complete jackass, but at the same time he's a very interesting character.  For me, the most interesting thing about this movie is the fact that there are a lot fewer spy movies set in this kind of world than there are.  I think this is the most realistic spy movie of all time.  Another thing I liked about this film is that the action was done really well.  Everything was well choreographed and it looked amazing.  A lot of this movie was very fast paced.  All of the action took place in a very short period of time, and the action in these scenes was really intense.  Again, a lot is told from the point of view of the spy, so the movie is told more through the eyes of the guy trying to make the best of a bad situation.  Overall, I think "Red" is a very entertaining movie.   It's a good way to look at the Cold world in the 1990's.

The plot is not original, but it is fairly original and pretty well done.    It is a story about a woman who is an engineer.  She works at a nuclear power plant.  Her sister is the chief of staff of the plant. She works on a program called "Operation Pussycat" to repair and maintain a nuclear reactor.  The problem with this is that it is not working very well and the nuclear reactor is about to blow up.  This will not be an easy problem to solve, but she has a plan.

It was a movie that felt like it could have been made at any time and the music was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is the sequel to the movie   The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.  It's a very good movie.   As I said before, it is a sequel to a movie, so it is not very original, but it is very good.  The movie begins with the death of the Ring-bearer (Tom Bombadil) and the destruction of the One Ring.  Then the other four rings of the Fellowship (one for each of the four races) are revealed to be on the other side of the Great Sea.  They are the Two Ringed and the Three Ringed, and they are not pleased to see that the Ring has been destroyed.  It turns out that they were planning to destroy the One and destroy the other rings so that they could rule the world.  But they are stopped when Frodo Baggins, a hobbit of the Shire, takes the Ring, and then saves the world from them.  There are some nice scenes in the movie: The Ring-Bearer's death and the Rings are destroyed, but the Ring is still there. The ring turns out to be the Ring of Power, which is held by the two other Rings. Then the four Rings leave, one by one. But Gandalf's Ring is left behind.  When Gandalf is being pursued by the Nazgul, Frodo goes to the Shires to hide and save Gandalf. There is a scene in the ShIRE where Gandalf has to leave the Shienarans to his own devices. Frodo is not in the story. The Shire is being destroyed.   The last scene is Gandalf and Frodo's farewell. Froweh is still in the forest. The other Rings are gone, and Gandalf does not get his Ring. But he will get it back again, and he will keep it. He will destroy the Ring. He wants the Ring so that it can only be wielded by one, and that is Frodo. The next day, Frohwein goes to Rivendell. It is a very long day. The Elves are getting ready for a big celebration, but they are tired. Then they hear a knock on the door. They look out, and there is a hobbits' voice:  "It is I, Frowein. I am here to take you to Mordor." The Elves go to the door and open it. They see
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a nice little comedy, with a lot of humor and it gets even better as it goes along. It's a great little movie to watch on a lazy Saturday evening and it's a good one. The voice actors are pretty good and the animation is pretty decent, with decent use of colors. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because it's short, and I really like this type of movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ ___________________________________ The plot is simple: A group of friends are on a boat in a lake and they're having a great time. Then a big wave crashes over them, leaving them stranded on a small island. It seems like everyone who lived there is gone now, so it's up to them to figure out how to survive. The best part of this movie is the cast, it's the only part of it that isn't cliche. ______________________________________________________ Ripley's Believe It or Not is a classic example of the old "one-hit wonder" that has been doing the rounds for a while now. It's not a bad movie, in fact it's a very entertaining one. The plot does not revolve around Ripley at all and that's probably the best thing about it. The story itself isn't too bad either and is certainly not bad enough to warrant its exclusion from the Best Movies of the Year list. It does have a few faults, however.   The acting is pretty good but the plot is pretty dull, and the film never gets around to dealing with its main character's relationship with the rest of the crew.  As the film is about a girl who gets stranded on an island with an alien, and her only friend is an alien who doesn't speak English, the plot seems a bit redundant. However, the film does have some decent special effects and is quite entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sorry to say that I didn't find much in this movie to be enjoyable. The action is well executed and the movie itself isn't much different from the average martial arts action movie, it's just that the characters are all a little over the top.   While it is not very memorable, the movie is still very good and worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil is a Gentleman" is a movie that I'm going to need to watch again. It's a classic of the genre that will never fail to entertain me. The plot follows a man, played by the late Henry Fonda, who travels to New Orleans to find his dead wife. After being refused a job in New Orleans, he takes a job at a bar where he becomes a regular. When he discovers that the bartender is a woman, he decides to take matters into his own hands and hire a woman who looks like the woman he's after. It doesn't take long for the woman to discover that her husband is alive and well. It is then that she decides to travel to New York with a suitcase in her arms. She plans on going to the bank and then on to a hotel. When she finally finds a job, it's to work as a housemaid to an old man who she meets in the train station. The old man is, in fact, a devil and has been using the woman for sex. The two of them are soon married. The movie's cast is wonderful. The actors do a great job of conveying their characters, especially Henry Fond, who plays a widower who is just as handsome as he is ugly. The other actors in the film, like Paul Newman, Sam Waterston, Richard Widmark, and Robert Wagner, are all excellent. In addition to the excellent cast, the film has a wonderful score. "The Devil Is a Gentleman", like so many of the classic westerns that have come before it, is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again without losing your interest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So this is a pretty good movie. It has some flaws, but it is still worth seeing.    The story takes place in a small town and the characters are all pretty average.  They are all in their teens and I don't know why the town is so small, but you have to give them credit for trying.  The movie is not a particularly strong one, but the acting is really good and it has a very good ending.

I don't like the Joker but he is still a great villain and is still funny and annoying. There is a very good performance from Kevin Conroy and I liked a lot about the action. The story is good but I am not a big fan of the Batman, but I liked the first act. The ending is pretty good. It is a nice Batman movie and it has good action, good music, and good special effects.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a fan of horror, and especially horror movies that focus on supernatural and/or occult elements, I was thrilled to watch The Possession. I don't know what other genre the movie was aimed at but this was a very well done and entertaining film. I found the ending to be a bit contrived, but I guess that's part of the horror genre. There is a lot of tension in this film and the scenes that follow are quite scary. I would have liked to have seen the film a little longer. There are a few scenes that are just not as entertaining as they could have been. It would have been nice to see more of the characters' motivations and pasts. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that is not a fan, but there is nothing bad about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie, it's really well made, but not the best of the trilogy.  It has some great action sequences but it's all a bit too short.  The movie is about the time when the world was at peace and people just got back to normal.  The movie is set in a small village called Rambouillet, which is a place that has not been touched by war for a long time.  Ramboullet is home to a man named Cesar (played by Richard Harris).   The main problem is that Cesar and his brother have a problem.   They can't control their brother's uncontrollable urge to kill.    They're also not very good at handling weapons so the world starts to get a bit dangerous. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like "Gone Girl", "Django Unchained" or any of the other Oscar nominated films, you will enjoy "Garden State". The movie takes place in an idyllic New York town, the idyll is shattered when the residents find out that they have been replaced by "New Yorkers" in the movie. This new "New York" is very different than what the old ones ever were, it's a modern, "urban" New York.   In the movie, we get to see the true life of a real person who has lived a normal life for decades, until the day when he gets the opportunity to be a part of a new urban life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the beginning of the movie, the film starts off with a scene in the hospital room. Dr. Geddes (Cillian Murphy) and his wife (Helen Mirren) are talking about the future of their two children and what they want for their futures. He says that they can't have a future like they had before, since his wife died, and that he and their two sons don't have much time left. Helen says, "Don't get so down." He says, with his wife, "Yeah, well, we'll be dead soon." This movie is based on the true story of the family who lived in the small town of Kincardine, Ontario, Canada. They were a happy, healthy family with their beautiful, bright daughter, Hannah (Helena Bonham Carter) and their young, energetic son, William (Tom Holland). However, they were always victims of the cold winter, and William was born with a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. The parents could not afford a machine that could make his heart beat more rapidly, but the parents did not want their son to die. So they did not know how to help him. Then William was just two years old, and the doctor said, "You'll live." It took them years to figure out what to do. Finally, they decided to have him in the summer of 1997, and he would be able to play sports with other kids his age. This made them happy, but there was a catch: He would not be able go to school, and would not receive any help from the school to learn to read or write. He would be in the same class as all the other kids who were not in special education. Then they found out that he had a genetic condition called "atrial flutter" that can cause irregular heartbeats. They did a lot of research on the Internet, and they found a doctor in Ottawa who specialized in this condition. They made a trip to Ottawa, and Dr. George Bignell did a few tests on him. He diagnosed William with this condition, and told the parents that William could go to college and go to university if he wanted to. He also said that he could probably get him an implantable heart defibrillator, but he would not need a cardiac catheterization. However, his parents did have to pay for it, which would cost about $30,000. The next day, Hannah
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character is a nice looking, intelligent and attractive guy. It is easy to get along with him. The romance, however, is a bit strange. He is a handsome guy with a beautiful wife, but he is a total bachelor and can't seem to get a girl, no matter how hard he tries. His wife has a few boyfriends, but they don't seem all that interested. At the beginning of the movie, the wife is upset about her husband not being able to find a date. This makes him feel insecure and he is very angry. He gets very aggressive with his wife. This is a strange character, but it is well done. The movie is well acted and written, but unfortunately it doesn't have much action. It was too long and it would have been much better if it were shorter. I liked the characters and I hope this will be on the short list of movies to watch next year.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a perfect world, there would be no need for the internet. It would just be the old days when you went out to buy a beer and get some laughs. You could take a trip to the old west, ride a horse, and have a few laughs at a bar. But in the real world, this is not the case. It is a world where people live and die, where people make deals with each other, where the law is applied and where money is not only king but queen. It was a world that the audience was meant to see. It had everything that people expect from a western, it was funny, it had great actors, it also had a great soundtrack. There is one thing that you have to say about this movie. It didn't need to be shot in 3D. If it was, there wouldn't be much to the film. The 3D is distracting. It made the movie feel bigger than it actually was. It also made the action look like a lot of fun and not a chore.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've seen a movie like this before, I'd be hard-pressed to blame you.   But this movie is a little different from other "star-crossed lovers" movies that I've seen, in that it doesn't focus on the love-making but rather the struggle to stay alive.  When a ship that's about to sink (that's what the whole movie is about) is saved by a guy with a crossbow, we all assume that the ship is doomed and we're all going to die.  The ship is saved, but not before a girl named Mireille (who is the crossbow-wielding guy's wife) is killed.  After the ship's captain is killed, a guy named Joe (a good looking guy with an evil streak) takes command of the ship.  He uses the ship to try to kill Mireile.  It's a good enough movie.  This is the second time I've watched this movie and it was quite good the first time.  But I found the second viewing a bit less good.  I don't know why.  Maybe because there was more of a focus on survival and not so much on love.  There were also a few more scenes that didn't fit in, but those are not important in this movie. The characters are not great and don't seem to have any real depth.  And I have to say that I found this movie a bit of a disappointment.  Not because it was bad, but because it wasn't anything that I would want to watch over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie before and have to say it is very good. This movie has the same charm and humor as its predecessor and is an excellent time to watch. The plot is very predictable and doesn't seem to have any originality to it at all. The acting is pretty good and the songs are very good and catchy.   This movie is very cute and I loved how it was animated.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You want to know what you're in for?  Oh yes.  It's a pretty good time.    This is the third time that I have watched this, and I'm amazed that it's still getting a good rating.  This was actually the first time that we got to see what the other characters were up to.  I thought that they had gotten a bit too familiar with each other but this film has some really good bits to it.  The characters are a bit predictable, but I don't mind that.  A few of them get into a bit of a battle, but other than that it is just good fun.  As far as the story is concerned, it's not great.  It seems to be taking a lot of cues from 'Lord of the Flies' and 'The Last Starfighter' and I think it's great, but it can get a little stale, especially after a while.  There are a few scenes that really are worth watching, but most of the time it feels a bit like a children's book.  You can also check out my review of 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete'.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The End of the Beginning" is a short and intense movie with the simple premise that we are all going to die. The only thing that keeps us going are the people who are doing things to keep the world alive. That's the beauty of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I thought that this was a good little action movie that is well worth watching. The film is about a group of young mercenaries who are hired to take out a terrorist named Abu Nidal. They do take him out and they kill him. The problem is that they don't know he has a bomb in his underwear, so they don´t know what to do. Â The movie is not very good. There are some bad acting and bad acting is bad.  The bad acting includes the main character, Sam, who has the same accent as the guy from the first movie.  Sam from the beginning to the end.    When the movie started, I thought it was a real action movie, but then it took a turn and I realized it was going to be an action movie. The movie has some good action and it has a good script. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is good and enjoyable and the characters are great. I think the best thing about this movie is how good the special effects are.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of 2014 is the new film   'The Raid 2' starring Riz Ahmed and Paul Dano. It was directed by Gareth Evans and has some great action scenes and some amazing performances from both actors.   The Raid 2 is about a gang of Muslim extremists who raid a Japanese restaurant. They kidnap a young Japanese girl and hold her hostage. They then take the girl to a remote area where they kill a few of the employees and burn the restaurant. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many things I can say about The Wicker Man but the best is that it is an entertaining and frightening movie that has the power to move us.  It was a bit overproduced at the time of its release, but the effects and the costumes are wonderful and the film is just that - a horror film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very unique. I love how the movie takes place in a school, and the way the kids are portrayed, from the most popular ones to the least popular ones, is very interesting. There are some great performances from the kids, especially in the school's principal's daughter, and she does a good job of portraying the school principal. I especially liked her line, "I don't want to hear it. I want to make it real. I don't believe it." I thought it was a very powerful and poignant statement.   The movie also takes place during a time when the students are preparing for the national dance contest. They're competing against the other students of the school and some of the students from other schools in the country. I loved how the principal and his wife are in this movie. I liked the way they played off each other. The principal is a very cool character, and I also loved the way he handled the students. I particularly loved the moment when he tries to get them to dance in the movie. They are so into this dance competition, they won't even look at him! But then he tries again, and they finally look at their principal and he has a smile on his face! He is a wonderful role model for all kids!   Overall, this is a really fun movie that I think many people will like. It's funny, it's moving, and it's great! If you want a movie that's fun and entertaining, but also has a message, this movie is perfect for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crazy for You is a romantic comedy that is about a couple in love.  The movie takes place in the 1950's and it's about a husband who wants to be a man so he wants to dress like a man and be a woman.    Crazy For You is funny but not a romantic movie.  In this movie we see the wife, who is the wife of a man who is obsessed with a woman that he meets in the hospital.     This movie is about the love for a woman, and the husband who doesn't know how to love a woman and wants to become a woman so that he can love a man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a story about a man and a woman who are stranded in the middle of the desert. They are attacked by a dog and a man with a sword. The dog is a little hairy man and the sword is a big ugly man. The two are in the desert for a week when a man comes and offers them some food. The man is a shaman and gives them food and medicine. The woman tells him the story of the man with the sword and the dog and the man who has a big hairy man for a pet. The shaman and the two men live together for a long time. The only bad thing about the movie is the terrible acting. I know I should be mad at the actors for this movie. I was very frustrated and I hated it at times. It was a bad movie and I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fun and entertaining comedy.  I loved the comedy and it wasn't too long before I started to laugh out loud.    It is a funny movie about a girl who is having a bad day and she wants to take a nap.  She takes a nap in a little box in the backyard.  When she wakes up in the morning she is on the verge of tears.  Her dad tells her that she is lucky and she will be ok.  But the next morning she wakes to find a guy who lives in her backyard.  This guy is called the "Bait Man".   He lives in the box and every morning he walks into the box.  He then talks to the girl and tells her all about his life.  I didn't really find the story interesting.  It was just a lot of talk and the movie didn't get very interesting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like  Battleship Potemkin, you will like this.  It is a more dramatic movie than Potemkina.    I did not know about the "Pavlov" theory that says that when we are around a dog, we become more like it.  I had to see that for myself.  We are given an idea that a Russian ship has been captured by the Japanese and taken to the bottom of the sea.  A small group of soldiers is left with the ship and with only one day left to save it. The group includes the young soldier from the beginning of the movie, the old, the young and the very old.  The old is very much in charge of the group and is not in his right mind.  This is where the film shines and I love this movie.  It is so sad that the old soldier is not around anymore.  If I had a dollar for every time the old man came in and took the kids away.  He was very sarcastic and was not the most likable character in the film.  One of the soldiers is a boy who is an excellent shot with a rifle and is given the most difficult job of all.  In a small village he is ordered to make a "cross-fire" with an artillery piece.  After the first few shots, he gets a look at the young boy and the old one.  Now I love how they use this in a movie. I love the fact that he is a very nice boy.  There are many scenes where he gets an "a-ha" moment and is able to figure out what is going on.  They also used a lot of "dog" shots to show that he was getting closer to the enemy.  So in a way, they used him as a human shield to protect the young boys and the young men.  When we first see the boy in the movie he is dressed as a child and is carrying a bag with a toy soldier inside.  Next to the boy is a man who is dressed in a white uniform with a yellow star on it.     Then we have a boy in a suit who is playing with a gun.  Another man is sitting on the floor holding a rifle.  Then the film switches to a group of three soldiers who are on the ship.  All three of them are very different from one another and the two that are in the front

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't recommend this movie enough.  It's a movie that you won't soon forget.    The movie is about a guy named Peter (Robert Blake) who is married to a beautiful woman named Marla (Cloris Leachman) who lives in a small town called Green Cove.  In the movie, Peter is getting over his divorce and is planning to propose to Marla at the end of the movie.  However, before that can happen, a couple, the Jensens, are having a big fight at their house.  One of the Jenders, a small man, is trying to hit Peter.  The other Jender is trying for the same.  It gets really heated.  This scene is followed by one of the best scenes in the movie: a car accident.  I mean, I don't know about you, but when I hear "Cocktail hour at a diner" and the music is "Take on Me" by the Beatles, I just know something is going to happen in this movie.   The movie then turns to a little old lady who is also a diner patron and has a long talk with Peter about his long absence.  Eventually, Peter gets a call from his lawyer.  Peter is going on trial for his wife's murder.  He has the testimony of a young lady who was in a car with him when the incident happened.  Unfortunately, Peter's lawyer is a total asshole.  But, Peter has a chance to prove that the young lady is lying about the incident.  They drive to the diner where Peter is being tried and the young woman says that Peter hit her in the car.  We then cut to the next scene where the lawyer and the judge are in a conversation.  Then the lawyer says, "You can't win this case."   It's the most epic line in the film.  Now the judge asks Peter if he would be willing to testify about his wife.  Yes, of course.  "Oh, no," says Peter. "No way!"   So the judge says, and we cut to Peter's home.  As Peter is sitting there on his porch, he is listening to the radio.  A man is talking about the trial of his ex-wife's murder in the courtroom.  Pete looks up and says, to himself, "I don't believe what I am hearing."  Now Peter looks up at the

The main character, Jason, is a guy who loves playing video games, and this is the best one ever made. The graphics are great, and it has a good storyline and plot. If you love games, you will love this movie. If the movie was not so cheesy, the movie could have been even better. I also liked the music. The whole movie is just a little cheesy and cheesy, but that doesn't mean it is not worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie "Breathless" was a great action movie from beginning to end. This movie is definitely one of the best action films from the 80's. The movie is set in a jungle with some very cool stuff going on. The character of Max is an average guy who gets sent to the jungle to stop some people from kidnapping his daughter. Max is a tough guy with a huge gun who knows what he is doing. The people Max has to fight are a couple of evil men that want to take his daughter away from him. I must say the movie is full of action and a lot of people die and a bunch of people get hurt. It is a little hard to get into the movie because it starts off a little slow. It starts off with a guy who is trying to get his daughter back from the kidnappers. He is a very strong character but the film never goes into the action, just a couple guys talking about stuff. Once the action starts it gets very good. The action is amazing. Max gets to fight some very strong people in this movie. The fight scenes are very good and the people die a lot. The only complaint I have is that it does get a little bit long at times. There are a few things in this film that I don't really like and it just gets to a point where it gets a little boring. I think a movie like this would be better with a little less action and more of a story. I would also have liked to see a little more of the background characters. I like the characters that are introduced and they seem like they are from a movie and not real life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best way to describe the plot: a man who lives alone, in a large house in a forest, is visited by an unknown man. He gives the man a key to the house. The man enters and finds a mannequin in a closet, dressed like a woman, and has been waiting in the closet for several days. He opens the closet door and finds the mannequins headless and the woman in a room, dressed in women's clothing. He goes into the room and finds that the woman has a very strong orgasm in her throat, and he goes into her mouth and pulls out her head. The woman's head falls down on the ground. The guy picks up the head, and looks at the woman's body. He sees a hand come out of the body, and the hand is that of the woman. He turns the head into the body of the man and puts it into a coffin. He leaves the house and goes to a nearby inn. He has a conversation with a man and a woman in the tavern, and they tell him that the body is being stored at a local cemetery. The next morning, the man finds the body in a coffin, and picks it up. He gets into the coffin and looks inside. He looks at a man in the coffin, a woman dressed as a man, and a man dressed as the woman, but does not see the head. He then sees the head on a table. He walks out of his house and finds out that the man who gave him the key to his house is the owner of the coffin. They find the head of the headless woman, dressed as woman. They open the coffin with the head in it and look inside. They see that there is a little child inside. There is a child's mouth with a red smile on it. The little boy says "I want a big apple" The man who was the owner says "No apple, I have an apple." The man is going to let the child go, but the little boy is saying "No, a big one!" The man says "A big one? You have a very big mouth, little boy." The boy is going "I have an angry mouth, you have a big mouth." The woman is going 'I am a woman with a bad mouth, I am a man with a good mouth' The man finds a wooden box in the house, and inside the box is a woman's hair, the hair
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most brilliant thing about this movie is that it is a comedy.   There is so much to laugh at in this movie and I found it funny.  It has a couple of things that make it a good comedy:  First of all, the lead, Mr.  Jaws is the greatest, the most entertaining actor that has ever played a monster.  Second,   the story is a classic that has been done a thousand times and is done again and again and in a thousand more ways.  This is the real deal.  You don't get better than this.  If you have ever seen a bad monster movie then this is the one.  I laughed at every moment.  It's a great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a good half hour and then leave you there.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The film is not as strong as the first. I have to say that, as a matter of fact, the film is far less good. Â Instead of an old man who is now living in a new home in the country, we have a new housewife.  The housewife has just got the house ready and is in the process of putting it all together.    When she opens the bedroom door, we are immediately met with the scent of the sweet smell of new carpet.  She is then greeted by a very young boy, who she calls her "boy friend."   His name is Tom, and he is very bright and full of life.  He tells her that his parents are out of town for a few days.  The housewife immediately knows what he is talking about and decides that she wants to go out and see them.  But, as soon as she walks into the kitchen, she hears the old man's voice calling to her.  It is the old gentleman and the housewife's son.  Tom is a very shy boy.  So, when the old housewife gets into the bedroom, he is just staring at the bed.  Her face lights up when she sees Tom's face.  This is a wonderful scene.  When he is invited into the house, Tom goes over to the old woman and says, "I don't have to tell you, Mom, that we are friends, or that we're in love."  It seems to have a profound effect on her, and she tells him that she knows this, but doesn't know how to say it.  After that, Tom and the old lady have a wonderful day, and Tom asks if he can stay with her for a while.  They spend a night together, and the next day, Tom gets his wish.    He goes home with the old folks and they have a great time.  At the end of the day, the old people all go out for a nice dinner, and when they return home, they all decide that they should go on a "date."  Tom gets a few hints from his mother that they are going to have some fun, and so he goes along with it. After the dinner, the young lady asks him if he wants a ride home, and his mother says,  "If you don't mind my saying so, we don't take a lot of passengers."  The old folks take

It does not waste a minute, and it is fun to watch. I found myself smiling, and not just because of the vampire, but also because of all the little things the film does right.   The film was made in 1970, and while the special effects are dated, they're still pretty good.  If you're looking for something a little different, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film about two men, who try to get through their lives without doing anything bad. It starts with a man (John Belushi) who wants to take a girl out to dinner. After that, the guy starts having some problems, like a friend's girlfriend is dating another guy. This guy (Dennis Quaid) is trying to have a normal day. Then, there is a crazy man (Darryl Hannah) who has no problems whatsoever. And then, the bad guy (Danny DeVito) comes in and just destroys everything, which is great.   I thought this was a great film. I don't know why it is so popular. I've seen it once and never heard anything about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those films where you are not sure if it's a science fiction movie or a comedy, but it's pretty much the first one. It's a film that doesn't feel like it's trying to be both, but rather a film where a lot of things are happening, but the story is not very interesting or gripping.   The film follows a woman who's working for a secret government agency that is looking to take over the world.  The woman in question is named Elsie, and she's one of the only ones who can see and understand what the "others" see. She's an odd one, though, and it takes a long time for her to learn how to use her power, and then there's the fact that she's working on a mission to save the world, which makes her seem very unimportant.  When she does discover her power though, it's in the form of a little blue girl, who has been raised by the government since she was a baby, and who is a little girl. She also happens to be an extremely skilled, but also very mischievous child, which Elsie immediately starts to see as a threat.  As the film goes on, however, the film begins to explore the other side of the coin, where Elsie is not the only one who can use her powers, and her mission is not to take the world over, but to save it.  Despite the problems with the story, the overall look of the film is very nice.  It's dark and has a lot going on, and there's a good amount of action in it, although I think that the story could've been made a lot more interesting and gripping with more time, which is something that I really liked about the film.  What I don't like about the movie, however is that it's almost impossible to tell how much of the movie is a comedy and how much is a serious story. It almost feels like the film tries to be all of the things at the same time, and while it's interesting to see the characters interact, I don�t think it's the best way to tell a story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it is a great film. It is a movie about two people, who have their own ways of living, but they also have something in common, they are both trying to survive the world they live in. One of them, a woman named Susan, decides to leave her husband and her home and live in a new city, but she has no idea where she is going. She is constantly trying to find a way to survive. She finds a job at a department store, and she becomes close to the man in charge, which is the most interesting part of the movie. The rest of the film is about her trying to learn more about the new city she is living in, and trying to make friends. There are also people she meets that help her, and in the end it is her life that is in danger. It seems to me that this movie is about a young woman who decides to move to a new town, but finds out there are things in this town she can't understand, and the things that she can understand are very different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was very well-done.  It took me a little while to get into the movie, as it's not as fast-paced as other sci-fi movies I've seen.  The story is set in a future where a "fracture" in the space-time continuum has left the Earth in a condition where it is only capable of sustaining a human life for a few weeks at a time.  This means that everyone in the world lives in their own little communities.   We are introduced to the leader of the colony, and the first person we meet in the movie is the doctor who is responsible for getting the children in the colony to school.  He is an interesting character, as he doesn't just want to make a living.  Rather he wants to give a human quality to the lives he gives his people.  When he first comes to the colony he makes a remark that is extremely strange.  "If the colonists can be treated this way then why not the whole of humanity?"  This is a very important point in the film.  For one thing it shows that the human race is far more advanced than we are.  Secondly it shows us that humans are more than just "primitives".  Thirdly it shows the potential for something better.  In the colony the children are able to play with all the other children in their class.  It's a very positive sign that they are able play with other children without fear of them running off and getting killed.  Unfortunately the children that are able live in peace with each other also need to make an effort to build relationships with other human beings.  One of the ways that this is done is by forming a "family".  It starts with the children playing together, before moving to more structured relationships.  These children have many friends and there are a number of adults that live in the city that help them.  The story is told by the children as they interact with their parents and the other adults.  But even with the other people in the story the story is about the children.    The movie starts off very good.  As I said the movie doesn't seem to be set in the future but in a period between the second and the third world wars.  We are introduced in the first scene to the children, the leader, and her father.  After that we see the first child die, the second child has a run-in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie.  It is a story about a small town in Pennsylvania.  It is set in the 70's.    The town has many old buildings, like the school, the old church, the store and the post office.  There are lots of old people who live here, and they are happy.  The one thing about this town is that they are still in the habit of drinking their tea with milk.  This is not just a little town, but a small one.  It is not much more than a thousand people, and even less is left of its past.  They say that the town is about to become more like the big cities, but that is a good thing.  So the town has a big old church and a school, but they do not have much to do with each other.  What this town needs is a little money, a little change, a good job.  In this town, a girl has the problem that she does not like her mother very much.  She lives with her aunt, and her mother lives with the doctor.  One day, the girl has an opportunity to have a new job, but she doesn't want to go.  Then she meets a man named Tom.  He has a beautiful voice, and she is attracted to him.  But her mother won't allow her to go with him, and Tom takes her with him. Then a great disaster comes and the town, and everyone in it, dies.  All of a sudden, Tom disappears.  When she looks for him, she finds a small, empty house, and he is nowhere to be found.  After that, the town seems to have changed.  Some of the old people have returned, and the old town has been saved.  I have a feeling that this movie was made as a tribute to the old folks of this town.  Maybe this is one of those movies you could watch at a bar or a picnic with your grandparents, just to enjoy the stories. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I'll give you the facts: there is a monster in the closet. A monster who comes out to eat you if you don't take the proper steps to kill him first. But it's not all bad. There is a wonderful monster in this movie, a nice man named Mike Myers. The first act is a bit slow, as the monster is introduced, and the film does a good job of setting up a solid first act. Mike's character is the kind of guy who makes you want to go out and get him, and I'm sure this was a good choice as it sets up a strong tone for the rest of the film. Then, the second act begins and the story takes a turn for the strange. This film is strange and scary, and you don;t see it coming. The film does have some of the typical "horror" elements that are so familiar to fans of the genre, such as the opening sequence and the monster that comes out and gets you. However, there are a number of interesting elements that I didn't really expect, such a scene where Mike has to hold down a girl and he's having a hard time doing so, and a really cool sequence where he has to get a kid to sit still. The music and sound effects are also great and give the film a great feel. The special effects are the best I've seen in a horror movie, and it shows how much effort went into them. There are also a couple of really great sequences that don't fit into the story at all, and they really set the tone for what happens after the monster comes out. Overall, this is a very entertaining and frightening film that I would recommend to fans and newcomers alike.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good thriller, not as good as the movie made by the same writer in the 90s but it's not bad. I didn't mind it but it wasn't really good and I don't know what was the point of it. The movie started out great with a great character and some cool stuff. Then we have this girl, who just happens to be the mother of the main character, that is why the movie keeps going. It starts out nice and then this other guy comes in that we don't really know and he's kind of an asshole. He is not really bad but it is the other guy that really makes things worse.   After a bit of time we are introduced to the main guy, who is the guy that is the one that kills the other man. The thing is, he does it because he is a killer, who will go through anything to get what he wants, even his life.  The other guy had to have something to kill and it looks like he is up to no good.  This guy was interesting and he seemed to be on the right track at the beginning of the movie.  However, by the end of the story we are left with nothing but a bad feeling in our stomach.  At one point, the guy kills a guy, but that guy had something to do with the murder and it didn't make sense.  After we get this guy out of the way we can see that the main dude is still alive and he has to make a decision about his life and that choice was not really clear.  It seemed that the movie was trying to tell the story about the guy and how the murder was related to him. It did tell a nice story but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I don' t know what it was about the story but I didn' t like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best kind of comedy, I think. I have to admit that I was expecting something much, much, MUCH worse than this. I was prepared for a movie full of cheap gags and a lame plot about a boy and his pet turtle who can only move forward if they do so in a straight line.   Well, the movie didn't disappoint. It's funny, and it's a cute, goofy movie that's worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had heard that the first part of the movie was set in a world where magic has been used since time immemorial, but the second part took place in a different time. The characters in the first were like those in a fantasy book, but they were not so childish that the story was hard to follow. The second part of this movie was more interesting, the characters were not as childish as in the previous movie, they were much more sophisticated. In addition, the story had an interesting climax and was interesting to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Saving Private Ryan" is a good old fashioned action movie that is full of action, but is also an excellent story. The action is pretty good. The movie is a story of the German army. The story is a little bit strange, but it makes up for it in the action. There are some interesting characters in the movie. It is a very good movie that deserves a place in any movie collection.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't remember where I first saw this movie, but I can remember it vividly.  It was on a school night, and I had been doing some homework.   One of the professors was giving a talk about a new book.  I remember sitting there in a chair in the back of the class, watching the lecture.  When the professor began talking about the book, he began telling a story about a woman who lived in the forest, where the air was so thin that her feet had a habit of sinking into the ground.  Her son was a very tall boy, and he would go off into the forest to find his mother.  His father was a hunter, and while he was away hunting, his son was supposed to go to the forest and find his father, but he did not go.  So one day, the boy came home, but there was no father.  It was the mother who was in the tree.  The woman was a bit mad at the boy, because he was not there to help her.  She then decided to leave the tree, but she did not know where she was going.  After wandering around the woods for a while, the mother noticed that there was a large tree that was taller than the rest.  There was a strange smell coming from the tree that scared her. She went up to the tree and asked the man inside.  "What is that smell?"  The man told her to sit down and wait for him to come out.  As she sat down, he asked her what she was looking for.  He then asked her if she had ever seen a large dog.  No, she replied.  Then he said that he knew a man who could help her find the man.  In the meantime, the man was walking out of the woods.  At the end of the road, he saw a woman in the trees.  They began talking.  Both women were in pain.  One woman had a broken arm, and the other woman was in terrible pain.    The men came back and found the women in great pain. The woman in pain was in agony.  A man named Hoss was tending to the woman.  Hoss looked at the woman and asked her to tell him what she needed.   The woman told him that she needed a new coat.  This time, she told Hoss that the new coat would keep her feet from sinking

I've seen this movie before, but I'm glad to see it again! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie is that it's a sequel to a movie from the 70's that I also saw in my youth.   And it's got an old man, who's name is "Rudy" (played by James Earl Jones) who's got a really bad back (and it's not just that, he's been in a lot of movies and they all end up getting re-made, I mean the "Indiana Jones" movies all end in the same way, with the villain's "back" exploding) and he's got to go to New York and he comes to the "Mountain" (a real mountain, not the movie version, where a bunch of people are riding on horses down a trail. ) And the guy he meets is "Evelyn" (Gloria Grahame) who is the wife of a guy named "Joe" (Raymond Burr), and Evelyn is kind of an odd character. She's the one that's constantly trying to "save" him, and when she finally does, it's the last thing he remembers. She wants him to come to New Orleans and she'll make it worth his while. But he's so mad about the whole thing, that he doesn't want to go, and he decides that he'll get over it by himself.  It's a pretty long movie (more than a little over an hour) and it doesn't get too complicated. But the film is pretty funny, and I like that it has this old guy in it, who still has a lot to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ending of this film is pretty damn fantastic.  I don't know if the final shot of the film is supposed to be the one we see in the credits, but it is pretty much the only time I can remember feeling anything other than elation.  One of the great things about this movie is that we are introduced to all these different characters, and then it cuts to the end of the movie.  The characters are all pretty great and the story is well told.    If you like sci fi, you might enjoy this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have the same characters in this movie:   The same two friends in a high school with the same problems:       - They both are very good friends but there are differences:  - In the movie, we see them at a bar and the only thing that they have in common is that they are both overweight.  - At one point, the guys get to talking and they both want to make a deal with a girl who has just broken up with her boyfriend.  So they decide to get her drunk, get in her car and drive her to a secluded area where they can have sex.  The girl agrees and they take her back to the apartment where they have sex while she is drunk.  They then take the girl back to their place and have sex again.  They have sex for about 30 minutes and the movie ends.     - The guy is a bad guy and the girl is a good girl, but the movie doesn't end there.  When the guys return home, they decide that they want to have a one night stand but they are interrupted by a girl that comes over to their apartment and starts to make out with them.  She is very drunk and very flirty and the guys think that they should have sex with her because she is so cute.  It is really funny watching the two guys trying to think of a way to get rid of her.  After a few hours of sex, they end up giving up and the guy realizes that he is gay.  The movie is a little too short and there isn't enough action in the movie.  But the humor is very good and I really liked the movie even though I didn't like the characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has all the makings of a good action movie, with the action scenes involving a group of cops and a couple of bikers. It doesn't go too deep into the subject matter and doesn't really offer any deeper meaning. It's basically a story of a couple who go into the drug business and get busted, and what happens is that they try to make a comeback and are captured by a Mexican drug lord. So you have a lot of cops, some good bad guys, and a good, bad and good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is the music.  It is so awesome that the film doesn't need to be anything more than a well-made movie about a guy who wants to be a big man on campus and has to find out just how far he can push it before he gets caught.  I enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Short" is a film that is very smart, funny and compelling.  The story of a bunch of smart people making some stupid mistakes in a big city is a good enough premise.  It is not really a bad film either.  It is the actors that are the real stars of this film.  This is a group of people that is made up of real geniuses.   You have to love the way these people work together.  They all have a different background but they all understand each other's personalities.    I really loved the way the film portrays their relationship.  I mean they are a group that is so smart they know how to work with each other, they all trust each other and they do things together.     I liked the way they all made jokes in the film. It is not an all too smart movie, but it is a very entertaining film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first hour or so is really slow, but that's how it has to be for a movie like this. The story is quite simple, but it's not really a bad thing. The movie starts out with a young woman named Anna (Jessica Sula) who has an unfortunate accident and is left in a coma for years. A few years later, her life has returned to normal. But the accident itself has had a big effect on her. Now, she can't remember much about herself. She can't even speak. Anna's mother (Janeane Garofalo) tries to keep her alive, but she's very frail. So, her father (Ralph Fiennes) takes it upon himself to help her out and take care of her, but he's not very good at it. He's not a doctor, but doesn't seem to be a very good person either. When Anna's parents discover that Anna is a genius, she is put into an institution, where she's given a huge amount of medical care. She also becomes a patient of a professor of neurology named Dr. John (Liam Neeson), who is also an accident victim. When John is diagnosed with a brain tumor, he is taken to the institute to receive treatment. The whole story has a very simple and naturalistic feel to it. It's not over the top, and is a bit more realistic than a lot of the films that we see nowadays. The only downside is that the plot gets a little convoluted at times, but then, it's only because of how slow the plot is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know about you, but when I hear the opening scene, I just burst out laughing. I thought it was a silly comedy at first, but then I got a better grasp on what was happening, and the movie kept getting funnier. This was a good idea, and it's hard to see how the movie ended up being a big hit, since there were a few problems with the plot, especially with the climax. The actors were all good, the direction was decent, and I just can't help but like this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had just gotten out of a really bad relationship. I was depressed and sad.    This movie changed my life.  It was like the movie The Wizard of Oz in the 70s. I just fell in love with the movie. I would give it 5 stars if I could.

It had some nice action scenes with the robots, it had some funny parts with the robot and the alien, and it had a good amount of character development. The action scenes were fun to watch. The alien was fun to play with. There are a few minor problems that come with this movie, and they don't ruin the movie. But it's still a good one to watch if you like science fiction.

I watched this movie a long time ago and I never forgot the kids running up the hills screaming as they saw something big and scary.  A really good movie.

There's so much blood. The water is so bad that it looks like a lake. I would never let my kids go in this movie. There was a guy who was stabbed in the eye with a spoon and his face is covered in blood. This guy is the best part of the movie. This movie would be better if it were made in the 80's instead of the 90's. This is just a watered down version of a classic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A classic comedy about two poor people, a rich guy and a poor guy who get into a lot of trouble. A little girl is kidnapped by the rich guy, who takes her to a place that is a giant maze. Then he gets a message from the girl telling him to take her to the moon. She goes into a room full of mirrors that look at her back, then she sees her parents and they're all dead. Then she sees a man in a spaceship with a big black gun, but he's not there to shoot her. Instead, he puts a little girl in a box with a man named George, then he takes her out of the box and tells her to follow him. She follows him into a place where he takes a knife and cuts the sky, and then he throws the little girl into the sky. So she flies up to the stars and he's gone. But there's another girl on the spaceship with him. And she's a good one. She's not a little thing like the girl who died. She can fly and she has a lot to say.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie that's like a sequel to "Tiger", but with less "Tigerman" and more "Mushroomhead".   The story is more or less the same as "TIGER" with some new twists and the same "villains".  It's more or slightly less like a different version of "Tigger".  There is one "villain" in this one, "Linda" (Hannah Fink), she is a drug addict who has an affair with the owner of a movie theater. Her name is a good one to describe her.   She is in a wheelchair and she is also in a coma from the drug addiction. She is also not very smart but she is very strong willed.  Linda has an ex-boyfriend who she has sex with a lot.  He doesn't seem to mind it.  She thinks that she is going to die from this drug addiction, but that isn't the case.  As the story progresses we get to know more and more about Linda and the other women in her life.  They seem to be the ones who are going to cause her problems.  "The Witch" is a very good movie. It's like an American version of a British TV show like "Mister X" or "Wuthering Heights".

The group decide to shoot the badass (who happens to be the leader of the group) and the film ends up in a shootout.  The result?  Two more men die, two more are injured and one gets shot in the leg.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie in a small theater in the old city of São Paulo and it was a great movie! This movie is really a very funny and really touching movie. It is a story about a man who is on the verge of death and decides to take a trip to the Amazon where he sees a river that is running under water and is inhabited by all kinds of animals. The man is very excited to go there because he is very curious about these animals and wonders what they are. After a while he begins to get the feeling that the animals are not friendly and are all afraid of him. He decides to keep a close watch on them because he knows that the closer he gets to the river, the worse things will happen to him. However, at this point he realizes that it will not be a long trip because the animals will attack him and he will die of his wounds. He is then saved by the river which takes him to a big village where the people are happy to have him in their village. They give him food and water. The people then tell him about the great power of the river and they give him a boat to travel on and a gun for protection. At first, the people seem to be very nice and they teach him the language of the animals. Eventually they begin to realize that he is a very special man and are very concerned about his safety. The village then decides to get him to the city of Belém, where the river takes him. When he reaches the city, he is able to speak the language and learns about the city. He tries to convince the people to let him stay in the city but they do not agree. The animals attack the city and kill all the men and women and they are all killed. The woman that he was living with was one of them and she is still alive because she is a healer and can help the animals with their problems. The doctor is one of the people who was killed. This movie was really well done and very well acted. The movie was very funny. I really loved this movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the animal world.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story:   I was at the movie theatre and it was showing a film called "The Dark Knight Returns". I don't know why but when it comes to a film based on the comic book that I love I always feel a bit like I'm being lied to.   This movie is all about the Bat-Man, the Batman. I don' remember the last time I saw a Batman film where the villain was a nice guy, a bit of a loner and had a wife and a child. That's how it is with Bruce Wayne. He's a quiet guy and the only one who can get his hands dirty. That and Batman is a man who can go from being a superhero to being a normal guy. I loved this film and it did a good job of portraying a Batman who can take care of himself and don't have to be the superhero.   of course Bruce has to fight crime but in the end it's just Bruce, a man in a cape and a cape who is the Batman, and that's the end of it. This is a shame because it is a very good film, but it really does feel like it was made to be a movie based on comic books. It could be a great movie, but I just wish it would have been made by someone who knows what they are doing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been a fan of horror movies for as long as I can remember. I first saw the movie in the early 90s and it stuck with me, but it was the sequels that really got me.  The first one, which I have seen a dozen times since then, had a great twist ending.    It was also one of the first horror films that I could identify with.  They were just as scared as I was and were probably a bit more twisted than me.  The second movie, "Bela Lugosi's Dead" also had a good twist ending and this one was even better.  It also has a great cast and it is one of those films where you get to see all the classic monsters come out in a fun way.  This is the kind of film that a young child can enjoy, and a young adult can enjoy.  If you like your horror films to be a bit strange, then this one is the one for you.  There are a couple of things I want to mention before I get to the review.  First of all, the movie is on DVD, and you can get it for a great price.  I don't recommend it to the less imaginative horror fans, as this is a lot more violent than most of the rest of the movies I've seen.  Secondly, there is a little bit of nudity.  Not that much, but some of the characters have a bit of cleavage and one girl in particular has some nice breasts.  Thirdly, there was a time in the late 80's when I was a teenager when I heard about this movie and I decided to check it out.  Now, I know it's been a long time since I've heard about it, but I'm surprised that I haven't seen it.  The one thing that I remember about the movie was how I was always afraid of the old man in the green suit.  He seemed like a creepy old guy, but also someone who I could sympathize with, like a father figure.  Of course, the most memorable scene from the movie comes from the old woman who gives a very convincing rendition of "The Bells of Rhymney."  I guess you can't really call it a remake of "Bella."  "Belsie" is just a different twist on a classic movie.  Overall, this is another great movie and one that you should check out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is pretty simple: a man who works for the government and wants to help the poor is killed by an assassin, so he tries to find the assassin, who is a priest. The plot may not sound very interesting to the average moviegoer, but it is a lot more than that. The story is told in flashback, and the flashback takes place during the Civil War, and is told through the eyes of a young soldier, named John Wilkes Booth, who had been a member of the Union Army. Booth is also a very good character, he is honest, hardworking, and intelligent, he's a man that you can trust, but is also an evil person. When the Civil war is over, Booth has no other option than to go to the north and take part in a rebellion against the government, which he succeeds in doing, he also has the honor to be a captain in the Union army, he becomes a general in the Confederacy, and becomes a wealthy man in the process. This movie is very much about the life of John Wilks Booth, and there is no other way to say it, the movie is absolutely brilliant in this aspect. The acting is all top-notch, and it is the best acting I've seen in a movie in a long time. All the main actors (not including the main villain) deliver excellent performances, and this is due to the fact that the movie was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and was a collaborative effort between him and a number of other Hollywood stars, the best of which are: Howard Keel as the leader of the Confederate forces, and Sam J. Jones as a young officer. The movie is also very good in the way that the plot is told. The characters are all different, and they are all interesting, there is a very well developed story, and very good acting. It is a bit disappointing that this movie doesn't get more praise, it is still an excellent movie, and deserves more than it currently has.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie. There are plenty of memorable scenes that will stay with you forever. The only problem with the film is that it starts off rather slow. The story takes us through a long road trip through the heart of the US. It is a little slow for some. I found myself wondering why it is that we need to travel so far to see some of the best music we have ever heard.   It was a beautiful ride, and I enjoyed every minute of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good action movie. I don't know why this movie didn't make it to the silver screen.  It is well-acted, and the story is a very well-done one.   I think the best part of the movie is the chase scene.  The movie is about the guy who steals a car, and then it is revealed that the car is actually a motorcycle.  Then he steals the bike, and that's the movie.  This movie has many good scenes and many good action scenes.  I think this is one of the best of the 80s action movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good movie. I can't find any fault with it. It is very well acted. The special effects are really good. The action scenes are well done. The plot is a lot like "The Man with No Name" with the same kind of people who are living together and doing things they normally wouldn't do. This movie is really funny. There are some good songs in this movie. The ending is a little abrupt, but that's the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The first thing that I noticed about this movie was that the camera work was absolutely spectacular. I thought I'd never get used to how great the camera was because it was such a departure from the first movie. That's not a bad thing at all because it really doesn't matter what a movie is about if the camera isn't going to be able to pull it off. This movie is a beautiful love story about two very different people. It's got a little bit of everything: a little romance, a little humor, a lot of drama, and a lot more action. In the end, the story just comes down to the fact that these two people can't stop falling in love. I was so in love with both of these characters that I just wanted to know what would happen next. I guess that's the power of the love story: you don't know what the ending is going to hold until you've seen the movie over and over again. _____________________________________________________________ -A- _____________________________________________________ I don't think there's a better love story than this one. I don;t think there are any better movies about love. This is a movie about two people falling in and out of love. It doesn't go about it that way. It just is. It also has a lot to say about friendship and love and what it means to be alive. ___________________________ -B- ______________________________ This movie will change your life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was great!  The best movie I've seen in a long time.  I'm glad to see that they don't want to just do another action movie like every other movie.  In the end, the only bad thing about this movie was that the ending sucked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a big fan of horror and suspense, so I'm not surprised that the first installment of the new 'Twilight' trilogy is going to be the best one. It is really a great adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's novel. I'm sure that it will be an instant classic, because it is so well made. It really brings to life the fantasy and the darkness of the books. The acting is superb and I don't even like horror movies as much as I like Stephenie Mckenna. It's hard to describe, but there is a little bit of everything. It has all the elements you expect in a horror movie: the darkness, the supernatural, the monsters, the horror movie.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the movie was shot on location in Iceland, which I find very exciting. The landscapes are stunning, the architecture is gorgeous, the costumes are fantastic and the production values are superb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Somewhere in between a horror movie, a comedy, and a thriller, The Babadook is a dark, spooky, and haunting movie, full of creepy imagery and a great soundtrack."   The Babadooks, by Jennifer Kent (2012)  "The Babadaook" is the first of two movies made by Jennifer's husband, Richard, with the help of his young son. The Babadaooks are a group of children who have all gone missing after the sudden death of a family friend.  Their mother, who had previously been a victim of child abuse herself, has to deal with a very unstable and hostile family. The children have been raised in a strange, secluded environment, and they find out that it's not long before their fears and paranoia get the best of them. ,  It's a nice idea, and the movie works pretty well as a thriller. The screenplay is well written and the direction by Jonathan M. Goldstein (the director of The Babar) is a little too "hokey" at times. However, it is not a bad movie by any means. The film is very suspenseful and has a lot of tension. I think the movie is best when the audience is not sure what to think or how to feel about it. The only thing I wish they had done better is some of the performances in this movie are a little lackluster. The characters are really the stars of this movie. There are several interesting parts in this film that really are worth a watch. The cast is pretty good, especially the kids, and I really wish that they had been given a little more screen time. I also wish that the film had been longer, since it really starts to get scary towards the end.   What really makes the movie stand out for me, is the music. I really like the score, and although it is very dark and scary, it also has a great deal of light and humor. I actually really like how the movie ends, and it gives the audience a nice little moment to breathe. It's a good, simple, yet effective ending to a good story. The movie really does make me feel uncomfortable at times, and is very scary at others. There is a scene that I really enjoyed in this one where the kids find a very dead body. This one scene really really gives the movie an edge, and makes me think that the whole movie could have been more scary
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about the life of a real, real, really-real person. He's a man who lost his job and was forced to live in the park with his dog and his mother. I won't get into the plot details but I will tell you that this movie is not a bad one at all. I would say that this is a really good movie with great acting, animation, sound, and story.

I liked this movie a lot, and I hope you will like it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of the film is set in a world where vampires are real. There are a number of vampiric individuals, who are called "The Seven" and who are on a quest to kill the vampire king, the most powerful vampire of them all. As the story unfolds, the seven are able to take on the vampire's leader, and win the battle, thus saving the world from a terrible threat.  However, in a cruel twist, this brings about a new threat, a new and powerful vampire who is able to transform into a giant monster.  The plot is very similar to the previous movie, but the story is much more enjoyable.   This is a nice horror movie that will make you think a little bit about your own morality. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie to watch.  The music is great and the acting is good, and the story is good.    The movie is about a high school boy and his friends who play a game to try to win a contest, which is a "game" of "he who has the most balls."     The game is not very good, but the boy is very competitive.  It is interesting that he can play the game with just his hand.  His friends are nice, but he is just very competitive and he is very mean to them.  One of the boys is very shy, and he tries to get over it, but it is hard.  This movie is a lot of fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The Godfather Part III is a superb sequel to one of the most acclaimed films of all time, with a score to match. Â I'm not a huge fan of Francis Ford Coppola's movies, but he has a way with actors that I just love.  Carmen Ejogo is excellent as Sonny, and as is the case with so many of his movies, he's in a world of his own.    The Godfather III is my favorite Francis FordCoppola movie, but it's also my least favorite.  The plot is much more interesting, and the music is more inspired.  But the film is a bit rushed, and some of the dialogue is a little ridiculous.  Still, this is a wonderful, thrilling and well-acted film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film itself is a very good example of the kind of genre filmmaking that came to a head with this one, and the movie does so well that one might even forget it's a parody and simply appreciate it as a good old fashioned genre film.   It's an enjoyable film, but I don't think that it's the masterpiece of the genre that it was meant to be, but a good, if somewhat shallow, comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure why I'm so excited about this film. I was disappointed by the ending (and the movie as a whole) and was left a little underwhelmed. The movie does not attempt to be a serious film, it is instead a lighthearted and silly film that makes a few fun jokes.  A fun film that is very much a "comedy" film.    The characters are all fun and the movie is just about the comedy of it all.  This is a fun little film that I would recommend to anyone who likes a little bit of a comedy.

The only problem I had with this movie is that it's just too slow, but this movie has so much going for it, from the great acting to the gorgeous scenery.  This movie is great fun, so if you're a fan of science fiction and space adventures, I'd recommend giving this a try.

I watched the movie with my parents and they were both very surprised with what they saw. I have seen the movie many times and have never been more in love with a movie than I was with this one. It really is a beautiful story about a man who loves his wife more than anything else in the world, a beautiful young girl who loves him even more than she loves herself, and the two children who want to be just like their father. I really did enjoy the film, I loved the music and I loved everything about it. I think that it is definitely one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The movie starts out with a pretty decent and not too long opening scene, with a lot of people walking around and a few of them holding hands. It seems like this film is trying to be more than it is and tries to be a romantic comedy with a heavy focus on the relationship between the two leads, although, as the film goes on, we realize that the film is more like a romantic drama. However, the relationship doesn't get much more interesting. This is mainly because the relationship has a lot to say about the nature of love, but it's very much limited in scope and doesn't really go in any of the usual romantic comedy territory. Â Also, we see that the relationship is a little bit out of control, and at times, there are scenes in which the two are very close, but they are so brief that it doesn't make the relationship any more believable.    The movie takes a while to get going, but once it does, the movie quickly becomes one of the most interesting romances in recent memory.  This is the kind of romantic movie that I love to watch, as it is an interesting look at two people that really love each other, but don't know how to express that love.  The movie is well paced and has a really interesting story.  It's a romantic movie and it's got a lot going on, but in spite of this, it doesn the things I love in romances. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most visually striking movies I have ever seen.   This movie is an example of how to do a horror movie right.  One minute we see a very attractive blonde with an attractive smile and a perfect body in a small apartment. She is surrounded by dead men in a very creepy way and she is being followed by a male character who is always in the room with her.  The next scene is very much like a classic ghost story where the victim is being hunted by a ghostly figure.  There is one part in this movie where we see the killer and the victim.  They are looking at each other and he is whispering something into her ear.  It is very creepy and it makes you think this could be a real life case.  But there is more and there is much more to this story.  I am not sure why this movie is so successful in Hollywood.  We are told about this beautiful girl, and she starts to make some calls in her hotel room and that is when she has to go to the bathroom.  This is a horror story and it is scary.  You will have to watch this movie at night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited to see this film and was hoping to be impressed with it. I was not. I thought it was very boring and not very funny at all. I don't think it's the director's fault. The cinematography and music is very good but I just don't get it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting little movie, but sadly not a movie for everyone.   The plot is very simple and only somewhat well written.  A bunch of criminals (the movie calls them "crooks") rob a bank and are caught.  They are sentenced to prison and, while in prison, one of the crooks tells his story.  One of the other crooks (played by a young Steve Martin) is on his way to get married and has to make his way across the country with his new wife.  He is stopped by the crook who has an old girlfriend and asks for a ride.  The girl has no idea what the guy wants and takes him for a while.  Later, while waiting to be married, the guy comes across a girl named Della and, since he is not married, he takes her for a walk.  It is not long before the two start having sex.  After this, they are married.  Unfortunately, things go from bad to worse.  I was disappointed by this movie.  This is a movie that will appeal to people who like to see movies where the bad guy is a bit of a wimp.  Some people will like it, some will not.  There is also a "horsing around" scene that was pretty much pointless.  In a way, I would say this is a good comedy.  But I also think that the characters could have been a bit better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a western. There are many, many westerns. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (also called The Good to Bad, the Uglies to Good and the Baddies to Bad) is a good western. I'm not going to say that every western is good, every western does its share of bad and I would be lying if I said that The Good, the Bad, and the Stupid didn't have a couple of bad scenes, but it isn't a bad movie in the least. The movie starts with a fight. Two bad guys, one of which is the star of the movie, shoot up the bad guys. The bad guys are the baddest dudes in the west. They shoot up a bad guy. He's knocked out. We cut to a doctor who's trying to fix the bad guy's arm. The doctor tells the bad dude that he's been shot. The good guy then tells the doctor to tell his wife. We get another scene, this time with the doctor telling the good guy to get the gun. The gun is then found by the bad man. He shoots the bad actor and the bad bad guy gets shot too. The scene ends with a big explosion, which is pretty funny. The Bad Guy says, "I'll tell you what, I don't think we can trust any of them anymore." He then tells his wife to tell the doctor that she loves him. The woman says, "...I do. You know I love you. And I love everything about you." The Bad guy says, (he's a bad bad bad man), "Well, I'll love you too." They go off to a cabin. We then cut to the doctor who is fixing the bad men's arm and the good men who are trying to shoot him.  They can't because the bad gun doesn't work. The man who is the bad boy says, he doesn't think the bad boys gun works. The old man says, the good boy has a gun.  The Good To Bad  The Good To Stupid  The Uglie To Good  The Baddie To Stupid

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a huge fan of the "Star Wars" movies, I loved all of them.  When George Lucas first started working on the series, he was in search of a way to tell the story of the Jedi.    He wrote a number of stories about this but could never get it right.    He came up with the idea of telling the story through a series of comic books and decided to use the old stories of Luke Skywalker as a template.  There were two issues released in this series and both were good.  The first issue had a little bit of a different feel to it than the rest of the series.  It was more "The Shadow of the Cat" with Luke and the Dark Side of the Force.  I liked that one a lot.  A second issue with the same story was released in 1980 and I really enjoyed it.  This is the first of the prequel trilogy and I believe that it is the best of the three.  In a nutshell, it is a great story of Luke and a good representation of the characters.  What I like best about this series is that it shows Luke's journey in his early years and Luke's feelings toward his parents.  Luke's story is the most important and this is the only prequel series that tells it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that had me crying at the end.   The film follows a small time drug dealer and his girlfriend who both are being held hostage by a large gang of thugs who want the drug money for themselves.  Their hostage situation only gets more tense when the gang decides to kill the couple instead of paying the ransom.  One thing that I like about this film is that the characters are real people with all the trappings of a typical gangster movie.  However, it still manages to surprise and shock.  This is a good little movie that should be watched with the lights off.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies and is into good movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a number of times, it's a solid movie, good acting, funny, a good soundtrack, and a good time. The movie is set in a town in Ohio called Coney Island, it is a town of immigrants, the movie has a very good cast of people, the cast includes Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin.   The movie is about the two men that come to Coney island. The first man is a black guy named Bill Wilson, he is a good looking guy, and he wants to go to C.I. to work in a hotel, the second man is called Johnny Torrio, and is a poor guy, he lives on the streets, and has a wife and kids, he tries to make a life on Coney, but it's hard, and the people are tough, they want what they want, and if you don't have it they will take it from you.   the two are good friends, and they have a good life together. But when a woman tries to get into Bill Wilson's hotel, Johnny Torri wants to protect Bill Wilson and tries to stop her. The other people try to help them, but they don't know what to do.  ....   If you like a good laugh and some good acting then you should try this movie, if you have not seen this one, then I suggest you go to your local video store, and rent it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had it all, and in a good way.  The writing was great, the acting was great.    The plot was interesting and I think it would be interesting to watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     There's really not much to say about this movie. It's just a really short and very good movie. The story is about a young man named John McPhee (played by John Carradine) who is living with his mother who's a single mother. He is going through a tough time and finds comfort and joy in his girlfriend (played beautifully by a very young and talented actress named Jane Curtin). When John's girlfriend falls ill, John leaves her and moves to a small town where his new girlfriend is going to live with her mother. John is also not happy with the new girlfriend, and tries to break up with her by threatening her and her mother with a gun. The only problem is that the gun is a toy and a toy can't kill you. In fact it's a bad movie and is very dull and uninteresting. It is so boring that I could watch this movie for an hour and a half and I'd never get more than about 10 minutes of the movie. I don't like the ending either. It just doesn't add anything. John McNeil is a very good character, and it is a pity that this movie is only worth about 2 hours of your time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. I think it's a really good movie and I think a lot of the people who didn't like the first movie like the second one. I am really glad that they have a new director on the set. I was so sad that the actor that played this movie is no longer around. He was great and had a great character in the first one. He played a good guy in the second. This movie was great! The special effects were really good and I like how they made it look like the ship went by Jupiter and back. The music was really good as well. This is a great movie and a great director. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good space movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You know how you hear about some old folks in the backwoods who go into a house in the middle of nowhere, drink a bit of whisky, and play old time music? That's what this movie was about. The story was good. I think it was a pretty good time. The dialogue was well chosen and well delivered. I enjoyed this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not really a huge fan of the zombie genre. It has its charms, but there's a little too much of it in the end, I don't think it can be good without a little restraint, and even then, the plot seems to go off the rails quite a bit.   The story is about a group of people who have been infected with a virus that turns people into zombies.  This leads to a number of problems. First of all, the film starts out with some pretty lame special effects, which are only improved in the second half of the movie.  The plot is really weak, and not a single bit of it is really coherent.  It's more about setting up the characters and letting the zombies come to them, and then getting to the climax of the story.  Even though the plot is weak, the action scenes are great, and really make the zombie element interesting.  I can't say much about the acting, but they're good, and it's all in the dialogue.  So what really makes this film good is the acting.  There's some really good performances in this, and I was surprised by some of them.  But I can definitely see why the movie has some fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun movie to watch. It was a movie that I really enjoyed and I hope it gets more attention. It has a lot of humor and it was pretty good. I like the idea of a movie called "Seduce and Destroy" and I liked how it was just a little bit darker than a lot that came before it. The cast was really good.   I'm sure that there will be a sequel in the future.

The plot was good with an intriguing mystery. I like that the movie isn't just a simple movie. This movie has some very good ideas. The character design was great, and the movie was well done. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an interesting mystery movie, and I certainly recommend it to those who enjoy the suspenseful part of a mystery movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you think of a horror movie, you think either of a group of four men in black suits walking around the woods killing random people or a bunch of people who go on a trip in the woods and are slaughtered by the killer in black.    I went to this with the hope of being in a group where I would feel like I was part of something and not some random person walking around in a forest.  There were times when I would find myself sitting in the chair and looking up and down and just staring out the window.  I don't remember a lot of the movie but I remember the ending.  It's not a good ending but it's a good way to end the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I were watching a movie that was really good and had some nice action scenes. The movie was about an old man and his son and how they were trying to survive in the world that they had left. The father had a beautiful wife and son and was very good looking and the son was a little boy who was very cute. The old man loved them and was trying to teach them the right way to live in the old world and the world they had come from. One of the scenes in the movie was of the old man having a conversation with his son, he was trying not to laugh as he talked with his child about the old days and how things used to be and how bad it was and how he was so happy to have the children. The scene ended and the old couple was getting ready to leave. The son was telling his father that his father is gone and that he is not going to miss him. The daughter who was standing behind them asked her father if he is going to go with them. The man replied that he will go. The boy then said that he didn't want to go to the old place but he wants to stay at the new place and be with his father. The girl said that she will go with him and her father replied that she can stay at his place as well. The last scene showed them getting into a car and driving off in the sunset. The only problem with the movie is that it was very slow and very boring to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An awesome film about a man that lives in a small town and has a great job working for a small paper. The next day he is given a big job by the local newspaper. His first assignment is to write an article about the new town mayor who has just moved in. After some time of working hard and putting his family first, the new mayor and his wife are having a very close relationship. His new wife has been a teacher for years and his first love is his job. The rest of the film is about the tension between the two as they try to get along, even when the new Mayor has a very unhealthy relationship with a local woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a little trouble with the subtitles (or at least, I thought so at the time). I am not a native English speaker, so I had to make a few translations. But it turned out pretty good. I found the movie quite interesting. There was a lot of action, a lot going on in the background and on the screen. I liked the movie a lot, even though it wasn't my favorite of the series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this movie, it reminded me a lot of The Thing, another movie that was kind of "frighteningly original" and that's what I liked about it.  It's a very interesting idea that takes you to a very alien place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of the plotline in this movie seems like a copy/paste of other "action movie" subgenres of the past. A large group of men and women try to get the attention of the girl (a young girl named Alice) by any means necessary. Unfortunately, the girls in the movie don't always get the best of us. There is a lot of violence in this film, especially when the guys are attacking a group of young girls. Some of the girls are very attractive and some are very not. I guess that the only good thing about this movie is that it was filmed in Japan and not in a Hollywood studio.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie and a great sequel. The film is a little on the slow side in the first half, but then it picks up steam. The plot revolves around a group of people who discover that a mysterious man, who has died and is now a ghost, is actually the god of a small town. The people of this small town believe he is their savior and when he's not, he has the power to turn their town into a ghost town.   I can't say enough about this movie. It's great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't like to say that a movie is a "bad movie" if it isn't a bad movie. This one isn't bad. It's good, but it's not "bad."   There's some good scenes in this movie. The writing is very clever and the characters are very well drawn.   It's a short, and it takes a while to get going.  But once it does, the story is a classic.  It has great acting, a great script, and a very clever plot.  The ending is a cliffhanger, but that doesn't detract from the movie at all.  I think this movie is very much worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The first part of the film is very good, showing the life of a young man who is a fan of the American westerns of the time. The first act is set in an unnamed country, where the hero has to defend his home town from a band of bandits. The bandits are the kind who wear a bandana on their heads and carry a pistol. The film does not take itself too seriously, so the young man is able to get himself out of a scrape without killing anyone. The second act shows the young hero travelling to the other side of the world to meet a woman who was a childhood friend of his. This time he must deal with a more powerful bandit force, and must also deal with the other hero in his crew, who has gone AWOL. The final scene shows the hero with a bandanna on his head and with a pistol in his hand. "   The second part of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is a real classic, not only because it has some great fight scenes, but because it is a fascinating story about a group of people, who are divided by their common interest: money. They meet at a casino, where one of the men decides to gamble away his money, and the others are forced to pay him back. They are all in a hurry to get home so they can go on with their lives. There is a bit of sex, and a couple of sex scenes, and we get to see the people who live the good life, all the way from a girl who is very beautiful and a very wealthy man. All in all, this film is a good film, with a great script, a great cast, and is filled with great action scenes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great adaptation of a comic book story about a boy, Jack Kirby, who creates his own superhero. Jack Kirby made an excellent comic book in the 1940s about a kid who becomes a super hero. In this movie, Jack takes his superhero name, The Human Torch, and goes around the world on a world tour. He meets various other superheroes and saves them from various dangerous situations. In the end, he has to return home to the United States to get his girlfriend back, because she left him for some reason. This movie will bring back a lot of childhood memories for a lot Americans, because the main character is so likable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Posted by John on May 17th, 2010   I think it's a good idea for a movie, but it wasn't really what I was expecting it to be. It was very much a love story, and it had me wanting more, but at the same time it was a little bit depressing. I don't know how much it's worth, but I think I would have liked to have seen more of the story, more of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not looking forward to the third film, and not only because I didn't know if I would enjoy it, but also because it seemed that the film was trying to be "realistic" about how people live, and when I first saw it, I thought that it was a little over the top, but it was still a good film.   The film is set in the 1950s, and focuses on the lives of two couples: a married couple (Martha Stewart and Stewart Granger), and a married woman and a single man (Richard Conte and Henry Mancini).   They all have their problems: the single man wants to go out with a young woman (his niece) and he is a little too "boyish" for her; the married woman has a husband who is not supportive of her; and the married couple is having problems. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Babe" is one of those "one shot" movies you can watch over and over again and never get bored.  It's a little slow at times and the ending is pretty cheesy (but it was pretty awesome in the movie), but it's still very entertaining.  The movie is set in a little town called Little Rock, Arkansas.    Babe is a girl who has to live at the local train station with her grandmother and aunt (who is actually a pretty decent person).     The only reason the family even has a place to live is because of a man who died and left a wife and two kids in Little Rock.  When they first moved in, they weren't happy about their new home, but the kids didn't understand why the man didn't come back for them.  Once they get to know the man, they find out why he left.  In the end, the man makes his way back to Little Rock to take the kids with him (and the wife) to a place where he can die happy.  As he dies, the kids try to kill him, but he saves them and they become his heirs.  It's a really sweet movie that you can't stop watching.  The music is also pretty good (if you like the old school, then you will enjoy this movie).  In the end (well, at least the first half), we get to see the family grow, change, and try to get their lives back together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was one of the best I've seen in a while. It's a thriller and a little bit of a love story. It is also a very realistic look at the world of war. I had to watch this on TV in my living room while my wife and I were having a romantic night in my basement with a bottle of wine, some cigars and a blanket. We were both very tired, but were having the time of our lives. The movie itself was very well acted and directed. The acting was excellent and they made it seem like there was no real reason for the war. It made you think, and the way it was presented was perfect. I also really enjoyed the love story that was portrayed in this movie. I think it was a perfect movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. This is one of the best action films of the 90s and it's worth a watch. There are several great action scenes in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a fan of films about people who make mistakes, or people who go through the process of change and growth. I am not so much of a fan, however, of those who are merely victims. I have no doubt that some of these people are very well aware of their faults, and I respect them for it. However, I think the film, in its treatment of them, is a little off. I mean, we are given a lot of time to sit around and watch these people make mistakes. But at the same time, we have no idea what they have actually done wrong, or what is really wrong. For example, one woman has been accused of being a murderer. What happened to her before the murder? Who knew about it? Who did it? How long had she been doing it? I really don't know. What is also a little odd is that a few of these characters actually seem to be the ones who should have gone to jail. The woman who was the mother is actually one of the most despicable characters in this film. I don't think that this woman deserves to live in a world like this. She is clearly evil, and she is a complete failure as a mother. I also don't understand the way she is able to get a child to do what she wants, which is not to tell the truth, or to look out for the safety of others, but to take money and to have sex. She knows she is in trouble, but she does it anyway. I can't imagine how a mother could be so evil that she could allow her daughter to have such a relationship with another man. I really want to say something about the scene where she is walking with the little boy and she stops him and tells him that if he does not do what he is told he is going to have to go home. Then, in the next scene, the boy is walking home with his girlfriend and she tells him to stop. She doesn't understand what he has done wrong. It is as if she doesn't know what is going on. She only has a sense of guilt and shame and she wants him to do exactly what he says he is doing. But what he tells her is not what he really is doing, and it is impossible to explain why it is not. I was also annoyed by the scene when the mother was telling her story. She has no idea how to explain anything she is saying to anyone. She talks about all
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! I found the story and the characters to be excellent and the action was exciting. The plot wasn't that complicated but I thought it was worth a look. It wasn't a movie for everyone. It is quite dark and there are some gruesome scenes that would make some parents very upset.   One of my favorite scenes is when the girls try to hide from the evil witch. I loved the way they reacted to the evil. They are very brave and never give up on the quest for justice. I also loved how the girls went after the evil as they did the other kids. I really liked how they got revenge on the witch. They got revenge.   the ending is the best part of the movie. I will always remember the scene when the evil girl is in the house and the evil kids come out to chase her. It was very cool.  ,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a couple of good movies about dinosaurs, so I was not expecting much from this one, but I think it is a very entertaining movie.   The movie starts with an interesting and somewhat confusing sequence.  It is obvious that the dinosaurs are not all that friendly and they are also not very good at communicating.  I can't imagine this movie making a lot of money.  As it is, I think the dinosaurs should have been made extinct by now.  What's good:      A fun movie. It is a little different from other movies about giant prehistoric animals.  The dinosaurs are fun to watch and the special effects are pretty good.  These are some of the best dinosaurs I have ever seen.  They have all the characteristics that are so cool: they are big, they are smart, they eat people, they live in water.  This is a good one to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the idea of an old man living with his granddaughter, who was a little girl when she was a baby.  They are both retired, and they have a little daughter now, and their grandchildren.  The Old Man lives with a granddaughter, and she is the one who brings him the news about the death of his wife.    She has the old man read his will, which contains a stipulation that he will not marry.  The old man is angry at his granddaughter for not letting him get a divorce, but she tells him that he can do it if he just does something about the children, who are all adults now.  He does that, and he gets a divorce with a daughter.     He has an affair with a beautiful woman who is his daughter's sister.  They get married, and it is a big deal for the old men.  But they live in a very different time, in a country where homosexuality is still a crime, and the son of the old woman is gay.  It is a very good movie about old age and loneliness.  I also enjoyed the way the old guy talked about his granddaughter.

The only problem is that the mine is going to run out in a year and the mine owners don't like to leave anything to chance.  If they can find a way to save the mine they might find a fortune and maybe one day the boy can be a hero like his hero.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies.   I'm pretty sure this is the only movie about the JFK assassination where there isn't a real assassination scene (it's all faked).   The movie is pretty good, and I really enjoy the story.  This movie is a good one.  It's a nice story about a very smart young man, who has just lost his father, and his mother is in a nursing home.  The young man goes to visit his father in a hospital.  After visiting his father the young man realizes that he is dying.  He tries to make his father remember how to be a father to him, and how to love him again.    I found the story to be interesting and the movie to be very well made.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in history, JFK assassination, and the JFK story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story follows the life of a small town girl named Kay, who grows up with a loving mother and a big brother who is only interested in her. When Kay's mother is killed in a car crash, her father sets out to find her killer. Kay begins to realize that something is very wrong with her father. This movie is definitely worth watching and has a good ending. The only reason this film doesn't get a 5 is because it's a little slow at times.   Favorite Scene: Kay's mom talking to the kids on the playground   I'll end this review with one last quote from this movie: "This world is an unforgiving place, and the people of this world are the worst. It's the only place we can live in and it's the worst place we could possibly live in. There's something about a beautiful mother, a loving father, and a loving brother that will bring you peace and happiness."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-acted, well-written movie.   It tells the story of a man and a woman, played by the two best actors in the business.  The story has an almost unbelievable quality, and the characters are all so real and believable.  And it is hard to believe that the movie was made in 1951, when the country was still in the grips of McCarthyism.  As it happens, the McCarthyites were more successful than their liberal counterparts in the 1950s.  It was a time of many political battles.  While most Americans were protesting against the war, McCarthy's Senate hearings were a national sensation.  When the film was shown in 1950, the hearings were still going on, and McCarthy's enemies had yet to make the charges they would later make against him.  But it is impossible to say how much of the movie has been altered since then.  In 1951, there were still plenty of people who didn't like McCarthy, who thought his accusations against the Democrats were overblown.  Perhaps, some of them even considered McCarthy a paranoid.  There were still many people who thought McCarthy was crazy, and who believed his wild accusations.  Certainly, it is no accident that in the movie McCarthy is so obviously not crazy.  If he had been, the movie would have been much more believable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this on my birthday, a Saturday. It was a Saturday and a rainy one as well. The movie starts off with a man running on the beach, a woman yelling in the background: "Don't come over there, I know you want to go swimming!" He's about to get hit by a boat full of kids, but then, a strange woman comes out of the water. Her skin is completely pale and she has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. She's like a goddess. She talks to the man and they kiss. The woman then swims away and the kids follow her. The man follows her and the next thing you know, they are in the woods. She has a knife and he doesn't have a gun. The kids are trying to help him, but he's afraid to let them help him. They eventually get him to the boat and he drowns. The next morning the woman comes to the beach to find the man's body. Her eyes are red and bloodshot. He looks exactly like the man who she fell in love with. She says she is very disappointed in him. She leaves and the boy goes to the woods with the girl and the girl's husband. She tells the man that she was very disappointed and that she wanted to stay with him. The boy asks the man to marry her, but the man says he will never marry her. He tells the boy that he is going to marry the girl. The girl looks over at the man she fell for and tells him that he's the love of her life. The end. The guy is a total asshole, but it's pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new breed of film maker has been born in Hollywood and it's a movie maker who has seen and done it all. He's been making films for over 30 years now and has worked on some of the most famous and loved movies in Hollywood such as Grease, Rocky, Back to the Future, Jumanji, Superman, The Usual Suspects, and so many more! In the 80s, director John Landis made a movie that would be called "The Muppet Movie" but it was so much more than that. It was a movie about the power of human imagination and the power to inspire. It had a message and a story that had an impact. It showed how a small group of individuals can change the world and the lives of millions of people in a matter of a few hours.   It was the most influential movie of the 80's.  The movie will make you laugh, cry, smile and smile some more.  John Landís voice is so powerful and the lyrics are so funny, clever and moving.  You have never heard a voice so perfectly matching a melody and the emotions of the words. John Landiss is such an original talent and a true genius.  If you haven't seen it yet, go and watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.  - August 29, 2009Great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie, it is hard to believe that a movie like this could have been made in the 20th century. I loved the idea and the direction of this movie, the actors were so good that it made me smile, and I laughed out loud at several of the jokes.  I really liked the idea of a world where all the people live in huge floating cities called "suns" which have huge, floating platforms above them.    This is a movie where the best scenes involve a young girl who is having a bad day and then there is a scene where the moon explodes, killing everyone on the planet.  This movie has so many things going on that it is difficult to figure out which scenes are good and which scenes need some more editing.  The story is told through a lot of flashbacks that give us little bits of information about what is happening, like a young boy who lives on a floating city called "the sun" and is being punished by his parents for a terrible mistake.  I also like the way the movie is set up.  There are several parts where we can see different parts of the planet and see what the people do, so it is like a little mini movie.  While this movie has a lot going on, it still manages to keep a good pace.  One of the things I liked about the movie was that there was a lot that was explained about the sun and the floating cities.  Some of the scenes were so ridiculous that I laughed and others I just had a hard time watching.  It was interesting to see how different people think about the world around them, and the people on the sun really did seem so different.  If you like science fiction and science fiction stories, I think you will like this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â This is a nice little movie that's worth watching. Â The director, David DeCoteau, is a wonderful writer.  I love the way he can make a scene and then immediately go back to his other characters to have them play it out and then make a joke about it.    This movie is funny and really entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'd rather be the bad guy than the good guy"  That's what the bad guys in the movie "Dirty Harry" are all about.  They want to be a good guy, but their real bad guy nature is exposed when they kill a good man.    "What's the matter with you?"   This is one of those movies where you can't help but be drawn into the action.  It's a really entertaining movie.  I can't wait to see the sequel, "Dumb & Dumber to come out"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing wrong with this movie.  It is not the most original of the '90s and not the finest of the new millennium.  I know that sounds silly.    But it is very true.  It is the story of a guy who has to go back to the past to stop the evil from destroying our present and our future.  There are no aliens.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  The characters are all in their early 20s and have been around for a while.  Some of them are really funny and are in the lead roles.  Others are annoying and their lives are boring.  They all come across as people with no sense of humor.  This isn't a bad movie, it is just bad.  But at least it is good.  If you are looking for something new, then go to this movie, if you are someone who likes to see bad movies, then just skip it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Day the Clown Cried" is the latest installment in the long running "Cabbage Patch Kid" series. The story follows the day-to-day life of Max, a young clown who has to deal with the antics of his neighbors, the eccentric Grumpy Old Man, the obnoxious Lumpy, and the lazy little boy, Billy the Kid. It is a pretty good little movie and I have to say that this movie has not been done before, and I like it. The animation is a bit dated but that is not a bad thing. The songs are pretty good, I particularly like the song in the end credits. This movie is fun and has some pretty good laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** The original was a masterpiece and this sequel is nothing but a mediocre copy. There are no twists, no sub-plots, and no characters that are worth caring about. The main character is a dumb-ass. The story is about a group of girls who have been trapped in a haunted house. There's a monster that appears, and it's the only character in the film. It's kind of interesting to watch the girls try to get out, but it's just a stupid story with no real plot. I don't think it's as bad as it sounds, but I don' think it was even intended to be as bad. ********************** If you're looking for a cheap horror movie, look no further. *********
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie.  It is a very simple story with a great protagonist.   She is a young girl, in the early days of the war, who meets a young man who is a prisoner in a German concentration camp.  They become lovers and fall in love.  This is the only love story in the film, and I found it quite moving.  The characters in this film are very believable.  There is no "bad guy" in this story, just bad men who make poor decisions.  I also like the use of music and sound effects in this movie, it helps the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most of the "silly" movies that are made nowadays, "Risky Business" is just a lot of funny dialogue, bad acting, and silly jokes.

I just don't see how anyone who has a taste in the comedy genre could enjoy this.   Rating: 2.5 - Terrible
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last night, I went to see the movie of "Duel at the O.K. Corral". It is a very good movie, and I enjoyed it. I think it is the only movie of the series that was made by the same people. I'm not sure whether it's better or worse than the first two. The first two films, I thought, were very good, and were more realistic than the sequels. "Duck" is a better film than the second. But "Dunk", as the name implies, is the best of the three, IMO. There is some wonderful acting, and the scenes are set very realistically, and it is a good time to watch. It's a real "old west" story. The good news is that there are some great scenes in this film. There are some wonderful scenes with the three bad guys and the sheriff. There were two other good scenes in the movie, too. One is a wonderful scene with the horse and the cattle. There was a scene with some of the other bad guys in the bar, and they were good, too, I think. I liked the ending of the film. I did not think that the final scene was quite as good as the one in the first film. But, that is what makes the first three films so good, IMHO. It seems that the third film is even better than the other two. I don't know what made me like the last film more than the others, but I liked it a lot, IMOHO. It is good to have a good story with a good cast, and a good director. This movie is definitely worth watching, IMOs. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the Western genre. The second film is a great, but not great, movie. It has some great acting and a great story. But the second film was too long. The third film, however, is a much better film, IME, and is definitely the best movie of these three.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've only seen the first part of this movie, and I love it. It has a wonderful story, and it's good to see some of the old actors back in action. I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not sure how well it holds up. I've seen the TV series, and this movie is definitely the best of the three. The acting is fantastic, and the cinematography is very impressive. The characters all seem to be on the same page, and their reactions are all very natural and believable. This is an entertaining movie, it's just a shame it doesn't hold up.   -Dale

This is the first movie that I saw in theatres and I remember being completely blown away by it.  It's the first time I felt how great a movie could be. The story is simple but it's so good it doesn't need to be. It's an exciting and entertaining film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film that I thought would be good, but didn't like.   The plot of this film was fine, but the movie just didn't have much to do.  The story was about a girl who had been born blind and was trained to be a surgeon and did a lot of surgery on humans.  I thought the story was fine.  Unfortunately, the movie did not live up to the story.  This movie was like watching a really bad version of "The Good Life" or a bad version that was made by Disney.  There was nothing special about this movie.  If you are looking for a good, good, bad movie to watch, look somewhere else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if this movie is better or worse than any other of its type: I really don't. The first half of the movie is quite good, as the main character, an engineer, is doing something very important: building a spaceship for a space station, that will travel the solar system, searching for extraterrestrial life. It is a bit slow, and it isn't all that convincing (I found it hard to believe that such a large space station could fit inside of a small town), but this is not a bad movie. In the end, however, the movie stops moving. There is nothing really interesting about the film (if you can call a movie about a space ship a "movie"), and there is nothing that I want to see again. I didn't like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie. I am a big fan of the comic strip, so I was glad to see that the movie was a direct adaptation of the cartoon. It's a funny, good-natured, and well-acted movie. My only complaint is that I felt it was a bit rushed in the beginning, but it ended up working very well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the comic book, or to anyone with a strong love of the strip. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited about this movie, as the trailer said. It looks like a nice little indie flick, and the acting was good, though not outstanding. I would have liked to see more from the character, though. There is not a lot of detail in the movie. The story seems very old fashioned, and I am not sure how much of a directorial debut this is. I guess it's just a good time, and an entertaining one at that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of the original Batman series, and I've always been a fan of Paul Dini. This movie is the best of the "dark" Batman movies, and for that reason alone it's a must see.    I had a bit of trouble following the story. I thought the story was good, but the pacing was kind of off.  The "real world" of Batman is a very dark one, and to this story it was the perfect setting.

It was a good experience to me.   This is a movie about a man who can't control himself. He wants to be in control, but he is always controlled.  He wants a perfect wife. He is the perfect guy.  I think this movie is about a guy who will get his life back if he can find a perfect woman to love him.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film in the Alien Trilogy,  Covenant  was an enjoyable movie for the most part, but not a perfect one. The film itself was very good, with a good story, a decent soundtrack, and a strong cast that did a good job with the material they had to work with. The only problems with this movie were the actors. There was a decent amount of dialogue in this film, but it just felt out of place, and there was very little action to speak of. This is especially true for the Covenant, which has the least amount of action of the three movies. The characters were good, but were not great. Most of the characters had little screen time, and the ones that did had little to no impact on the story. The Alien is the main character in this movie, and was a bit too big and too powerful. It is too bad that Ridley Scott was unable to make the Alien a more believable character. There are a few moments in the film where it is really cool and it makes the movie great, but that is really it. There is a very strong supporting cast in this one, and it is a shame that they did not get more screen time. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good Alien movie, but who would not mind a bit more action. I have seen some people complain about the ending of the film, and that is a good point to make. It did leave a few questions unanswered, and I would like to see what would have happened if we didn't get the Alien back. I can see why Scott had to end it this way, but I would have liked to see a few more things happen to the Alien before it finally dies. This was a great movie, if you liked the first film, you will enjoy this one as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am pretty sure you have seen this before. A movie that has a pretty good storyline and decent acting by the cast. The story is pretty simple. A group of friends have come across a haunted house in the woods. They are not sure who or what they have stumbled across. The house is old and decrepit and the people who live there seem to be ghosts. They decide to leave the house. As they leave, they find a body. It is a woman. She has been dead for years. The man who finds the body is the last one to have seen her alive. He tells them that he killed the woman and buried her. It seems that his friends have been trying to bring her back to life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an incredibly well made and well acted movie.  I like it when a movie is about something I know nothing about.  The movie tells the story of an unnamed man and a young girl named Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) who have moved to a house with their father and two other families.  As they are getting ready to leave for their vacation the young girl sees a man who appears to be her future stepfather.  But as they go to leave the man is struck and killed by an oncoming train.  It seems that the father has been kidnapped and is being held in the house.  Annie finds a way to escape the house, but the man in the attic has escaped and is after her.  He kills her stepfather and Annie takes off with her father's body.  After getting into an argument with the two men who are trying to kill her the two go to a nearby church to wait out the night.  There the young Annie sees a woman who looks a lot like her father and the woman kills her father.  When Annie comes to she finds a newspaper that is supposed to have been written by her father before he was murdered.  In the newspaper she finds the name "Henry" and learns that he is the murderer of her father as well.  With no father and a new name she has a new life in a new town.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I heard the story about how a "tough" guy like this (as in, he had a pretty rough childhood) got in trouble for taking a break in the middle of a fight, I couldn't help but get all excited about a movie about a guy who has a lot of bad habits, a very bad childhood, and a bad attitude toward his life. After all, this guy has a good family, good friends, a good job and even a girlfriend, but it seems like his bad habits have gotten him nowhere, so he's back to doing whatever he can to get what he wants. And in his head, that's a big gun. A real bad-ass one. A gun that is so powerful that he doesn't even know what he's shooting at. But this movie, it doesn't let him forget about the bad habits he has, or the fact that he's still angry about everything. There's some great action scenes in here, including some good fight scenes. The plot is a little unclear at times, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie.   This movie is in my top 10 of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know that the movie was called   The Dark Knight Rises   at first, but then I saw the title and it just made sense. This is a big film, and one that I thought would be good. The movie has great acting, and a wonderful score. There are some moments that are very good, but most of the movie is good.   This movie is based on the comic book by Frank Miller, and is a good one. I was surprised that the film was rated PG-13. The film is not overly violent, but the violence is good and the scenes are interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with the narrator (and a few others in the background) reminiscing about the events of the day that had led him to where he was. He recounts the day in which the protagonist, a young girl (I think it was supposed to be a boy), was kidnapped and forced into a series of horrible scenarios by a pair of psychopaths. He goes on to describe the way in which she was held captive, and the way she was saved by the protagonists' friend, who is also a detective. There are many things about this film that are truly disturbing, but the most disturbing of all is that this film does not try to hide it. It is clear that the filmmakers have a perverse sense of humor, which they have expressed in the film's title. If this is not enough to give this film a rather disturbing reputation, then I don't know what is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This movie is not for the squeamish, the very faint of heart, or the easily offended. Â It's a really cool movie about a group of kids, all in the same class, who are trapped in a movie theater.  And trapped in the movie theater, there is a bomb that has been placed under the movie screen.    When the bomb goes off, a bunch of other movies are played, but none of them is any good, except for the one they just played.  So the kids are trapped, they can't get out, and the bomb has to be defused by the police.  But it's not that easy, the kids have to put their egos aside, and do whatever is needed to save themselves and the movie.  The movie is really good, and I really liked it, and thought it was a lot of fun to watch.  I hope that this movie will get some more attention, because I really enjoyed it.

The French Connection is a classic film about a crooked cop named Eddie Felson who is tasked to investigate a murder on the city streets.  He is aided by two other corrupt cops and his assistant, Charlie, who is an excellent police officer.  The movie is well-acted and very well-directed.  This film is based on the true story of a man named Eddie Franklyn Felson, who was a member of the notorious French Connection.  His name is mentioned a lot throughout the movie.  It is difficult to remember the name of his father, however he is the reason that Eddie's father, Harry Felson (played by Henry Fonda), gets involved with the French Connection in the first place.  One of the most entertaining parts of the film is Eddie's interactions with his two best friends, Charlie and Frank (played very well by Charles Grodin and Robert Duvall), who have a rivalry with him, but it is always played very well.  Another good aspect of the movie is that Eddie is given a very colorful, interesting, and colorful backstory.  In addition, the movie has a good soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ It's really not that good. _________________________________________________ I was really looking forward to seeing this movie since the trailers were great and the cast was really fun.  I was excited to see the first teaser that came out on the 15th and was really hoping that it would be good, but unfortunately it was not.  The story was boring and had no twists, so I didn't care if I got to see a vampire or not. The rest of the cast wasn't all that great either, but it's not the biggest deal.  __________________________________ ____________________________________ ___________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very pleased to say that this is a great movie.   It is about a couple who get back together when the woman (who is in the movie) gets a job.  It's the perfect marriage movie and the characters are all well drawn and realistic.  The plot is very interesting and well written and the ending is so well written that I can't even put it down.  I will definitely see the movie again and I'm sure that I'll see more of these wonderful movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the movie twice. First time, I loved the movie. The movie is very good, but not good enough. It does not have a strong theme or story, but a simple and clear storyline and a few good acting performances. The first half is about a woman who tries to find her husband, who is lost in a snowstorm, but he is lost also in the snowstorm. The wife is forced to look for him on her own, and the whole film is a good adventure, because she is forced into a difficult situation. The second half is very different from the first. I loved this movie, because the plot is very simple and has a clear story and an interesting ending. I wish it was a little longer, because I liked the ending much more than the first half.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I was at first quite worried when I first saw this movie. I was so surprised at how much it reminded me of a similar movie I watched a few years ago, but with a bit more humor. It's still a little silly, but there is a lot of fun in this. If you liked the movie I saw a few months ago, you'll like this one. It gets a little repetitive, but that's okay.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a hard time finding a good "monster movie" that isn't a "monster-of-the-week" movie. This is not that. This isn't even really a movie. It's an hour and a half of mindless action, no humor, and a lot of "why can't these two people be more likeable than they are?" I don't even remember why I was watching this. I was bored, and then I got bored. I know this is supposed to be a monster movie, but this movie isn't "monsters" it's "horrible, horrible things." I don`t know if I will be seeing a lot more of this, but if you have seen this, it`s not worth your time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sideways" is a good thriller that will leave you scratching your head wondering what happened. This is one of the best of the new wave of thrillers. I'm sure the story will take you into a world of mystery. This movie is set in a small town in Indiana where a man goes missing from a bar. The police have no leads on his whereabouts. He is eventually found dead on a riverbank. His wife wants the police to investigate but they can't because the place is still considered a bar and they can only charge the bartender with being an accessory to a felony. Written by James W.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that the movie "The Man From Planet X" was interesting. The concept was pretty cool, but it didn't get interesting enough to hold my interest for very long. The plot was okay, and there was some good action, but everything else was just okay. The movie was about a scientist who is captured and taken to a planet where they live in a society based on a strict hierarchy where the women wear white dresses and the men wear black. The scientist has a problem with the women wearing white dresses, so he has a plan to get rid of them. The women on the planet wear a blue dress and the man wears a white one. That is pretty much it. The action is okay, but the special effects were poor. The only special effects that are decent are the special effect of the alien being able to walk on his hands. I'm not sure if this was a mistake, or if they simply didn't know what to do with this special effect. If you're looking for something new to watch, then "The man from planet X" is worth a watch, but if you're not interested in seeing something original, then I would recommend just sticking to the original Star Trek movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________   There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed with this movie.   1. This movie, at first, is really fun. It's fun to be in a car and to drive around and find a good place to stop and get some sleep. There are lots of scenes that take place in the car that are really enjoyable.   of course there are the issues that we all have about movies like this.   the music is great and there are some good effects, but the car driving scenes are really boring. They just take place inside the car and then just move around a little. It takes a long time for the car to get anywhere, even with a lot of camera angles. It doesn't really seem like a car movie. It looks like a movie made to make money and a movie that I would be interested in seeing if it was a movie. _________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Perfect Storm" is a great film and the movie is about an oil company that was hit with an oil rig explosion and a huge amount of oil leaked from the rig into the ocean.  This caused a huge disaster for the company and a lot of people died, including the main characters:    The company is going to get sued for the disaster because the people who died were people who were in the process of cleaning the oil rig.   This leads to the main character, a man named James McBride, to do whatever he can to get out of the disaster.  He goes to the oil company to see if he can help them and the man tells him to go to the nearest city and find out where the oil is leaking.  Unfortunately the city has been burned down and the only one who is left is a man who doesn't speak any English and a boy who has a really bad cold and can't go anywhere near the oil.  However he is still very useful to the company because they need his help in finding the oil and he is able to give them that information.  James is a good guy and he doesn't have any problem helping the company, even if they are a disaster and are going to be sued.  It was a good idea to do a movie about oil but this movie was much better than the other movies in the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film stars Bruce Willis, in his only film as a character of any substance, in a role that is at once a parody of a good action hero and a satire of the "superhero genre" which he seems to despise.  In the beginning of the film, Willis is an average, unremarkable, unimpressive, unremarkably average actor.   But at the end of the movie, he is the only one who can save the world.  I liked this film.  It was good, it was bad, it made me laugh, it left me in tears, it reminded me of an old Western with a great script and great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The final scene in which the little girl, the one who is crying in the hospital with the dying man, is seen being taken to her grandfather's house by her father.   It was a moving, touching scene that showed what was in a child's heart.  And the last scene, where the little boy, who's dying, is being taken home by his grandfather, and being greeted by his mother and sister, was touching as well.  The whole movie was moving.  It brought to the surface the truth that it seems we are so afraid to look at: That there is a human life in us all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about a man who was a victim of sexual abuse in his childhood.   He is an alcoholic, but has turned his life around.  He has a wife, two kids, a good job, and he still can't get enough of the badness of the world.  When he is out of town, he has a few drinks and ends up in a bar with a group of women.  They are a little strange, but not so much that they can't hold their own, so they get to know him a little better.  After a few days of hanging out, he is invited to the home of one of the women, who is pregnant.  This is where things get strange.  The pregnant woman has a little boy, who doesn't look like his father.  It is later found out that he is not his father, but the son of an old man.  Unfortunately for the man, the man has no idea of who he is, and will not help him.  But he does let him stay with him and take care of him. It is a nice place, and the people there are nice.  In the mean time, the woman is having a few problems of her own.  She has a bad habit of picking on people and is always trying to get revenge on them.  While they are all living together, it becomes a lot more interesting.  Even though she does not know who the man is, she does know who she is.  Her mother is the one who killed her husband and who is trying to kill her.  Then her sister is also trying to take over the family, and her boyfriend is also in on it.  There is a lot of tension in this movie, but it is not all negative.  Instead of just killing everyone, the film tries to show the effects of abuse.  I liked the fact that the film tried to portray the world through a character's eyes.  A little over two hours long, this film is very well done.

The story is very interesting and the characters are interesting and well developed. I really enjoyed the romance between the two lead actors, and I really liked the romance in the book as well. The only problem I had with the film was that there were times when the film could have been better. The film does not have the same depth of atmosphere and atmosphere in the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Bury Your Gays" is an excellent movie about gay men who live in a city, where everyone is gay.  In a very short period of time, a lot of them get killed, but the one who survives is a man named Sam (played by Michael Parks). Sam has a secret that no one knows about. He is a gay man who loves men. The film takes a very funny and interesting direction, which is based on the life of Sam, who is forced to leave his life and find a new one in a new place.  The ending is quite tragic. But, the movie itself is really good. The acting is very good, the music is good and the acting is also very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I watched this movie I thought it was just an overly sentimental, very well made movie. I have not seen a movie like this since that time. I'm still trying to figure out how this movie made such an impact on me. It has a bit of a surreal quality to it, with a plot that is almost unbelievable. It takes place in a strange town called Mephisto, which is supposed to be a magical place. The town is filled with ghosts and spirits. The spirits seem to be constantly moving around. The movie has a lot of weird moments, like the ghost girl who has her clothes changed into a strange costume. But the most bizarre scene is the time the ghost boy runs around in his underwear. It's a little strange to see the ghost in his undies, but it does add to the surreal feel of the movie. And it makes me think of the classic movie "I Dream of Jeannie" with Janet Leigh, which was also about a girl who had her clothes magically change into her underwear. The ghost boy also seems to be inspired by "The Conjuring" with its haunted house and its eerie atmosphere. It may not be the best movie, but if you are looking for a good laugh then this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was watching the film a few weeks ago and was impressed by the fact that I got to see the film and even if I didn't like it, I found myself very interested. It is one of those films that makes you wonder why this is called a "classic" even though it isn't that classic at all.  That's what I mean about "classic films" which are those films where you know the title, but you aren't really sure what the film is about until it is over.    It is a very good movie about a woman who doesn't quite fit in to her husband's circle of friends and her family and what is more interesting is that she doesn't fit in with anyone.  This is a film about a man who is trying to understand why his wife doesn't want to have children and it is a good film about the relationship between a man and a woman.  The film itself is quite well done and a lot of thought went into the making of this film.  It had a good story and a good script and a great cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a love/hate relationship with this film.  It's a movie I've seen multiple times and enjoyed a few.    In it we meet a beautiful young girl, Lila (played by Susan St. James).   Lila is a gifted young girl who has a dream of being a poet.  But her father (played wonderfully by Harold Lloyd) is a real pain in the ass.  When Lila discovers that her parents are getting divorced, she has to run away to a new home in the country, which happens to be in the woods.  This is where Lila meets a boy named George (played brilliantly by Charles Coburn).  It is here that we see the first signs of Lila's talent.  She has the ability to communicate with animals and people and even her brother is not afraid to play with her.  Lilias parents, Mr. and Mrs. St. John, are divorced and they are trying to come to terms with that.  They are also having an affair with one of their neighbors.  The St. Johns seem to be on the verge of losing it and one day Lila has to sneak into their house and save them.  It's a wonderful film, I hope to see it again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** "THE SPECTRE" is a very interesting and engaging film that will entertain most people and have them asking themselves if they are really awake. It is the story of a very wealthy family who have just acquired an underground "spooky" mansion in a rural setting. The story is very interesting as you have the wealthy family that have purchased the mansion with all the expensive equipment and appliances. They seem to have no clue of what is happening down there, except for one member of the family who is a bit obsessed with the strange happenings that have been happening to them. The rest of the group is not as well off as they think and it is not a good time to be an outsider in the town. As the family members get a little older they discover the reason that they have been having so many strange events is because they have all been "invited" to the house. One member of this family is a girl named Rose, who is in love with one of the servants in the house, named Rose. She does not know that the man she is falling for is a servant and has not been there for a very long time. The others who have been invited are all of the same age, and the two of them will be going on a tour of the house which is being built. There is a certain amount of confusion between the three of them, but they are going to be able to work things out eventually. This is not to be a bad thing, as it is an entertaining film. The one complaint I have is that the music in this film is pretty cheesy. There are some catchy tunes, but it does not really stand out from the rest of your films. The film is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies about a small group of people who go to a mysterious mansion in the country for a little vacation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good comedy, about a young couple who are looking for a place to live. A house in the country, near a creek.  The only problem is, the house is haunted. When the husband starts seeing a spirit in the bathroom, he gets scared and leaves.  Eventually, the ghost returns and scares the husband again. This time, the husband is more successful. He moves in with his new wife and moves into a new house.  A few years later, the new owner of the house, the very rich, very bad man, comes to see his new house...  This is where the movie starts getting bad. The movie is filled with horrible acting, awful dialogue and terrible jokes.  This movie is only memorable because of the creepy house and the bad acting.   This movie is terrible and the acting is even worse. I would not recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We're talking about a film that should be seen by all, even those who have never seen a Western before, a classic that stands the test of time.  I like to think that the first scene of the movie is a perfect representation of the Western genre, and for me, it is.  I am sure that there are a lot of other people who like the Western as well, but for me this is the movie that really made me want to be a Western movie buff.    I don't think it's a stretch to say that John Ford was the most influential director in the history of Western movies, and it's easy to see why.  The way he makes the characters feel real and relatable is just so captivating, and I think it is because of that he can take a movie about cowboys, Indians, and the Spanish, and make them feel like they are real people.  He knows exactly how to make you feel for the characters and make you care about them, and he can make the most horrible situations look like they were all part of a good old time.     John Ford is probably one of the most underrated directors out there.  To this day, people still debate whether he was the best director of the film, or just one of its better ones.  Personally, I would say he was one of his best, but I also don't consider himself the best.  For me, he is the best because he knows how to tell a story without being bogged down by plot and character development.  This is one of those movies where you can tell that John did not know what he was doing when he wrote it, because he didn't know what kind of film he was making.  It's just not very exciting, and this is probably why the movie still gets so much good press to this day.  John is one brilliant director, and there is really not a whole lot else to say about him.  With that said, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

Â The movie has all the elements that make for a great comedy:  the bad guys are despicable;  some of the best acting of the year; Â and of course, a great plot with an ending that will be remembered for a long time.  I'm surprised that this is the first movie to get a Blu-ray release and the first to get an American theatrical release (as well as the first in the series). Â In fact, I'd be surprised if it weren't the first one to get Blu-rays (the other movies are all Region-A releases).  The picture and audio are both great and the sound effects are great (particularly when the bad guys get out of the car).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great movie! It's a very interesting film and it really shows a bit about the inner-workings of a police force in Japan. The film is a simple police story. A little boy is walking home from school. A police car drives up beside him and stops. There is a little girl in the passenger seat. They both get out of the car. There's no time to say anything to each other. The girl is sitting next to the boy and he's looking at her and she is looking at him. There are some shots where she's sitting on the ground and the boy is looking in at her. The boy then sits down and she gets up. He gets up and she sits down next to him. They go back to the car and the girl tells the boy that he looks cute. He smiles and nods and she nods back. He then asks her a question. She says he can kiss her if he wants. He looks at her but she doesn't smile. She then tells him that he can look her up in the phone book and she'll show him where she lives. Then she turns around and leaves the car before the boy can get a good look at her, so she is left on the side of the road by herself.   This film is very simple. It's the story of a boy who is looking for his missing sister. It doesn't get into any of the other more interesting things about police work. There was a scene at the end where the girl went up to the policeman and told him that the boy was going to find her. That's the whole story.   The film isn't very good. It has some very strange and unnecessary shots. There were also a couple of scenes in which I had trouble understanding what was going on. The story and the plot are interesting but they are so far from being very good that I was disappointed. I was expecting a lot more from a police film and this film just didn't do it for me.   the film is rated PG. The sound is very good and there are no commercials. The movie is from 1964.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen the film yet, but I think it looks really interesting and I hope that the film gets a chance to play in theaters around the world.  The movie is a story about a man who was born and raised in a small town in Pennsylvania and then left to travel around the country with a small group of people who share a love for country music.  One of the songs that the men were singing, "Cream of the Crop"  I've always enjoyed the songs of this movie and I think that if they would ever put a feature length version of this film on the big screen it would be a great addition to the movie-going audience.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original "Roots" was a brilliant film. It is still so relevant to the struggles of black people today.   In this one, however, the focus is on black women and their struggles.  A beautiful story told by a wonderful cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like "The Devil's Advocate" and you are a fan of Charlie Chaplin, you will enjoy this.   Chaplin plays a man who is going to his father's funeral, but on the way there he sees the devil and is inspired to take revenge.  Chaplins mannerisms, speech and the devil's speech is so funny.  This is a funny movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to tell what was going on in the head of the main character when she was about to have sex with a man who looks like a cross between a werewolf and a vampire. I've read all the books in the series and the first time I read them, I thought they were really good. The second time I re-read them, after reading The Ring, I felt like the story had been turned up a notch or two. I loved the characters and the plot was really well done. I also loved the magic that was going around and I loved how the vampires were a metaphor for the modern world. It's hard for me to rate a book that I've never read. I'm not an avid reader but this is definitely a book I would like to read.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like good movies then you will like this one. If you are a fan of old movies then this is the perfect movie for you.   This movie is a remake of a movie called "The Big Sleep"   You may not recognize the movie, it is one of the biggest movies of all time.  This is a movie that changed the way people thought about sleep, and the way they thought about the dream.  If your looking for a good sleep movie then this one is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the best films of the year.  What can I say. This is a movie that deserves to be watched over and over again. It is one of those movies that you watch over and OVER AGAIN, because every single moment is amazing. I can't even tell you how many times I watched this movie. I watched it twice and then watched it over again because I knew I had to re-watch it. The best part about it is how the movie doesn't make any money. I have seen so many movies in the last few years that I have been to a few conventions and they all have some money in them. I'm sure this is the only movie that makes money, because it is a true story and it doesn't just happen on its own. It has a lot of drama going on, but the main character is the most important. The story starts off with a young man named James who lives with his mother. His mother is very abusive, but she is also the one that gives him love. Her abuse of him starts at a young age, and she never stops it. When James gets older, his mother starts to force him to become a doctor, and that is a very bad thing for him. James gets involved in a very dangerous situation that he didn't sign up for, but that's a story for another day. This movie does not have a happy ending. I wish it did. It was a lot to watch over again, and there were so many good things in it that I want to see it over and again. I want more of it! I hope to see more from this movie soon.    I give this movie an 8 out of 10. It just made me feel good and good things happen to good people. I also loved how James gets to have a father figure in this movie, and it's funny how he gets involved with the right people in the right way. It's a good story, and a great movie.   This movie has also inspired me to watch the movie The Girl Next Door and see how different that movie was. It definitely gave me some ideas to do that movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We were all young once, and when the dust settles from the war we find ourselves a broken people, divided by a common enemy: the man who was called Hitler."   This is a good and well-told story of a man who became Hitler, who, after becoming the Fuhrer, took up arms against the democracies and who died in a Nazi concentration camp. The author, in this short but compelling book, gives us a fascinating insight into the Führer and the way in which he saw the world. We are also told about his friends and family, his struggles to become a man of action, and how the people around him helped him along the way. We learn about the nature of Nazism, how it came to be, and the ways in which Hitler changed the world for the better.   I enjoyed this book a great deal. I also found it a little sad, because it showed a man like Hitler, one who was so strong, so strong-willed, and so much in command of his mind that he made it so much easier for others to follow his example. This was not the Hitler I know, and I wish that had been changed, so that we could have read a different story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film follows the journey of two soldiers of the Soviet Union. The story begins in 1943, in Russia, during the German invasion. The men are the same as we know them now: hardy, brave, and tough. They are part of the famous Soviet "Siberian Winter" division, and when the Germans invade they take the opportunity to take on the enemy on their own terms. They don't take the easy way out, and the battle that follows is intense. The soldiers fight for their lives, often in snow and ice. They face heavy enemy fire, and then they are able to surprise the Germans with a surprise attack, and finish them off. This film is not the most impressive of Soviet-era war films. The production is not as good as some of the more elaborate productions, and some of them are more spectacular than this one. However, the film is a good example of how a good Russian war film should be done. It's very realistic, and very engaging. I'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie, but I have a feeling that there are more movies like this. It is an easy watch, and one that you will remember for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie and thought it was good, a little slow, but not bad. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I thought it should have been a little longer. I would recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I had a great time at the movie theatre last weekend.   I think it was a good time all around.  There were three different plays in this movie.  The one I liked the most was the one about the "penny dreadful" that was based on a true story.  My favorite was a play called "I've Got the Blues".   This is a great movie to see at a local movie theatre.  I am sure there are some who may find this movie offensive.  Some may think it's an excuse to have a lot of fun.  It's not.  If you want to see a good show, this is a good place to do it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The Godfather Â (1971) is the most famous of all of Francis Ford Coppola's films, so it's no wonder that it's a great movie, with a very interesting plot, and an excellent score. Â I had been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the original film in 1964.  I was only a little boy when I saw it for the first time, and my memory of the movie is still vivid.  Â Â This is a film that is both funny and serious at the same time, so that it can be both a good film and a bad film.  I have already written a review of this film here, but here is a brief review:    This film takes place in the 1920's, when the Mafia, the Sicilian crime syndicate, is trying to control the Chicago mob.  One of the characters, Michael, is an ambitious Chicago gangster.  He is very successful, and in a moment of great danger, he makes a deal with the mob that if he does not kill his wife and daughter, they will be killed by his enemies.  This is one of the most interesting stories that Coppolola ever tells, and it is one that he continues to tell, in almost every movie that he makes.  The film is about a man who goes through the most important events in his life, and is very good at portraying those events in a very realistic way.  It also shows the lengths that the Mafia goes to to control their opponents, and the lengths they go to protect their own.  All of these are very important themes in Coppold's filmography, and he uses them all in a way that makes them seem like they are not just themes, but very real, very powerful themes.  I am sure that some of you will not find this film as interesting as I did, but if you do, then you will definitely enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't really like this one.  The movie is very long and the script was just plain awful.    The first act is really boring.  The main character has a terrible boss and spends the first part of the movie telling everyone he is a hero who never loses, who is the best at everything.  This is the only reason the first half is so bad.  It's just a boring set up.  Then we get to the first "battle."  The movie is supposed to start with the main character getting a new friend who is a giant, evil robot.  But instead of the big bad robot, we get the little guy, who doesn't have a weapon.  He just attacks you.  At the end of the first act, we find out he is named Zax, and that he is actually the villain.  So instead of a giant robot that is evil and wants to destroy the earth, he is the little kid's friend.  Zax is a pathetic character.  His motivation is so weak that he only wants to have friends and to play, and this is not the way a real villain would want to be portrayed.  I also thought the special effects were awful. The movie has an awesome scene in which the giant robot is fighting Zax and they are both flying and the robot is moving really fast.  However, it's not until the end when Zax's head is coming out of his chest that the movie really gets good.  And then the movie starts getting really bad.   There is a scene where Zax steals a gun from a kid, and the kid gets away with it.  Now Zax has a gun that can shoot bullets and Zax wants to shoot the kid.  Well, there is a girl in the crowd, so he does, and she is killed.  There is also a little girl who has a crush on Zax.  She is also killed.   This scene is a really long time coming.  Even though this is a kid's movie, the adult characters seem really old.  Like, I was expecting something like "The Goonies" or "The Last Starfighter."  I didn't expect a movie like this.  Maybe I should have guessed that this would be bad, because it didn't have anything to do with the kids.  They just showed how old the characters were.  Also, when the kids fight the giant robots,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't think that I would like this movie. I really wanted to like it. I thought it would be like the first movie in the series, but instead I found it a much more entertaining film. The plot is simple, but well executed. It's not a plot that I was particularly looking forward to seeing, but the characters are fun and the comedy is well done. It was the type of movie that I always enjoy seeing in theaters, but it is not the type I would want to see again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you are in the mood to watch a good action movie, this is a good one.  The action is excellent, especially the last one where the guy with the big hammer is kicking all over the place.  One thing to mention is the way the fight scenes are filmed.    It is a bit choppy in some scenes but they are still good.  They are mostly action, so if you want a good time, you might not like it but it is still a good flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day I went to a movie and found myself sitting next to a guy I hadn't seen before and didn't know much about. He was funny and he played a good character and he was very nice and polite to me.  When we started talking he was like a little brother to me and I was happy to see he had a little bit of a different attitude about him.  I've heard people say that if a woman is attracted to a man they should go to the theater, go in, and have a good time.  This is how I felt.  I'm a woman and I'm very, very attracted to men.   It's hard to describe in words how I feel about a man, but I do it in the words of a song that is on my iPod.  The song is called "He's a Wonderful Man".    And I will say this about this movie:  I think it is a very well made movie and it was a very nice movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ It was a bit slow, but this movie is about the story. This movie is a remake of the movie with the same name. This time, the story is a bit different. There is a whole new group of characters and they're trying to find a way to get back home to their family. It's very emotional, but at the same time, very funny. It is an action/adventure movie. The whole movie is very intense and very funny, so this movie should be watched by anyone who enjoys an action movie. _______________ A little too long, but worth the time.

The story is about how the man will get over his obsession and be able to live a normal life. There is a beautiful story at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not about a man with a plan. This movie has nothing to do with the real world. It is an absurd, ludicrous, and unbelievable tale about a clown, who becomes the ruler of a small country in the middle of the American Midwest. A guy in the background is a real clown, but it is not obvious at all.   The main character is played by a man who looks like a clown with a moustache.  There is a joke about the clown, that he could never get a girl, and this is where the movie starts.  This is a funny movie, but its not a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In spite of the bad reviews and bad writing, it was a really good movie. It was about a man who was able to change his life by using his mind and body to overcome the things that he hated. His first thought was that it was going to be a boring movie because it was about "a man who uses his mind to change people's lives."   It didn't take long for that to change to "a good movie that is about a person who uses their mind to conquer his own problems."  If you don't mind the ending, I give this movie 4 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is a wonderfully weird and scary movie.  The movie takes place in an isolated hospital that has an experimental treatment for a rare and deadly disease.    The thing that causes the disease is a gigantic slug that has been cloned by the hospital.  It can also turn into a human and live on a man's arm.  When the man dies the slug turns into a hideous, grotesque monster.  The film is really scary and weird and I can't believe it's not better known.  I recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic example of how a bad story can be turned into a good film: The film starts with a beautiful, romantic sunset. It's beautiful, but there is something wrong with it.  It's not just the sunset, but everything about it. The colors, the light, the way the camera moves. It just is. It doesn't work. So we get to the "plot", and it's a lot of nothing. It starts with some guy (I forget his name) looking for a place to hide out in. He finds a hideout, and he has some trouble there. The guy is a bit of a loner, so I'm guessing he's not an "alpha male". But this little bit of information is enough to make you feel something for the guy. This is a really nice way to begin the film. We get a nice little piece of a guy, but he's just too bland. And the plot is just... a little too bland and boring. But you know what? There's a reason it didn't get more attention. The actors are fantastic, and they are just too good to let this be the end of it. If you can get past the blandness of the story, you'll get a great film with a great cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Bobby (Kevin Bacon) is an alcoholic who drinks and drinks and takes a lot of pills. But after he's saved by a young girl (played by Jessica Lange), he decides to try something different: he starts to have a relationship with her, even though he's still an alcoholic. But then, one night, a couple of strangers appear at his apartment. His roommate (played, of course, by Michael Caine) says that Bobby and the woman he's dating have been having sex. The guys are a pair of bikers who look like they've been to a lot. One of them is played by a big, bearded, hairy guy. His name is Burt Reynolds, and his brother is played with a lot more authority by Don Johnson. The other guy is played in a way that suggests he's been to the same place as Bobby, but the guy looks like he's from another planet. I think this guy might be a space alien."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen many bad movie sequels and they never fail to disappoint.  This one, however, was pretty good.    The original story was great.  It was a well thought out story, which took us into the story of a young man named John who is in love with a young woman named Jane.  While this is a great story, the sequel has a lot of problems.  The plot seems to be more like a collection of jokes and slapstick, rather than the original story.  I'm not sure if this is meant to be a comedy or not, but it really doesn't work.  One of the main problems with this film is the lack of the "evil" aspect of the story. You still have the evil overlord, who is always shown to be really dumb.  There are still a lot more jokes in this film that are more along the lines of slapstick and bad jokes.  Also, the characters still don't really change.  You still get the same old people, the same boring one liners and all the funny lines are still in the same places.  This film is just a series of bad jokes and bad scenes, but they still manage to get a laugh out of us.  My favorite parts of the film were the ones where they show us John and Jane kissing.  They are both very sexy and the kissing scenes are very fun.  Another fun scene is the one where they go to a strip club and John and Joe watch the girls dancing in a sexy way.  These scenes really made me laugh and they were really great.   Overall, this is another one of those films that will only get worse with time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not expecting much out of this movie, but it was a good one. I think it is a nice change of pace from the action packed series. This movie is more of a mystery/thriller with some horror elements thrown in. It is not bad at all and I enjoyed it a lot. The ending was a little disappointing for me as I was hoping for a little more. It was a nice little movie that will have you laughing and maybe a little crying at times. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any fan of the series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I had a dream about a girl named Amy (Carrie Fisher), and I have a dream that I am Amy"   In this movie, we meet a girl that has an interest in the famous "Tinkerbell" (the little fairy who likes to run around and eat apples). She has a dream of being Tinkerbell. So she gets a doll of her likeness made by a fairy, a magician, who does a trick that gives the doll the ability to talk and run about. She is called the "Tinkertail" and is given a home with a father who is a magician. The girl's father, a wizard named Jack, is a great magician who has a lot of friends, so he helps Amy become a famous magician. But when she does magic, she gets in trouble with the police, who find out that she does it by tricking them into thinking that they are in trouble. Jack is arrested and put into jail, and Amy is left to live with the father she likes so much. This is a movie that makes you laugh at the time, but then, after a while, it really starts to get serious.   The movie has a great storyline that has the boy's parents (and other characters) getting in trouble all over the place. They are all in trouble, but Amy doesn't do it intentionally. I also liked the "tinkertails" because they have such funny names, and I'm sure they have a lot more fun than I do.   a lot to like about this movie:   - The "tinkerbell dolls" are so funny and make the audience laugh every time.  - I like that there are some funny scenes with the "Jack" and the "Amy"  -"I wonder what would happen if he got caught?" I think this movie is the first time I've ever thought that.   on the "bad" part:   the movie does start to get real bad towards the end.   the voice acting is also not very good in this movie. The kids are supposed to sound like they are around 10 or 11, but it sounds like they're way older. I'm glad I watched this, because it was a lot better than I expected it to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Day After Tomorrow "  is a fantastic science fiction film that is very entertaining to watch. The film is about a scientist who is called upon to come to a planet that has been destroyed by a nuclear war. He is tasked with bringing back the remnants of the human race and to help them he must have an extra-terrestrial to help him.  The extra-human is played by Richard Dean Anderson.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in the mood to watch this movie a couple weeks ago and decided to check it out. The movie starts off with a scene where we see a little boy riding a bike on a city street. A little boy gets caught by a police officer in a high speed chase that ends with the boy getting run over by a car. As the film continues, we see more and more evidence that the boy is really a girl, which leads to a police investigation. Eventually, the police discover that the little boy has been adopted by a woman named Marie. She seems like a nice lady, but she's not. She has her own agenda, one that she has been keeping a secret from the police.   She's also an extremely violent person. One time, she has a man tied up to a chair in her house and then kicks him repeatedly. She's a nasty, violent woman.  The movie ends with a twist that you didn't see coming.  It's a good twist because the movie is about a very troubled woman who is being stalked by a serial killer. There are lots of twists and turns throughout the movie, and it is fun to watch them unfold.  My Rating:

I have a friend who I used to live with in college who is also a big fan of the Crow. He and his friends would all gather to watch the movie together. This time around, we went to the theater and I thought the movie was great. The special effects were top notch and it was pretty funny as well. The only problem was that I don't think the movie would have made as much money as it did had the Crow not been in it. I still love the Crow, but the movie did not live up to the hype. I will always remember that great day when I was watching this movie with my friends in college.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Carry on - A man who is the love of his life in the beginning of the film is thrown into the life of a stranger who is in a desperate state of mind after losing his job and his girlfriend. He decides to follow his girlfriend in her new job and they both end up living together and finding out that they both have something in common, their husbands, the husband who is still alive, but who is being taken care of by his wife who wants to become his nurse and take care of him and the wife who has a secret.  As they live together, they become close to each other and get to know each other.  The ending of the movie was quite shocking.    I don't think the ending was bad, but it was pretty out there and a bit unexpected.  I think the story of this movie was not as bad as the title suggests.  A couple of the characters were quite likable.  The story did take a turn into something a bit darker, but not that much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie as much as the first one. The second one was better than the first.    This movie takes place in the future and all is done on a 3D television set. It's the future, and everything is a lot more advanced and pretty futuristic. There are a lot of gadgets and computers. I don't know if it's the 3D effect or the futuristic nature of the setting, but it's definitely pretty cool.  A good movie to watch with your kids:   I think the movie should be watched with the kids because there is a little violence in the movie. It does a good job of setting up a nice and dark future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie!   A great time was had by all!  It is a very unique story.   It was like a western in a time when most movies are about men and women fighting, not about two people and their differences.  It is not as dark as some of the other westerns out there.  It has an uplifting message of "how much is enough?"   The acting is good, and the film is a good fun.  I would recommend this film to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never read a book as good as this one. I think that this movie is very realistic. You can see the whole village, the children, and the adults, the village people, all in one movie. There is nothing fake about this movie. The people live in the village, have a good life, and are happy. This movie shows you what a real village is like. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is a very good movie.  - December 25, 2009I am so happy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a feeling that this one will be on a lot of people's must watch lists.  There is so much happening in this film that you would think it was a soap opera.    But the film is not about that.  The film is about the journey of an American family that is moving to the UK in order to get a divorce.  There is an awkwardness in the relationship between the husband and wife, but the family is very loving and supportive.  I thought that it was really touching that in the end the daughter, who is very much an innocent, was able to see what the other side was all about.  It made me cry and made me laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main characters are very relatable and the movie is filled with many of the clichés that are expected in a good spy movie. However, the story was interesting and had a good pace. The ending was also well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is interesting, and has some good twists. I'm sure that it's an homage to the classics of the genre, so it's not as bad as most. I like the way they filmed it: the slow-motion shots of the city and the characters' reactions to the chaos. There is a lot of stuff going on, and it's very much a character study. The plot twists are always good: the bad guys aren't as bad at all as we think, they actually like what they do, and have some good laughs along the way.  It is an interesting take on the classic film noir. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an excellent, if a little silly, adventure story. This movie is about a group of astronauts on a trip to the moon in 1969, where they meet the beautiful and powerful astronaut (Karen Allen) who they have come to know well from their previous missions to the Moon.   The film is full of wonderful, colorful special effects.  The characters are all funny, and the story is interesting.  It takes a while for the story to develop, and is not a long movie.  However, it is worth seeing if you are into space adventures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Man on Earth (2011)  is a well-acted, well-made movie that's definitely worth a watch.  It's also a fun, weird movie that has some pretty neat elements, but is ultimately kind of a downer, which is what I usually like about these kinds of movies.  The Last Men on Earth, starring Zach Galifianakis, is a silly, silly, and silly movie.   The premise is that a group of last men have to try and survive a zombie apocalypse by eating each other.  If this were a TV show, it would be pretty awful.  For starters, this movie is poorly acted.  They are so badly cast that they don't even have enough time to build a relationship with each other, and they never do anything that makes any sense.  These people are like the zombies from A Night at the Roxbury: They all seem like they are in it for the money and fame, and all of them get the girl and then immediately go back to their lives.  It's like they were all just trying to get as much screen time as possible.  There are two main characters, but they don´t even get enough screen time together.  The story doesn't work because the writers are so lazy.  I mean, who cares about the last men on earth?  If the last man on earth had the same problems that everyone else had, then there wouldn't have been a zombie problem at all.  So, what is the point?  This is the third zombie movie that is based on a comic book.  One of these movies is called Last Man in the World, and the other is called The Last Days on Earth.  Last Man In The World is just as silly, but the main character is much more interesting than these guys.  In The Last Men On Earth, Zach Galafianakis is just trying too hard to be the last guy.  His performance is kind of like the actor trying to be like a zombie:  he is trying to mimic the zombie, but he's just kind of annoying.  He makes it clear that he doesn't know what he is doing, and it's really disappointing because he should have known better.  Another thing is that the movie doesn't even give enough time for any of the characters to get their own storylines going.  Galifanakis doesn't get any kind of arc and it doesn't

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is based on a true story. The main characters are a young couple who were married for twenty-two years. They decided to get divorced. When he got back from the army, he wanted to get his life back on track. The two of them have been married for almost thirty years. It is the only time I have seen this couple look happy. It also showed how the family is very close. There is no jealousy in the movie, even when they fight. The only thing I can say is that this is a good old fashioned love story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________ It was a bit hard for me to get into this movie but then I saw the trailer and knew that this is the movie for me. The acting was excellent, especially by Michael Stahl, the film is not a movie about the American Revolution, but a movie of the American people. And you could see the differences between the British and the Americans, the British are greedy and greedy is a good word for them. The British were not only greedy but arrogant as well, this is a film about the people, the people were fighting for their rights and for a better future. It is the best movie that I have seen in a long time, a great movie.

There were some great scenes in this movie and I am sure the director made a good decision with the cast he cast. This movie was great!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Exorcist" is an excellent horror film.  The plot is fairly simple: the family of the family is going through a divorce.    As a result, the children are going to an "exorcist school" for the rest of the year.    The head exorcist is played by a terrific actor, Bill Pullman, who gives a terrific performance.  The special effects are excellent, particularly the scene where the demon turns into a horse, but the real strength of the film comes from the performances of the children.        There are many children's movies made nowadays.  But   they never seem to be able to capture the wonder of the imagination.  "The Exorist"   manages to capture this wonderfully.  It is a wonderful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Horse Thief" is a classic "Western" which has a lot of the typical features which were present in this genre, including the good and the bad. I would like to add that the film does not focus on the gunplay. In the movie, a group of men come across a group who are not happy with their situation. This leads them to make a bargain, with a woman. After the woman is raped and murdered, the men come to the conclusion that she is their last hope. Unfortunately, their attempt to kill her backfires when a man kills her attacker. After this, the gunfight starts. The action in the movie is good, but it is a little bit slow paced, and the gunfights are pretty tame. The characters are not the best. Some of them are very stupid. It is really hard to believe that these men were out on the frontier in the late 1800's. They had not been in contact with any civilization. I suppose the idea was to portray the men as "out of control", and to make them look stupid, rather than to be "good guys".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Jupiter Ascending"  is a great movie with a great premise: "I'm going to space, so I'm going on a crazy journey to get there"   The premise is a brilliant way to get a movie off the ground: a teenager on an interstellar adventure.    This movie has a great blend of science fiction and fantasy with an interesting and imaginative story.  The film is also pretty funny, and a little heartwarming too.  I've seen the film twice, and I'm still not completely sure how I feel about it.  For a movie about a boy going to a strange new world, it seems like it takes a long time to get to that place.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the film does a good job of establishing a sense of wonder and adventure that you don't feel long before the characters finally make it there.  "Jupiter"  (The first part of the movie) is a great example of how the film has the ability to tell a story with great visuals and incredible set pieces.  It is visually stunning, as well as very well paced.  There are a lot of cool sequences in the film, and the performances are very good.  At first, I thought the film would be much more interesting if the characters were more well developed, and if the film did not use so much special effects.  But, it's a well made film that I recommend everyone see.  Recommended to people who enjoy fantasy films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** It's a classic, a classic of the genre, but at the same time a very different kind of classic: the kind of movie that can be made and shown in almost any part of the world, that can make its audience laugh, and that makes them ask themselves: why? The whole movie is based on the theme of the impossibility of living in peace with oneself. A man is about to commit suicide, but when the doctor who is about in the next room is murdered he becomes obsessed with the question of what would have happened if he had taken his own life. In a way the story is a little too simple. It's an attempt to make a movie that would be able to tell about a very important question: what would we do if we had all the problems that we face? But I think that this is a very serious question, because it's the same question that the human race faces in general. There's a question that a lot of people have that I think a lot more people should ask: why did we do it? We did it because we needed the power, and we needed to feel we were powerful. We wanted to feel powerful. That's the only reason that the movie is a classic. ********************* **************************

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Devil's Advocate" is a comedy film about two men, a lawyer (Bruce Willis) and a judge (Steve Buscemi) who are trying to get their respective husbands out of jail. It's a long movie and it's a good one. The plot is simple, a man has a difficult time in jail, he's a lawyer, so he is very clever. However, he can't help himself, he gets very drunk and he starts having a lot of sex. The rest of the film follows the couple trying to figure out a way out of prison, the story is quite amusing and it never goes out of it's way to be melodramatic or overly sentimental. Bruce Willis is quite the comic, he really brings the character to life, but at the same time he is the man who makes it all seem possible. Steve Buscem is also quite funny and he is a good actor. It is a movie that is not very long but it's entertaining. It would be a good film to watch with a group of friends.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Tales of the City" (1974) is the first installment of the Tales of the Zombie Trilogy. The first film, "Tale of the Dead" (1971), is an excellent film, and also a good zombie film. The second film, "Tale to the Grave" (1973), is a very interesting, albeit a little boring, film. This movie is set in a haunted house and the main character, George, is a dead-man walking. He is pursued by his fellow human beings and is often in danger. This is a film with a few of the most inventive and fun special effects ever to appear on the screen. It is also a movie that is fun to watch. It has a lot of the humor and the horror elements are all present and correct.   I think it is worth watching just for the fun of it.  "Tales to the Cemetery" (1970) is a good horror film, but a little dull. I have always enjoyed watching this film, as it has a good combination of horror, humor and action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not expecting much from this movie, but I was surprised to find a very good movie, and I think that is because of its characters. The story of the movie is told by a man named John Henry. He has lost his wife to the flu and his son to the same. He is not the best father, but he tries to do everything he can to make the best out of the situation. But then his son dies of the flu, and this upsets him. He blames the flu on the doctor and the doctor blames it on the flu. He wants to blame the flu so that he can blame the doctor. It's a mess. But the movie has a lot of interesting elements and the plot is very interesting. I was very interested in this movie because of the characters, and the film had some great acting, and great cinematography. I don't think this movie is perfect, but it is worth a watch if you want a movie that is a little different.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A young girl lives in a house she builds in the woods. She lives alone, and she's not much to look at. She's only ever seen on a screen by the occasional bird, and her home, a little cottage, sits in the center of a clearing in the trees.   Her neighbors are her dog, a strange little creature called a fox, and a little bear named Mr. Fox.  In the beginning, she doesn't know that she's a fox.  Her mother is kind, gentle, and patient.  One day, her mother is killed by a boar.  The young girl is upset about her mother's death.  She begins to hunt the boar and her father tries to stop her.  Things don't go well.  Eventually, the young girl finds the boAR and destroys it.  As a result, the boars are gone, and the young fox, Mr.Fox, is no longer lonely.  Soon, the little fox finds another fox. Both the fox and the little girl enjoy their new-found friendship.  It seems that everything in this little tale is based on a true story.  My only complaint is that there are too many references to the Bible in this story. I understand the intent behind the story, but it does get a little tedious after a while.   Read the full review...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an oldie, but a goodie. It is based on a true story about a young girl who falls in love with a young man who is from the other side of the world. This film was directed by the great Sam Peckinpah and it was a hit in its time.  In a way, it is the same as 'The Wild Bunch'.  The story is about a boy named Ben who is sent to England to live with his uncle who runs a farm. Ben is a poor boy who has a knack for singing and acting and he makes the people of the village laugh. The uncle tells him that he will leave the farm to go to boarding school but Ben decides to stay in the village to continue his singing. Ben's singing is not so good, but he does have a special talent and that is being a hero in his school play. In the play, he must do things that he cannot do and it is hard to watch.   Ben's uncle leaves the farm and Ben goes to boarding class at a convent. He meets the nun who is a little older than Ben, and he falls in with the girls.  In this film, Peckinpan is no doubt the most charismatic and interesting actor to have been born in the United States. He was a very bad actor but he could really bring a character to life.  Peckinpa was also a master of directing. It shows in every frame of this film. There is an endless amount of beautiful landscapes and landscapes that you are constantly reminded of when you watch this film (though I am sure it will soon be gone).  Peckinspan was a big star in the early 50s, and I hope that there are more movies to come from him.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad to have found this movie. I am not a fan of horror films. I have seen all the bad ones and some of the good ones. The bad ones are bad because they are cheesy. The good ones are good because they make you feel that you are living in the horror movie world. I like how this movie is shot and edited. The movie is set in an old abandoned hospital and the people who stay there seem to be very scared.   It is not a horror film. It is a psychological thriller with a lot of twists and turns. It takes you on a journey into the world of the insane and makes you think about the human mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this film is very enjoyable. I was a bit shocked at how good it is.   I'm still very surprised that a film of this genre was made in 1980.  And this is not even the first time that this film was released.  The director was a man named Robert Redford, and he directed this film for himself and the producers, and I believe that this was his only film.  There was a lot of action and violence in this film, and a good part of the film is about a man (Robert Redford) who is out to rescue a man and his wife from a group of men who have taken their son.  Robert Redfern is really a good actor and the character he plays is really very strong.  At times, he can be really annoying.  However, the acting is still good and the story is very good.  I enjoyed the film a lot.  This is a good film to watch if you are a fan of Westerns, especially the ones about the Old West.

The movie is quite funny, the characters are well drawn and the action scenes are a nice change of pace.   The movie was written in the form of a novel by Stephen King. It is a horror story about a family and a little girl named Laura (played by Natalie Wood), who have recently moved to a new house and are unaware of the sinister events that are going on in the house and nearby woods.  It's a good story, and the movie is enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second movie in the Star Wars Trilogy was one of the most impressive Star Wars films of all time. It's the third installment of the prequel trilogy, which I'm still waiting for.   It has so much going on.  From the very first scenes we see Han Solo and Princess Leia on a desert planet, in a cave that leads to a gigantic structure, that looks like a spaceship. It looks like the whole thing is on fire, and a bunch of giant beasts run up to the ship. They seem to be trying to stop the ship, and it seems like they are successful. However, they are not. The ship blows up and then it is revealed that the creatures are aliens. Han is captured and the creatures begin to attack. There are many, many scenes like this, where the action is incredibly fluid and exciting.  The only downside is that this is the only Star Wars movie where the robots are bad guys. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was actually a little bummed out that the director didn't take the opportunity to actually make the movie a little more fun, like maybe just throw in a few more jokes and the movie would have been a lot more entertaining than it was.  But I guess it doesn't matter because it was still very entertaining.      This is a good comedy that I recommend to anyone who likes a good old fashioned slapstick comedy with lots of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well made film, a good idea for a movie.   I liked the concept and the way it was shot.  If I ever see this movie again I'll watch it again with a smile on my face.   Rated 5 out of 5 by dtjf from Excellent film about the real life of the original Stonewall.  I loved this film, and it does a good job of portraying a part of American history that has been so heavily distorted. The actors were excellent, and the director, Ira Levin, did a good, if not great job.  The film's message was well chosen. The message was that the gay community has always been here, and always will be.  This film is not about the Stonewell rebellion, it is about the fight for LGBT rights.  It's about equality. It's not about celebrating Stonewalls past, it's about celebrating the future.

The first half of the movie is filled with action and excitement and there is a great chase scene at the end. The characters all have their own personalities, and are all great. I was not really a fan of the "Lost" series, but I like this movie more. The only downside to the movie was that the ending was just a little bit off.

His best friend and surrogate father, a wise and good-natured old man, attempts to get him back to normal by telling him stories about a famous ballplayer, and the boy's dream of becoming the best in the world becomes a nightmare.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â "The Road to El Dorado" is the most enjoyable western ever made. I don't know if it's because of its fantastic production values or because of the outstanding cast, or both. Â All of the characters are excellent, and you feel their emotions as you follow them through the treacherous journey.  A lot of things in this film are believable, from the hardships of the journey to the hardships the people face once they reach El Dorados.    And of course, the horseback riding!   I think "The Way to El Dora" is an amazing movie, and the best western I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. The movie is based on the book "The Last Temptation of Christ" by Jonathan Cott. The book tells the story of the final days of Jesus before he was crucified. The author writes about how Jesus was taken to Jerusalem, but the disciples did not believe him. The disciples then sent out some spies to ask the Romans if Jesus was really a Messiah. They were told that he was, and they asked him to come and speak to them. He then did so, but this time the disciples were not convinced. He told them that he would go to Jerusalem in the near future and then he would return. It seems to me that the film was not good because there were too many changes that I didn't like. I thought that there was a better way of telling the story and I would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not like good films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a masterpiece. I think it is the greatest movie of all time.   The movie is based on a book of the same name by Joseph Conrad. It is about the life of a Russian sailor in the war.  There is some great dialogue between the sailor and a young German officer.  It is a very good movie and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie does not have many scenes that are interesting, it is mainly about the journey of two young guys who are going to a concert together. It is about a trip of the two men to a place that is very interesting and also very funny.  It is not a comedy, it has no jokes in it, it does not use any of the most common tricks of the comedy, but it is a very interesting movie that shows how a good guy can become a very bad guy, if he is not careful.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "The Man from Earth" (1946) was a popular American science fiction movie that was directed by Charles Vidor. The film starred George Murphy as the alien scientist from Earth who had come to Earth to study the Earthlings, and to help them prepare for an invasion by the Martians. The Martians arrived and were very friendly and helpful. The aliens showed the Earth people how to use primitive weapons, and gave them the means to build nuclear weapons. The Earth people soon realized the threat, and they started to develop their own weapons. One of the more interesting scenes in the movie is a fight scene between the Earth humans and the Martian humans. In the end, the Martynians were all killed, but the Earthmen still had the chance to get their revenge. The movie was a great success and made a lot of money for its makers. The best thing about the movie was its originality, as it was one of the first films to show aliens on a large scale. It was an impressive production, and a great movie to see. - June 5, 2005Great film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The King's Speech" is a movie that's got everything you'd want from a movie - a compelling story, a great cast, a fantastic soundtrack and the acting is great, especially from the leading man himself, Tom Hanks.  The movie is very well acted and is a very well crafted piece of work.    "The King of Siam" is based on a true story and the movie is a true historical piece.  It's the story of a young man who is the king of Sia, a small country in the west of Thailand.  In the beginning of the movie, he is very young and naive.  He has an easy time living with his sister and their uncle.  Soon, though, he grows into a very wise and worldly man who grows up with the help of his advisor, a wise man named Thongprao.  Thongpaoro is a great character and makes the film even better.  But he isn't the only great character in the movie.  The rest of the cast is very good.  Even the animals in the country are portrayed very well.  " The King of Kings Speech"  is a beautiful movie that will bring you a smile and a smile will bring a smile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most important thing about this movie is that it is not just a good horror movie, but also a very good movie with a great story, a good character and a good ending.   I like this movie and I recommend it to everyone who likes scary movies and who likes the movies about zombies, because this movie, is an example of what can be done with the best effects that the Hollywood has to offer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** The movie is called "Losing My Religion". The movie stars Jeff Daniels, a Christian missionary who travels to India to help save his daughter from a life of prostitution. It is also directed by Michael Winterbottom, who made the great "The Best of the West" about a Christian Missionary who gets caught up in a love triangle between a young Hindu girl and an American who is in love with her. The movie also stars Susan Sarandon as a Hindu girl who falls in love and falls in with the American. "Loving" and "Saved" also starred Richard Gere. This movie has the great Jeff Daniels and Susan Sarandons playing the Indian girls and the great Richard Geren, who was one of the best screen actors of the last 50 years. It also had great songs, including "Don't Be A Fool" and many more. The Indian girl is played by the great Devika Rani, who has a lot of sex scenes in this movie. This is a good romantic movie, even though it was about an American Indian girl and Indian guy. The only problem with the movie is that it is too long. It was a good comedy, but I didn't find it funny at all. It might have been too long for the audience. The ending was a little bit disappointing because the Indian girl died and the American died in the end. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story starts out with a group of friends who are bored at their jobs and decide to join a movie theater. They start off with a boring performance of the classic musical "Grease" and they get more and more irritated. They all start to go crazy and start acting out their problems. The movie starts off with the girls at the bar singing about how much they hate their husbands. They get into a fight with a guy at the door. They then start fighting each other and then their husbands come in to settle things down. I was so impressed with this movie and I don't think that it gets old until the end.   This is a fun movie to watch and I was in for a good laugh as well.

The plot revolves around a guy named Jack, a guy with a dream of being a singer.    He meets his dream girl, a woman named Mary, who is from a small town.  But before he can get to her, Jack is thrown into a world he didn't know existed, a world of demons and a lot of blood.  Jack must use his singing voice to destroy the evil before it can take over.

It is a movie about the friendship of two guys who are in love with each other and who are also both big goofs! They both think the other one is a wimp and are both very jealous of the girl he has a crush on. They try to get him to confess to her and make him love her, but all he wants to do is keep her to himself! This movie was a bit of a laugh riot, but I think the humor would be better if there was more of the goofiness!

So they go out and kill a bunch of deer. In the woods.  And there's some weird stuff going on.  The guy who's in charge of the rifle has a long red beard and is wearing a big fur hat.

It was not long after I watched the first movie that I knew I wanted to see the original again and here it is.  The movie itself is pretty much the same story, but it does not have the same charm.

I also think it is pretty funny that the lead guy has a girlfriend who is a total whore.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "When a man can't help himself he goes back in time to kill his wife in the womb and her baby."  - William F. Nolan, Time Enough at Last (1983)   Time Enough at First is a fascinating historical drama. This is a true story about a man who is trying to get back at his wife who he believes murdered his wife and their unborn child. But this is a classic time travel movie, so there's plenty of action and adventure to keep things interesting.  The film is based on a true life story, but there are some twists. For example, there are no "wombats" in the movie, just an old man who has been living in a cave for the past 100 years and has been trying to kill himself. But he does have a very close relationship with a young girl and a young boy. The boy, John, is very attached to the old man and even looks up to him as his father. The movie does a very good job of showing how a father and son can bond, and even come to be close friends. The old man in the film also has a daughter named Sarah who has a very sad and unhappy life. There is a great deal of suspense in this film, but not much time is spent on it. This movie is about a real man's journey back in the past to kill a woman he believed murdered his family.   The acting is good. This film is not exactly Shakespeare, but the performances are all well done. A lot of the time is wasted in the long speeches from the old folks, but they do a good job. The only real acting problem is the man who played the old gentleman. He has a horrible English accent, and it's hard to understand him at times. The story is well told and the characters are well portrayed.   the film is a bit slow, but it's not bad. There are some very suspenseful scenes, and there are a lot of people in the background. The time travel element is interesting, but does not over-burden the film. It is definitely worth watching. It has great music, and a good cast. The ending is a little strange, but this film is still worth watching, even though it takes a little time to get going.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a big fan of all sorts of movies. I'm a huge fan of the James Bond movies, especially from the 60's, and I'm still a huge James Bond fan. So, when I saw the casting of Daniel Craig as James Bond, I was thrilled. I've been a huge Daniel Craig fan for a long time, and this is an awesome casting. He's a good actor, and a very funny man. His style of acting is a bit more serious, but still has a lot of humour to it. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, and was glad to see that there are more adventures to come from James Bond. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that it's a little long. I think it would be better to cut it down, but there is still plenty of fun to be had. I give the movie a 7/10.

There are a lot of good fight scenes, and Chris fights a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the movie and the music is pretty awesome. I'm really not a huge fan of the first two Star Trek movies and so when I heard that the original Enterprise crew was coming back to the big screen I was pretty excited. The movie starts off pretty well. The ship has a problem and that's the fact that its computer can't deal with any more data and so they send a new crew to the ship.   The new crew is a bit like a rag tag bunch and they are pretty much all characters from previous Star Trek series. The first crew member is Lt. Uhura, a human woman who was captain of the Enterprise from 2263 to 2265.  I'm sure that most people would like her but I'm not sure if I'm a fan of her at all. She is pretty much just there to look pretty and act pretty and that isn't her best quality. Then there is Sulu, who was the first captain of a starship, the USS Enterprise, in 2266.  He is very commanding and knows how to get things done. He's the one that does the talking for the crew and is very much a captain on the bridge. There is Scotty, a half-human, half-Vulcan who was an engineer on the Enterprise, 2266 to 2267.  Scotty is the one who says "Hey, look over there! The Klingons are coming!" and this is a great moment. Scotty's character isn't that bad but I don't like his lack of individuality and the fact he has a human face. Next there is Chekov, a Russian, half Klingon, half Human.  Chekov has a good reason for being a Klingon.  They want to kill him because he has been a traitor to his people and is an alien. Chekov is also the only character who actually speaks Russian and the only one that actually talks like a human. He also has a decent reason for wanting to kill Kirk but I feel that the whole thing is a little over-the-top.  Finally there is Uhura's replacement as first officer, Dr. McCoy.  Dr. Spock is the only original member of the crew. He is the oldest and the most knowledgeable person of the group. He has a very calm and collected nature and a very good understanding of people.  The rest of the new crew are pretty average.  McCoy is very smart and very competent but he is also somewhat
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film that takes place in a haunted house.  The film starts off very slowly and I wasn't sure if I was in for a good film.  This is what I call a "stalking" film. But, that was before I came across this film.  This film is about a man (David) who goes to a haunted mansion and is stalked by a monster who lives there.  The film begins with David having a night out with his wife and the man in the house.    David is an actor who goes on the set of a film about the ghost who lives in the mansion.  He meets a young girl who is in a relationship with the ghost and she has a strange connection to him.   After this they begin to go out at night and David finds himself being stalked.   David and the girl have to find the killer.   The girl has a secret that the ghost must find out.  David must find the murderer before the monster does.  They find a mysterious diary that has a list of names that are written in it.  There are pictures and they try to find out who these people are.  It seems like a bad film, but it's not bad at all.  David goes into the mansion, which is a haunted place.  And, it is a creepy place.      There is a strange room that has people inside and out.  But, the person is not in there.       David meets a strange old woman and then he sees her ghost.     It is really a nice film and the ghost was very creepy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie! It's like a cross between an old school classic like "Jaws" and "The Goonies." It's about a bunch of kids who go on a treasure hunt in the desert. The treasure is a gold watch that was given to the kid who would end up saving the whole group by finding it. The kid has a lot of adventures. It's got all the usual suspects like the water that runs uphill, the rock with no name, and the kid that gets lost, but it is a lot more fun. I'd recommend this movie to any fan of adventure stories.

One of the members of the gang is a wannabe actor named Billy who is obsessed with his career. The other is the leader of the group, the hotheaded "Blackie" (who gets a bit annoying), the other is a dour, moody, but funny, "Duke" (I think he's the only one of the main gang to be called "Duc" or something like that). It's funny how they all like and use their girlfriends, but all the girls are not interested in them and most of them have very bad taste.  Anyway, the plot involves a gang who are trying to escape from a dangerous and violent area. The only problem with the plot is that it's almost too long.    The only good thing about this movie is that there is one very good song in it.

I'll be honest.    I didn't love this movie.     But I did like the way it was done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Lone Ranger" movie is a fine example of a good old western.  There are two different sets of heroes in this movie, one who's a real loner, and the other who's more of a "lone wolf" type of guy.    In both cases, the hero is a character that you can get along with.  He's just an average guy, not a good guy, but not a bad guy either.  The plot is good, but it's not great.  There are some good action scenes in the movie, but they're not too elaborate.  However, there are some great shots, and a few good moments in the middle, but there aren't that many good scenes, and none of the scenes are that great.     The movie is about an American named Jack Reid who's on his way to a frontier town to take a job as a sheriff.  At this point, he's been out of action for a while, and he's ready to get back to work.  His first stop is a town called Green River.  When he gets there, he meets the Sheriff, a guy named Jim.  Jack decides to take his job and stay.  So, this movie is not a story about a hero who gets revenge, or a hero in love.  It's a story of a character who's ready for work, who gets his job, and who comes back to the town that he grew up in.  This movie has a very good ending, and it does set the stage for some of the other great stories to come from this film.  I was surprised by how well this movie did, and I was happy with how it ended.  While I don't consider this movie to be a classic, it's a good example of what a good western should be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie for the first time recently. I've seen it several times in the last couple of years but I never liked it as much as I did on this recent viewing. I think it's one of the best action movies of the 1980s, and one of my favorite 80s action movies. The movie opens with a bang, as we cut to a group of characters, who are sitting around the table in the house of an old man. There's a gun, a bunch of bottles of liquor and a gun case. They've been up all night and haven't slept in a couple of days. They all have plans to get together to get away from the "fearsome" men that are coming after them. The old man is a gun collector and the group have just bought a pistol from him. It's one that the older guy uses for a while but eventually he has to replace it. There are a few other characters in this movie that you will know but I'm not going to spoil them for you. I found this movie to be very enjoyable and a good time. It had a great script and I loved the action and the humor. The story is a bit of a long way from the book, but it does end up having some action and a great ending. I'd recommend this movie if you like action, action, and more action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of films are shot in the same location over and over again, but rarely do they come up with anything so different from the last.   But the most remarkable thing about this movie is how close it comes to coming up with something new.  The film starts off with a young boy getting lost in a desert, and then it quickly goes downhill from there.  In the beginning we get a quick glimpse of a desert that is almost black, and the boys journey seems to be on a train that moves along.  But as soon as they stop at a train station, they see a sign saying the station is closed and the station manager, a man named Bob (Robert Mitchum) comes running out to them saying that the station was closed because the wind blew in the wrong direction.  Bob then leads the boys into a cave where they are told that a tribe of people are buried there. But when they go in the cave, the boy and his friend are completely unaware of the fact that the cave is actually the grave of a famous explorer, Thomas Edison.  It turns out that Edison (who was known as "the man who invented the light bulb" in the early 1900s) was a very wealthy inventor and businessman who worked with the locals and was a good friend of Bob.  Unfortunately, his death at the hands of a vicious gang of thieves caused him to be forgotten by the people of the town and they didn't know what to do with him.  After he is buried, Bob and his tribe of natives decide to go to the city of New York to dig him up and put him in a museum.  Soon after they get there, Edison's body is discovered and they begin the long process of trying to figure out who stole his body and how to bring him back.  When they finally do, they discover that Edison's corpse was horribly disfigured, and they figure out that it was done by someone with a strange ability called "The Power" who was trying to prove his power to avenge the death of a former friend.  And just as they are getting close to bringing Edison back to life, Edison gets a new body.  So as they head back to New York, the two boys are forced to continue their quest to find out the secret behind Edison's new body, but they also have to deal with the fact they can no longer find the cave where Edison's spirit is.  This leads to some interesting and strange plot

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I have already stated, this is a decent movie. The story is pretty well-made, and it is a nice, long scene with a good story. There is a strong and dark undertone to the movie, but it is not as dark as it is in the trailer. It is very good in the way that it portrays the way the war is in Germany, and the way it is depicted is very realistic. The special effects are great, and there is a lot of action. The movie is fairly long, but there is no dull moment. It has some good laughs, and some good character development. I liked it, and I am sure it will be a good one. It does a good job of getting into the mindset of the Germans during World War II.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the other films by these directors, so I don't know much about them. I can't really tell how good this movie is or isn't.   It has a good plot.  There's an old man who's had enough of his old job and wants a new one, but he doesn't have any money.  He decides to take a job at a factory and see if he can make a little extra cash.  The story is set in the same time period as the other two, but the story is a bit more down to earth.  I like the old guy.      The characters in this are great.  John Cusack is a great actor.  There's a lot of humor in this.  A lot of people complain about the bad acting, but this is a movie with a lot.  It's a movie I want to see again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good film and has many good points. The movie is made by an Irish director who obviously knows how to use his camera. The acting is also good and the story is well told. I can see that this film is not as popular in Ireland as in England or the US but that is because it is very old. If you are looking for a good old movie that is funny, entertaining and has a good story then you must watch this.   Reviewed by: John H

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching this movie for quite a long time and still haven't seen the end yet. This movie is a classic and one of the best comedies ever made. The film is all about two young men who are both quite handsome and have a lot in common. When one of them is on vacation in Paris he meets a woman named Marion (played by Shirley MacLaine) who seems to have an interest in him. She also has a young daughter named Marley (played wonderfully by Diane Keaton). Marion doesn't seem to like her husband much and she and the husband have a very bad marriage. One night Marion visits a bar called "The Jungle" and sees a man named "Lionel" (played hilariously by John Cleese). He is there to meet a girl and he seems to be in a rather unhappy marriage. This is a good place to meet Marion and Lionel, and this movie is good because of it. The story of the movie is very funny and it has a lot of great character development. The movie is also very funny. I would recommend this movie to everyone and I will always watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man with the Golden Gun is a film with a lot of interesting and unique ideas.  I'm a huge fan of the John Woo films and this one is no different.  I'm also a huge Bruce Lee fan and I think that this film could be a huge hit.   The story is a lot like the other great films he did: "Enter the Dragon" and "Enter The Dragon 2".    The story is great but the acting is not.  I don't think that the actor who plays the martial arts master Bruce Lee is good enough to make me like him.  It is too bad that the story doesn't go anywhere with Bruce Lee and the other actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A pretty good horror film. The movie is about a group of friends who decide to leave the country. The kids are all pretty scary, but they are still funny and they're not stupid, just immature. I think that the only bad thing about the movie is the ending. It didn't add anything to the movie and it just seemed to be an after thought. I also don't understand how this movie is rated as low as it is. This is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I have ever seen.   There is a wonderful little village called Mulberry Valley, and it is home to the local school's first-grade class.  When the principal announces the arrival of the new teacher, a very beautiful girl named Miss Cuddington, he immediately starts getting all sorts of attention from the other boys.  Miss Cuddie is the only one of the group who is not a pretty girl.  This girl is not only beautiful, but she is very good at everything.  She is also very shy and a little withdrawn, but is very strong and determined.  The other boys think that they can teach her, but Miss Cuddy can't be taught.  There's one thing she can be taught, and that's patience.  At the beginning of the school year, Miss Cudington is a little nervous about her first class of students.  But she is not too bad, and in fact is one of those wonderful teachers who makes her students want to do good things in life.  Then one day she gets to the subject of the art of painting, and the boy in her class who always tries to be good is now in great trouble.  It is a terrible mistake.  As she works, Miss Mary Cuddley is painting her student's picture.  Once he is finished, he asks Miss Coddington to give him a drawing of her own.  And that is what she does.  Her students and friends are in awe of her skill.  They all love her.  Their teacher is so good, they are not sure why she isn't in high school.  When she is a senior, a boy from another class comes up to her and asks her to draw a picture of him.  He wants her to be able to paint his hair.  What happens next is one to be seen.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want a good thriller, look no further than " The Man Who Knew Too Much "  A lot of people have been talking about this film for quite a while now.  The plot is as follows: A retired NYPD officer is in his apartment when his doorbell rings.  It's his late wife, Betty.  He's there to pick her up to go to their old apartment.  Betty, however, isn't there.  Her purse is gone and she is bleeding from the nose.  As she's about to die, she's heard a voice and sees a man in a hoodie standing behind her.  His name is John Doe.  She's terrified and screams, but he keeps staring at her and she runs away.  John Doe and Betty leave the apartment building together and John Doe runs down a flight of stairs and the door slams behind him.  A few days later, Betty is found dead in her apartment. She died from a heart attack.  How did John Doe know she was dead?  And how did he get there in the first place?  He doesn't have a car and his name is Doe. This film has a lot of heart and is a good little thriller.  If you like detective stories, you should see this.

I was instantly hooked and I had no doubt that this was going to be the best Star Trek movie ever made. I watched this movie three times. It has everything you could want in a Trek movie. The plot was good, the acting was excellent and the special effects were just a bonus.   Star Trek: First Contact was a really great movie. It was an awesome way to start a new series. I loved it and I hope it never ends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a real classic of the genre. It was a big deal back in the late 60's and early 70's. It also got some pretty good reviews. There are a couple of actors I'd like to see more of:  Robert Conrad in this movie is like a young Clark Gable. He's a good actor, but this is his only major role. He looks a little older and more "grown up" than he really is, which is a bit sad. It's not like he's a bad actor. He does some pretty funny stuff. And a young Bruce Campbell is also great in this film. There's a great deal of sex and nudity in this picture, which I think it deserves. I do have a couple problems with this movie. One is that the story is so long that it's difficult to follow it. It goes on a long time. There isn't a whole lot of action, but there are a lot of people getting shot. I think the best scenes in the movie are in the third act, where it's just Campbell and Conrad fighting, with the other actors not really playing much part in the action. It doesn't feel like a lot is going on, but it's a fun and interesting film. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good old fashioned Western.

I think this is the only film about the Battle of Gettysburg that I will ever see again.  There are a lot of films that try to tell the story of the battle of Gettysburgh.    I've been waiting a long time for a movie that tells the whole story in a way that is accurate and realistic.      This film does a good job at that and there are some scenes that are hard to watch.  The actors were all great and it's a good time to see a movie about the Gettysburg battle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if I can call the movie "Good" at all. It's not bad, but it's not good either. The story is kind of funny, but I don the story is basically about a group of guys trying to rob a bank, which they fail at. The guys are all very drunk and talk about how they want to rob more banks. They make a bad bank, they go to a bar to have a drink and talk. When they leave, the guy who lives there is not home. So, they head to his house, find a car, and drive to the bank. The bad bank was the best. It was so bad, I thought the guys had died. I laughed so hard, I had to lie down on the couch. I can't say I liked the movie. I guess it wasn't that bad. I think that it would be a great idea to do a remake of this movie. Maybe the story should be about a bank that has been robbed, and how the guys get back there and make it back to the police station and then back to their cars to get a drink. That way, you don't have to watch them fail to rob the bank, but the guys can just be drunk talking about their plans to rob another bank and get back to where they're going. That should make a better movie than this.

As a critic, I'm often impressed with the film's visual artistry.  The Grand Budapest is an enchanting tale about a young man who finds himself transported to a mystical and wondrous world, one that has many of the qualities of a fairy tale but is much more realistic.  This film is so enchanting that I was compelled to stay up until 1 am to catch a late screening, just to watch the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one was particularly bad.  The movie was made in 1980 and is set in a city called Nanking.    The movie shows the terrible atrocities that the Chinese did to the Japanese in Nanking during the war.  The Japanese, a bunch of arrogant and haughty people, were fighting the Chinese.  When the Chinese captured the Japanese at Nanking, they proceeded to torture and murder the Japanese soldiers and then eat them.  Then they had a banquet for the Chinese and the Chinese began to rape the Japanese.  After the Chinese ate the Japanese they had the Japanese men go and rape the women.  I won't give away too much of the plot, but I will say that the movie is pretty bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Tower"  is a solid film, if not the best, of the series. The story is set in the year 2880 and revolves around the titular "tower" in the center of a city in the shape of a "dark tower." The tower is in the process of collapsing due to a cataclysmic event and the people of the city are trying to figure out what is going on. The plot is mostly pretty good. The characters are likable and the dialogue is good. There is a nice twist at the end that I enjoyed. The special effects are pretty good but a bit boring and the story can get a little repetitive. This is a solid movie. It is worth watching for fans of the Dark Tower books. It may not be as good as the original trilogy, but it is still a fun watch. I give it a 4/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you've never heard of the film: it is a comedy about a man who decides to take his life. This is a pretty cool movie, but it isn't perfect. I'd say that the first half of the movie is okay. It has a decent pace. The second half has the same problem: it just gets boring. It feels like the movie was filmed by a low-budget director who didn't think twice about getting a mediocre cast together. The acting is average at best, with all the people doing it doing a bad job.   There are some cool things about the film, such as the use of a giant clock. This movie is pretty good. It's got a good plot, and some good humor. If you're looking for something new, this movie is a good choice. If not, I wouldn't waste my time on it.   a decent movie about a sad man who has to take a stand. This isn't a great movie, and it isn' t a bad movie either.

The only thing I didn't like was that the main character is too skinny and not attractive. I'm not saying this as a criticism because I was too young when this was made and I only saw it in a short time.

She says, that he shouldn't tell anyone, that it's a private thing. He doesn't believe her, and tells her that he is going to take a look at the car, he tells his mom and his little brother, and that they will be home soon.  Then a few days later the boy is home and finds his mother's purse open. He thinks she took his money.  He goes out to see what's going on.  They find a hole in a yard, and the car is still there.  the car isn't in working order, and it looks like it has a few holes in it, so he thinks it must be an old car. He digs a little bit more, and finds some tools and some wires. He puts them together and they are able to work the car again. It is the same car, only a bit better, it's still a little crazy, but still a pretty good car. It goes over well with the other kids.  In the middle of the night, the boy hears the boy's mother call him. He goes over and finds her standing in the middle the street. He walks over to her, thinking she is just tired. But she's very excited and tells him that she is having a party for her birthday. He asks if there is any food in the house. She tells him to come on in and sit down.  She tells the boy that the party is going on, and to come.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that felt like a good one so much.  It's a good story about a group of kids and a bad guy who is also their best friend.  The main thing I like about this movie is that it's really well written.    The characters are likeable and believable, and they have a good time with each other and with the bad guy.  It has a lot of great moments, and some really funny scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** This movie is a remake of the original "Ripley's Believe It or Not." The remake is a little more humorous, but the story is still about a woman named Ripley (Jodie Foster) who is an adventurer, and who finds out that her house is on a secret government research facility. The film starts out with a strange, eerie music and some scary, distorted shots. The actors are all good, but it isn't a film I would watch for the characters. *************************** I was surprised that the director of the film was the great, silent film director Howard Hawks, and that he used this technique in the film. I was also very impressed with the cinematography. This movie was good, not bad, but good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Weird, but funny:    In the same vein as the '60s British science fiction television series, 'Babylon 5', the sci-fi film 'Dracula' features a young scientist, played by John Carradine, who is hired to analyze the blood of a vampire which has attacked a young boy. He soon discovers the vampire is in fact the son of a Roman vampire, and that the vampire has been killing his own children. As the vampire's own blood is also turning into vampire blood, he is able to control them and has been taking them all over Europe. As he begins to control all the vampires he is also beginning to control the vampire blood that he has been producing, until he is finally able to take over the entire European vampire population. As it is too late to stop his plan, the only thing left for the Doctor to do is to try and cure the vampires of their vampiric tendencies, by using a'mummified' human skull. The'mummy' (played by a young actress named Joanne Woodward) is a vampire who is being watched by the young girl, played the brilliant Julie Christie. The two are also joined by a German scientist (played here by the very good Paul Kincaid) who is attempting to kill the vampire and prevent him from spreading his blood. In addition, there are two American scientists (who are also'mummies') who are trying to find the blood that the Doctor has stolen, as they believe it to be a cure to all vampishness. As they begin to get more involved with the vampire, they become more and more convinced that it is the best cure to their vamps. However, when they find out that the only cure is blood that has been stolen by the Doctor, they begin a hunt for him. As with most of the other British series, the acting is very good, and the story is really good as well. The action is really impressive as well, and it features a really good script. However it is a bit strange that the film was made in the US, since it was made entirely in the UK.

I knew this was a classic before I watched it, but I didn`t realize how amazing it is until now.   It`s like The Godfather Part II with a little more heart.  A great film, I love this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I loved this movie and I still love it. The movie has a very unique atmosphere. It's got this old west vibe, a bit of the western and it has a story line that keeps going and going. There are a lot of action scenes, plenty of gun fights and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, but at the same time it's not so fast paced and I felt like I was watching a good, old fashioned western movie. This is a good western movie and a good action movie at the end of the day. I gave it a 4 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a classic, and I can understand why people love it. The movie is about the life of a boy named William F. Buckley Jr. (Robert Redford) and his parents (Lois and the late Jack Buckley). William was a very intelligent child who was always the one who did things himself. He was the class clown in school, but was also an accomplished athlete, and excelled at math, history, and geography. William was also a genius at physics and chemistry, and as such, he wanted to study these subjects at college. But it was not to be, for the two most important decisions of his life would have a direct impact on his future.  William's mother, Lois (Kathy Bates), died of cancer in his fifth year of high school. Her death was an accident. She had been reading a book and was walking outside the house when a bus hit her. William and his sister, Jane (Diane Keaton), went to her funeral and his father was left to deal with the loss of his wife. This caused a huge amount of tension between William and Jack, and Jack began to act more out of control, making William question the direction his life had taken. William had begun to have feelings for a girl named Betty (Mary Steenburgen), but Jack had become very jealous of William's love. The situation would get worse for Jack as a result of William being with Betty.  The tension between these two grew so bad that Jack had to find a new job. After he lost his job, William had to face the fact that his life might be in jeopardy. Betty was now pregnant with a child, and a boy had been born to Betty and William. Jack was determined to prevent William from marrying Betty, and he would go to any lengths to do so. He sent William out to a nightclub, where William met and began to fall in love with a woman named Betty, whom he found attractive. Betty's husband had been killed by a hit-and-run driver, and William felt sorry for her. This gave him an opportunity to act on his jealousy and to seek revenge on William. Betty left William for William, but Jack followed her. He found out that William was now in a relationship with a beautiful blonde named Betty's son, who was named Michael (Bradley Cooper). Jack then began to follow Betty and Michael around and, with the help of some thugs, he got a gun and shot Michael

Â They have to help each other find a way out of the house by doing chores, playing pranks on each other, and just living the life of kids who just happen to have a haunted house in their neighborhood.  They all look like they could be little old ladies, but the girls can kick the crap out of anyone they put in front of them.        This is a good old fashioned movie that has some great acting, a great plot, and a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of horror movies, especially those that feature vampires. I am always interested in how a vampire lives and I am glad to see that the vampires in this film are quite different from other vampires.   The film starts out in a small town in upstate New York where there is a vampire who is known as "The Man Who Saw Too Much". He is a very nice man and a good family man. He lives in a large house with a large yard and lots of room for his vampire family. His wife is a beautiful vampire who has a very good figure and a very sexy vampire daughter. He is very well liked by the locals who are afraid of the vampire because he can bite them without the victims even knowing it.  When the man hears that his daughter has a boyfriend, he decides to go to the town and find out about this boyfriend. When he arrives, he finds out that this boyfriend is a young man who looks like a cross between an ape and a monkey. The man is called "The Thing" and he is a real strange character. The Thing is very quiet and does not say much. He walks around in a very peculiar way that makes him look very odd. He does not have a mouth and he only has four fingers on his left hand. His right hand is missing and he uses his left to eat and to do other strange things. The only way the Thing can speak is by moving his hand. He also does not speak English and the only thing he seems to understand is that his wife is in danger. The Man Who Sees Too Much and The Thing begin to have a quarrel. The thing is afraid of The Man, especially when The Man does not understand him and when The Thing finds out the man is a cross-breed and the Man who Sees too Much is a human. He decides that he will do everything in his power to get The Man's attention and the two men begin to fight.  One of the first things that The Thing does is bite The Man and he feels terrible pain in his arm. He then starts to get very curious about the Man and starts to do strange things with the Man's house.  It is at this point that the film starts to become very disturbing and disturbing. It is so disturbing that I had to keep rewinding the movie to watch it again because it was so hard to watch. The things that the Thing does are quite strange and the story just gets
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* "I love this movie. This is a really cool little story about a guy who is trapped in a giant vacuum that only sucks air and who has to get to a girl that has come to help him get to the end of the vacuum and escape." I think that it is a good story and a great movie. The plot is really simple. The guy is trapped inside a giant vacuum. He's trapped in the vacuum by his girlfriend and her mother. He gets out of the vacuum by using his special air pump to suck air out. The movie starts out with the girl talking about how they are both in love and then we see the two of them in a restaurant. There's a long conversation about the vacuum, the vacuum is about to suck them out and they need to get out of it. They don't get out the vacuum before the machine sucks them out of there. The girl's mother tells her about her sister and how she needs help getting out of that vacuum. Her sister comes up with a plan to get help from a little boy who lives in a tree. He tells her he will help her out and then he starts sucking out the air from the vacuum. They escape the vacuum but the little boy is sucked out by the machine. They get out and run to the nearest building. The mother tells the girl she has a baby. The little boy comes up to her and he gives her his shoes and a pen. He then says to her "It's me" and then she puts the shoes and pen in his hand and he goes away. It is just a short movie and a good one. It has a good ending and it is just fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the late 1800's a young woman in rural Tennessee is accused of murdering her husband.  She is a victim of the witch trials, a period of hysteria, in which men were accused of all manner of offenses.  A modern day witch hunt in the 19th century.  The trial is presided over by a judge named Judge William Walker.  It's a very strange, slow paced, well-acted and very sad movie.   The plot of the movie is very simple:  the young woman, Elizabeth Wood, is accused by her mother and the town elders of the murder of her husband and a number of others.  She was only 13 when the murder occurred and is only 17 at the time of the trial.  There are many scenes in this movie that seem to take place in the past and it is obvious from the beginning that Judge Walker is a man of his time.  He is a staunch abolitionist who believes in the innocence of black people and sees his role as trying the witch cases as a way of bringing justice to the poor and ignorant.  Walker is not very good at his job though and it becomes clear that his belief in the guilt of the accused has caused him to make some very stupid decisions.  But Walker is also a very decent man and he has a child that is in love with him.  I really enjoyed this movie and think that you will too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has an old fashioned style. I can't help but be reminded of "The Wizard of Oz". This movie is not for the faint of heart. The acting is good, but I wish they used more real people instead of the usual "actor" who just sits there and "acts" out. But I really like the movie, it's well acted, well written, well acted (and directed) and is a good story. It has a great ending. It's not perfect, but it's good enough to keep you interested. If you like fantasy or horror then this is a nice movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great action movie.    Review by: D. G. From: New York I would have liked to have seen more of it. I am not a great martial artist and the choreography is a little much for me to handle. The film is about a group of assassins who are trying to kill a Chinese emperor, but they get caught up in a battle with a French knight. The French knights are good fighters and the film was really good. The cast of characters are all well acted and I think the story will be better for the fact that the story line is more of a "what if" than a "who is" scenario. This is a great film and I recommend it to everyone who loves a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter is very fond of the movie, and has already asked me to watch it again.   In my opinion, the movie is really good, and is a must see.  The movie is set in the year 1944, and in a world of constant wars and terrorism.  There are only a few people left in Europe to escape the Nazi's, the Russians and the Japanese, and the Americans are trying to prevent them from getting there.  A young man named Will (Willard Scott) is trying to get away from the horrors of war by making a movie.  Will, who is an amateur filmmaker, has made several movies before, but never gets to show them.  He has a girlfriend (Helen Mirren) who is working on a movie, but the script has not been finished.  The two of them meet, but Will has a lot of trouble with the production of his movie, especially when he tries to set up a shooting. Will's best friend (John Hurt) has to help him, and Will has to travel to England to make the movie. The movie is called "The General." Will has never seen the movie before, and he is not good at making it. Will has also been living on the streets, and will need a few friends to help out.  One night, Will is shot by the Japanese. He is taken to a Japanese hospital where he is saved. Will and Helen Mirren return to America and have a successful movie. When they get back to England, Will wants to make a second movie about the Japanese and the Russians.  This is the movie that changed my life, and my children's lives, as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dangerous Game"   Directed by John Huston, with a screenplay by Robert Ludlum and a screenplay rewrite by John G. Avildsen.   It was in the 50's.  A young boy, Harry, is an orphan.  His mother has been killed and his father is a junkie.  Harry, with the help of a young gangster, has to find a way to get money to buy his way into the game of the Mafia.  As you can imagine, the game is a very dangerous game.  It's a story of revenge.  The film is very good.  I like the way the gangsters are portrayed.  They have a certain roughness to them that is not as present in the films of the 30's.   This film is about a young boy and a young man, who have both had their lives taken away from them.  While Harry is trying to make it to the big leagues, the Mafia is still at work on him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was my first time to see a movie about a group of people that do the best they can with a bunch of people they don't know.   In my opinion this movie was the best part of the movie.  There were so many funny things in this movie that I can't even remember all the parts.  The best part was when the main character was on his way to the hospital to give a speech about the importance of a family to each other and to society.  He is driving when he gets a call about the wife of a friend who is dying. He is in the hospital and is trying to get to the friend's wife in the last moments of her life.  His first thought is "What if I could have my wife with me?" Then the main guy asks him to have a good time and the two go on a ride around the city and then go to a bar where the main guys friend is dying of a heart attack.  When they get to his house he is so sad that he goes into his room and gets a hug from the wife and a kiss from her best friend.  This part was so funny.  And it ended with the main couple holding hands and laughing at a hospital.  I wish I could see this movie more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My Little Pony: The Movie" is the second animated movie by director and writer-producer Frank Thomas and writer Gary Goldman (who also wrote the script).  As with "My Little Ponies", this is a "pony-fantasy", a good fantasy.  I'd say that the animation is better than the first movie, but there is also an added feature, that is the music.  "My little Pony:The Movie"  It is a nice song, that has a nice melody.  The voice acting is also nice, especially Pinkie Pie.   Pinkie Pie in "My little Ponies"   The character that I think is the most realistic, and not to say that she is the character that you would want to live with, but she is an excellent character.  "MyLittlePonies" is a good cartoon, it is not too silly, but the characters are silly enough.  This movie is funny, I am not sure why it is so popular.  It is a short film, but I would like to see more of it.  I give it a 3.5 out of 5.

It's a very weak movie and I think that it's been a long time since the last one. I like it because it shows that a movie can be funny without any dialogue and if they had any good acting, then I think it would have been better. But no one is funny in this movie. The only one I like is the kid who says he's a ghost, so if you like that kind of movie, then this is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The first film of the third installment of the trilogy, this one deals with a young man named David. He has been taken away from his mother when she is in the middle of giving birth to him, as she is sick and can't make a proper delivery. He is taken to a boarding school, and while there, he is able to live with a bunch of kids, and he is taught to be a part of the gang by one of the kids, Chris. As David is going through puberty, he makes a discovery about his mother, that causes him to want to leave the school and go back to her, but he can't because he is still under the age of consent. So, he sets out to go back home, and finds out that his mother is now pregnant. However, there is a problem with the child, and it's the father, who was also at the boarding school when he was born. He had been molested, and David was told about this. This led to him having a bad attitude towards the family, and eventually David kills the father in an argument. So David goes back to the boarding, where he is introduced to the school's headmaster, a man named Mr. Stirling. David is given a job at the school, but while he is at work, he meets the headmaster's son, a boy named Chris. When Chris meets David, he thinks that David is "the kid who was molested," and that they have the same parents. The more that they get to know each other, the more they start to realize that they are not that similar. Chris and David soon become good friends. They find out that they share a secret that they had kept from each other. They have both been abused at some point in their lives. But when David is asked to do a job, he takes it, even though it is to kill a little boy, named "Hank." After David kills Hank, Chris goes to the police, and they come up with the right idea in going after the "bad guy." ___________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ -SCREENPLAY- Written by Richard Donner (co-writer of "A Bug's Life"), and Charles Roven (co writer of "Jaws") This is a good story. The plot is good. The characters are interesting. David has a problem that I really enjoyed watching him deal with. I didn't really like the idea of a boy
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen all the movies on this list and it still doesn't get old. It's just a good old fashioned adventure movie and a great one to see as it's only 22 minutes long and is perfect for any time of the day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Hush, Hush, Little Girl" is a lovely and moving story about a little girl who was orphaned and abandoned by her mother and father in the rural backwoods of North Carolina. She has been adopted by the Griggs family and is raised by them. She is smart and good-hearted, with a knack for making beautiful things. She also has a great sense of humor, but can be moody at times. She's also got a very strong will to live. The movie has a good balance of comedy, heartbreak, and sadness. It's a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought I was going to be disappointed with this movie. I really thought it would be some sort of bad version of a great movie. It turns out that was not the case. The story, for the most part, was fine. It did not have the most interesting characters and didn't do much to explore the theme of a man who, after the death of his wife, goes back to the same old world that he knows so well. It was not bad. I don't know what I expected, but the story wasn't so bad that it could not be good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't help but smile while watching this movie.  It's not a very good movie by any means, but the humor and good acting keep me entertained.  The only negative thing about this movie is the ending.    The ending is pretty pointless.  It's not like it adds anything to the movie. I found the ending too convoluted.  I guess the movie was supposed to be an homage to the original series, but it's not the same. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a classic, but not just for its story or its characters. The music is very much a part of the film, and it's a very good one, with the theme of rebirth that is in the film. The movie is a tribute to the best of the American film noir genre, with characters who are all real and human. The acting is wonderful, the story is interesting and the acting is very good. I can only recommend this film to fans of the genre, and also to those who like good mystery films, with an excellent score by Bernard Herrmann.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing about this movie is the ending. It's not quite the end of the world, but it does have some pretty severe implications.   This movie is not a bad one. It has its moments, and it's good enough to be entertaining. It can be a little bit over the top at times, but if you like good acting, a good story, and the best ending to a movie ever, this is a must see!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great, if a little short movie.   If you have any interest in horror and/or thriller you will probably like it.  I'm glad to see that the film was directed by a woman and the cast is very strong.  This film is based on the true story of a young woman named Elizabeth (Julie Dreyfuss) who works at a local hospital as a nurse.  She falls for a young doctor named Dr. Charles Logan (David Morse) who she meets at the hospital.  When Logan goes on a work trip to Europe she decides to go with him and the rest of the crew.  There is a great sense of danger throughout the film as Dr. Logan has to stay in Europe as well as Elizabeth is trying to keep her job at the Hospital.  One of the biggest issues I have with the film is how short it is.  The ending is also very weak.  It would have been nice to see a little more of the history of Dr. Clayton Logan and Elizabeth.  Perhaps there could have been a bit more time spent in Europe.  Overall I'm very happy that I watched this film as it's a good watch and the ending is good.  I have seen a lot of horror films in my life and this is one of the best I have ever seen.  In a world where people fear the dark, where people are scared of the unknown, this film has something that will make it seem more real.  After seeing this movie I have a feeling that I will never see a scary movie in a theater again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good thriller. It is a story of a man who tries to escape from the clutches of a serial killer. The killer is in fact the serial killer, who is trying to escape his own past, and has to kill again to bring himself to a new point in his life. This is the second time he has killed. The first time was because he killed the young woman he loved. This time, he has decided to kill his own son, because he knows it is the last chance he will get to be with the woman he loves. This man has become a monster. It has become clear that he is going to do the most awful things in his next life.   The killer has a plan, a plan that is very similar to the one he has come up with in the past. He is going through all of his victims, looking for a piece of the puzzle that will bring him back to life. The clues that he has found in his victims' lives point to the fact that the serial murderer is still out there. It does not matter if he is caught or not. His victims will have to live with the knowledge that there is someone out there who would kill and eat them in cold blood if he could.   a very disturbing movie that makes me want to look into serial killer films. It makes me think about what I would have done in his place.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was good.  It wasn't exactly the best, but it wasn't bad either.   I was really surprised by how good the writing was.  It wasn't too cheesy or cheesy like "Rocky".  It's not even cheesy like that crappy movie "Barely Lethal".  I don't even know what to say about it.  The story is simple and has a good amount of suspense.  In the end, it is pretty entertaining and I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the most exciting film I've seen in a long time! The movie is about a man who is a good hunter, but is always out of luck. One day he hears about a girl named Auroth, who has been kidnapped by a demon and is to be sacrificed to it. But the man is also a demon himself, and he and his son decide to rescue the girl, even though it is an extremely dangerous and dangerous mission. The movie has many twists and turns and is filled with action and suspense.   The movie was made by the same director of the first film (John Milius), and it is one of the best action films I've ever seen.      Rated 5 out of 5 by BOB from Another John Miliu classic, this one a must see! This is a very enjoyable and exciting film. Aurotha (Natalie Wood) is a young girl who is being held hostage by the demon Rhea (Tom Hanks). After the demon is killed, Auroatha escapes, only to find herself in the possession of a demon who wants to kill her. Her father, the hunter John Mifus, wants to help her and tries to save her, but he and Auroath's grandfather, the priest Father O'Rourke (Richard Harris) have to work together in order to save Aurota's life. They must work together to find Rhea and the demon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great story about a young man's journey through a world where he sees many beautiful women. The story takes a turn towards the dark side when the man realizes that the women in this world are not so pretty, but there are a few good ones and a man who is not so bad. This movie is not a comedy and is more of a psychological thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an amazing film with an awesome soundtrack, but a little bit of a problem in the ending. The movie is a bit of an action-drama with a lot of explosions, so there are a lot (literally) of explosions. But then there is a huge sequence where all the characters are fighting each other and then they are just standing there with their arms outstretched, like nothing happened. I felt like this is just a movie about a guy who has a gun and then he kills all the bad guys (or so he says). But that is just my opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are so many great movies that have been made.   I love this one!   It's a comedy/drama about two people who live together in a small town.  They get married.  The wife and the husband both want a dog to go with the marriage.  When the dog doesn't come, they find out that the dog is a black lab that can talk.  And he doesn't just talk. He also likes to play in the mud.  The dog is kind of a problem.  But that's not all.  It also is a comedy.  There's a love story that has to be watched to be believed.  I thought this was the funniest movie I have seen all year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ It is an entertaining story about two friends in love. They meet, fall in love, and eventually marry. Then the husband leaves. He returns with a younger wife, with whom they have a son. But the younger wife is not all he seems. She has been in a coma since she was an infant and is a bit of a fraud. So is the husband. I liked it. It is funny, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's no denying that the story of the film is a bit of a mess.  It has all the hallmarks of a bad movie, the characters are just bad, the story is just bad (at least it is for me), the music is terrible, the special effects are just laughable.  I don't even know what to say about this one.   The story, the character, the dialogue, the setting, everything is just so poorly done.  This is one of the worst films of all time, and it's a shame because it's so good.  It was written in the late 80's by the great Michael Winner, and has a story that is at least 90% of the way complete.  But, like most movies of this ilk, it's plagued by a lack of budget, the production quality is pretty bad, and most of the movie is just horrible.  A lot of people might complain that this movie is bad because of its story, but that's not the main problem.  The real problem with this movie isn't the story, it isn't even the acting, it is the special features.  There's a scene at the end of the first half of the second act that is simply awful.  I'm pretty sure that no one in the history of the world was allowed to actually see this scene.  For the love of God, it should be cut from the movie.  Not only that, but it doesn't get any better in the special feature, the only part of it that I found interesting was the music, and that's about it.    All in all, this movie will stay in the basement of my shelf for years to come, because it is just a horrible mess.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to imagine a better story about a family of four, except for one.  The family is the oldest son, Sam, his wife, Mary, and their two sons.      The older son is Sam's best friend, and the only one of the three who can be trusted, and not in a scary way.  The youngest son, the only child, is the spoiled brat who has his own family issues.  He is a good kid, and can be kind, but he can also be a complete dick, and that is how the story plays out.  There are a few things about this movie that I didn't like.  First of all, I don't think it's the best of the four.  Sure, it is a solid story, and a good start to the series.  But it was a bit uneven.  This movie had some really bad acting, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  They were all given the chance to shine, and they all did.  Also, the ending was very poorly done.  I know it wasn't supposed to be, but the writers of this movie did a terrible job with it.  If you want a good action movie, this is not it.   It's a good flick, and it's worth a look.  It's one of my favorite family movies, and I've seen it a few times.  Enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like it.   The acting is okay.  The story is about a girl who wants to marry a guy who has a big nose.  She's too small for him, and her dad is also a little fat.  And her mom and brother are too old to look good.  So they have to marry some ugly guy.  They have to go through a lot of stuff, but I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â It has a lot of humor and action, but it's not the usual shlock that you'd see in a "shooter." Â The movie is actually a little bit about love. Â There are some pretty touching moments, like when a soldier named Harry, played by a pretty good Richard Crenna, tries to convince his girlfriend, Laura, to come home with him.  It's just a sweet movie and the writing is good, but I was disappointed to see that there were so many "shoots" in the movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few great scenes in this movie. There's a great scene in the first half where the kids (which include the younger of the two kids that play the piano in the movie) play on the street with their mom. The mother is a really good mom. She has a lot of compassion and care for her kids. They are all just so sweet. The kid's father is an awful father. It seems that his whole goal in life is to get the kids to make a movie. When the mother gets mad at the father and he can't keep his promise to have the movie, he leaves. There is a great deal of anger and resentment in this family. There are a lot more scenes in the second half of the movie. The kids get very close to their mother, which is why she decides to leave. The dad is a very strange guy. I didn't think he was funny, but I can't help but like him. The movie has some great scenes. It's a little sad that there are not more movies like this, but it's still a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want a good story to end your summer with then this one is a great one.  I have never read a book with a more powerful emotional punch to it then this book.    The story is about a young woman named Elizabeth, who is a girl who doesn't know the meaning of fear, until she is in the company of the devil himself.  This story is told in a style that is so convincing that it leaves you feeling as if you are actually watching a movie.  The movie is so well done that you will not even notice it's a movie until the last 5 minutes.  You should give this book a try, and I promise you that you wont be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's hard to describe how much I loved the movie'The Last Days of Disco ', it was an excellent combination of comedy, romance and drama. The movie was filmed in the early 90's and was shot by Roger Corman. The cast included Steve Martin, Lizzy Caplan, David Bowie, David Spade, and the late Joan Rivers.  It is also said that there was an even better movie, entitled 'The Last Days', about a group of people who get stranded on an island, and how they all start to have sex and dance to rock music and that the whole thing is filmed on the beach. The film is so funny and full of love that it really is worth watching. If you're a fan of the disco era and a fan the great music, then you should definitely check this out."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "The Dark Tower" is a terrific piece of writing, from the first words to the last. It's a story of an ordinary man who comes to a strange town in the desert and meets a strange girl named Roland Deschain who speaks a language he can't understand. Through the course of the movie, they get lost and eventually come across a tower which has a lot of doors. The story is that the Tower was built to contain a great man called "The Tower" and it is kept closed from the outside world so it can be "taken care of" from the inside. One day, the man named Roland enters the tower and is shocked to find out that the man who built it is now dead. Roland becomes trapped inside the Tower and the mysterious girl who has come to the town, named the Witch, becomes his guide. The movie starts off very slow, but then it picks up speed and builds tension as they go deeper and deeper into the tower. The music in the movie is great, it has a really powerful tone to it, and it also sounds pretty much like a western. The characters are all great, and even though there are a lot more people involved in this movie than in the book series, they still come across as likeable enough. I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing more from Roland and his friend, the Witch. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the book. _________  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought I was going to love this movie, but it was a bit of a letdown. I like that it was made in the '70s and '80s. I liked the fact that the plot was very different from what we see in today's movies, but I didn't like the ending. I don't know if it was because the movie was made a little too long or it just didn't feel as good as the first one did. I'd give it a 3.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished The Dark Knight Rises, the final installment in the trilogy of Batman films. I have seen the first two and I enjoyed them, but the third is the best of the three. I was not sure I would like the film, but it is definitely a good one. The film is a slow burn, which I like, but I think the pace picks up a bit as the film goes on. I do not think the story is as good as the other two, but there are still some good scenes and it is pretty well acted. The music was really good, and I thought the film was well directed. It is not a bad movie and I think it will be an important film in the series. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Day The Earth Stood Still" was one of those great science fiction films that were made during the 1950's. I'm a fan of sci fi and all the space-related stuff. I have seen a few of them over the years. I've seen some of the ones by Clarke and Arthur C. Clarke, but this one stood out for its unique plot, excellent special effects and unique take on science fiction. The movie itself is set in the near future, but the time and the setting is very close to the early 1950's, with the Earth in a very precarious state. There is a lot of trouble with the government and the military and the general situation is not good. When a group of scientists and engineers are invited to a conference at the U.S. National Defense Research Center, they are told that they will be spending their time studying the earth, as it would be of great help in developing a defense against a possible threat. They are also told that a very dangerous alien life form has been discovered and is now on a mission to kill the human race. The scientists and the engineers get together to form a team to look for the alien. Their initial mission is to go to the planet Mars, where they can get information about the alien and its intentions. The mission to Mars is difficult because they have to travel through a storm, which is bad news, but they manage to get through the storm and they finally arrive at the alien planet. The aliens there have developed a space-age device and are using it to get to the Earth. Unfortunately, the device also creates a time paradox. This creates an alternate universe where the aliens never arrived and the humans are still alive. The group on Mars is now under the protection of the U-Boat, who are the last remaining ships of the British Royal Navy. The British government decides to send the UBoat to Mars to stop the alien from reaching the Earth and they send the group to Earth to do so. There the group must stop the aliens from reaching Earth and then they will take it back to their own world. As you might expect, there is a fair amount of suspense. It is a well-made movie that is well worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to laugh a few times.   This is not a "Bollywood" movie.  The director of the movie is an ex-cricketer and actor who is a little more known in Bollywood as a stand up comedian.  There are many things wrong with this movie: the acting, the acting and the acting.  This movie has no heart and there are no laughs.  What is wrong with you people?   Why don't you have a little heart?  I am a bad person. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing you notice about this movie is the music. It's one of those films where you are almost in a trance watching it. The music is like a song in the opera, a sort of "piano music" which can be quite beautiful and relaxing. And there's also a nice soundtrack to accompany the film. But the film isn't only made up of beautiful music. There are other elements to it, which I won't go into detail about. The main character, Max (played by Steve Buscemi), is a character who is not only quite smart but also quite naive. His first meeting with an older woman, (played with aplomb by Anne Hathaway), is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. As well as that, Max is also quite handsome and very intelligent. This leads to a lot of problems for him, which, I'll try to avoid spoiling. But it's not just Max's intelligence that makes the film so enjoyable. The acting is also a major plus, with a whole host of other actors also playing supporting roles.   As with most comedies, the story is also pretty much a joke. Max finds a beautiful woman, is in love with her, but is afraid of her being a bad influence on him. And so he becomes a bit obsessed with her. This doesn't really matter too much because, apart from Max's lack of maturity, the other characters are all pretty stupid and the plot doesn't progress very far. It also becomes pretty predictable pretty quickly. This isn't a problem, however, because this is a comedy.  . But there is a funny scene where Max has to play the piano in front of a mirror and the mirror is really a bit creepy. There's also an interesting scene in which Max meets his sister who is a woman who has been in a relationship with him for a very long time. He does not know how to react to this and he doesn't know what to do. And that's pretty much the story of the movie, so there is no need to explain the plot.   of course, there is also the comedy. Max, his sister and the rest of the group of friends are a bit more interesting and have a lot more depth. The film also has some nice little moments, such as when Max goes to visit his sister. He has a nice conversation with her about his life. As with most of the comedies in the 80s,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in the 80's and I have always liked movies about people living in the big city.   One day I was watching a movie about people in the city of Chicago, and I felt like they had taken a picture of my hometown of Portland, Oregon.  I have never been to Portland, and this movie looked just like my neighborhood.  But the movie did have an interesting plot.  It was a story about a woman named Lucy (Julie Bowen) who lived in a small house on a hill.  Her husband was away for a few months, and the kids, as well as the neighbors, used to come over to play.  She loved to play the piano.  One of her granddaughters (played by Ellen Sandford) had a pet cat.  When the cat came home with a dead rabbit in its belly, Lucy felt bad for the poor little creature, and she brought the cat to the doctor.  As it turned out, the cat was sick and died in a few days.  This gave her a new motivation for life.  At the end of the movie, she leaves the house for good and goes to a nice little hotel in Portland.  You can tell the movie was made with a lot of care, because the movie is beautifully shot.  The movie is about a couple who get married and move to a small town in the country, which is near the ocean.  After living in a big city for a while, they want to start a family, so they go to Portland to look for a house.  Once there, they find a house that has a lot going for it.  First of all, the home has an ocean view, and there is a lovely little lake just outside.  There is a lot to like about the place.  They are happy, the kids are happy.  And, the movie has a happy ending.  My wife and I enjoyed the movie a lot.  If you are looking for a good vacation movie with a great plot, you can't go wrong with this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say I expected much from this movie.   It's a movie that's mostly about a man named Billy Jack.  It seems like there's nothing interesting going on in this movie, at least to my eyes.  Billy Jack is a pretty average dude, except for his long flowing hair.  He's not exactly a bad guy.  There's some good moments, but it's pretty standard stuff.  I was hoping for a more interesting story, but this movie wasn't.  A lot of the scenes just felt rushed.  And I just couldn't figure out what was going on.  That's not a good thing.  But I'll still give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much, and I've never seen a movie so scary and fun in a movie theater. It's got a lot of laughs and scares. The best part is that it takes place in the 80s, but it looks like it's from the 30s.   The story was really good, and the director's vision was great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on TV about a month or so ago and thought it was the best one I'd seen. I don't like to say "this is a good one", because most of the movies I've seen have been crap, but I think this one is a nice little movie about a guy who is trying to be a detective in the city where the "real" detectives (and by that I mean the ones who actually solve crimes) are. There are two detectives on the show, one who is a little "pudgy" (he's got a long face) and one who has a "long-hair" (I don't know if that's a real thing or not). They both get into all sorts of funny trouble, but the one with the long hair seems to be the best detective at the start. He's also the one who gets caught a few times by the real detectives and is often seen giving the real detective a hard time. The movie is pretty short, so I guess you could watch it while you're doing something else, or you can watch it right after you finish your other movie. It's a very good movie that's very enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie itself, I think, is great, and you can get a good idea of the world from the various characters, but there's something a little bit off about them.  For example, I liked that the movie seemed to be going along just fine until the final scene where they get killed off, and it made me wonder what the point of the movie was, which isn't a bad thing. Â There are a few things in the movie that I don't know that I'd really recommend, like the main character's obsession with a young woman who's trying to live her life and avoid death, and the scene where the protagonist tries to kill the girl's mother. Ã Â The only other thing I can think of that I wouldn't mind is the ending, which I don`t think I'd recommend either.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "My life has been one long series of surprises. This is a film that brings them all together and brings them to a head."   If you have any doubts about how this film is going to end, you can't. The film is an hour of pure chaos and it all culminates in a big climactic fight that leaves us with a giant explosion that we can only guess is going off in the sky. It is a good thing this film has such a massive scope and it really shows in how the film has no limits in terms of how it can take things. In fact it is this sort of scope that is what makes it so good.   This is a movie that has a great cast of characters. It doesn't matter if you are a fan of Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris or Michael Bay. It will be impossible to look away. If you are one of those people who will just watch it for the action, then you are in for a treat. There is so much action in this film it will take you a while to get used to it. The special effects are just amazing and it has some really interesting special effects that are used effectively.   of course this film would not be a good film if there was not one thing it has in common with the others in the series, the great fight choreography. Bruce Lee is at his best when he is in the thick of the action. It looks like he is literally running away from things. I love Bruce Lee and I am glad he got the chance to fight in this movie. This film is all about Bruce Lee getting into his fighting stance. He is just amazing in this fight. It has a sense of realism about it. I mean, it is not real and he is still fighting like a legend. There are so many good fights in this. There was a fight in the beginning between a Chinese man and a Korean. It was a lot of fun. This movie is also very funny and I thought the way it was made was great. It just makes you laugh and laugh. This was my favorite of the 3 movies so far.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have seen any film from the 80s you should definitely see this one. It was produced by a young James Cameron and directed by a little man called Walter Hill. It is a very good movie, with lots of fun action and good special effects. It stars the great Richard Castellano, and was directed by one of the great filmmakers of the late 70s. The film is very faithful to the books and is full of action, good characters, a bit too many of them, and some great special effects (the flying car was my favourite).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of the film is pretty much a love story between a young woman and a young man.  It starts with a very nice romantic scene and the film never strays from that.  The film starts off with a beautiful girl named Milly who meets a mysterious man named Max who's not too bright either.  Milly and Max are introduced to each other and Milly quickly falls in love with him.  Unfortunately Milly's father decides to get involved in a scandal and the police arrive to arrest her father.  In the midst of all of this Milly discovers her sister has gone missing.  At first the police believe that Milly is the culprit and she is put in prison.  However, Max is able to prove that he is the real culprit.  When the police come looking for Milly they find Max and Mily locked in a room.  Max and the other man in the film have a very close relationship and Max tells Milly that he loves her.  One night Milly goes out to find Max but he is nowhere to be found.  As Milly begins to look for him she finds a very strange man. The man is a very attractive man who wears a tuxedo and has a very sexy voice.  Although he does seem very attractive Milly soon realizes that he does not love her. Instead he is just interested in the other women in the room. When Milly finds out she goes into a rage and the two men fight.  During the fight Max has an accident and Mandy falls in a pool and is rescued by a handsome man who calls himself Harry.  Harry convinces Max that he must go with him and Mony ends up spending the rest of the night with Harry.   The film then starts with Milly going on a date with a nice guy named James.  While on the date Milly learns that James is a professional magician.  James uses his magic to trick Milly into thinking she has a disease and then Milly falls in another pool.  Luckily Harry is there and he helps Milly to get back to the room and they start to have sex.  After a while Milly decides to leave Harry and James because she believes she is no longer a virgin and they go back to their apartment.  Once there Milly meets another man named Mike and they soon start to date.  Mike and Mally then have a fight because Mally doesn't believe Mike is really a

The only real "happenings" are a couple of people who are just trying to get home, and a cop who gets a bit too friendly with a guy.  This movie is not really anything special.  It's just a bit dull, but not terrible.  I don't know why it's been around for so long.    I'm not impressed with it at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie the first time around at a screening at a local theater, and I was immediately taken by the beautiful, yet terrifying, score. I liked the plot, and the characters were well-developed. The story is a little convoluted, and it's not very clear why we're in this particular place, but the film works well enough as a horror story and as a commentary on how the "weird" is often just "weirder" than what we might expect. The movie also offers some pretty good one-liners, and a lot of them.

The story is great, with great twists and turns. The movie is set in Egypt and the main character is a very good actor. I was wondering if the movie was an Egyptian version of "Rocky" when I first saw it. The characters are funny and well drawn. "Isha" is set at a college where the students get together to play sports and to eat. This is when the evil character from the beginning of the movie shows up. The rest of the story is just great. I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely go see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a group of students at a school in the mountains. The school has a special class for the children who have had a lot of physical contact with animals, and the students have a lot more contact with the animals in this class than with the other classes. There is a boy who has been playing with an iguana for a long time. He is really friendly with it, and it takes a lot to get him angry. His friend's dad is not very fond of the iguana, and he is constantly getting in trouble because of it. He has a little daughter who is not too fond of animals either. The girls are all really interested in the iguanas, but it takes them quite a while to warm up to the animals. The main problem the boys have is that they keep getting picked on by the girls, and they can't stand up to them when they get a little too close. One of the kids, who is just a little older than the rest of the boys, wants to get the igua to the class in a certain way, so he gets it to the school by having it go through a narrow tunnel, which is filled with water. But there is a nasty old woman who is always watching the tunnel, and when the iguas do get too close to her, she stops them with a stick. She doesn't like iguanos either. She has a terrible temper and keeps her house in a terrible condition. She hates them with an awful passion, and she wants to put them out of the world! The boys are not too sure what to do about it, but they are too scared to stop her, and eventually one of them goes into the tunnel with the igula and brings it back to the boys. The iguana does not like the boys at all, and just hangs out with the boys as they play. They are not going to get in trouble with the old woman, and then they can go on to another class!   One of the things I liked about this movie was the way the characters were brought to life. There were some good performances in the movie, and I liked the characters and how they were drawn. The one thing I did not like about this film was the ending. I thought it was a little confusing at the end. The movie had so many good performances, and at the same time it was so easy to follow the story. I think the movie could have been made a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What could possibly go wrong? Well, nothing really. The story itself is rather simple: you're a young man with a girlfriend, and she's going to the country to visit her aunt. She'll be gone for about a month. So you go on a trip with your friend to the countryside. It's nice, it's simple, and the characters are all pretty good. You have the nice girl who doesn't seem to care about her family, but does. You also have the boy who is a little more naive, and a little less intelligent, but more fun to watch. And of course, you have the bad boy.   As the film progresses, the more you realize how badly the movie is written. It just doesn't feel like a movie. There is absolutely nothing exciting or exciting at all, and all the characterizations are terrible. There are no emotional beats or things to relate to in the movie. So yeah, there's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn�t feel like anything. It feels like a waste of time. It�s hard to believe there was any actual effort put into this movie. The actors just don�t have much of a personality.   is a very bad movie. It isn�t bad enough to be enjoyable, but even then, it�s really bad. It does have a few good points, but nothing that will stand out. The movie is very basic, and very, very slow. The plot is pretty basic, too. It doesn�to take you by surprise. It has no real suspense or surprises, and you're going to be bored by it in no time. So what�s the point of watching this movie? The only reason why I could actually find it entertaining is that I could laugh at the bad guy. The bad guy is stupid, and he's annoying. I could find something funny about him, because I like being stupid. But I really don�to get into a serious movie about a stupid character. It felt like the only way to be entertained was to laugh at him. I don�don�t even want to say that there was a good ending to the movie, because there wasn�t. There was nothing, but a lot of filler. I really didn�t understand why I had to see this movie, and I just wanted to forget about it. This movie has absolutely no appeal to me. There�s nothing good about it, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid movie about a poor family and the problems they face.  I liked the characters and enjoyed the film.  It is not a very long movie but is well paced and it gets you hooked from the very start.   The story starts with a very good performance by a young boy (I think that is the name of his family) who has a brother who has been murdered.  Then we have a poor woman who is having trouble with her husband and daughter who is also having trouble and is a little bit lost.    Then we see a very poor man who seems to have all the money and he is really into a woman.  His wife has a son who is the only one of his brothers to survive,  Then we get a good performance from a very nice young man (he is the son of a very wealthy man) who goes to live with his uncle in an old farmhouse.  He is living with his cousin who lives in a very little house.  Now we have this very poor and very depressed man who is going to be married.  The family has no money.  They are forced to eat food that they don't like and they have no idea how to make a living.  In the meantime the man who goes with the uncle and cousin has a good job and is working a very hard day job and he likes it.  But he is tired of being poor and of having no one to take care of him and his cousin.  So he tells his cousin that he will marry the cousin if he can get her to work at a factory.  That is the way the film ends.  I was really pleased with the story.  It is interesting to see a poor man like this who has no education and no way to support himself or his cousin in the face of the world.  This is a very sad movie.  As I have said I was impressed by the young actor who played the boy.  And I liked the way he spoke.  When he was a child he was always in a hurry to do something and to get a lot of his attention.  To me this makes him more like a boy than a boy and a man.  Another good thing is the fact that this movie was not written by a professional but by a person who is not an expert in any field.  Even though it is not very long I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story.

There is a great twist on the love story, with the main character in a hospital bed. I enjoyed the romance in the movie and I liked the way it was handled. I thought it was very realistic, even down to the way that the character was treated. I'm sure there were some other things in the film that I liked, but the love theme was the only one that really made me laugh out loud.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, a friend of mine and I are having a movie night at my house.  The movie is "I am the one who knocks" starring Danny Glover and Kevin Spacey.  It's a comedy that features two cops who are both having affairs with the same woman.    The first cop is played by Kevin Spacely.  He is played as an egotistical asshole and a complete jackass.  Spacey makes it obvious in this film that he's an asshole.  In fact, he's so awful in this movie that you can see how much he hates this woman.     But, in the end, we all learn that they love each other, they have the best sex, and they end up living together.  This movie is an underrated gem.  And, the soundtrack is fantastic! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Would Be King is a very good movie about the King.  This is one of those movies you can't help but like.  The story is simple.  The King is trying to win a battle with an invading army.    King Arthur and his knights, a.k.a. The Knights of the Round Table, are the only defenders of the realm.    Arthur is a kind man.  He has no interest in fighting the enemy.  Instead, he's content to sit back and enjoy the fruits of a successful reign.  However, the king's best friend, a man named Gawain, has been betrayed and captured.  This has caused the king to be in a great mood.  Arthur thinks that he can get the enemy commander to speak to him.  His only problem is that he doesn't really know much about the commander.  Then the King's cousin comes to visit.  Unfortunately, the cousin is not what he seems.  It seems that he's trying to gain the king´s favor by becoming the king.  Now, it´s not really a big deal.  In fact, it seems to be a bit of a waste of a movie.  For all the King is concerned about being happy, he is also concerned about the life of his cousin.  So, he sends Gawain to go speak to the enemy Commander.  Once he arrives, it is clear that the commander is just another figurehead.  What he really wants is a kingdom.  But, Arthur´s cousin isn't interested.  She just wants to rule.  If Gawain doesn't find the commander, he can't get the kingdom.   The King has two options:   To kill the commander (a mistake) or to allow the commander to live (a better idea).  In the end, it comes down to a choice between the life and the throne.  As a result, Arthur wins.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The first half of this film is not a very good film. The film is so poorly edited that I don't even remember what the plot was. I think that the movie is a bad example of a story and is very forgettable.   The film has the classic horror story "the ghost of a clown." The movie is about a clown named Freddy who comes to town and starts killing people. The story is so bad that it could have been made by a 12 year old. I wish that the film had been made in 1971 and not 1974 because this film would have been much better. The sound effects are terrible and some of the special effects in the movie are so bad, I can't even stand to watch the movie. The movie has an extremely bad script. It is one long scene that has nothing going for it. It seems to be written by a child. I have a feeling that this movie was made as a joke by someone who had never seen a horror movie before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's The Thing, a brilliant horror film. It is an incredibly effective and suspenseful thriller about the aftermath of a nuclear catastrophe that happens at the end of the world. The film is based on the short story "The Thing from Another World," a tale that was originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1959. The story is about a scientist named Dr. Robert Weisz (Martin Sheen), who is attempting to find the secret of a mysterious alien organism called the Thing from another world. Weis, however, is not the only one who is trying to find this creature, and Weis is a bit of a troublemaker. We see Weis (and, of course, Weis' alien) get trapped in a strange and seemingly impossible situation, and there are some really good moments in the film. I remember sitting on my bed and watching the film in the middle of the night with a couple of my friends. I thought it was fantastic, but I still thought the ending was somewhat unsatisfying. I also thought that the movie would not work on a big screen, as it is so dark. However, a few years later, I watched it again with my kids. I was amazed at how well the film was shot. It looks good, and I think it is a great movie for any fan of horror films. It will be on my list of favorites for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a lot of love for this movie. The whole movie is set in a prison. And it has a bunch of different prison settings, but it's a prison where they have a prisoner named "The Rat" who is a very intelligent person. He has a lot to say about society, and about people who are smarter than he is, and he's very witty.   The most intelligent person is The Rat, and they have him on television and in a newspaper and in books, and then the prison starts to get out of control.  I found myself laughing a lot in this movie, and I'm pretty sure the reason I laughed so much was because I was in prison, and it was funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first movie I saw from director Terry Gilliam, who did the brilliant Brazil (2001) a few years ago. It's not as good as Brazil, but it's good.  It has a great cast, and it's just about as good a movie as you can get in a movie theater in the early nineties.  I had no idea who all the people in the movie were until I saw the credits and realized I had seen this before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a good time watching this film and it didn't make me laugh too much, although it did it was entertaining.   The movie has the potential to be a very good comedy.  This is a comedy that you could watch over and over.  There is a lot of comedy to be had.  In my opinion, the movie has a lot to offer and it's only the first film for Mr. Smith.  He may not be the most talented actor, but he is good enough.  The acting is great, and the film is filled with lots of laughs.  I thought the story was good, and I enjoyed it.  A lot of the humor is in the language.  If you have a sense of humor, you'll enjoy this movie.  It's funny.

She and her sister are on the brink of losing their apartment, as they are being chased by a group of men. When they get the chance to leave the apartment, they do so and try to leave. But they are followed by the men, and one of the men throws a glass at her face, which she catches. When her sister is hit, the two sisters get into a car and leave. They end up in the desert. The sisters fall in love with a man who is a guide, and a car-driver. They travel for days, until a band of Indians attack the car and kill everyone on board. The brothers find their sister's body and run away in terror.  This is a classic tale of love and survival. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a lot of fun to watch. There are not a lot things that you will like in this movie. It is not a bad movie, but I would not recommend this to anyone. I can't give it a rating because it is not the greatest movie of the year. But, it is a fun movie and it will get you to laugh a lot. It will also make you cry a lot, because there are a lot that goes on in this story. This is a movie that I would recommend to any people. This movie is a good watch. It's a lot more than just a movie and will make you laugh a good deal. I really recommend this movie to everyone. I am giving this movie a 5 out of 5!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, a good comedy, and a good love story.   It has it all.  I've never seen a comedy like this before.  It's a little on the long side, but it's still good.  The characters are all good. The romance is very good and it does not overstay its welcome.  But the funny part is the ending.      The only reason it didn't get an 11 is that I think it's a bit of a disappointment.  The ending is a little strange, but that's all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie very much. It has a wonderful story and a great cast of characters. The film is about the "American Dream" as a young boy goes to Europe to find his father who is working in the field. He is accompanied by his sister, who is not too bright and has a tendency to cry. The two go to a strange house where the house is decorated with flowers and pictures. They come upon a woman who seems to have a very strange way of talking. She is called Elvira and she has a strange power to make people believe that she is their sister. The story is told in a somewhat realistic manner but the director did a good job in bringing out the best in the actors. The music in this movie is excellent. It is not very dramatic but the music is nice and very well composed. The ending is a nice one. I have never seen a film like this. It reminds me of a story I heard in a storybook about a little boy who was sent to a great school and who was able to find some of the things he was looking for. I am sure I will see this movie again and again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** This movie is a classic. The music is great and the acting is top notch. This is a movie about a guy who is a little more powerful than his age. He is a high school football star who was able to defeat the best high school quarterback in the country. His coach doesn't know what to do with him. He has a big cock, a nice butt, a big smile and is willing to give it to you if you give him the time of day. ****************** This is the second time this movie has been released. It has the same story as the first, only now the coach is in the high school and there are more high school athletes. It's about the same guy. The story is still good, but the characters are much more developed in this movie. ********* I've seen this movie about 6 times. It is my favorite and most memorable movie of all time. ************** It's great to see a movie where the characters get laid and have a good time. This movie has it all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a big horror fan.   But   The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day, I was at the mall with my family. I got a good laugh out of a guy that was having a meltdown in front of a bunch of kids.  He kept saying "I've got the power to make you guys go crazy. I've got that power." It's a good scene, I'm not going to say it's a great one, but it's pretty funny. And the movie's over in a minute, so you don't need to worry about watching it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of this movie is pretty good, but the second half is absolutely fantastic. I have never heard a movie so realistic. I love the way it was shot, I love that the main character is a normal, unpretentious person.  I also love the fact that he has a pet dog.   I think that this movie was inspired by the film "The Good Life" about a group of people in a community who were trying to figure out how to live a good life, and how to be happy and happy people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am pretty sure I have seen this movie at least three times, at least once on video.   It is one of those rare movies where you feel the emotion and the feeling of being trapped in a room.  You can tell the story, but it doesn't really feel like a movie, at all.  This movie has a nice story and it is well told.  But I think I know why it is so rare.  The characters are all the same.  There is a doctor who is a man who loves a young woman who loves to read.  We get a young doctor who wants to save his young patient and his patient doesn't like it.  That young man loves to listen to music and that young woman loves to talk about music.  What do they talk about?  Well, the movie never really tells you, except when the doctor tells her that the world is an illusion, a bad dream that is made up of lies and lies and that we all make it up.  It never really makes sense.  And the young doctor never really gets a chance to tell her that her dreams are a bad thing.  I don't know how this young man will survive the night.  Why does he think he will?   But it isn't really a bad movie, really.  So why is it so rare?  And that is the thing about this movie, it is pretty good.  If you are going to watch a movie about a young man trapped in an old house, with no idea what is real, why not give it a try?  It might be hard to get into the story but the movie isn't a bad one.  As the doctor said, he is going to try to save the girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved the movie and enjoyed the script, characters and direction. It was not the best movie of the year but it did a good job. The cast did an excellent job and the plot was interesting.  This movie has all the things that I like and enjoy in a movie.  The movie starts out with a lot of good vibes, a good car chase, some good fights and a great ending.    The first act is slow, it doesn't have a lot going on but there are things going on in the background and you get to know the characters.  This movie has great characters and a good script.  The action in the movie is well done, but not in a way that will make you jump out of your seat.  It's a movie that will keep you watching and will keep your interest for the entire run time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I had not seen this movie I would have never heard of it. The story of this movie is like a lot of other old westerns like The Magnificent Seven or Out of Africa. The old west was a very violent and cruel place and people lived by the law of the gun and all kinds of wild violence. This movie follows a small group of men who are hired by the town's sheriff to go and kill a man who has killed the previous sheriff. As the movie progresses the town becomes a much more civilized place and things seem to get back to normal. However the old west is still a very dangerous place and the men are all good men and do not do any harm to anyone. However there are a few problems with this movie and that is the bad acting by most of the characters. They all do not sound natural and the main guy in the movie has a bad accent and a bad voice. However this is not a bad movie overall, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a strong stomach and a strong will to watch it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good horror movie, but not very good. The story is good, it has some great kills, and there are some very good performances from the leads.  The acting is really good in the movie.  There is a scene where the police captain is talking to a policeman on the phone.  He asks the policeman what he thinks about the incident with the girl and the boy.  The policeman asks the captain if he is sure that the girl is dead.  Captain says that she is dead, the policeman says that the boy has a broken neck.    After a long fight, the police manage to get the boy out of the house, and it is found that the child is dead after a very painful death.  This is where the movie loses a little of its horror.  There is a very long scene in which the boy is being rushed to the hospital.  His mom and sister are outside the house.  It is then revealed that the father had been murdered, and the mom and the sister are in a state of shock.  In the end, the father is able to get out of his house, but he is left with a broken collarbone.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been watching movies since I was a child. I grew up in the 80's and this movie is one of my favorites. I had to watch it again when I went to college to see the sequel. I really enjoyed this movie. I like the idea that the people in the town who have been out of the town for so long, they all have a chance to be reborn and they all do. I also like the humor and I like how the characters all have their own personalities. This is a good comedy movie and I recommend it.

They are playing pool and one of the old men falls and breaks his leg. They go to get an ambulance but it doesn't come. They try to get a ride to the hospital and find the place deserted. They find an old man lying on the ground and he tells them that he is the only one in the cemetery. He has no children and doesn't know why he is there. It seems as if he is being attacked by a dog and when he looks up, he sees the moon. The man and his friends decide to head to the moon and bring him back to life.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________ If you like science fiction, then you will like this one. The story is set in a future where a robot has become sentient and goes on a rampage. I don't like to compare my own life to the future, but this movie could have been a very good movie. It is a good idea that the robot has a human soul, but it is really a poor movie. There are very few moments in this movie that are worth seeing. The plot isn't anything special either. It seems that the main character is the only character that is really interesting. _______________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is good. It has a good story, a good acting performance, and a good soundtrack. It is the story of a man who goes to a cemetery to get the body of a dead man to a morgue. When he goes to the morgue he gets the wrong body. It turns out the man he was looking for was murdered by his own family and his wife. So he kills the family to get his body back. It all works out okay in the end and the story does a good job of keeping me guessing. There is a lot of blood and some violence. I don't know if the movie would work well for kids, but it is an interesting movie. It takes a while to get going and is a bit slow, but the ending is worth the wait.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There is nothing I love more than a good story." - Steven Spielberg   This is the kind of story that could only be told in the age of the internet. I first read this book in the form of a novel. I don't think I would have bought the movie had I not already read the book. I loved it so much I had to reread it. I think it is the only book I have read that is as good as this movie. The writing style of this book is as well-written as Spielberg's films. The only thing I would change about this book (and the movie) is the use of the word "nigger" in the title. I can't think of anything more offensive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best of Both Worlds"  is a good film.  I have seen the movie once before and I enjoyed it.    In the movie a couple of alien species come down to earth to visit and have a great time.  The aliens get their name from the fact that they live in both worlds and their names are "Orientals" and "Australians".   They are very much at home on earth and are fascinated by the way humans act and think.  As they are walking about the planet they pass through a "tent" where the humans are playing a board game.  There are four of the aliens in the tent and they all decide to play the game but when they are all at the same table one of the other aliens takes a fancy to a girl.  She is very pretty and is playing the game and he can tell that she is a very good player.  He goes over to her and tells her that she must lose because he has come to win the game. He then goes into the tent to talk to her.  When he gets there he is immediately attacked by her father and then the two of them take him to a cave where they will use him to win.  They have a little game of cards and then it is time for the aliens to play their game. The aliens are the first to put the cards down and they decide to be the winners.  Unfortunately for the Australian people, the aliens win because they have already won the game by cheating the Australian humans.  What a surprise!  They also have a lot of money to spend and so they buy all of the food and drink in the town.  One of the Australians notices that his daughter is playing a game with the aliens and he wants her to stop.  However the girl has already lost the game because the aliens have already taken the money.  After a bit of discussion the aliens decide that the Australian girl has been playing unfairly and that they will win the money back for her. The Australians have to decide what to do.  It is not clear at all what the decision will be and so the people of the town are very confused.  To make matters worse the alien mother of the Australian boy (and probably the other two aliens as well) tells them that they can take all of them away but only if they take the girl with them.  Apparently they want to be sure that the girl will not be hurt if they

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a story of a young man (Mackenzie Foy) and his best friend (Mitch Pileggi) who are at a local bowling alley one night. The two are in a fight because the boy has refused to share a game with the girl. The girl has a thing for the boy, and is having an affair with his best buddy (Michael Kenneth Williams). The boy does not want to be in the same place as the girl, and she's having an argument with the boy. As the movie progresses the story gets better. The story is simple. The friend and the boy try to get to the girl in a car but they crash. The boy is unconscious, but the girl is still mad at him and she comes up with a plan to have the best friend and boy be her lovers. The movie is told in a non-stop way. There are a few things that are annoying. The opening scene, where the boy wakes up, is a little annoying. It's like the guy has just woken up and there's a lot of talking going on. It takes away from the movie. It also takes away a bit from the fact that the movie is pretty good. The ending is a bit confusing. I don't know how I feel about it. I have a hard time getting through it. This is the only part of the movie I didn't like. There's a reason it's called The Boyfriend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a scene in " The Shining " where the main character, Jack Torrance, is sitting in his room with his mother. It's a rainy, cold day, so she's looking out the window. She asks him if he can see her, and he says he can, but it's only a little bit, and she replies that if it's too much, she'll close the window and he'll be alone again. The camera pulls back, and the window is closed.   Then we see that the little window is opened, and it's Jack, holding a gun to his mother's head. It looks as if he's about to shoot her, but he then realizes that it's just a window and the gun isn't real, and so he pulls the trigger.     The film was released in 1979, and although the Shining is not the most popular movie ever made, it has many great elements. I've never seen it, but I'm told that the Shining was filmed at a place called The Overlook Hotel, which is where the movie takes place.  I love the book and I love this film, and I can see why it was a success at the time.  The book is written by Stephen King, and is also a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure if I'm in love with this movie. I think I'm a bit indifferent to it. There's so much to be excited about, but the movie falls a bit flat in that regard. The film starts off with a great, suspenseful scene where a young man who has been on a quest to get to the center of the universe is being chased by a giant robot. It's the most exciting, nerve-wracking scene you're ever going to see in a movie, and I loved every second of it. The movie then jumps into a story about a space marine who, while on a mission, finds himself being chased around a city by a big robot. He finds himself at the mercy of this big robot and ends up fighting him until he eventually defeats him. And then the film ends. Now I have seen some movies that I just couldn't stand. I saw the movie, but I just didn't feel a strong connection to it, or to its characters. I also have seen movies that, while I didn't hate them, were so much better than this one that I could barely care about them. But this movie is worth watching. It just may not be for everyone. If you've ever thought you were going to have a great adventure, you can get that now. And if you have ever wondered what it would be like to have to fight against giant robots, then this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I liked this movie so much was that I felt that I knew what to expect. I have seen this movie once before (which was just a glorified TV movie that was made to be shown in some local theaters) and I thought it was an alright movie. However, I think it was the same director that made the first one, with a few different actors (all of which I have heard good things about) playing the same roles. The only new thing that was introduced in this movie was a man who was trying to get rid of the evil ghosts in the woods and his daughter, who was looking for him. He was played by the good-looking Gary Busey. The story is the same, but the actors are very good. The main problem with this movie is that it does not go anywhere. There is not a single bad part in this film. It does a good job at showing a little of the history of the forest, but it does nothing more than that. It's a pretty good movie that you can sit down to watch once and then never watch it again. It is certainly a good start to the holiday season, but I will not recommend it to anyone. It was okay, but not anything special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, funny, heartwarming movie, and a great deal of fun to watch with the kids. It is a wonderful story about a little girl who is the most perfect, kind and happy little girl in the world. She has a very big, strong, brave, smart, funny and very loving father who loves her and protects her from everything. She is the best little girl anyone could ever wish for. But her father doesn't love her the way she loves him, and they don't have a very good relationship. She wants to be like her mother, but is more like her dad. The story is pretty simple, the main characters are the father and daughter, and there is a little boy who doesn't quite fit in, but doesn't really have a good time either. He gets to live with the girl's father and he likes her. It's a good little movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if it is because it is so well-made that you can't help but admire its attention to detail or if it's because it's so well acted and is really a well-written movie.   The acting is really good as well, from the leads and especially from the leading man, and even the supporting characters are excellent, with the best performance coming from the female lead, who plays an archetypal evil woman with a wicked sense of humor.  And of course, the music is a major plus.  What's not to like? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of the trilogy, and the best movie I've seen in a long time.   I would say it's a masterpiece in the vein of "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Blade Runner" in that it is about a future world which has become completely depraved and violent and has been taken over by a society of psychopaths who are a mixture of people from many different cultures. It's about a group of people who are trying to find a way to stop the madness.  I don't really know what to say about this.  The first movie was a great start to the series, but this is a much more complex and intriguing story with a great cast of characters and a lot of action and twists.  A lot of the humor in this movie is in the way people talk and act, which is a lot more subtle than in the first movie.  It's not a perfect movie, but it's one of the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I was a little hesitant to see the movie "Jurassic Park" as a teenager, but I eventually grew to love it. I would go so far as to say that it is one of the greatest movies of all time. In fact, it is my favorite film and I've seen it so many times. It's got a huge cast, great visuals, great action, and it's one of those movies where you really feel like you are in the movie. I'm not the biggest fan of the original "Jaws", but the sequel was great. I also loved "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", and I'm pretty sure that the "Indiana" franchise was the best of the three, but "Jury's Remorse" was also a pretty great movie. The film opens in a museum where a woman is reading a book about a prehistoric shark. The shark is called a mosasaurus. They're the only ones who know about the shark. In the opening scene the shark attacks a woman, and we are shown the scene of the shark biting her hand off. As the woman is being eaten alive by the shark, she screams for help. The narrator tells us that this is a "jurassic" movie and he tells us it is a good time to be a dinosaur. The scene where the woman's arm is torn off is extremely realistic. We also see the shark dragging the woman around in a circle, and this is shown to be the kind of behavior that is characteristic of this type of animal. The mosasaur then devours the woman and we watch the shark swim away from the scene, leaving us to wonder what will happen next. The woman's leg is then ripped off and the film cuts to a helicopter that is flying over the shark's head. The helicopter drops a bomb on the shark and we hear the explosion. The next scene shows a scene where a man has to cut the shark open to save the woman. This scene is shown from a bird's eye view and we see the scene through a helicopter window. We see the man cut the sharks arm off. The man then tries to open the shark to get at its heart. This is done through the shark opening its mouth. The first time I saw this scene I was stunned by the realism of the scene. I thought it was a very impressive scene. We are then shown the shark swimming away, and the helicopter continues to fly over the scene as we see it
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title is not the best choice, it's just a movie, and a good one. It is a comedy about a woman who wants to have an abortion but her boyfriend's mom doesn't let her. She eventually is forced to get a tattoo. It's not a movie about abortion per se, rather it's a film about love, acceptance, and the power of art. It does have some very funny moments and it is a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this I thought it was a great movie, even though I was a little bored at the beginning, I was glad I saw it.  The plot is simple. A group of people have to escape a small town where they are held captive. There is a girl named Alice (I can't remember her name) and the two other girls in the group are named Lisa and Linda. When they escape they try to make it to the nearest town which is about 20 miles away.   After leaving the town they try for another town, but get turned back. Alice tells them that they will make it by sleeping in the woods and hiding.  After a while they get to the woods where Alice tells the others that they should not sleep there.  She tells them to go down the path to the left and they go down it. After a time they find a door, and Alice tells her group to go through it. As they do they see a girl, Alice's sister. Alice tries to tell her sister about what they have been through, but the sister just laughs at them. After that they come to the next door and Alice's group tries to open it. They don't manage to open the door, but Alice's mother (Alice) comes out and she tells them what they should do next. They try the door and open it, and there is a man in a dark green suit with a white suit and hat. Alice's mom tells them he is the person that brought the people here and the man is there to take them to the town. Alice and her mom go to see the man, and as Alice and the rest of her group are approaching the man says that they can go back, and that he will take them back.    He tells them all that he has come to take everyone to the same place as the people that brought them here, which is where they were imprisoned. Alice, Lisa, and Linda try to talk him into not doing that, and they try telling him that they are his friends, and he doesn't know them.  When he tries to argue with them, he yells at them and tells them it doesn't matter, and if they don't leave, they will all die. Alice says that she has no other choice and they all start to leave.  However the man stops them, and tells Alice and Lisa that if they leave, he will never take them anywhere else. They start to run,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about the adventures of a band of explorers who find a very peculiar treasure and the evil magician who owns it. They all find out that it was stolen by an old man and they are trying to find him.   There is a bit of a jump scare, but it is mostly not scary.  There are lots of laughs and there is a lot of action.  The characters are interesting, but they don't grow very far.  It is the kind of movie where you want to watch it over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out with a pretty good plot: a high schooler who can't seem to find love is asked by his friend, who's a cop, to kill his own father, because the father is a mafia boss and will kill the kid if he tries to run away from home. When the kid goes into the woods to try to kill the mob boss, the mobster has a small boy with him, and when the kid gets close enough, he lets the mob kid take him.   So the kid kills his father, the mafia boss comes looking for him, but the kid escapes with a girl named Sarah who is a high-school student, and they decide to move to a small town with a school for the deaf, and Sarah, who can see the deaf kids in the school, gets a job at a local radio station, and a job in the store where the kids get their food.     When the movie gets to the point where the kid and Sarah and the deaf children of the town are going to have a party at the radio station. All the deaf boys and girls are there, and the parents are at the party, and there are about three kids, all of whom can hear, and one of whom is the kid who tried to kill their father. And this is when the movie starts to go down the toilet.   of all the children who are there in the radio studio, there are two that can see. The kid who tries to kill our father is one of them, and he is about 8 or 9. The other kid who sees can't be more than 5, and is about 3. So, the deaf child who tries kill our dad is probably about 8, and can't see, and it is about this time when the kids who can hear start to get antsy, because they can't hear the radio stations playing their songs. So the kid that tries to murder the mobsters father comes over to the deaf boy and asks him to play a song. And the deaf son of the mob's boss sings a song, and says that he can't wait to get out of here, because it is getting late. And he says that the deaf kid can't stop crying. And then the kid sings a nice little song, about how sad he is, and how sad it is that he is going to die. And Sarah comes over, and she is looking forward to a party that is coming up.   (
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie, but it's not my favourite. The main character is an idiot. He thinks he's cool and he's a little stupid but he gets the job done, that's all I can say. The story is kinda confusing. I like that it takes the time to get you invested in the story, but I think it's a bit long to be a good comedy. It's funny but it has some really bad dialogue and bad acting. It was kinda boring but I enjoyed it and I think I could give it a B or even a C. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I give it 2 stars.   Thanks for watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is one of the best of the decade, and a must-see.  The movie is about a group of high school students who go on a mission in the forest to stop a demon who has a terrible obsession with their friend, the beautiful, redhead,  Cheryl (Kari Wahlgren).  When she disappears, the kids get involved in a series of deadly adventures.  As always, the film has great special effects and is well acted.    It has one of my favorite songs by the band "The Proclaimers".   This is a great movie to watch with a good crowd, and it will be in the top 20 of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the great "cameo" characters in movies of the 70s is the one-armed, one-legged, one handed, one fingered, one shoe wearing, one eyed, one foot walking, one leg walking, blind-spotting, one of a kind, one hand, one eye, one heart beating, one voice, one hair, one man, one dog, one car, one old man, a young woman, and one child.   In this movie, this man is played by a one-eyed, one armed, one legged, one one handed man named John Gaddis.  John is the lead of a one man comedy troupe called "B.Y.O.D." The movie is about how Gadds is a one night stand away from being homeless and living on the streets.    It's not exactly a comedy but it's a funny movie about a guy who is living on his own, having no money and no friends.  He finds a job as a one star comedian.  The one star is a guy named "Holly."  He has a "sketchy" look about him.  He is a very big man with an even bigger heart.  Gadd is very friendly and good at making up stories.  If you watch this movie you'll find it a lot of fun and a very good movie to watch.

I cannot say a negative thing about this movie and that is how I like my action movies.   A great mix of the most famous action heroes of all time (Jackie Chan, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jean-Claude Van Dammes, Anthony Michael Hall and more).   The movie itself is a classic.  It is a mix of martial arts, sci-fi, action, and comedy.  There are some very cool action scenes and a great story line to it all.  What are your thoughts on this film?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Cinema Paradiso" is an amazing movie.  There is a certain "doom and gloom" feeling to the whole story.    It is like the end of the world, or the end days.  We have a young man who is a priest, who has an evil plan to take over the world.  It is very exciting.  And it is all set in the most beautiful places in the world (the Alps).  This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  This film was made for a specific reason.  The reason is that it is the only movie of the year (2006) that is a masterpiece.  To quote the film, " Cinema Paradiso is a film for everyone, the story is for everyone... a film to be experienced with the eyes of the viewer open.  Cinema Paradisio is a journey of discovery and an experience of beauty."  This is a movie that I highly recommend.

I've never seen it, but have heard a lot of good things about it. I finally saw it with a group of my friends this weekend, and it was great. There were so many funny and funny things in this movie, it made me laugh my head off. I thought it was so funny to see the people who have been at the movie for years now being all excited about it when they finally see it. If you are into classic comedies, and/or movies where the characters are all very likable and funny, I highly recommend this one. If not, then it's not for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the movie twice now, and I can't get enough of it. I can understand why it was rejected by several critics, but I just loved it. There is a very realistic depiction of a woman (the main character, a young woman) who is a bit "distant" from her family, which is why she doesn't have any real close friends. She also has a very strange friend, who is always making fun of her, because he can't figure out her. He also makes her look stupid at times. But that's ok. There's not much else to say. It's a funny and sweet movie. If you don't mind that the characters are "dumb" and "stupid", then this is the movie for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would like to thank The Last Jedi for the very first time. I have been waiting for a movie like this since Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones. I didn't care for Episode III at all but I still wanted to see the movies and they finally came out. I am not a Star Wars fan but I like them and I like these movies and the actors. I would like a little bit more action but I would have to say this is a good film. I will be watching Episode VIII on Christmas. I like it a lot. I liked Star Wars as a kid and now I really like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is not that complicated. You know how when a movie like this is made the plot is more of a story to a movie. So it does not matter what the plot are, the movie is more about the character's growth and the emotional journey they go through. I thought this movie was a very interesting watch and one of the best movies I have ever seen.   For the character I thought the main character, Sam, was a good role model. He was not the best but he did the right thing in the right time and right place. He never gave up. He did the best he could with what he was given and did the things he had to do in order to survive. It was a sad and lonely road but Sam's life was filled with hope. He saw a girl he fell in love with, he saw a woman he loved. He found love. He went to his grave and I do not think he had any regrets. I think he lived the life he wanted to live.   the only thing I think is a little weird is the movie gave the ending a little twist. There was a little bit of a hint at a possible second movie. I do believe there will be a second movie as they have made a lot of changes and additions to the story since the original film. It is still very good and a great follow up to the original. It just had a little extra twist at the end and I was not really sure what it meant but I guess it was a hint that they will make a sequel.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* I am not sure how it was possible for a movie of this kind to get made in the 1970's. The idea was brilliant, the execution was terrible. It is a long movie, and I was only able to sit through the opening act because I had to be at a restaurant that was closed. When the restaurant was open, I was able to catch some of the action. The story is about a man who gets an idea that if you can find the right person you can get rid of your boss. It turns out that he is the right man, and it turns out he is just a little too nice to be the boss of a big corporation. This is a movie that is not very good, but it is a fun one to watch. If you enjoy this type of movie, then it is worth a watch. *************************

This was a good one, and it was a fun watch. It was a nice little romp about a kid who goes out to the woods to catch a monster. The monster isn't as cool as some of the other ones I've seen, but it was enough to keep me interested. I was pretty impressed by the effects. The monsters looked really scary, and the sound effects were great. I didn't think the ending was that great, but I was still entertained. This is one of the better movies I've ever seen.

But, as a movie... I'd say I didn't enjoy it very much. I liked the character, but he's very wooden and the other actors aren't any better. It does have a great ending though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is one of the best movies in recent years.   It's a classic tale of a man who finds a way to get revenge on his past.  I liked this movie more than a lot of the other movies I've seen.  And it's pretty good at it too.  The movie was filmed in France and in the U.S. and they did a good job of it.  It was directed by a guy who is famous for being a bad director.  But he was also a good director and the movie is very good.  There's a good cast and they all do well.  One of my favorite parts was when the police were chasing the bad guys and the guy said, "I'm the bad guy, I'm the one who gets out."   The ending of the movie was really cool and I wish they would have made a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was excited to watch this movie because I had heard it was great and it was based on a true story.  The movie starts with the death of the last surviving member of the old family of the famous singer, and the family's only child, an orphaned girl, who is adopted by the family.    After her birth she's raised by a mother who is a drunk, a father who is the most racist person you'll ever meet, and a brother who is always getting into trouble with the police.  This is all before she becomes a dancer and becomes involved with the "Rancher's" brother, a man who is obsessed with the occult and who's obsession is a strange form of mind control.  And all of this takes place before she has a chance to realize that she can change her life and find a way to live with her new found independence.  I don't know why the movie was made.  It's so bad I wish they would just make a DVD or Blu Ray and sell it in the stores.  The acting was awful, there were so many things that were not in the script that the actors did not know what to do with.  Every line was delivered in a way that made it seem like the lines were spoken in a language that I did not understand.  When the father says, "We are the family of Rancher" you expect to hear something about a man, but you don't.  There was a time when I thought I understood what was going on.  Then there was the scene where the father is telling the story of his first wife and how she was a beautiful woman and how they were together for over twenty-five years.  But that was it.  They took the plot and the story and made it their own.  So this is not a movie that you want to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a certain charm to the movie that is hard to explain. It has a strong narrative, a great score, a compelling lead, and an interesting premise. The plot revolves around the story of a woman who goes missing in the woods. There is something strange about the way she disappears. The mystery begins to unfold and the film begins to develop. The story takes a turn for the strange when it becomes clear that she is being stalked by a man in a black trench coat. He takes great pleasure in keeping her in the dark. The film has a great sense of pacing and suspense. The camera work is excellent and the effects are outstanding. The characters are well done and the movie is a great example of what a good thriller can do.

It is a good example of a movie that is made for the audience. The film is well-paced, with an impressive story. There is a lot of action in this film, which I find to be quite impressive.   I found the acting to be very good throughout the movie, with good performances. There are some funny moments, but there is a decent amount of action and horror. The story is a bit of a stretch, but it is well made. This movie is definitely worth watching.   I would recommend this movie to anyone. I would give this a 9.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting little gem of a film, but a bit of a downer at times. It's a film that's about people who go to a country where there is a very low amount of life, and people live there on the backs of cattle. This is a great example of a little movie that can be a real pain in the ass to watch, but it also gives us an interesting look into the lives of the people who live there. This film was made in 1962 and I'm sure this was the first film to take advantage of the new technology at the time.   "What are you doing down there? I thought you were supposed to be helping people."      This film takes a bit to get going, but once it gets going it's a great film.

He was found dead on the bathroom floor with the toilet lid still on the toilet. There was blood splattered everywhere on the floor. He had a gun nearby but the gun was not found in the room. He is found to have died of a stab wound to the neck. The story goes that a hotel maid is working in the bathroom when a man came in. She called out to her to check on the man. She asked the man what he was doing and he replied that he was looking for a hotel room for a couple. He then grabbed a gun and went to the bathroom. She locked the door and he went in and locked the bathroom door. She heard a noise and she heard a man saying "Get off of me you little bitch!" The maid ran to the bedroom and found the dead man on the bed. The maid then called the police. They checked the hotel room and found no one else in the hotel. There is a book of Patton's written by his daughter which mentions the man who was found in Patton's hotel room in a book called "General George S Patton: A Life". The story of the man found in George S's hotel has also been told before. *****************************

He was shot with a shotgun.   The boys are told that the killer will come back and kill more people, and so they go to the police station and report it.  A few days later they meet a man who tells them that there is a killer in town and that they should call it a day.  They do so, and then go back to the boy's mother.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sisters" is an absolutely gorgeous and moving movie, and one of the few good movies from the 90's that's still relevant today.  It has a great ending with a fantastic twist, and it's very sad that it didn't end there.   The first movie I saw when I was a kid was "Sisters", and I remember it very vividly.  It was a great movie and I loved it.  And then when I saw it again years later in college, I still loved it, but I could see that it was the last film from this particular director.  I had watched all the other movies he had made, and was a little disappointed to see the end of "Sister", but the director was a very nice guy and did a wonderful job, so I was not disappointed.  After that, I got to watch more films from this director. I've seen all his later films, and most of them were okay, but "Sorority Girl" was the best of the rest.  This is a very emotional film.  You get a good look at how these sisters came to be, how they got to be who they are, and how their relationship changed.  There are many different ways you can interpret this movie, but the main thing is that it's a wonderful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Stand" is a good old fashioned war movie that features a solid cast that includes a few of the best actors in the business.  The story is a bit weak as the American forces are a bit too strong but the film does not really need them.  The movie is really just about the four guys on the losing side that are left behind after the other side has been defeated.    The film has a lot of fun with the whole "last stand" theme and the action is great.  The music is not too memorable but it is still a good sound.  There is a very short but very effective ending.  "The Last stand" is one of the better war movies of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I don't know about the rest of you, but when I heard about this movie, I knew I had to see it. The movie is a remake of the classic 'The Three Stooges', and it's very faithful to the original film. I think that it's the perfect movie for fans of the original. The original is very funny, and the characters are great. The acting is very good, but the best scene in the movie is the one where the Three Stoogs are stuck in a sewer. They don't get out of there until the end, and they're hilarious. _________________  The Three-Stooges of "The Three Stoody"  By James L. Siegel   This is the first in a series of short films based on the popular children's television show, "The Stoogles", and it is the only one in which the characters in the film are not portrayed by the legendary Charles Nelson Reilly, although the other two were. I don´t think it´s a very good movie, but I think it is a very funny movie, so it´ll probably appeal to a lot of people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this on a friend's DVD, and had to watch it again.  My first thought was:    this is a good little comedy.    The comedy is funny, but the drama is pretty serious.  The characters are all likeable.  There is a big change of pace from the previous movie.  It was funny, a little tense, but overall I enjoyed it.  I will admit that there are some "cheap" jokes, but I think the comedy comes through most strongly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is an amazing film. It is a documentary of a man who is so famous that he has his own reality show. It tells about the life of the man, the events that he experienced during his lifetime. It shows how he survived the Nazi era and how he lived through the war. It also shows how his life changed in the 60's. The main thing about this film is that it is a very interesting look at how the man lived during his time.  There are a lot of interesting moments in this film.  The Man who knew too Much, from the trailer It is also a very touching film. The film does a great job in showing how the main character had to deal with his friends and family during the war, it is also very touching to see how he went about making the documentaries.    A man who was the most famous man in the world for 30 years!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts with a man who is in a very sad and miserable situation. He has a wife and a small child, who are both very sick and in need of help. So he decides to go out to a country where there is a hospital and a clinic for the sick. This is where the film begins. The film is a documentary and as such the movie is a little short and in the end it is hard to say how the film ends. It ends up being a very short film and that is a good thing because it really doesn't leave much for you to think about after it has ended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can't go wrong with any movie based on a book series.   The movie starts out as an action movie but quickly changes gears to a dark comedy.  In the end the film does what it set out to do and that is to show that there are no good guys in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We're in space."  The words that have haunted me ever since I was a kid.  There's no way I'll ever forget them.  The scene that follows is an awesome one.  There's a guy in a spaceship that's got a crew and a pilot.  This guy is the pilot.   He's on a mission and he wants to land, but he's a little too lazy to do it.   The crew are in charge of the landing and all of the crew except for the pilot are astronauts.  So the crew has to help the pilot land and it's pretty hilarious.  They're not kidding.  You can't tell if they're joking or not.  I can't believe this movie is twenty years old and I don't think I'll be seeing it anytime soon.  It was pretty bad back in the day, but the quality has improved a lot.  My favorite part is when the crew takes a drink after the landing, so you get a nice little taste of Space Camp in a movie about astronauts.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm pretty sure I'm going to be watching this movie for a very long time.   If you haven't seen this movie, you have to watch it.      The story starts out pretty good.  I wasn't a fan of the old "Man with the Golden Gun" and this one doesn't try to change that.  The movie does an excellent job of introducing the characters and showing us why they're there.  It's interesting how much of a difference the actors make from the actors of the previous films.  And I thought it was really funny how they changed the dialogue for the sequel.  So, it's a great movie.  There's nothing wrong with the story.  However, I would have liked to see a bit more action and not just gun battles.  All in all, I'd say this is a good film and you should check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie begins with a simple set-up: A group of kids are invited to watch a movie, a kid named John Hughes. The movie is called "Raging Bull", but the plot and the story are all about a bunch of guys. In this movie there are no female characters, only guys, the story is about a group of guys, John Hughes, Billy Zane, and Jake LaMotta. Jake La Motta is portrayed as a pretty boy, but he's a pretty good boxer. His brother John Hughes is portrayed by the one and only Al Pacino. They're both pretty badasses, John is the leader of the group and he's an expert boxer. He also is a pretty smart guy, so he's able to think of all the ways to beat the other guys. I really liked John Hughes because he's pretty damn cool, and he can kick ass. He's also pretty cool with his women. He has a girlfriend named Linda, and I'm pretty sure she's pretty hot. He does have a lot of problems with his parents, but his friends will always be there for him. I'm not really sure what happened to Linda, but I do like the character of Jake La Manzo. He gets in a lot trouble and has a lot to lose, but that doesn't stop him from being a pretty cool guy. I like his character because he has a pretty strong sense of honor. I also like that the movie is really violent, and there's a lot more than just a fistfight at the end. It's a good, interesting movie that I can't wait to see again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen many action movies in a while, and this one was definitely up there in the action genre.  This movie has a good mix of action, comedy, and romance that made for a really good movie.    I highly recommend it to all action fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The World's Greatest Dad" is the kind of movie I like to think I can get to like.  I've seen it twice, and each time I left the theater with a smile on my face.  The story of a couple that gets married in a small town in South Dakota, the movie is based on the book, "The World of Great and Secret Dad."  I don't really remember much from the movie.   It has an old fashioned feel to it, with the characters all talking in the third person and talking about things that happened to them in the past.  It's also a lot of fun to watch, and a lot to think about.  I can see how this movie might be a good one for the dad in all of us who are just starting to get a little older and a little more cynical.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _______________________________________ The movie follows a little boy named Ben (Aiden English) who lives in a small town called Fiddler's Green. Ben's a little bit weird, as we all know, but not really. He has a little brother named Charlie (Nolan North) who is the same age, but a little more serious. Ben and Charlie are very close. Ben can be very rude and mean to Charlie, but there's a big reason behind it. Ben has a very bad relationship with his mother. He's the oldest child and his mother had an affair with the town's Sheriff. Ben is a good kid, he's only a little weird. Ben hates the town and the Sheriff who is responsible for his parents' divorce. The town's sheriff, however, is a different story. He is a nice man who helps Ben and his brother with their problems, and has Ben's mother as a friend. He also has a daughter named Tawny (Jenna Fischer) who seems a little crazy. Ben doesn't really understand why Tawnys crazy acts, but he is sure that she is not crazy. When Ben and Tawnies mom are getting married, she suddenly goes crazy and threatens Ben's father and his friend. This is all a big misunderstanding that the townspeople want to make out to be a big deal, but Ben is not convinced. When the town sheriff tries to solve the problem, he is unable to do so and is left to take care of the situation. Ben, Charlie, Tawni, and the other kids also get involved. Ben tries to help them, but the situation gets worse. Written by The
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a kid, I used to sit in the back of the theater and watch a movie with my mother and my brother. It was one of my favorite films of all time. It wasn't long into the film before the villain (played by John Wayne) turned on the movie's hero (played with aplomb by Clark Gable) and made him an outcast.   In the middle of the film, he turns his back on his friend, and all of a sudden, he's a bad guy. He's not a bad man. He doesn't even have a name, but he's an absolute scumbag.  After the bad guy is done with him, he finds his girlfriend (played in the movie by Elizabeth Taylor), who was playing the baddie, and he says, "I don't believe it! It was just a mistake!"   I don't know if I've ever seen a more blatant ripoff than this movie.  And what's worse, it doesn't hold up.  The movie gets its dramatic moments by having the hero fall in love with the heroine, who happens to be a pretty actress.  I mean, the bad guys get their bad moments, too, but it's not even close to what the badguy does to Clark Gables.  It doesn't take long before he's playing golf, which is all right, because he is the baddest bad guy in the world.  Now, it's only a matter of time before he turns on the bad girl, who's a pretty, pretty actress, too.  Gable was playing a bad person, so he doesn't get a chance to be in a good romantic comedy.  For this reason, the movie is only marginally enjoyable.  There's a reason why it's called a "bad" movie. If you want to laugh and have a good time, you'd better not watch this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last one is a remake of the great 'Holes' (1971). There is one scene in the film where a girl is being killed. The film is full of gore and the girl is a really pretty actress, so I was sure it would be a good film. But the film turned out to be so full of blood that it was really hard to watch. The gore is really good, it was like a real horror film. I liked the story. I found the acting of the two leads to be excellent. There are lots of strange scenes in the movie but none of them are really disturbing. But this is not a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A simple yet powerful tale about a man who is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit.

The story does not disappoint in this regard, and is full of twists and turns.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have the money and the time, this is the best movie to watch on a long plane trip. It's the kind of movie you might watch if you just got off a long flight, or a vacation, or just something to look at.  It's a pretty good film, not necessarily the best I've seen, but certainly a worthwhile watch.    The film is set in the mid-1970s, about the late 1960s, when the Vietnam War was still in full swing, and the American public's reaction to the war was mixed.  On one hand, there were the Americans who did not support the war and were in fact opposed to it.  And, on the other hand, the Americans were the ones that were supposed to be defending the freedom and the liberty of their country.  This was a problem, because the Americans had lost the war, and they had to get back into it and do something to regain their standing as a free and open country. They had to take a stance, and their stance was that they wanted a complete withdrawal of all of their troops from Vietnam, because they could not win it.   The reason for their position was that their military forces were superior to the Vietnamese ones, and, with this superiority, they could win the war.  They did not believe that the Vietnamese people would ever be able to defeat the US military.  As a result, they did not want to take any risks.  There were a number of other issues involved as well.  The first issue was the Vietnamization of the United States, and a number other issues that had nothing to do with Vietnam, such as race, economic depression, drug abuse, and sexual perversion.  After years of American involvement in Vietnam, a lot of these issues had gone unresolved, and there were many people who were tired of the war effort.  Also, in addition to this, there was a feeling that the US was trying to push Vietnam to become more like China.  I would say that, on a general level, the American people were tired and felt like they had been there too long, and were ready for something different.    As a consequence, a great number of people came to the conclusion that they did, in fact, want a complete pullout from Vietnam.  It was clear that they were willing to pay any price to get the withdrawal done.  When the Americans first came to this conclusion,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original 'Lone Ranger' was a pretty great movie and I thought the sequel was a lot better.  I have to say I'm not as much of a fan of this movie as I was of the first one.  The film was made in 1954 by a man named Roy Rogers who went by the name of 'Ringo'.  The film tells the story of a ronin who becomes a ranger in the forest when he is wounded during a duel with a bear.    He soon meets a beautiful woman called Pai who he falls in love with.  This leads him to discover that there is more to life than just being a ranger and that the ronins aren't the only people out there who are out there looking for adventure.  The story is told in the third person.    I liked this because it allowed the audience to become more involved with the characters.  It also had a good amount of humor which kept the audience on their toes.  As I said before the action scenes were good but I just didn't think it was as good as I had remembered it.  I thought it had a better script than the first.  Overall this was a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good story, with a great ending.   The movie was a little bit long (at least for me) but it was worth it.  I liked the characters and the way they reacted to different situations.  My favorite scene was when the police detective was chasing the robber (you can watch this scene at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs4gZn-n1Dk).   I'm pretty sure this movie is an old movie but it's not that old.  The acting was great (except for the bad guy, he was very bad, I'd never seen him before).  This movie will make you laugh a lot, even if you know a lot about the history of the robber, who is so evil.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of the Star Wars franchise then this movie is a must see! This is the first time I have seen an action packed Star Wars movie!   I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and even though the story line is very different from the other films this is still a good film and I think it is worth watching.   The main characters in this film are Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and C-3PO.  Leia is the main character in the movie.  She is the daughter of Han and Leia.  When she is about 8 years old her parents are killed in a battle with the evil Imperials.  This event causes Leia to grow up a little and she becomes an orphan.  While living in a village called Alderaan she becomes the apprentice of a Wookiee named Chewbacca.  Chewbacc is a very good Wookie who teaches Leia the ways of the Force.  With the help of Chewbac she begins to train herself to be a good Jedi.  After many years of training and many battles against the Empire the Empire finally manages to capture Luke Skywalker and bring him to their evil emperor.  Luke has been training for many years and is now ready to face the emperor and become a Jedi Knight.  Unfortunately for Luke he is captured in a huge battle between the Imperial and Rebel forces.  Luckily Luke escapes the clutches of the Emperor and manages to get back to the Rebel base.  The film then focuses on Leia as she trains herself to become a good fighter and Jedi Knight by learning from the wise and powerful Han Solo.  Han Solo is an old Jedi Knight who has become a very powerful Jedi and has become famous for his incredible strength and skill in battle.  He is also a good and wise mentor to Leia. After Luke is captured by the Emperor he is sent to Dagobah to face Vader, one of the most powerful Sith Lords ever.  Vader is a powerful Sith Lord who was once a Jedi Master, but lost his powers and was exiled to the desert planet Dagobahs.  At the end of the film Vader is defeated and captured by Luke Skywalker.  I would have loved to see a sequel to this film, it would have been great to see where Vader's adventures would have led to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been waiting a long time to see this movie.  It's one of the most popular horror movies ever.    This movie is based on the book of the same name by Richard Matheson.  This film is a pretty good one with some good scares.  The cast is good but a little bit bland.  They do have some great actors like Peter Boyle as the father and George C. Scott as the son who are very good in this film.  I have seen this film over 50 times and it still remains the best horror movie of all time.  It has a little gore but never goes overboard.  My personal favorite part of this film is when the father gets in a fight with his son and then the son gets a knife and stabs his father and kills him.  If you're a horror fan and you like a good horror movie then you should see this.  The "I Don't Want to See You" video by Horror Junkie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I am soooo sorry I am not able to give this film a better rating. It is very good, a little slow in parts but I found it pretty interesting. ____________________________________________________________ A friend of a friend who was a part of the British Army during the First World War was captured by the Germans in a raid. He was then taken to a secret base in France where he was kept in solitary confinement and forced to write a book about his experiences. When the war ended, the book was returned to its author but the book had been altered so much that he had to start all over again. The book became a best-seller in Germany and the German government decided to destroy it. The only way to save the book from the flames was to make a copy and to send it to Germany. So they sent a copy to the British. This was a rather silly idea as the British could not have known who wrote the book. The British then decided to make an exact copy of the book with all the changes. This copy was then sent to a publisher who was impressed with the book and gave it to the author. He then wrote a new book about the war in France and returned to England. The new book was very popular and he had another best-selling book about what he had seen during the war. It was all rather silly and I found myself laughing rather than crying. _____________
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the kind of movie that makes you feel like you're actually there. This is a movie about a man (John Hurt) who gets involved in the war when he finds himself caught in the middle of it. The plot is simple and you get to know John Hurt pretty quickly. Hurt is a veteran of the Vietnam war, so when he sees an old friend (Tilda Swinton) getting married in Vietnam and he wants to join her on the trip he's taken, he's reluctant to go along. He's then forced to leave the country when he and his family are kidnapped by the Vietnamese. It's a little disappointing that they didn't get into a few scenes about the Vietnam War, but it is a little more than a couple of minutes that get you up and running. When you've got a guy like John Hurt in your movie you've done something right. The film is also a bit short, but I can't really complain about that.  I can't believe that this movie was actually made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a bit odd that we've seen such a big change in the way we view the world. Nowadays we think about ourselves not only as humans but as individuals, who are able to achieve the impossible and who are capable of the most extraordinary things. If that's the way you want to live your life then the future is not all that bad. And if that's not your idea of a good time then I don't know what is. It's a very good movie and a good one to watch, although I do feel that it could have been better. The film doesn't really work that well on a cinematic level, and even though I enjoyed it on an intellectual level I found myself bored by it, it felt more like a novel than a film, and I didn't find it interesting. That's not to say that it's bad, it's just that I didn´t find it all that great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like The Godfather, and like the other movies of this genre, it is a very good film and a very fun one.   The film was made in 1964 and was produced in the same year as the original and based on the play by the same name.  It was directed by Robert Aldrich, the same director who made The God of Love, and it is just a fantastic movie.  The story revolves around a mob boss named Nicky Spaghetti (played by a young Robert Mitchum), and his gang of young thugs who are called the "Mafia".  Nicky and his guys travel to the Philippines to steal the diamond that is thought to be in the possession of the Sultan.  Unfortunately, the Sultan's men are ready to kill Nicky's men and the Sultan himself.  After a brief fight between Nicky, the other gang members, and the mob boss's men, the mob bosses are finally able to kill the Sultan and take the diamond.  Nick is in a much better mood after the fight, and his men return to the U.S. to celebrate.  Before they get back to the states, however, they get a surprise visit from a man named Donnie (a young John Wayne), who tells them that he is going to kill all of them.  A few days later, Donnie is killed by Nicky.  Shortly thereafter, Nicky finds out that Donnie was a CIA agent who was trying to stop him from stealing the diamond, and he kills Donnie and then the rest of his gang.  In the end, Nick and his mob buddies go back to their lives and Nick tells his gang that they are now officially in the Mafia.  However, Nick knows that he has been betrayed and so he decides to kill Donnie.  Just then, Donny's brother, who is also a mobster, shows up and he tells Nick that Donny is dead and that Don Jr. is in the hospital.  Now, Nick has to decide who to kill.  While he is pondering, Don Jr.'s son, who had been following Nick, comes and tells him that Don Sr. has been killed.  As a result, Don Sr., Don Jr., and Nick Jr. decide to leave the Philippines for good.  This was a great movie and I highly recommend it.

They get to the bear and the bear is not very nice, but that is ok. The boy is not too bad either, and he is trying to find out the origin of the noise. After finding a bunch of weird things in the woods, the boy decides to go back home, but his dad is worried that the bear has eaten all his friends. The bear is a little funny and the boys have fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like science fiction, movies about aliens, and a love story that makes you feel that you're not alone, then you need to see this movie. It's very funny and at times very touching. I like the idea of a spaceship in space, but it's hard to connect to it. I was expecting a lot more action scenes but they are very sparse. It also has a lot of dialogue that is hard to get into. But then, what's there is very well done. The music is a good complement and is a nice change of pace. The characters are very well developed and well developed. It doesn't feel like it's a typical sci-fi movie, but a movie about people trying to connect. It does seem to me that this is a film about how people can change when they are in the right place at the right time. I'd give this movie a 7.0.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must watch movie for anyone who loves a good time.   This movie is a fun action movie with a great plot.  We have a good action movie.  The movie starts off with a bad guy who wants to kidnap a young girl, he then takes over the plane to kill everyone on it.  Once on the plane the girl gets out, we get a great opening scene with the young girl in the plane, then we get the bad guy in the helicopter.  In the end of the movie there is a big bad ending with a lot of deaths.  If you like action movies this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that you can see right through to the end without any sense of loss or confusion. The story, which is basically an urban legend about a woman who was killed by a man who shot her for trying to steal a car, is very well told. And I don't have anything against the urban legend aspect of the film, because it is entertaining, but I feel the film should have been more than it is. The acting is very good, and there is a great performance from Robert Redford. However, in the final third of the movie, it becomes painfully obvious that the film has not been properly edited and is very much in the style of the 1950's. This is not the first time that the movie has suffered from a bad editing, and it will not be the last.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a little girl, my family used to have a play about the life of an Irish peasant girl named Fionnuala.  My sister was about seven when we got it.  I'm Irish, I'm a peasant, I've got a horse, and I've been to Paris.  This was an animated children's movie.  It's a pretty great one.    I'm not sure if I could've made it to the end without losing a tooth or two. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You are the first person in a movie to mention the existence of a giant green man and to refer to him as a "giant green monster."  I love this movie!  It's so odd to have a movie that doesn't follow the plot line of any other Hollywood blockbuster.  Instead, it follows the life of a guy named George (Richard O'Brien) who is the only person who knows of the existence and purpose of a green man.    George, in his quest for a friend's baby, goes on a journey to find the giant green monster and his human friend who are both stranded in a strange and strange world.  George has never seen anything like this world and is afraid that it is all a trap to catch the baby.  This movie is a perfect blend of comedy, horror, and mystery.  I found this movie a great surprise.  The only thing that would have been better would be if the giant Green Man was not so green and wore a yellow costume. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good, action packed, and humorous movie, that takes place in a town in the north-east of the country, and focuses on two characters, who are both of the same age, and who are also on the same football team. The two of them are also from the same school, but the two of the two have different tastes in music and films. One is a fan of rock, and the other of disco. The one who likes rock is the leader of the football team, and is also a musician himself. The other is a film buff, and watches a lot of movies, but is an expert at football. He is also quite the ladies' man, and a good kisser. The movie revolves around the rivalry between the two, and their attempts to find a film which they both like, and which they can both watch.   This movie is full of humour, which will keep the viewer amused for the duration of the movie, but there are also some very good action sequences, and there are a few well written scenes in the film, which are not too much on the silly side. The film is also very well acted by a number of people, and it does a good job of bringing out the personalities of the main characters.   I recommend this movie to those who are fans of football, and of disco, and those who enjoy a good laugh.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Saving Private Ryan" was an American epic film released in June of 2000 and based on the novel by Michael Crichton. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg and was also produced by George Lucas. The story centers on Private Ryan, an elite soldier in World War II who fights in the Battle of the Bulge and is subsequently captured by the Nazis and subsequently imprisoned in a Nazi camp. His captors tell him that he will be given a chance to redeem himself in the war when he escapes. However, it seems that the chance for redemption will not come, and when he is finally released, he has no idea where he is or how he got there.   I liked this movie a lot and thought it was an interesting take on the war. While it is true that the film is based on a book, it is not a bad movie. It is just a little short on character development and not as much plot development as it should be. While I liked it, I would like to see a little more character development in the next one. I also liked the idea of a "Saving" Private Ryan."   The Sound:   The sound is fine for a movie of this caliber. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I think there were a few more shots of bullets hitting flesh that would have been nice.   the film was shot on a sound stage and it sounds very good. The music was okay, but I didn't like it. I did enjoy the song that the band did. It was a very enjoyable song.     Conclusion:   "Shaving PrivateRyan" is a good war movie and a good watch. It does a great job of setting up the story for Private Ryan and the story does a nice job of tying together a few major aspects of the movie.   a little less characterization and a little better story development would have made this movie much better.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome! There are some great effects in this film, as in the opening credits, which shows a guy falling from the top of a skyscraper, and the next thing you know, he is in a police car with some policemen, with a policeman asking the guy if he is okay. He is talking and the policeman is playing a tape of a voice he is sure is a man (which he is) who is trying to warn him that he is going to die. He says he is not going to do it, but the policeman continues to ask him questions. The guy is really going nuts about it, so the policeman pulls a gun and shoots the guy (this is all done in a few seconds) when he is dead. This film is pretty much a comedy, and if you like the first "Funny Girl" movie (and who doesn't), then this is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has some great moments. It was a good idea that had the potential to be a good one. The characters were interesting and likable.

The movie is not very long, but there are enough moments to keep you watching. I will certainly be checking out the sequel!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that a movie is not really a story until it is told.   This is a story of a woman who has lost a husband, and now lives with her two young children.  They are the ones who must help their mother to move out of the house.  It's not a very nice movie, as the film is very bad, and even if the story was good, the characters could not be more ridiculous.  This movie is a disaster. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a good cast, and even the lead actress does a good job. I did not like the villain (I was a big fan of the other films in this series) but he had a good design and I like the fact that he was an ordinary man and a normal guy who did not have a magic power or special powers. He also has a bit of a crush on his co-worker who he loves but does not see very often, so that I found it a bit awkward that he has a crush when she is not even there. I also found it odd that he didn't have a magical power, and it would have been nice to see a spell he cast on her to keep her away.   I also found the ending somewhat disappointing because it seemed to go back on itself a bit, and that's why I gave it a two. It's a bit more complex than a typical romance movie and it takes a while to get there, and there are a lot of twists that I wasn't sure about. However, it did give me a good laugh and I think the movie has enough of a storyline to be enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a man who was once the most feared criminal in New York. He was given a new identity and a new family after his execution. This family had no knowledge of his past. His wife (Honey Riley) was a prostitute, but this movie shows that she is also an intelligent woman. She has a very difficult time with the police (they don't know who she is) and with the court (she is not as clever as she thinks she is). I am also a big fan of this movie and I can't wait to see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of the film "The Wizard of Oz". My mom and I went to see it when we were younger, and I've always enjoyed it.   The film is a great one, it tells a story about Dorothy and her friends as they travel to the Emerald City to learn more about the mysterious wizard who was behind the strange events that happened in the Oz woods.  Unfortunately the story has a bit of a plot hole in that the Scarecrow has the key to the gate to the city, and it's not really mentioned when Dorothy first gets there.  There is some very cool effects throughout the film, but the special effects of the forest, as well as the characters' transformations are not quite what they were in the 1937 film.  It's a very good movie, but I feel that it needs some more of a love story and more character development in the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not very good. The first movie is good, and then the movie just gets worse and worse.  The only thing that keeps it from being a 1 is the great acting from all the cast.    I wish I knew more about these people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An American classic:  a story of love and loss, friendship and loss...a movie about a guy who, while out with a bunch of friends on a cruise boat, gets to know the gorgeous and talented singer, Joan Baez.   He falls for her and, like many people, she doesn't want to know him.  But he doesn't seem to have any interest in her, either.  He's a guy that will only make his love for her known to the best of his ability, so it's not long before they are making out in the bathroom.  Then they hear a song that Baez wrote.  It is the song that is playing in the movie.  After the song, they're both drunk and it seems to be on the tip of Joan's tongue to get up and leave.  Joan doesn't.  She goes back into the bathroom and the song is still playing.  So Joan goes up and puts on a "lovely" dress.  Baez starts talking about how she loves the music, how she's been listening to it all her life and how it's the song they were listening to.  They kiss and Joan goes out to get her guitar and they start playing together.  What follows is the most beautiful love story ever told.  The movie is so beautiful it's hard to believe it is a movie.

The demons that are possessed by humans are very scary and a good portion of the movie involves the demon being possessed by the boy and his mother. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am always a bit nervous about a movie like this, especially since I don't think there's really much that's new about it. I mean, there are a couple of different themes, but I can't say that they are all that innovative. The story is not terribly original, either, although I have to admit that it has a very good pace. The characters are all pretty good, but not all of them are the most memorable. I was not impressed with the acting, though, which is always one of the more serious parts of a movie. The dialogue is usually pretty bland, and I couldn't help but feel a bit bored. The soundtrack was pretty average.   The only bad thing about this movie is that the ending seemed to be a bit rushed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an interesting movie about a bunch of people on a vacation. They all like to kill things and are doing it right now. They are on a cruise ship with a bunch in the water. The cruise ship is about to sink, but it turns out to be a trap. The ship is filled with water. When the ship hits the ocean, a man on the top of the ship falls in the sea and drowns. A boy finds the man on a beach and tries to save him. The boy fails and the boy gets caught in a net. The woman from the movie is a swimmer and tries her best to save the boy. The movie ends with the boy and the woman on the beach. The girl is so happy to be alive. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Killed Donnie Darko  is a brilliant movie and has a very clever plot, even if it is a little convoluted. I think it is about a young man, Donnie (James Franco), who is trying to find his way in the world. He is an average young man who wants to be a writer. One day he meets a girl (Jennifer Connelly) who tells him she is a psychic. She tells him about the life that he wants to live, but he does not have the means to go about it. The problem is, he does, but not with a psychic girl. He decides to live the life of a writer, but without a psychic (the girl), he must find his own way in life. I have been wanting to see this movie since I saw it as a kid. I am glad I finally did. I loved it! It was not as good as it was when I was a kid, but it is still a very good movie. The acting was great and the plot was well thought out and executed. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good old fashioned movie making.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing you see when you walk in the theater is a shot of a beautiful woman (I think she is the wife of the character played by Robert Duvall), who is on a date with the movie's main character (who, I think, is DuvALL, though I haven't seen him yet) and his wife.  I don't know if it's possible to make a bad movie, but this one is pretty bad.  The plot, as described by the box-office poster, is that a man named David (played by Duv all right) and a woman named Lillian (played here by a much more pretty actress, Susan Lillis) have been separated for a while and are on a first date when a mysterious man named Peter (played for no reason by a very pretty actress) comes into the room.    He introduces himself as Peter Parker and tells David that he has been looking for him for years, and has finally found him.  When the two get to Lillian's place, Peter starts to make himself at home by giving her a massage, then he takes a bath, and he then takes Lillian out on the town to see some sights.  But things get weird when Lillian starts to fall for a guy (played, I believe, by a pretty actor named Peter Weller) who is a total stranger to both of them, and who turns out to be the man who killed her parents.  Peter Parker (of course) then tells Lillian that she has been cursed by the Black Cat and that if she tries to kill him, he will die.  She agrees to kill the man (David), but then Peter tries to kiss her, and then he dies.  After that scene, Peter is seen in the street being dragged by a mob of people.  The only way I can explain the movie is that it is a very funny movie, in which the lead actor is a great one, but the dialogue is pretty poor.  So, for that reason, I'm giving this movie a C.  If you're looking for a good romantic comedy about a guy who is cursed by a cat and is sent on a wild adventure, then you should look at the more recent films of Robert Duvvall and Robert Vaughn.
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** The film starts with a large group of kids being led into the woods, and are being told that the world is ending. They then start to see strange lights, and then the movie begins to get a little creepy. It's hard to say how scary this movie is. There are many shots of a very dark forest and the sounds are a bit eerie. There is no dialogue, only eerie noises. *****************************  RATING: 3/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you haven't seen the movie, it's about a young man who is sent to a mental institution and who is slowly coming to realize that he's not crazy. He discovers he has a friend who is very similar to himself and that the two of them are being watched. That is, they are being controlled by someone in the asylum. The plot is simple enough: The young man, who has a crush on the nurse, falls in love with her. She's the only person who doesn't notice him. She is the one that gets sick, is being watched, and is slowly being controlled. The movie is not bad, but it does feel like it could be better. The ending is nice and the music is okay, but the plot is weak.  The man's friend is the man in the movie and I liked it, it is a very simple plot, but you don't have to think too much to figure out what is going on.

This movie is a bit slow, but if you like movies about sick people, you will like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape is a great movie, not just for the wonderful action scenes, but for the characters and the storyline.  In many movies this type of story line is thrown in, to help the story along, but it doesn't really add to the story at all, instead it is a bit redundant.  This is the story of two men who are escaping from a German prison camp.  The story goes a bit too well too be believable.  This is because the characters are very well written, and their actions are believable.   The villains are even more so, as they are not just the bad guys, they are evil as hell, and are able to make a convincing case that they are the bad guy.    I think this movie is pretty good.  I have to give it a 8 out of 10, and I would recommend it to people who like a good story, but don't like too much action, or have a weak stomach.

I wish the movie would be made by someone more talented, it really should have been made by a director like John Hughes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie, if you like adventure, then this is for you.   I'm sure you are all a little bit like me when you start to see what this movie is all about.  This movie is about the search for the treasure of King Arthur.  The movie starts off with a few short scenes of the Arthurian legends.  After that, it picks up where it left off in the previous movie, with the crew of the ship, the Black Knight, headed to the Island of Avalon.  A short bit of the legend is told before we go to the real plot of the movie.  What really makes this movie so great is that it takes a bit of time to get into the story, but once you do, you are hooked.  There is a little more romance in this movie then in the first, but it doesn't take too long to get there.  One of the things I like about this movie was the fact that the Black knight had to be very careful around people, and that he has a wife to keep him in check.  It was a great thing about the movie to get to know the characters a little better, and get to see them grow as the story progresses.  I will say that the acting was not that great, but this is one of the movies that I will watch again and again.  If you have a chance to see this movie, then I can't recommend it enough!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on a special screening in a theater near my home in St. Louis, Missouri. I had never heard of this movie, but the reviews on the Internet are all glowing. I was also surprised that the movie was not a spoof, but a true story. The film begins with a police detective (played by Jeff Bridges) in a bar trying to get a confession from a suspect (played, oddly, by the legendary actor Ray Milland). The detective finds the suspect (actually a cop) in his car in the middle of the road. The detective calls for backup and gets it. After a few shots are fired, the detective gets out of his car and walks into the middle distance. He begins to pull out his gun, and the suspect sees this and raises his gun. The movie was shot in a manner which, if not exactly realistic, was very good. The dialog was good, the acting good, and I thought the movie itself was good. I would suggest it to anyone who likes police procedurals.

There are not a lot of great acting performances here, but some interesting ones. The characters are very well-developed and it is easy to see why this movie has such a large audience.   Then, things start getting really bad, with one of the characters having an emotional breakdown, leading to a large amount of death. This character has an intense, realistic and disturbing portrayal of a very different type of person.   a) The movie is about a girl who becomes a human robot and a man who can only communicate with her by speaking to her with the robot's voice.  b) It's a horror movie.   and c) I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with how well the characters were developed.   for me, the movie's first half is excellent and shows a lot about the development of the main characters, while the second half is not as good, with some characters having a very boring and unbelievable death scenes. I don't know what happened to the movie itself.  : This is a very disturbing movie. It is disturbing in the sense that there are a lot more things going on than just a normal, everyday, scary movie. I was quite scared by it, and I'm sure you will be too. If you like horror, then this movie is a must see. I gave it a 4/5.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie with great performances. The film has a very interesting story that is quite interesting in the beginning. I didn't know the meaning of the film until a while in. I thought the movie was very funny, very entertaining. The story is about a woman named Mimi who gets married to a man named Denny and then decides to divorce him. She is married to Denny who is very jealous of her. She tries to make a move on a man she thinks she can get. She has a few people in her life who love her but the men are too jealous and she can't get any satisfaction out of them. She then decides on the man who she thinks can satisfy her and she gets married. The man is a little too easy on the eyes. He gets jealous of Mimi when she has Denny around. This leads to a lot of problems. It was a good film. I recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, which was produced by George S. Kaufman, and directed by Steven Spielberg, has a lot of interesting ideas about the future and about life on earth. The special effects were good, and the dialogue was fine.   There is a lot to enjoy in this movie, but it is very slow paced.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an old school sci-fi movie with a very simple premise: aliens abduct a human child (Hans, played by a young actor named Hans Conried) and take him away. The movie starts out with Hans and the alien, played (as usual) by a very young and very talented actor, being taken by boat to a very strange city. This is where the movie begins to get good. The city is so strange and creepy that Hans gets a little scared, which is a good sign. The aliens (actually the only humans) are very creepy and a little like ghosts, and their behavior is so off the wall that it becomes difficult to take them seriously. They are really just weird. The ending of the movie is also very interesting. It is a little confusing, but it is not hard to see how the aliens are trying to return the child to his mother. I guess it would be interesting to know what would happen if Hans was not kidnapped and if he didn't return home. I would like to see a sequel to this movie, but I'm not sure it will happen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why this movie was so well received, but I did not see it. My sister had a screening and we watched it together. The whole family enjoyed it. The movie is about a father who finds a young boy who had been thrown out of a window into a building that is now falling to pieces. He goes to get the boy and finds his parents dead. He doesn't know the boy's name, but believes that he is the son of his late wife. He decides to go to the boy, and asks him to tell him who his father was. The boy says that his father wasn't his real father. He is not allowed to tell anyone of his real mother. He must live in a orphanage with other orphans. He gets along well with the other orphans and eventually becomes their leader. He also begins to play basketball, and the other boys begin to like him. The other children begin to tease him, and he is eventually bullied by one of the orphans. The kids think that he must be a boy, because he is wearing a boy's uniform, and playing a boy-game. He plays the game well, and becomes the leader of the boys. He finds that the boys in the orphanage do not know him, so he decides to teach them. He tells them how to read and write, and how to write down their names. They begin to have some fun. One of the older boys, who looks like a little boy, tells him he is going to be a priest one day. He becomes very excited about this, and begins to call himself a priest. But he begins to realize that his new position is not all it's cracked up to be. The priests are not allowed in the church, and are not very well paid. His job is not very stable, and there are many other priests who are in a similar situation. He wants to be able to have a family of his own, so that he can be free of the priests. He begins to work out his own ideas on how to get out of the situation. At the same time, he also becomes involved with a girl, who is older than him. There is also a boy who is also part of the orphan group, and a boy from a neighboring town who is very rich. They all begin to make plans to make money. They take a few girls to the city and have them prostitute themselves. There are many more boys in this group, who
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not about the love between a couple. This movie is about a girl who has a bad childhood and a boy who had a terrible childhood. The boy who has suffered and still suffers from a broken childhood. When she gets married to him, he is so poor he can barely pay his debts. So she asks him to work in the field. He is a farmer who has only a small house and can't find any work. When he is offered a job to go to a town, he asks her to be his wife and take care of his son. She takes care of him, cooks and does all the housework. He does the work he is paid to do, and she can't live in the small house. She is poor and does not know what she is going to do when the child grows up. He gets married and is poor. They have no money to buy food. He wants to buy a cow to make a few pails of milk. He has no money. The girl comes to see him and tells him that she needs money to pay her rent, and to pay for the cow. He offers her a job as a maid in the village, but she wants to be a farmer. So he says that he will buy her a cow and he will send her to work as a farmer herself. She wants to do it because she wants the husband and child to be well off. But the boy is so desperate that he sells the cow and gives it to her. She gives it back to him. This is the end of the movie.   The boy and girl have a child and are very happy together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Thing is one of those films that is a little too much like a video game and a little less like a movie.    While the story of the Thing is not terribly original, it is still an entertaining one.   The Thing seems to have some kind of psychic ability to see in the dark.      The Thing has some interesting enemies that he can beat, although not often.  And it seems like a lot of the time the Thing just gets hit by stuff and is unharmed.  " The Thing is a great little film with a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a sense, "Somewhere" is the movie that was made to prove a point about the world. It's a movie about a man who can never find his place in the world; who has no one but himself; who is trapped in his own mind; and who is completely consumed by his own fears. It is a film about a person who can't find his own way out of a bad situation, but who tries and fails to escape by trying to fix it. It isn't the world of a world-weary, bored, and hopeless person. It was the world that I lived in when I was 13 years old and was the place that I came from when I went to college and was 20 years old. It wasn't the place I came to when I got married and had my first child. It certainly wasn't a place where I thought I'd die young. It didn't have a life for me, and I'm still searching for that life for myself.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off very slowly. But as the plot thickens, the movie slowly becomes more exciting.   This movie is not your typical romance movie. There are no love triangles or sexual situations.  It is about a guy who loses his girlfriend and then finds another one. The story of the movie is very realistic. The plot starts with the guy, his friends, a girl and her mother coming home from a movie. But the movie turns out to be very sad. The friends were all having problems with their girlfriends. The movie is about them, and about their relationships. I don't know about the plot but the movie made me cry.  The ending was very realistic as the movie ends with the mom crying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************** The story is quite interesting. You are introduced to a couple of bad-ass cops who are part of a special police squad, the Hells Angels. These guys are basically gangsters. They don't care about anything but money and sex. Their leader is a "don't care" type. The story takes a turn in the second half when a young woman is killed, the bad-asses are accused of being involved. The cops don't take it lying down and try to clear their names. I found this movie very entertaining, but I did have a few problems. I felt the second movie was better, but it didn't matter. I liked the main characters. ************************** Summary: ********** I enjoyed the Hell's Angels, but the second one is better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was so much fun to watch!  It has all the hallmarks of a good thriller:  1) It has some nice action scenes.  There are plenty of fast cars and the characters are all tough guys.  2) It's an excellent movie about a man who goes to his family's funeral, but has no memory of them.   He has an interesting theory about the death and is willing to take risks to find the truth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun and silly movie about a woman and her new husband, who is a giant gorilla. The movie is a sequel to "The Great American Ninja: The Legend of Rocko" and a movie about Rocko (Michael Keaton) being a good guy who is not so good at his job. The only problem is that the gorilla is not quite as funny as in the first movie. Rocko is not as smart as Rocko in the second movie, and the gorilla does not really help Rocko with anything. In this movie, we see that Rocko and the "Great American Ninja" are actually on the same side of the law. It is a good time for all of us, who love Rocko!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a movie about the end of the world, but the world of this film is very different from that of a classic film like The Day The Earth Stood Still.  The ending is a bit abrupt and you have to wait a few minutes to see what happens. It is hard to believe that the end is so sudden and it seems as if something happens and you can't see what it is because you don't see it, but in the end it is revealed to be a good and unexpected ending.  The movie is quite long, and I would say the length is perfect, I would suggest watching it with an open mind because it is very unpredictable and you won't be sure what is going to happen. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something different from the typical apocalypse movies that you are used to seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ This movie has it all: a solid plot, interesting characters, great soundtracks, and some very impressive effects. _______________________________________________ The story revolves around the protagonist, Riku, a young man from a wealthy family who is now trying to earn enough money to help his sister escape from a small village in the middle of nowhere. The town's population is made up mostly of poor farmers and fishermen. They live off the land, and there are not many other opportunities to earn a living. One day, a woman named Aya (Mizuko Inoue) comes to town, and her family has been farming the land for generations. She has a kind personality and has an insatiable thirst for knowledge. She tells Riku that she has a secret that she would like to teach him. Riku agrees to learn everything she can about the world. However, this means that he has to leave his home and his family. But before he leaves, Raku (Tomokazu Sugita) arrives in town to help Riku get settled in. But his arrival leads to an odd friendship between the two of them. Raku teaches Riku the ways of the people in the village, and Riku learns about the secrets that are hidden within the forest. This friendship, however, does not last long, as Riku finds himself being chased by the evil witch, Kaoru (Aya Suzaki), who wants to turn him into a witch. She is aided by a boy named Nijiko (Matsutoshi Nakamura), who was once a member of the same village as Raku, but is now a thief. As Nijikko attempts to stop Kaoru, Ruku is forced to join the two against his will. _______________________________ It is a good idea to watch this movie early in your life, because you can't really prepare yourself for what you are about to see. There is something about this movie that keeps you wanting to come back for more. _________________ I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that I'm actually a big fan of Miyazaki's work, but I'm not exactly sure why.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ _________________________________   The plot is set up in the first minute: the story revolves around a group of four kids who, in the past year, have been "found out." They are a bunch of misfits who are "found" because they were in a video tape which was made in the late 70s and it was supposed to be a movie but the director died before he could finish it and all the money was spent on the set. The tape was shown to a few friends in an old apartment complex and a group called "the Children's League" bought it because it was thought to be the first film to tell a story of a group finding itself. The kids are "the Kids," and the group is "The Family."   There are four main characters: John (the leader), Sam (the kid who knows the most about the group), Joe (the "cool" kid) and Bob (the other "cool kid" who is not as cool as he thinks he is). John is the leader and a bit of a loner, but he's a good leader and knows what he wants. Sam is the kid who can be tough or cool. Joe is the guy who tries to be cool, but is actually just a bit shy and not as tough as he seems. Bob is a total weirdo. He seems to have no sense of humor at all. His real friends are Bob and Bob's girlfriend, Julie (the most naive and silly girl in the group). All of the kids are different in their own ways, but they all have to come to terms with their differences and learn to work together.   My favorite characters are John and Sam. They are the most original and interesting characters I've seen in a while. I really like how they come to their own decisions and the problems that arise when they try to work out their differences. John is a very quiet kid who doesn't talk much but who seems to be thinking a lot about what he's doing. Sam can be cool or tough, but in the end, he is just a kid who is trying to fit in.   and in the second half, they make a group movie together and have a group picnic together, all while being "found," and then they have to face their fears and learn how to be "found-out" and how to work in the "family" again.  -L.R.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It's been a long time coming, but finally I'm back on the set of a good flick, and this one's got some serious character work.  The story has some nice elements (a lot of "what-if" stories), but not so much as to make this a bad film.  The movie's a little over a half hour long, and not a whole lot of action, so don't expect to see a lot of big, hairy guys doing all the fighting.  It's a decent enough movie, and I look forward to more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Trek Into Darkness"  has a lot of heart, and some heart-wrenching moments to go with it.  I found myself in tears a few times as I was watching the first half of this film.  It is not very often I watch a Star Trek movie and actually feel as if the director did a decent job.    "StarTrek.com"   The director, JJ Abrams,   did a good job, and this movie is well worth the watch.     The opening credits show the Enterprise and the crew   in deep space, with the Earth and the Federation on the screen in the background.  The opening credits are shown from the point of view of a young man named Kirk, who is piloting the starship Enterprise.  Kirk has a strange new haircut and has a bit of a nervous breakdown.  He gets a new co-pilot, Lieutenant Uhura, and a new computer named Sulu, who has the unique ability to see into the future.  His first assignment is to take the Enterprise into the Andromeda Galaxy, a galaxy that is filled with strange creatures.  This is the first time we see this galaxy, and it is populated by a number of strange looking creatures, including some that look like they could be from another planet.  These creatures are in league with the Klingon Empire, who are trying to invade the Earth.  We also get some new faces in the form of Spock, who will play a big part in this movie, and Scotty, a scientist and father figure to Kirk.  It is interesting to see that Kirk has been acting very strangely lately, and the way that the crew and Spock deal with it is quite a sight to behold.  There are a lot more plot developments in this film, and even more heartbreak, but it is still a good one to watch. Star Trek   " Into Darkness "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a classic from the 1960s.  One of my favourite films, a great time-waster.  Here's a brief rundown of the plot:    A man is stranded on an island and has to find a way to survive.   He meets a beautiful woman who tells him that he is on an uninhabited island and there are two men who are trying to kill him.  He gets to know them and then they tell him to go to the jungle where the two men are waiting.  But, then he is attacked by a man who is disguised as a woman.  Then he gets some help from some natives and they help him to escape.  This is a movie I'm sure I will watch again and again.  It's a great movie.  I was watching it for the first time last week and I just can't believe that it's still being made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen this movie yet, but it looks great and looks like it will be an enjoyable ride.  The story line is fun and I am excited to see the movie.  4 out of 5 stars "I think I've seen this before."  "I think we've seen the last of the American Indians.  "The only thing that's left is to be killed.  The movie is a remake of the 1983 film, "The Last Frontier" starring Don Johnson and Susan Sarandon.  The film was produced in 1994 by Peter Berg and the director, Peter Berg, is the same director who did "The French Connection".  In this film we see the lives of the characters who were the last to see a Western before the war.  This film is not as good as "The Indian Runner"  which was based on the book by William Saroyan and I really think that this film is a disappointment.  In the book we see a tribe who live in the wilds and live as they want to.  They don't need to be civilized or help any other people.  While the movie version of the film shows the tribesmen who are not as violent or as violent as in the book.  We see the violence of the tribes people in this movie and it is quite terrible.   I think that the film version of this movie is much worse than the book because it doesn't give a good description of the West or the Indians.   The characters are all the same.  It's not good enough that they all live in this isolated place where they have to live as nature dictates.  I don't think it is a good idea to have a movie about a group of people who live as their nature dictates because it's not interesting or interesting enough to watch.  Instead, I think it would be better to have an adaptation of the book called "The American West - A Tale of Two Tribes" by James M. Cain.  That way the movie can focus more on the characters, which is the most interesting part of a film.  So if you are a fan of the books and like action movies then "The Indians" is the movie for you.  If you are looking for a Western with great acting then "A Walk to Remember"   or "The Wages of Fear"  is the better movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was good. The movie was about a man who went into a coma. He woke up in a hospital in a new place. He went to see his wife who was pregnant. She had given birth to a boy. This boy was very sick and needed to be taken to a different hospital. He saw a man in a room who was giving him a transfusion. The transfusion was causing him to die and it took a while for the doctors to find out why. The boy was about 6 years old. He looked like a boy from another planet. He could not speak. He did not look like a child at all. His skin was a strange green color. It looked like he had never washed his face. The doctors kept telling the boy's mother that this was the first time in his life he was having a stroke. The man who was with the boy said he was his brother. He said his name was Lenny. The woman who was his wife told him she thought his brother was his father.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The first movie in a series is called "Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy". It is a fairy tale that tells the story of a poor orphan boy named K.W. who is raised by his aunt and uncle, but is a bit lazy. One day, he gets lost in the forest and finds a fairy that has the power to change the color of his clothes. He is a little afraid of her so he leaves her alone, but she makes him so happy that he wants to stay with her forever. Unfortunately, one day a witch shows up to steal the fairy and K.K. is sent back to his uncle to get the fairy back. But, the witch has a very wicked side. Her evil is only rivaled by her beauty. She wears a blue dress and green lipstick, and she has a sweet voice. I think K. K. is just a little too easy to love. He just sits around, waiting for a fairy to come and take him. Then, a little girl shows up and he falls in love with her. But then the witch shows him a magical spell that will make her his wife. But before she can do that, he has to pass the spell that makes the girls love him. And that's when the movie really begins. I really love the movie, because the first half of it is all about the friendship between K. W. and the fairy. And, I loved how they just hang out and hang out. They are all just hanging out in the woods. K.-W. doesn't like the fact that he has magic powers and he's always trying to avoid the witch and the other girls. I also loved how the witch is a very bad witch. She can only do one thing, and that's steal the fairies. She also has a few other spells that she can use to do all sorts of things, but that's all the spells she really knows. K-K. has this magic power that he can't seem to use in a good way. So, he is a really lazy little boy who is always trying. I liked the fact the witches had to keep changing things in the story to keep the boys in their good moods. When K.H. comes to the town to steal a fairy, K-H. is able to use his power to make the girls like him. But when he tries to get K.J. back, K. H. makes the witch

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie so many times I've lost count. It's like watching the very first Star Trek movie. The movie's a bit slow and you really get a feel for the crew. The music and voice acting are great. I think this is a good entry into the series.   There's a few problems:   - There's a ton of "special effects" and not enough of an explanation of why they're used. (The first time you see a Vulcan go into space with a bunch of other space-traveling aliens it's all done by puppets).   The only problem I have with this movie is that it's a little too "future" for me. I mean, you know, they have computers on their heads, the crew goes to space, and the ship is a giant space-ship. I guess I'm just a little disappointed.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a bit of a boring story. But as it went on I got more and more interested. The movie has a lot of suspense and the tension is just enough to make it entertaining.   I really like this movie and I hope that it gets a release in theaters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself enjoying this movie, even though it's not as good as the original. It's not nearly as good, but it's still a fun movie. I loved how the main character gets the girl and is so happy that she likes him back, but still loves her mom a little too much.   Posted by Chris in Movies at 9:37 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie is that the ending was pretty good. The ending of this movie, is the best thing in the movie. I think it's very good, and I'm not going to say anything bad about it, because I like it, and that's what matters. It was fun to watch. If you like sci-fi movies, and you like the story about a group of people who have been sent to the future, you will like this movie. If there are things about it that are not fun, like the ending, you can watch it for a laugh. It's not a bad movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, while a bit short, has a good story line, and it's not just about the hero. He has to do a lot of hard work to win his love. She was a girl he had fallen in love with before, but her family was against her and didn't want her to marry a man she wasn't really into. Then she was kidnapped and held hostage for a year by a sadistic and brutal criminal who was also her teacher. She finally got him to marry her, but the criminal was only out for a few more years.   The movie is pretty good, especially for the time it was made.  This movie is not as good as I expected, it's still a good one though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really like the movie. It's a comedy about a guy who wants to make a film that will get him noticed by the movie industry. The director wants him to find a girl with a big nose and a big bosom to play his heroine. His first job is to play a young girl who is looking for a boyfriend. The movie is very well made. It has some good jokes and good dialogues. The acting is very good and the characters are very unique. The ending is very unexpected and well written. This movie is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and interesting movie. It is also one of those movies where I don't think the main character (who is a kid) has a single bad line. It's a movie about a kid who goes to a new school and is bullied by his classmates. The main character is very strong and has the ability to defend himself. The teacher is a good teacher who gives the kids a chance. The movie is also good at showing the consequences of being a bully and how to overcome that. I also like how the school is modeled after the real thing. The kids are all friends who work together. It really reminds me of the real school I went to growing up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a classic. It is a very simple and short film. The plot is very simple: a woman is in love with a handsome man, she is married and her husband is away on a fishing trip. So she decides to travel to her lover's house in a boat. In a moment of madness, she kills her husband and her lover in the most cruel way.   The film is quite funny. There are some bad things about it, but at the same time it is really sad and tragic.   (this is my second review of this film) This film is not very good and I have not seen it in a long time. The film has only one good thing in it, which is that the ending is sad and sad. I think the ending was done well. However, I think it could have been better if it were a bit longer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Muppet Movie" is a good and entertaining comedy about a bunch of misfits who get in trouble at a local carnival. I thought it was pretty funny and enjoyable, but I found the story to be a little repetitive. I can see why they did this in the end, though, since I think it is a fun ride, but it is not a great film. It is certainly funny, and the characters are all well developed, but there is a lot of repetition in the story and the ending is not all that great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A funny movie about a man who gets the idea to become a cop. The movie starts off with the police being the bad guys. But this turns out to be a great idea. The guy who starts off as the bad guy is the one that has to get the cops on his side. The cops have to use their wits to stop him. The comedy is pretty good as well. The ending of the movie is a bit rushed and I think it should have been a little longer. The only bad thing about this movie is that it takes place in a small town.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think we've all seen this movie before, so I won't bore you with the details.  It's a pretty standard action film with a lot of "breathtaking action" and plenty of special effects, a bit more than you can expect from a movie of this type.  I'm a big fan of action films, and it seems like the people who made this are just big fans of them.  It was a fun ride, though it didn't last very long.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A film about the first war, about two boys, one of them a former British army officer, the other a Russian officer. In the course of the film, the British soldier is captured by the Russians and taken to a village where he is treated as a slave. Eventually, the Russians decide that they can use him and that is what they do. The boy is told that he will be sold to a rich Russian family. He is taken to an old Russian house where he finds himself living with a number of Russian women. One of the Russian women, a very pretty Russian girl, is told by a Russian priest that she has been given to the boy by a superior officer. She then decides that the boy should be sold again. The Russian girl also has another Russian officer who is a sadistic man who likes to see the boys suffer. The film is well made and has a good story, although it is not very well acted. It is a pity that the film does not contain much action.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is a fairly decent thriller about a man who, as a child, had a strange, and sometimes disturbing experience.   This is followed by a more serious story of a woman who suffers from a very similar case.  They are both people who have a history of seeing things.  The story about the man starts out quite good.  He is a man with a job, a good family, a home, a car.  His wife, also works and seems to be doing well.  However, he has a strange and sometimes unsettling experience that comes from time to time.  This leads to him questioning himself, and it leads to some of the more disturbing events that take place in the movie.  I found it to be very disturbing.  It is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is still very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good action movie.   There is a lot of fun, and a few action scenes, but not nearly as many as in a certain film from the 70's, and this movie does not take place in the 1970's either.  This movie is set in the 80's, which is why there is a little more action, and it is a different kind of action, not as fast and not as intense as the first movie, but it is still fun, with a nice mix of action scenes and some comedy.  One of the characters is a girl named Linda, who is the daughter of the head of the company, who has a bad temper and a bad reputation, and she gets involved in a lot trouble.  There are a lot more people in this movie, some of them are interesting, but a few are just not good enough to be really interesting, and they all seem to be trying to get in a fight.  The movie is mostly action, with some comedy, and some of the action scenes are really good.  Some of the movie is a bit long, but then again it is not that long, and that is what makes it good.

I like to sit down with a nice glass of wine and enjoy a good story.  For a while I thought that this was just that kind of story. I mean, I don't know what I expected when I first heard about this film. I had never seen a good time-travel movie before, and I really like time-time travel movies.    There was nothing particularly memorable about this movie.  It was a nice little slice of cinema, but it wasn't all that special.  The plot was simple, and the story of the characters was interesting.  I guess you could call it a "feel-good" movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ I had a feeling that this movie would be a real gem and it turned out to be that. I like it when a movie does the impossible and takes you into the mind of a psychotic, sociopathic killer who is obsessed with his victim, a woman he was dating. He's obsessed with her because she's his mother's daughter. He has a history of violence and abuse and this movie shows the man at his most evil. His wife, a beautiful woman, who he wants to be like him is murdered by him and a friend. This movie is the best in the genre because it's well acted and the writing is perfect. It's a movie that I'm going to remember for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think it would work as a horror movie. I mean it is a good horror movie, and I've seen a lot of them, but it isn't a true horror movie at all. It isn't even a thriller. It's a psychological horror movie that I like. It is very much in the vein of the early seventies Hammer films like Dracula or the Hammer Dracula films. The movie itself has a lot in common with those Hammer movies as well. The music is also very much like the Hammer movies. There is a lot going on, but the plot is pretty simple. A man named Henry (Tom Savini) comes back from a job overseas and is staying in the same hotel as his wife (Patricia Arquette). Henry is a doctor and Patricia is a nurse. Henry has recently gone off to the Army and is in the Army Hospital. He is in a coma and Patricia tells him that he has a tumor in his head. He wakes up, and is a little confused about the situation, but decides that he needs to go back to the States to help with his family, but then is visited by a woman named Rita (Sigourney Weaver) who tells him about her daughter. Rita tells him she has a son who is suffering from a terrible disease called "dementia" and he needs Henry's help. Henry agrees to go, but tells Rita he can't take any of her medication, but he has made some changes to the hotel so that it can help her son. The film begins with a very good scene of a room full of people getting ready to leave for their jobs. All of the men are carrying their suits, and all of the women are in their uniforms. It looks very nice, and the shot is very good. However, the music is all very much the same from the Hammer films, and there isn't much of a difference in the movie, other than the changes in the hotel. It really is a very boring and uninteresting movie, but that is kind of the point of it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the acting is really good. The way Tom Savini is playing Henry is very well done, and it is obvious he is not too happy about his wife coming back from overseas. The writing is also pretty good, but in my opinion it is not very original. If you don't like the genre, then this is probably not the movie for you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a kid, my father and I would get up early on Saturday mornings and drive to a nearby farm where he would pick tomatoes for me to eat. I loved those tomatoes.  The movie stars Don Knotts, an actor who played an astronaut on the TV show The Outer Limits in the late seventies and early eighties.  The film follows him as he goes to pick tomatoes. It was filmed on a soundstage in Los Angeles in 1977.  It is a bit hard to watch at times but it's worth it.

This movie is an epic movie from start to finish.  The characters are good and the action is good.  There is some comedy in this movie, but not a lot of it.  I thought the plot was interesting and I liked it a whole lot more than the first two Transformers movies.  Transformers 3 was a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a reason why I have never seen this movie.  I am not an expert on Japanese movies but I would guess that this movie is not worth seeing unless you are familiar with Japanese cinema.    The movie is very long (about 5 hours) and it has a story that is very good.  But there are no subtitles, so the movie is hard to understand.  It is a very long movie but I guess it is worth watching for the story.  I would recommend this movie to people who love movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie.  I'm not sure if the actors were trying to be funny, but they were.       And they all seem to have a good time.  A group of old people are having a party at a house.  The house is old and has a great view.  There are many other people, who are also having a great time. They begin to argue and argue.    One of the old people starts talking about how he would rather be the only one to have his eyes gouged out with a rusty pitchfork than have any of his eyes ever open again.  One of them points out that the old man is a fraud and he shouldn't talk like that.  So the old guy gets up and yells "I WILL STRIKE YOU DOWN, YOU LITTLE CREEP!"   And he does.  They are all surprised.  It seems like there is some kind of power going on.  I think the old person has some kind psychic power.  This movie is very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in a lot of movies, and I've never heard of a "Titanic" before, but after seeing it, I knew it was a good one. It's set in the 1920s and stars Humphrey Bogart as a wealthy man who has decided to travel to the ocean, so he can take a ride. Along the way, he meets up with some other rich people and has a few drinks, and then falls asleep in a cab. He's found the next morning by a boat, and he's brought back to the boat, where he finds the two wealthy men who brought him back. The wealthy men try to sell him on the idea that he's crazy, but he is actually right in a way, as he's really not insane. His life is a great story, but I'll try to keep this short. The plot is pretty good, with lots of humor and drama, and also the best performance of Bogart's career, with some wonderful lines like: " I have been to the bottom of the sea." " I'd like to try a new kind of tea. " " My life is my story. "

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one of those rare films that I can honestly say I loved every minute of.   A fun movie for any fans of old school crime fiction, it follows the same format as its forebears.  The story is told through the eyes of an old detective called "R.I.P." who has been called back to the New York to assist the NYPD.  He has been a member of the NYPD for 30 years.  While working in the old New York City, he has come across a murder case that he suspects was carried out by the same gang who murdered his father.  This is a perfect example of how the old school formula can be made new.  A detective who has known his profession for 30 plus years is called back into action to solve the mystery.  But this isn't just a case of police work.  It is a mystery of the old world.  R.I.P.'s investigation takes him to all corners of the city and beyond.  From the most familiar New York streets to the most exotic places around the world. But it is in the middle of all of this that R. I.P. finds his true love and begins to fall in love with the woman who will become his wife.  I have to say I was very happy to see this film, and I really hope this one doesn't go down in history as the last time a classic was made in America. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a time when everyone was complaining about the lack of diversity in Hollywood and the need for more white people to be cast as actors in Hollywood films, director Michael Winterbottom (A Clockwork Orange) came along and showed that the white people in Hollywood weren't the only ones who need to be given roles in Hollywood. Winterbottom showed that black and Asian men could be successful in a white male dominated industry as well.   One of the most important parts of Winterbottom's films is that he cast actors with different races of men. This is why a good majority of the cast are white.  This is not only a film about the racism in Hollywood, it is also a film that shows how hard it is to get the roles that you want in Hollywood because most of the white actors do not want to be actors. This makes it very easy for the black actors to get their roles because they are much better at playing their roles.  If you think that a black and an Asian man can play the same role then you are a racist and need to get out more.

I like to think I'm a fairly intelligent guy, but I was easily out-thought by a bunch of students. I was more than a little confused, and I have no idea what they were thinking with this movie. It was a bit too silly for my taste, but that is the kind of comedy that you can make fun of even if you can't stand it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** The story of "Jenny's Wedding" is not too different from a lot of other movies about weddings. There are several couples, each with their own problems and personalities. In this case, the problem is Jenny and her fiancé, and the problem for Jenny is that she is not very good at being a wife. She is an ex-porn star, and is not good at keeping her mouth shut, nor is she very good with children. She does the housework, and when her friends invite her to a party to honor their father's recent death, she shows up and does a pretty good job, but it turns out that her ex-husband has arranged the party so that he can get away with cheating on his wife, and Jenny and some of her friends start to think about going to the party. However, Jenny is also concerned about her ex and how he is acting, so when they finally go to the birthday party, Jenny gets drunk and goes over to the guy's house. Her ex-fiancé comes home and finds Jenny drunk in his bed. He tells her to get out, but Jenny doesn't care, so she leaves. When her friends get home, they are upset and Jenny can't take it anymore. She gets up, yells at her friends for not taking care of her when she had a hard time getting home, and then she tells her friends to call the police. Jenny starts getting upset and yells at them to leave, but they are still mad. Jenny gets upset that her friends don't care about her, but when she is upset, she does not care if they get upset with her. Jenny's friend gets so upset that she storms out, and that is when Jenny is ready to punch the guy. However the police are there and Jenny's friends run off. Jenny is in a really bad mood, but then she decides that she wants to get back at her ex by breaking his nose. Jenny leaves the party and drives to the man's house, where she tells him she wants him to break his nose because he is so bad with his money. She drives back to the hotel where the party is, and she goes to the restroom to take a leak. While she is in the bathroom, Jenny's ex-boyfriend walks in and she punches him. The guy hits the bathroom wall and the girl runs out. The police are waiting outside the door, and they see Jenny hitting her ex, and decide to arrest
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Holes" is a terrific movie, a little slow but with a lot of heart and a lot to say about life in a post-war world. It's a dark film with a little bit of humor in the background, but the overall mood is very bleak. You feel like you're walking through a dark tunnel and the last scene with the two little boys makes the whole thing seem like a dream. I'm not really sure how many of us were even alive when the bombs were dropping, but that doesn't matter. This film is about the real horrors of war. And even if you're not a fan of horror films or war, it's a great time for a movie like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Gatsby" is a great movie that shows how good a story can be.  There is a bit of a theme in this movie that is almost too subtle for me to notice.  One day, a man walks into a bar and starts talking about the great life of Gatsbys.   He says the life was good, but they never seem to get there.  Gatsworths always seem to be in New York, in the city, but never in the countryside.  There is a small village called "Fitzgeraldsville" that is where the story starts.  This small town has a man named Holden Caulfield.  Holden has a wife named Daisy.  He is a lawyer who is always drunk, and has a very odd sense of humor.  Daisy and Holden have a son named Nicky.  Nicky is the only one who can hear the great Gats by his father.  They have lived in Fitzgeraldsville for a long time, and have built a large house in the woods.  Unfortunately, they are always away on their fishing trips, and always seem sad about it.  When Nicky grows up, he has a big job offer.  After they leave New York to go to Fitzgerald'sville, Nicky becomes very depressed, and wants to go back to the city.  At one point, Holden says he is going to the farm to get some food, and they go back home.  The movie then cuts to Nicky in his bedroom, sitting in a chair, staring at a small picture of himself in his room.  "I'm not a big man," he says, and he sits down on the bed.  It is at this point that I noticed a subtle change in the way he looks.  I noticed how he has more hair on his head.  Even though it's a small scene, I remember thinking this movie has great depth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen The Big Lebowski before and it's good, but this is a completely different movie with its own charm. This one, like all of the Lebowks, is full of the absurd, and it is great.   The Lebowskis are the best.  The movie takes place in a small town in Indiana called Lubbock and is the story of an aging bartender who has to face the fact that he is dying. When he meets a woman named "Missy", he is suddenly faced with the possibility that he will not live forever and will not be able to see his wife again. After they have a few drinks and his mind is freed, he decides to spend the rest of his life with her. They live happily ever after.  And yes, I did find the end a bit abrupt, but I don't think that's the fault of the movie, since it is all very well-done.  I have seen this movie three times now, and I can't think of a better movie than this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The ending is pretty satisfying too. It has a really good atmosphere, even if it does not go exactly how you would expect. The movie is good for the time it was made. The story is a bit short but that is just a flaw.   I give this movie a 4.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title says, this is a movie about two lovers who get married and have a baby girl. I found this movie to be very cute. It's a little different from most of the other movies I have seen so far. It has a bit more romance and more comedy in it. I also really enjoyed the music. I think it's the best music that this movie has had so far! I thought that it was a good watch and it was very cute!
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â "The Green Mile" is a classic of westerns and a perfect example of the genre. It's not quite the "Green" Mile, but it's pretty close, and it's even better than that. It could have easily been made into a "Green Mile" remake, and the similarities would have been the same. It would be interesting to see if it got made as a film remake and if the original cast would have wanted to reprise their roles. Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a sucker for a good romantic comedy, especially a comedy that is set in the middle of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. But that's where my love for this film is short-lived. The film doesn't go anywhere, and I'm not sure why. It has a lot of ideas, but not a lot is explained. I think this was the director's idea: to write a movie that has a premise that will get your attention, then to get your mind off the premise by having it be completely uninteresting. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. This movie is about a guy who has a crush on a girl who is so far below him that he thinks she's an alien. This is his idea of a great love. The movie is over-produced and badly acted.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ I have watched this film so many times and I always get sucked into it. It's a good story, a great performance by the great Cary Grant. The film is set in the 1930's in New York City. The story is about a man who goes to a party in the city and meets a beautiful woman who he falls for. The only problem is that he finds out she has a husband and they are separated. The woman tells him she wants to go back to her husband and live with him. She leaves and he goes on a journey to find her. This is a great movie and you should watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie, I like it a lot.  The plot is simple, the girl gets into a car accident, and the guy (the one who got her) is a hero, and he helps her with the pain.    The plot was good, it had some interesting ideas, it was a nice change of pace from all the action films out there, it gave me a good laugh and was a pretty good movie.  What I didn't like about the movie:     This is the first movie that I ever liked.  This movie is an interesting twist on the action film.  It does have some interesting and good plot twists, and some good scenes in the movie, but it's not a great movie, in my opinion.  I thought the movie was ok, but I can't recommend it to anyone.

When the band decides to go out on the road, a band called The Wild Angels shows up, and they offer them a chance to make some money.  I really enjoyed this movie.

I was actually surprised that this movie came out before it. I liked it and liked it a lot. It was very well made, and the story, while not the most interesting, was well told. It felt like a good "old-fashioned" movie. It is not a particularly deep movie, but I don't think that's the point. I'm not sure why anyone would want to watch a WW1 movie, and if you can find it on video, I would recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Goon" is a fun little movie with a good amount of humor and a lot of action. It is also pretty good looking. There is a reason why the "Star Wars" franchise is so popular. It looks good, it has good acting and is well acted by a large cast. There are also a number of pretty cool effects in the film and the special effects used are great. It was an enjoyable little movie and I would definitely recommend it to fans of the "Goon movies" or just anyone who likes a good time with a lot o fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first part of this is the best part, as it's the first movie that was really focused on the relationship between two main characters (well, three in this case). It's not exactly a romantic story, but the romance between the main characters is really interesting and not the least bit cliché. I thought the last part of the movie was a little bit weak, although it was still pretty good. It's probably one of the weakest entries into the Alien franchise. But still a very enjoyable movie to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last of the Mohicans" is a great movie.  It is not as good as the classic " The Last of Robin Hood " but the action is good, the plot is great, and the scenery is great.    "The Last Of The Mohicans  is a great story.  If you don't mind the fact that the story is set in the middle of the 18th century, this is a good time to watch a historical drama.  I was pleased to see the actors portraying the Mohawks in a very realistic way.  The acting is superb.  It is interesting to watch the Mohawk warriors in battle.  One of the main characters, the Mohican Chief Paddy, plays a very interesting part in the story. The movie is also well written.  A few of the scenes are very well done.  There is also a scene that is very well acted, and a scene which is very good to watch, and yet not very interesting.  For a movie that is set on the Mohave Indian Reservation, there is quite a lot of history that the movie provides.  " The Mohican is a tough old warrior, who is a master of his craft and has a large amount of experience under his belt.  Paddy is a warrior who knows the ways of the Indian ways, and his words can cut a man's head off.  This movie will make you feel like you are there.  My only regret is that I did not have a chance to see this movie earlier.  One of the most interesting historical dramas that I have seen.  Very good movie. My Rating: 4 out of 5 stars

This movie is about a young man named "Rocky" who is trying to become the best boxer in the world.  His father is a very wealthy boxer who teaches him how to box and also trains him for competitions.  Rocky's best friend is a young boxer named "Tiger".  The story follows Rocky and his friends and trainers as they go about their daily lives.  The film was made in 1960 but it is the same story as the last movie in the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is set in a post apocalyptic society, where the only thing that keeps you going is the constant danger of being eaten alive by the mutated giant spiders. You see, it is a society in which the people are so weak that they can't even hold a conversation with each other and the only way they can communicate with each is by using a communication device that they wear on their arms. The device is a combination of a radio, a video camera, and a speaker, and when the device is used it transmits a message in the form of a song which is played over a continuous loop, which allows the two characters to talk to each other. The two main characters are Mr. and Mrs. Johnson who are a husband and wife who live on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. Mr. Johnson, who is the only one who can speak English, has a terrible fear of spiders and they are all that keeps him going. Mrs.Johnson however is the kind of person who just doesn't get scared by anything. They both also have an odd way of speaking which is somewhat reminiscent of a language they may speak in the future. They get along well together and seem to get along with one another and this leads to a great adventure for all the three characters. There is also a female character who is a part of the ranch who has a strange habit of telling bad jokes and who is very funny. It's a little difficult to figure out what the humor is supposed to be, but it is definitely a bit funny. The action in this movie is extremely well done and is always good. The fights are very well choreographed and are pretty well done. There are plenty of explosions and there is plenty of blood. There really isn't much to say about the movie except for that it is entertaining and has good action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was so pleased to see a film from the 1960s that I had forgotten about and that was  "Swan Lake".  There were no gimmicks, no music, no special effects, no big budget, no high-priced locations, no spectacularly produced effects, and just the usual kind of movie I love.  It was about a girl (Jane) who decides to join a swimming team in an attempt to win a swimming contest, and a guy (Bud) who just wants to have fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a bit of a huge fan of John Carpenter when I was younger.   Now, I'm sure I'm not the only one that is a fan of his movies.  There's something about the tone and the atmosphere that just really pulls me in.  I've never really been a big Carpenter fan, but when I saw this movie I really enjoyed it.  The story of this movie really is pretty much what you'd expect a Carpenter movie to be.  It's basically a sci-fi horror movie.  You know, a guy is trapped in a car and finds himself in the middle of a swamp.  If you're looking for a Carpenter film that will scare you, this is not it. But, if you're a fan, this will be the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of this movie, but also a big disappointment.  There was a really nice beginning, and it took a turn for the worst when a large group of white men (all the men in this movie) were all shot in the face by a black guy, who was also shot in that same group.    I mean, it is pretty sad to see how this guy acts.  He gets out of a car and starts shooting people.  And then he runs.  I don't know if this movie is just that terrible, or if the writer/director/actor/producer (it all sounds like a bunch of random guys) didn't really have any idea what he was doing.  After the first 15 minutes or so, you wonder why anyone is watching it.  This movie really needs to be re-titled, and if you watch this movie with a crowd of people, it might be difficult to hear what they are saying, and what the scene is about.  It is also hard to understand how someone could shoot so many people. I mean how do you even aim?  I also wonder if the actors in this film were paid much, because this movie just isn't worth the money.  The ending is very, very sad, because it takes the place of the previous two films, and the ending doesn't feel like it is part of the original trilogy.  But it is not a bad movie, it just didn't make me feel all that much.  The best part of this film is the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this movie I was expecting something with a more serious message and a story with a real moral. I had never seen a movie about a real life war before and so was really looking forward to it. The plot of the movie is that a young girl named Tessa (Jessica Alba) who lives in the town of Newburgh (New York) is a very talented painter, as well as a good dancer and singer. She is the only person in town who can paint pictures and sing a song (the latter of which I found to be quite well done). One day she meets a very handsome (by American standards) but somewhat odd man named Nick (James Franco). Nick is also a musician and musician's musician (he plays the accordion and plays the saxophone) but he's more interested in dancing, music and singing than anything else. Tessa soon begins to be attracted to him and she decides to tell him that she's a dancer as well. They get together and then they decide to spend some time in the country and take up a job teaching English. There they meet up with a young man named Daniel (Matthew McConaughey) who is living in the mountains. Daniel is a musician, as is Tessa's boyfriend, who works as a guide. T.S. Eliot once said, "I do not go for songs; I go for people. For people who talk about their lives with no regard for their audience." That's what I wanted from this movie and what I got. I really liked Tessa and Nick and I liked Daniel as well, but I did find that the story was a bit predictable at times. I would have liked to have seen more of Nick and Daniel, because there were a lot of characters I just didn't like, especially Daniel's sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). I'm not sure if it was because I saw a movie earlier in the year that I didn't really care for the way the movie was written, or if it's just because I've always been a little picky about the way movies are written, but this movie was a little too familiar to me for my taste. I think it would have been more interesting if it had been more about the actual war and the people involved in it. That being said, I think the movie works as an entertaining thriller and a nice little romp through a town I've never been to. I have to say that I really enjoyed the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a few bad movies, but this one, I don't know if I'll ever forget. The film's story is about a guy named David who is being pursued by a group of thugs. The thugs have been using him as a human shield, so David shoots one of them in the chest. The next day, a policeman is investigating a crime and discovers David's body. He then goes to David's apartment, where he discovers the gun David was using to shoot the thug, and he finds out that the gun is the only thing that can bring David back. There are some really nice performances, especially by James Stewart as the detective. This movie has a lot of twists and turns, and the ending is one of the best ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       "It was a wonderful night. I can't say I knew how to act, and I didn't even know what acting was. The play was a marvel, and a great deal of that was owing to Mr. Lubbock's acting. The costumes, the music, the scenery, the set, the lighting, and the stagecraft were all magnificent. I have often seen great plays, and these were as good as any. I will certainly see Mr. Stowe's 'The Old Man and the Sea,' and I am confident he will have a most successful production." - Frank Sinatra, Jr. "Lubbock has been doing the Broadway circuit since he was a boy, and has been performing at the National Theatre, Lincoln Center, and Broadway for over 20 years. He is known for his original stage show The Old Man in the Sea, which is an exciting adventure story, and his production of A Night in the Country in which he is a cast member is a very entertaining, well-acted, and entertaining show." - Jane Addams, founder of the Jane Addam House

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first of the three main character films, this is a good film. A good film with an intriguing plot, good dialogue, good special effects, great special effects. I like the special effects very much, especially the one in the middle of the film, when the little boy (Tom Selleck) is walking along the river and finds the body of a dead boy and is afraid of what may happen to him. The little boy goes to the town to meet the boy's mother and is introduced to a woman who is a witch and has a secret. She shows the little one the secret, and he is fascinated with the witch, but he is frightened by the witch's tricks and does not want to be her servant. So he tries to get away from the witch but the witch catches him and the witch makes him play the role of a boy in a dollhouse, where he sees and hears all sorts of things, including a child who is the witch and tells her everything he has to say. This film was very good, although it does take a while to get to the end, it does make good use of the time, but it does not drag out, it finishes in the end and is a very good film to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie and thought it was great. I think it's about the time when the first space ships were being built and all of the money they were spending on them went on the first film. The first film was called "The Star Trek" and it was a hit. But, "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" was a flop. This movie is set in the 24th century and takes place in the aftermath of the destruction of the USS Enterprise by the Romulans. The Romulan fleet has been defeated by the United Federation of Planets, but the Romas don't stop there. They launch a new attack and the Enterprise is in the Romaz system. Kirk, Spock and McCoy are all in cryo-sleep when they are awoken by the ship's engineer. The engineer is Dr. Leonard McCoy. Kirk's and Spock's minds are both "on" and they are fighting over who will be in charge. The crew are in the midst of a massive battle and the ship is about to be destroyed. Dr. McCoy, who is a very good doctor, decides to help the crew with the problem. Kirk wants to be in command and Spock doesn't want to go. But the ship doesn't make it, and the Romos continue to expand their empire. The Enterprise has been left behind on a lifeless planet. Kirk decides to try to get a message out to the Federation but a Romulanic warship has the right to the planet. When the Romo's try to kill the Enterprise, Spock is able to make a bridge between them and the Federation. Kirk is able make his way to the Enterprise and get the message out. This is a good film and it gets a lot better with the additional scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best comedy film of the year so far. It's not a perfect comedy but it's very good. I love that the film was shot by David Ayer. It reminds me of a very good version of "The Departed" in that it features an ensemble cast of great actors who have great chemistry together.   This film has a very interesting and interesting theme.  One of the funniest things about this film is the idea of how the police are going to use the footage to find the killer. They will look for a person who looks a lot like the killer and who lives in a very similar neighborhood to the one where the murder happened. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I just bought the DVD for this film about a man with a terrible sense of direction who gets pulled into a world of adventure and a beautiful woman who seems to be in love with him. He finds his way out by being helpful to people, even though his own sense of humor is pretty dry. There's a scene where the guy tries to buy some beer and gets the wrong beer, and it gets him really into the adventure. He's also a huge comic book fan, so he really gets into the whole superhero thing. There are several hilarious scenes involving the guys being chased by the woman and her gang. The comedy is strong throughout, and the film is really good, especially in the climatic scene where they are chased by a giant flying dinosaur. I've heard that the director and the actor were actually best friends before this movie was made, so I'm sure it's a really good story. _________________________________________________________ This is a good film. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would, but it's definitely a good action movie, and I found it a good comedy as well. I think this is a great film for kids, but probably not for adults.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first saw this movie I was totally amazed at the amount of blood and gore. The violence is pretty much like you would see in a western. And the violence is done with the utmost respect and restraint. The movie is pretty interesting, although I don't know if I would call it a horror movie. It is more of a mystery. It would be hard to classify this movie as a horror film, but it does have a certain macabre, gothic feel to it. I would not call this a horror-horror movie, because there is nothing in the movie that would cause the fear of a horror/horror film. The story is simple, a young man who comes to a mysterious island and is soon sucked into its dark depths. As the story unfolds, you are also able to see a side of the island that we do not normally see. The island is full of strange creatures that are trying to stop the young man from leaving. The creature that the young boy fights is named "The King", and the creature is a creature from the deepest of the ocean. It has long tentacles that cover most of its body. The tentacles are strong and have a very strange effect on the human body. When you fight The King, he is very fast, very strong, and has a great deal of power. He also has a very eerie voice that can only be described as the sound of an evil god trying to make his will heard. There is a great story, a good performance from the lead, and a great script that makes you wonder why this island was never discovered.  I was so surprised that this movie is about a young boy who leaves an island that he has never seen before. He gets sucked into the ocean and eventually encounters a strange creature. I really loved this movie and I highly recommend it.

It's a gritty film that deals with the death of a woman who is a victim of street prostitution. The only thing I like about this film is the acting, and there are several of them.   There is no music in this film. There are no special effects.  This film is just as gritty and gritty and hard as a real life story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an entertaining movie with an interesting story, a lot of action, good fight scenes and a good ending.  I was so surprised how the story went so well, with good pacing, it was an action packed movie.  I don't know why it was so hard to find it.    The movie is in Korean with English subtitles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I saw this movie as an old man watching a movie for the first time. It had all the right ingredients to make a good story, but it never fully developed the characters or the story. The movie itself is about a man who becomes a vampire and starts a family with a vampire, but the story was never that interesting. The vampire was never all that interesting as a person and I was not all that impressed with his wife. I was very impressed with the story that was told, but I didn't care for the characters at all. ______________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a bit skeptical about this one since I am not a fan of science fiction films and I am a bit of a sci-fi nerd myself so I was expecting a movie like The Day the Earth Stood Still or the original Star Trek. I was surprised to find out that this movie has a lot more depth and heart than the previous two.  It has some very good action sequences and some very interesting characters.  It also has a nice touch of comedy which works well in this sci-fantasy genre.    I really like this movie and it's one of my favorite films from the 1980s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a story line that is both funny and a little scary.   The story is told through the eyes of a young man named Jim.  He is a little too perfect to be true, but then again he seems to be just that.  His parents died young and he was adopted, but it doesn't matter, because he always wants to be a hero.  There are some nice effects throughout the movie, but I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece.  It's a little boring to sit through and I really wish it had been filmed on a bigger budget.  I guess the movie has an ending, but you don't get to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great action flick, which follows a group of mercenaries on an alien world. One of the characters is a very interesting character, who doesn't seem to fit into the group at all. The action is quite good, although not up to the level of "Alien" or "Aliens".
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always liked the idea of a robot-human romance. It seems to be a genre that is dying out. This movie has its moments, but it doesn't do a lot. There is a very good story and it seems to have been filmed in a very dark way, but that's all I have to say about that.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out with a nice introduction, where we meet the two main characters, Riddick and a young woman named Aya. They're both fugitives from the law who are searching for the last of a mysterious substance that was created in a lab in a distant land. They come across a group of "aliens" and the humans who live in a valley near a huge mountain that's called "Cursed Mountain". Riddik is an alien, who's skin is pale and his eyes are yellow and he's got a long, sharp tongue that he can use to rip things apart. He's a little bit creepy, but his voice and personality are entertaining enough that you'll keep watching the movie to see how he'll be able to save the day. Aya is a very beautiful woman, but she's also a little crazy. She has a thing about animals, and is so excited to see the dinosaurs she's going to bring back to life that she forgets to eat her dinner. It doesn't help that the meal has a strange taste to it and that she's starving to death. I can't say it's funny, because the movie is more about Riddock's adventures than Aya's, but it is pretty cool to see that she doesn't mind eating dinosaur poop. If you like adventure and comedy, this movie is a fun movie.   FINDING RIDDLOCK: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny, dark, disturbing, and tragic story. I found it interesting that they used the real-life story of the 'Great Train Robbery' as a basis for the movie.   "Weird" was a perfect word to describe the movie and it's subject matter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Birds of Prey"  is the best of DC's superhero movies, a film that doesn't overdo the violence, doesn't make up for it with overly long and boring scenes, and doesn't try to cover up the shortcomings by throwing in the usual suspects, such as the villains.  The story, though told in an  interactive fashion, does not go in for the jokes, and the story itself, though somewhat convoluted, is actually quite simple.    "Birds"   is a good action movie, with the action being more than satisfying enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of this movie, and have been since the original film was released. I'm always on the lookout for movies with good, original stories and stories that just seem to get better and better as they go along. The plot has the best beginning of any of the movies I've seen. The setting is beautiful and the people seem to be as interesting as the setting. I also like that they do a lot of research into the life of a person who was born in the middle of the 20th century and was raised by a single mother, and the problems he faced and what made him feel he didn't fit in. The only thing I don't like is that it is a very fast paced film. The ending is really rushed. The end of the movie is really bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the film version, they make the movie about a young man who can't get over his mother who's dying of cancer.  The movie's pretty much an extension of the first film with the same characters and the same plot, but it's even more entertaining.        This movie is about a boy who's having trouble with his mother.  In this version, the boy's mother is in a coma and her boyfriend is having an affair.  The boy is really getting to be obnoxious and obnoxious.  His mom's just not responding to him at all and he thinks she's a dead woman.  Eventually the girl, a model, shows up and he realizes he's in love with her.  This was an okay film with a lot of humor and a lot to say about the way our culture treats women.  I think the best scene is when the boy is getting ready to walk in on his mother in bed with the model.  He's so excited he has no idea what he's going to say.  But then he starts to get embarrassed and then the girl walks in.  At that point, he just wants to leave.  It's a pretty good movie, but I think this is a good time to mention the similarities between this movie and the first.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago I saw the first two parts of the first movie about the German war criminals.  It was in an old black and white movie theater and the picture was bad, but at least it was about a great man like Dittrich von Danzig and a very good movie.   The movie is based on a true story, it is set during World War II in Nazi Germany, it shows that the Nazi's were not really bad people, they were just bad at keeping secrets, and that they had a lot of good people in their ranks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts with the main character (played by John Malkovich) getting his first real job, as a security guard at a high-end New York City nightclub. There, he meets his future wife, played by Meryl Streep. Things go well for him until the owner's son (played beautifully by Daniel Day-Lewis) takes over the nightclub. And it's not long before the two get into a nasty fight, and Malkovich is thrown out of the nightclub for being a drunk. A few days later, he gets a call that he must come to the hospital. On his way, he discovers that his wife is pregnant. This is where things get a little tricky, because Malkovich has to make a decision about whether or not to have an abortion. He's not very good at it. His first attempt ends in disaster, as his pregnant wife (played with great sensitivity by Michelle Pfeiffer) goes into labor and has to deliver the baby while she's lying on the floor of the waiting room. Malkovich's wife is, of course, very sympathetic toward him and the doctor, who is a very nice man. His wife, however, is less sympathetic toward Malkovich, who, in fact, is a bit of a jerk. As he leaves the hospital, he notices the new arrival in the waiting area: a young man who is very attractive. He calls the man over to talk to Malkovich about the birth, but the man just looks at Malkovich coldly. A couple days later Malkovich sees the same young man again. He wants to get a look at him, but Malkovich doesn't want to. Instead, he tries to get the young man to show him his work. Unfortunately, Malkovich can't get a good look at his work, because the young person just gets up and leaves. Then he realizes that he can't just let the man go, because he's already been given a job by the new owner, a very rich man. The new owner gives the man a job, and the two of them make a good team. Things don't work out too well for Malkovich and the young woman, but he's still very happy with the arrangement. The movie ends with Malkovich having the most beautiful daughter ever, and he is so happy that he doesn't even care about his new job. As the credits roll, Malkovitch takes his new daughter to his house and lets her sit on his lap.

He says "Mom, that's just too bad" but he quickly gets up and leaves her to sail away. The next day he meets a girl and they have a little conversation. They are very cute, I'm not sure what the guy thinks he's doing when he's watching her and she's not really interested. She then notices he's missing. He then sees the girl and thinks he is in love with her. He runs to the boat and they start swimming to shore. They run into the girl's dad and she starts running away.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I had never seen a good version of The Exorcist and that's because I'm a film buff. Â This movie had a few scares in it, but not so many that it ruined the film for me.  The movie was great and I liked the way the movie was made.       I liked how it didn't take itself too seriously.  It's a good way to have a horror movie and make it fun and exciting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie takes place in a small town in New York.  A young man, George, is out on his motorcycle to look for his missing brother.       He is in a very isolated area with only a few houses, but no people.    His brother, Johnny, is a big, tall man who lives down the street.   They meet a woman, Sally, who introduces herself as the local prostitute.     Sally is the daughter of a big-time gambler, and she's the only one who can tell Johnny where to find his brother. Johnny and George have a brief but passionate encounter with Sally.           George gets a chance to see Johnny at a local hotel.  It's a fun night of drinking and gambling.  The next morning, Sally and Johnny decide to have sex.  Sally is very excited and eager to get rid of Johnny.  But Johnny is in for a rude awakening.  He gets a very strange look on his face when he gets back on the bike.  Then he runs down the road at high speed.  That's it.  George and Sally run away from the hotel and never see each other again.  After that, the movie skips ahead in time to a few years later.  As I said, it's a movie about a man who gets a new job as a bus driver.  We get to see a lot of old New York, including a few old neighborhoods. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad that this movie is coming out.   In all honesty, I was a little disappointed when I first saw it.  It didn't seem to have much in common with the other films that I've seen from the director.  This was a pretty short and sweet movie.  But the characters were great, and I liked that they were all somewhat unique.  Also, this is one of those movies that's a little bit too old to be "for kids", but I found myself thinking of the movie a lot when I was out in the woods, and there were some scenes in the middle that I found to be quite funny.  Overall, this was a fun little movie to watch, and it is one that I look forward to seeing again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most successful horror franchises of all time.   It's been 20 years since the first one was released, and the first two films were well received by audiences, and that was in a time before IMAX.  There are plenty of great horror movies out there, but the first movie was probably the most terrifying one I've seen in my life.  It took place in a house with a strange smell and the sounds of someone talking to themselves.  The house has two floors, one of which is a dark and creepy crawl space.  This leads to a series of events that are truly disturbing.  One day a boy named Mike discovers a book in the living room that mentions a creature that lives in the dark and is always hungry.  But this is where the story becomes a little weird.  In the book, the creature is a woman who is trying to get to a mysterious castle.  Unfortunately, she is too weak to climb up the walls, so she has to crawl.  She's also trying to escape a man who has been following her around.  I can't say the story is original, but it's well told and it's pretty creepy at times.  All the characters are well written and the plot isn't too complicated.  While it's not perfect, it's still a good flick and I recommend it.  If you don't like the first film, then I don't know what you're looking for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is all about the "bond" between the characters, a kind of bond between the two guys who don't get along at all. They're both big and clumsy, but they're both just really good friends. Their "bonds" and their love for each other is a source of inspiration, as they go about their lives, working and playing basketball. It's very funny and sweet. This movie is very romantic, with a romantic lead and a romantic ending. It just makes you want to see them again.

I don't know why I haven't watched this before but I just love it! The cinematography is excellent. There is a romance in this movie that is sweet and romantic, and I think the movie itself is a bit cheesy but it's not so bad! The music is also very romantic and I like it! It makes the movie feel a bit like a movie about a long distance relationship and how they deal with it! This movie is a fun watch and you will definitely like it if you like movies about long distance relationships!
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The film opens with an aerial shot of the New York City skyline, a clear reference to the "Big Apple" that will come later. We are now in the city of New York, on the same street where we saw the movie in the first movie. In this scene we get a clear picture of how beautiful New York is. There are a few interesting shots in this scene of people on the streets, and of course, the Manhattan Bridge. The camera zooms in on the city. We see a beautiful cityscape. There is a sense of calm and peace in the air. We know that the people are happy, that the city is peaceful and quiet. It is also a clear sign that we are entering the city in the middle of a very dark time in our history. The film then takes us into a subway station. The characters get on a train and go to a party. The people are there, and they are in a very good mood. We then get a good shot of a man in the crowd. We get a great view of the city and its people. It has a strong sense of optimism about it. This is what I loved about the film. We saw it as a dream, but it was a beautiful dream. It was a good day.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Pervie from Wonderful movie! I really enjoyed this film. It had a good story line, but the soundtrack was fantastic. I liked that it had some good action, but I also liked that there was a nice balance between comedy and action. The music was also great! This was a great film to watch with my wife and son.  in the beginning the story is interesting. the main character, Sam, is a good person. then the story goes to the point of "what if" as he and his best friend get involved with the gang of kids who are the main characters of the film, and the things that happen to them is very violent. It also becomes a race against time. and the best thing about the ending is that it was very clever. there was no way it could be a happy ending, because the ending was so good! i recommend it to all the childrens and teens who have never seen a film about New York before. , 5 out or 2

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely unprepared for this film, I was expecting a bunch of shots from the sky with no sound, just a bunch and a very little music. But that's what it is. The story is about a man who's father died a few years ago and he feels that he has to get to the bottom of it. What he finds, of course, is more than he could have ever imagined. The film is a little slow at first and you have to sit through a few slow shots to realize what's going on. There are some interesting things going on in this film but the plot is really thin. It doesn't seem to be all that well thought out, or there's a lot of wasted screen time and characters. But the performances are pretty good and you do get to see a lot more of the characters than you would at first think.   A little too slow and the plot was a bit too convoluted for my taste but it's still a good little movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I know, it's a horror movie!" is the first thing that comes to mind. It's not a horror film in the traditional sense. It is a story about a man who tries to find his missing son, who is abducted by a mysterious group of men. It doesn't take long for him to find out that the abductors are evil, and that the reason they are kidnapping people is to create a perfect world. The movie is not overly scary. The film is more of a mystery, and it doesn't even take long to figure out the mystery. But, it is still a good, well-made movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's name is simply "Alfie" and its plot is simple. Alfie, a man of great intellect, is taken on a tour of the world's greatest scientific achievements, from the first atomic bomb to the Apollo moon landings. The most astonishing thing is that Alfie learns about these feats from an English woman who works in the Atomic Energy Office, an agency whose director, Mr. Balfour (played with perfect British understatement by the legendary Anthony Hopkins), knows about the bomb but is unaware that its true inventor is an Englishman. Mr. Beasley is not a typical Englishman and it's easy to see why his life is so different from that of a British civil servant. He has lived all his life in America, never leaving the country for more than a few days, where he has become a well-known author. He also has a daughter, a beautiful but unhappy young girl named Maude, whom he loves with all his heart. In America, he has built a life that he considers the most luxurious he has ever known. He plays golf with his old friends, he drives his beloved Ford, and he drives around in his Rolls-Royce. But he is far from wealthy, and is constantly in debt to his ex-wife, a woman he used to hate, until she left him to marry a man who has ruined her life. But Alfie knows that he is a man with a lot of talent and, like his mentor, Mr Beasley, is trying to get to the very top. In fact, he is going to join the "Big Five" -- the other four men who invented the atomic bomb -- and make it a reality. And to do so, he must win the Nobel Prize in Physics. He gets the Nobel, and Mr. Acheson, who had also long been searching for an English-speaking man to work with, picks Alfie up to go on a brief tour of Europe. But before they go, they meet a very old friend of Alfie's, a Russian scientist who has a very special talent. This man is the man who will ultimately give Alfie the bomb, and who has taken his own life after years of living in isolation. The only person Alfie trusts is the eccentric but brilliant Dr. Stokes (played by the magnificent Charles Laughton), a man from the upper classes who knows all the secrets of the atomic bombs and wants to be the one to detonate

The only problem I had with this movie was how much I was invested in the characters' development and how the movie was so much fun.  I would like to see a movie with a better script and better acting, but the movie is good enough for the price. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A little girl is lost and is on a journey. She gets lost on the way to the city of her dreams and finds her way. A lot of the movie is told in her POV. She loves the big city. She is lost in it. She wants to be part of it and is part of the way people get there. It is a very romantic movie. It's a little girl's life. The main character is lost too and has to learn how to survive on her own. The girl is in love with a handsome boy. She finds out that he has a girlfriend that is just as beautiful as him. The two of them fall in love. The movie is sweet. It was very well done. The director does a good job at making the girls look nice. I'm not sure why the movie was not made in the US. I would like to see more movies like this made here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       The premise of the film is that there is a large number of people living in a town who are all suffering from the same symptoms of dementia. There are people who have the disease but don't know it. Then there are people whose symptoms are so severe that they are unable to go to work, even though they work at the local hospital. The movie is basically a movie about a couple of guys who are living in this town who try to help each other and get out of their own way.   In this movie, the lead character is played by Gary Busey.  He is a guy who is living a lonely life. He is very unhappy because he has lost his wife and daughter, who he still cares about.  Gary BUSEY is an excellent actor and actor is a hard thing to get right. It's hard to get the perfect Gary B USEY. His Gary B USES TO LOOK AWFUL and that's all you need to see about him. It doesn't matter how good he is at acting he can't fool me into thinking he is really Gary BUSY.  In the film he is the only person who seems to be enjoying himself. He has the best lines in the movie. The rest of the characters are not so good and the script is too stupid.  But you don't have to like Gary BUSHY to like the movie.

The story has a great sense of adventure and action. This movie has great characters and great action. The action is the star of the movie and it is all the better for it. I would like to see this movie in the big screen again and this time with a good sound system. _________

It was like watching a Disney movie and it had so much heart to it!  It's a story about a girl who is searching for her family, and she discovers something amazing in her backyard, and it has to do with a mysterious old man!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of this movie is very good. It has a great action sequence, and the movie takes a couple of very funny turns, and a great deal of time. The second half of the movie however, was a bit more confusing. The main character was supposed to be a good guy, but he is in a terrible situation, and he just cannot seem to get out of it. I guess I liked the character, but the movie could have done without the confusing and confusing story. I can see why this movie was successful, but not very good, and it was a little confusing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Samurai" is a very enjoyable movie that is set in a time when the United States and Japan were at war. There is a beautiful scene in which a soldier named Samura (played by a young George Takei) has to take a bullet to the chest in order to save the lives of his comrades. There was a scene earlier in the film where a young Samura is in a train station waiting for his sister, when a young woman named Takao (played very well by the late Miki Suzuki) approaches him and tells him that he is going to see the famous samurai, Koshiro (played with incredible strength by the great Tô Masaharu). Samura gets on the train, and on the way he meets a man named Uesugi (played brilliantly by Masahiro Sano). The story follows Samura, his brother Sakaki (who is always the butt of the brothers jokes), and their friend, a young warrior named Takeji (played superbly by Toshiro Mifune). The movie is really enjoyable. It is set during a time in which Japan was suffering under the rule of a corrupt government. It has many great moments, like when the U.S. Army is shown on the television and one of the soldiers says, "You are watching the greatest military in the world!" and then tells the Japanese troops, "Take your hats off and you are now our comrades." Or when Samura tells Takeji, "There is a difference between being in the army and being in love." It also has great scenes in which Samura's father (played as a tough and wise leader by Takashi Shimura) tries to teach his son about the way of the sword. The story is also set in Japan during the time of the Edo period, when the Samurai were a common sight. They fought for honor and money, and when one of them lost a battle he was forced to sell his sword for food. When the Samurai did not have enough money to pay his debt, he killed the samurai who sold his sword. After a while, Samura kills his father in revenge. After the Samurai has killed his father, he goes to Japan to try to kill the Uesugis. When he gets there, the Uesi are just about to capture him, but he is saved by a group of warriors. When Samura goes back to the United states, he finds out that the army has already put a bounty
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good sequel to a great film. The characters are much more developed than in the first film, which is the main reason why the film is a little more enjoyable. The story is really simple, but is really fun. I really enjoyed this film, it is the sequel to the first one, and it really shows what a good horror movie can do. I would recommend this film to fans of the original film and people who like good, spooky films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first feature film directed by Robert Altman. It is based on the novel "Sleepless in Seattle" by Walter Tevis. The movie is a little short but still very well-made. The story is very different from what you would expect from a movie about a guy living in a small town and looking for a job. The cast is very good: James Cagney, Joan Fontaine, Jack Lemmon, Liza Minnelli and Walter Matthau. I enjoyed this film very much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're gonna be pissed, that's for sure.  There's no doubt in my mind that this is a good, old-school movie about a bad guy and a good guy and the two of them teaming up to take down a corrupt cop, but the movie itself has some real problems, especially in the last act.    It's just a matter of trying to make sense of a plot that's hard to follow.    This movie should have been an interesting character study about a man's journey from good guy to bad guy.  And then the movie has some really weird scenes that don't make any sense at all.  But then again, if you're a fan of the 1980s action movie, you might enjoy this film.

They travel to the big city, where they attempt to find a job in a place where the family can be happy. The movie is a nice blend of comedy and tragedy. There are a couple of odd moments that could be used to develop the characters better, but the movie still ends up being a nice and heartwarming one.   One of the best movies I've seen in a while.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a little overrated by the critics. The story is not bad, but it lacks a lot of drama.

I am also not a big fan of the special effects. The special effects are okay but not great. I like the way they made the movie look, but I am not a huge fan of it.  The movie was not really that bad, especially for its time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I went to see the movie about a young woman who was a young wife. I saw this movie when I was a kid and it was always a favorite. I'm not sure if it is a good one or not but I still think it's a good time. The movie starts out with a little girl and her mom and then she gets taken into the city and she is a little bit of a princess. She is the oldest in her class and they are all in trouble. She gets taken to a park to play and it is like they all are having fun. Then one day a man runs in and kills a girl. She finds out that he is her father and she freaks out and runs out and finds her mother and brother and she has to take them back to their house. The father is very angry and tells his son to get away from him. So they start to run and the little girl gets scared and runs into a lake. The family is very upset about the death of the girl and the father tries to take away the girl but the mother says no. So the father decides to have her killed. They all agree to kill the girl. But one of the daughters, the little baby girl, wants to go out and play and the mother and father agree to let her go and she decides to run out of the house and run into the lake and she falls in. The girl was a very pretty baby and the other two girls were just like her. When she got to the bottom she looks down and sees a fish and she says that is the only thing she remembers. So one day she sees a man and he is the man who killed her. The little girl says, "Why didn't you kill me then?" The man says, he did not want to kill a little baby but he did. He just had to kill her to stop the trouble in the city. The man and the girl start to have an affair and the man wants to take the girl to the city so that he can kill her. He tells the mother that he will have her murdered so that she will be unable to tell anyone. The mother says, well, let's do it. So she goes to get the girl, the man and his mistress. They are in a car and the woman tells them that they are going to have to go on a long journey. So now the mother, father and daughter are all on a car journey. They start to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a scene in The Big Lebowski where Lebwowski gets a haircut and a new coat. This is in a barber shop.  The first thing I noticed about this movie is that it's set in the 1970s.   This is what the barber has to say: "This place is very strange. The barbers here look like they've just come from the seventies. They're all smoking and drinking and talking to each other, and that's the kind of place it is. They call this place 'The Village.'"    After the barbers get a little frisky, Lebowitz comes in.  The barber asks him what he wants. Lebowksi responds: "I want a barf" (which he is) "A barf? A barf!" (which Lebowicz is)     "What's a bar-f?" "A very old, well-used barf, a barfo, which means a barfly. It means a drinker of very cheap beer and cheap wine. It's a common thing in the city. It used to be that a person who lived in the slums would go down to the waterfront and sit there and drink all night. That was a good way to make a living, and then it was turned into a bar. Now you can find them all over the place."   Lebowski asks about the barf and Barfo.  "A Barfo? I'm not even sure what a Barfo is. The one in the movie is not a barfoo. He's a Barf. A Barfo can only drink two beers at a time, but he's got the whole town drunk. He has a huge belly, like a big-mouthed fish, and he's just like a real big barfo. If you get a Barfoo drunk, you can do pretty much anything.  And it's true, he's pretty easy to handle. He can be beaten up.  He's not a big barfly like the one in that movie. He isn't as bad as he is in the movies, but then, he isn't the real barfo."  This is what we've all been waiting for.  This scene is really funny.  We've all watched The Big Bang Theory and wondered, "Why is this guy not wearing a tie?"  This
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first two minutes of this movie were really great, and there were so many cool things happening in this film, but then it became boring.   It was a boring story about two guys who were in a boat and were saving a group of girls from drowning.  In the beginning there was an awesome music and I loved how there was a lot of humor in this movie.  But in the end I think the movie became more boring and had less action than the other movies I've seen this year.  I don't think I will watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie so many times I don't even remember what the title was.  This was one of the first movies that I saw when I got into the horror genre.    The movie starts with a very scary scene, but it doesn't last long.  The scene in question takes place in a house that is surrounded by an electric fence.    This scene is scary because the fence is electric.  It makes it very difficult to get through the fence.          I've seen a couple of movies where this is the first part of a movie.  In this case, it's the second.  This is the movie where the title is taken.  If I didn't know it was the movie that would be, I would have thought it was a horror movie. The next scene is very scary.  I don�t remember the name of the movie, but I know it's in black and white.  At this point, it is possible to turn off the lights.  Again, this is a scary scene.  As we see a family being attacked by a vampire.  You don't see it very often.  After the scene, we see an old woman being attacked.  Now this is where the movie gets interesting.  There is a door behind the old woman.  We see a shadow walk out of the door.  When it does, we hear the sound of a chainsaw.  They say it�s a "ghost".   This movie does a lot of scary stuff, but the main character is not very well developed.  Even though the movie was made in the 1950s, it doesn�t have a lot going on.  That's not a bad thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* I know, I know. I'm sure you can't even see the movie, but if you can, this is one of the most underrated horror movies. It's got a great story about a man who finds his wife (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) dead in his apartment. His apartment was the scene of a murder the previous night and he was home alone when it happened. After a short time, he hears footsteps downstairs and goes down to investigate. What he sees is a woman (played in a great little cameo by Marilyn Monroe) and a young man (played, of course, by Peter Graves). He gets the guy to come downstairs and the woman turns out to be a vampire who had just murdered the man's wife. She then turns him into a vampire himself. I'll go out on a limb here and say that this movie is one the greatest of all time. There are plenty of great moments. The soundtrack is fantastic and you just know that there's something strange going on upstairs, no matter how hard you try to look away. If you like vampire movies and the macabre, you owe it to yourself to see this.

It reminded me a little of the first Star Wars movie with the Death Star battle, but it has some great new twists on old characters, like Han and Leia (and Luke and Obi-Wan in the final battle), as well as new characters like Princess Leia.  I enjoyed this movie, and it is definitely worth seeing, especially if you like the original trilogy.

They are good action movies with a cool and edgy visual style and plenty of memorable moments.  My favorite scene is when Skynet finally sends out its final Terminator to the past, and John Connor's dad (George C. Scott) shows up to see what all the fuss is about.  The final scene.    It's a good little movie that you can find on Amazon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is about a small town in Indiana that is having a rough time. A small town is a good place to put a horror movie. A good movie is something that has the potential to scare the pants off of you. It is something different, it is not a traditional horror movie but a more intelligent, thought provoking horror. It takes place in a small Indiana town and the plot is simple. A woman in the town is murdered. Her husband has gone missing and now the townspeople have to figure out who did this. There is a bit of a twist to the story. It makes you wonder what could have been. The movie has a nice little soundtrack and the special effects are very good. It doesn't have the most original story line but it is very thought provoking. The acting is very good as well. The only thing I would change about the movie is that the acting is a little too on the nose. I understand that this is a small movie but it can't be that bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Short" is a good comedy about how greed and shortsightedness (along with a bunch of people from the "smart money" of Wall Street) are responsible for a spectacularly bad investment in a movie studio, which goes bankrupt and causes the stock market to plunge. The film is funny, but a little heavy-handed about what happens.  The "short-sightedness" in this case is the stupidity of the investment bankers (a la the "broke-assed" characters in "The Big Lebowski") and their inability to see that the film they are investing in is a bad investment, and will go down as one. The "greed" in the investment in the movie studio is the greed of Wall St. for Hollywood, which the bankers want for their own "smart-money". In other words, this movie is about how greedy people can get away with getting stupid ideas and then not caring about the consequences, which is why I laugh every time the "big loser" (a.k.a. the "banker" in real life) says, "I don't care about this movie, I'm just making a killing!" I have to say that the movie is funny as a whole, but it could have been more funny if it wasn't so heavy-footed about the subject.  If you are looking for a good laugh, and the film is a lot of fun to watch, then go see it.  But if you are a little bit more intelligent than most of the people in Wall Street, and a little more aware of how dumb ideas can lead to terrible results, you should avoid it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie interesting in its own right, it is an animated cartoon that takes place in a town called "Eden". The town was once inhabited by a large tribe of people who were very well known for their good looks and their strength. However, in recent years the tribe has dwindled in numbers, and the few people left are forced to live on the land that is now under construction for the "Empress". The cartoon is set in the future, where there are few things left for the people, but some of them are very determined to make a living. A large number of these people are "Benders", people who are able to manipulate metal and other materials with their minds. They live on farms in small houses made of a wood known as "Enderite", and they farm the land in order to get a supply of this wood.   The film is not a simple, cute cartoon, it features a large number characters that are all very different from each other, and each of them have a different kind of personality. There are the "Bendys" who are just as strong as their mother, but are far more independent. There is also the "Pikas", who have a special ability that allows them to "blend in" with other objects. There's the "Jellies", who live in small homes that look like giant treehouses, and they live a very simple life. There has also been a very mysterious "Jill", who is a very smart and independent woman.  The characters are very well designed, and I really enjoyed watching them grow and change as the story progresses.  This is a story that will keep you engaged for a long time, and it has a lot of heart.  I highly recommend this movie, it will appeal to all age groups, and everyone will find something they like in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot of "The Exorcist" is fairly straightforward: a group of high school students go to a local high school in the late 1950s for a Halloween party. The parents are not thrilled with the idea, but there's no time for that. It's time to get rid of the demons that have possessed their daughter.  This is the most frightening movie I've ever seen. I have seen a number of scary movies, and this is the best. It starts off slow and then gets really scary in the first act. It really is the kind of movie that you can sit down with and watch for hours. This movie is well-done, well-acted, and well-edited. This is a great movie, and you have to see it if you can get it.  the Exorcists (1981) is rated R.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is about a kid who finds a video game with his grandfather. It is a very simple game that is just about killing monsters and collecting items. But what I really liked about this movie was the way that the movie was filmed. It was quite a bit more dark and disturbing than the game that the kid found. The kid also has a real hard time dealing with the fact that he just can't die. This movie is really just about a child learning about the world and his place in it. It's not a great movie, but it is not bad either.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly:  Well, the first part of the film was very bad.  It was about a group of cowboys trying to get a ride on a big, scary horse that is trying to escape the evil forces of the forest that live in the surrounding area.   The bad part of this film is that it is a straight out bad film.  It has all the elements that one expects from a bad movie, from the bad acting, the bad writing, and the bad production values.  The good part of it is that the bad parts were only the bad bits.  They weren't really bad at all.  I liked the characters that were in this film. I liked how they were written and how they acted.  These are the things that made this film worth watching.  However, the second part of that film was not all bad. The second part was good.  This is a movie that one can laugh at, but one can also learn something from.  There were things that were done well in this movie.  Some of the characters, especially the horses, are funny, and I like how they are written.  If one is going to watch this movie, one should be prepared to laugh a lot.  Unfortunately, there was no laugh track in this, and it was hard to get through the second half of this movie without it.  One of the most important things about the film is to know that this is a cowboy movie, but that it has the elements of a bad Western film.   The movie has a bad ending, but it was not a bad end, but a bad beginning.  My rating for this film would be a 4 out of 10, but only because of the good parts.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ ________ _________ ____________ _______________  I've heard the phrase "if you've seen the movie, you've already seen the ending" and it really is a great way to sum up the story. The film is the first part of a two part story which is split in two parts: a small town in Maine and a big city in the suburbs of the city. The story centers around a family of people who run a grocery store and who also happen to be serial killers. They've been doing this for years and years and they have been arrested a few times, but they always manage to escape. This time, however, things aren't looking so good as their daughter, Maggie, is pregnant with the son of the store owner and he's about to be killed by the police. Maggie is taken in by a young girl who is the girlfriend of the older man who was once the owner of the grocery store. They soon become a couple and Maggie goes into labor. However, the baby doesn't make it to the hospital and so the police catch the two killers, one of whom is an older woman who works in a bar, and who is also pregnant with Maggie's baby. However there are several more people in the store who have been killed and so this killer is very much still at large. The whole story is told from the point of view of the mother, who is very disturbed by what she sees and hears, and the younger sister, who seems to be doing a lot better. The baby is born and Maggie is left in the care of the girl's mother and the older woman and her boyfriend. This girl's boyfriend is the son who is being killed by Maggie's killer. The younger sister is about to run away with the older couple but she decides not to. When she returns to her family, however the mother finds that her daughter has been kidnapped by the killer. Maggie's murderer is very well known and very cold and calculating. She is able to get her family into hiding as the killer begins to look for the baby and the mother. It's a very gripping story and I loved it. The acting was very good all around and the story is quite a nice one. It was also very well acted. There are also several very disturbing scenes which really add to the story and make it even more horrifying. This film is also a good introduction to a good horror film and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good action movie with an interesting storyline. The action is very good and it is quite a bit of fun. I like how the action is not all about the guns.  The actors really do a good job with the different costumes.    I would like to know if the girl is going to get pregnant?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have been thinking about this movie ever since I was a little kid. It's one of the greats, a great American film.  The story is very simple. A young man and his girlfriend move to the big city and they meet a rich, handsome young man. He takes them on a ride around town and then takes them out to the city's waterfront. They enjoy the view and the rest is history.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful movie about a couple of young guys who are having a lot of trouble in their relationship. After a drunken night, the two of them decide to go to a nearby bar. Unfortunately, they are soon approached by a beautiful woman, who, as she says, is willing to give them some of her time and then leave. As they look for a place to go, they find themselves in a dark alley where the woman explains that she is not a "chick" but a "girl". They are invited to her place. The two of the boys decide that they will not go and spend the night there, but they stay for the night in the woman's house. The next day, they meet her again at the bar, and they agree to go back to her apartment. Once there, the woman gives them a chance to see her real, live body. The woman is a complete stranger to them, but then the two men are shown a series of events that take place in the apartment and which, in the end, lead them to the truth about her.   (1/5)   I was a bit disappointed in this movie. It was a good story, but not as good as it could have been. I'm a big fan of the genre and I like the genre films, but this one was not up to my standards. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a lot of people who think the original Star Trek  is a great film. But it's not. I'm not even sure the Star Trek that was on TV, with Leonard Nimoy and the cast, was a good film. I've seen that, and I still haven't seen the movie. It was a bad movie. I can't believe people still say it's good. If the people who said it was good still watched it they would know it was a terrible film. It is bad in so many ways. But at least it was Star Trek. And that was one of my favorite shows!  So that's a plus for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I've ever seen about the Korean War. It is full of action, heroism, and suspense. I was never interested in the Korean war at all. I think I watched a few episodes of M*A*S*H before this movie and that was it.   I really enjoyed this movie!   It was a great movie to watch with my son who loves war movies! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a very small group of people who decide to try to save the world from a massive tidal wave of water. It is pretty ridiculous and not very good, but I still liked it a lot.  You have a group of characters who are all completely different from each other but who have a common interest.   The plot is very simplistic and not that well done.  This is a movie about a guy who wants to save his girlfriend who was the only girl he ever loved.  The guy goes into a place where there is a very high tide that has a huge wave coming.  They all fight and try to survive but the tide keeps getting higher.  I was just wondering how the high tide came about and who was in the group that wanted to save it.  It is not very well written, the people that were in the movie all had a great look but not that much of a personality.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I think it could have been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the world of science fiction movies, it is not always easy to tell whether a film is a good one. But in "Alien", the story of the alien with the beautiful face and the ability to travel through space to other planets is a very intriguing one. It shows us the real horror of space travel, with all the problems involved in it. It also shows us a world where human beings are not the dominant species. The Alien has been brought here as a human being. He is not an extraterrestrial, but a man of the earth. And he is still a child in the real world, although he can travel between the stars. I think that this is an excellent movie and one that every fan of sci-fi movies should watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie with great acting, great music and a nice plot. It is about a young boy who decides to become a boxer and fights for a good cause. The story is a good one, and the action is great. There are a few things that I don't like: 1. The ending - it feels a bit rushed. It's kind of like when you see a film that you liked and then you see the director change a little bit and there's a bit of a jump (it's not like this film jumps, it jumps a lot, but there's also a bit missing). 2. The kid - it's a boy, and he's just a little boy. He has a little brother who is a lot older than him. 3. The way he speaks. There's a lot of times he says things that you don't really understand. It could have been better. Overall - it is a nice movie, but it doesn't really go anywhere special.

I know it was my first ever horror movie and I didn't really enjoy it. But I have seen so many more awesome horror movies and I just can't think of another one that is as good as this one. It's not a perfect movie. There is some things about the story that just don's make no sense. And some parts are so slow. But the acting is great. And the music is so good. And I loved the characters. It had a very scary atmosphere. And for a kid's movie it had a lot of gore. It was a very good movie. And if you like scary movies and horror, you will like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very difficult to find a decent movie in which all of the main characters are well-rounded.   This is not a typical story about an ordinary man.  The movie is very good because of the excellent acting and directing, the great chemistry between the lead actors, and the nice music.  There is also a very good and unique story.  Some people will find the ending a little too easy and predictable.  However, it is an extremely enjoyable movie and is worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful movie about love, loss, heartbreak, and redemption.  The story is simple and straightforward.    The story is told from the point of view of a man, whose wife is pregnant, and who is trying to decide whether or not to kill the baby.  The movie is very beautiful, with a great score and gorgeous cinematography.  There are no characters who are overly exaggerated.  A very strong performance by Will Smith, who plays the part of the man who loves and loses his wife.  It is one of the best movies to ever be made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape is one of the best WWII movies ever made.  It was made by a great director, John Ford.    He made a wonderful war movie and it is a must see.  The Great German Lie is about a young German boy who has been adopted by a family of wealthy English aristocrats.  He is the only child of a German mother who had to leave her homeland because she was pregnant.  It is the beginning of the end for the Germans and the Americans.  The Germans are very bad and they want to conquer the world.  They want to enslave the English and the French.  However, they are fighting against the Americans who have taken over a British colony in the middle of Africa.  This is not the end of the Germans as they have a great leader named Friedrich who has captured a British airfield and is in a fierce battle with the Americans and British.  Unfortunately, the Germans have only one plane left, so they have to rely on their luck to win the battle.  And the Germans do win the war as they do win over the British colony.  If you love war movies, you need to see this one.  I recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful, poignant story of loss and redemption. The film was shot and edited beautifully, and it's hard to watch a movie with such emotion in it without being moved. I don't know if it's the acting, the direction, or the music, but I never got the feeling that the film was trying to be sad.   I don´t think that the story was that deep. I think that it was about a man who was struggling to keep his wife, and her husband, alive, while trying to find a way out of a broken marriage. It wasn´t so much a story about love and loss, but rather a story of a man with a troubled past, who tries to make his life better by finding a way to be happy in the present, and a wife who is struggling to be the wife he always knew she would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Halo" movie is based on the real life of a very famous American hero. He was the first man in space and the first to break the sound barrier. He died in an accident in a plane. However, it was not his first time in the plane crash.   After his death, he went to space in a spaceship. But he is very much like an old man.  There is a woman named Catherine who is an astronaut. She is in love with him. She gets him in a ship and leaves him there. The rest is up to the imagination.  I liked this movie. It was not as good as the first movie (which was more serious) but it was a good start to the series.

How does this guy even get to the stage of the show?" That's where the movie gets you: it's a movie about a man's life. It's not the life of Rocky Horror, but of a man who just doesn't know when to stop. It really is a great movie to see and watch, as well as to hear.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts out with an excellent opening shot. It shows the entire city, its many towers, the famous St. Paul's Cathedral and the view from the top of the famous Albert Square.  In the second and third shots, we see the beautiful views of the city from the vantage points of the towers.    The shots are so good that the movie could have been a documentary.    The movie then moves on to the other tower, the top one.  This is a very beautiful tower, but unfortunately it is also one of the most photographed buildings in the world.  The view is great, but there is also so much noise from all the windows, from the balconies and from the roof.  It is quite depressing.  At the very end of the movie we see another great view of the Cathedral, but it is so beautiful, we don't want to see anything else.  The movie is well acted, it shows the different cultures and people in London.  But sadly, this is only half the movie.  There are other scenes that show London as a city.  We see scenes of street scenes, but also scenes of people, people in a shop, people working, people walking.  So we see many people, but the movie has also to show some of the architecture and the people.  And the people in this movie are all so ugly, they are so boring.  For the most part, they speak in a monotone, they have no personality, and it is all so dull.  I am sure that this is why it was so popular when it was first made.  Now we see a new and improved version.  However, the movie is still dull.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a guy (George) who is walking down the street when he sees a lady walk past him and then he stops and looks at her and starts to laugh. She then stops and is confused about why he is laughing and she says that she is "walking home from work" and he says "yes, I suppose you are" and she laughs at him and walks on past him.  After a while they both go home but the lady goes home and he decides to follow her and then she says she needs a shower and he follows her and sees that she has a dog that is walking behind her.   He follows her home and she then says "I'm tired, I'm going to take a bath and I want you to meet my dog" and then goes into the bathroom and starts taking a bath.  She comes out of the bathroom with a towel on her head and the dog at her side and he starts to lick her neck and then starts licking her head.  He then gets on the floor and starts walking towards her and she gets out of bed and puts a robe on.  Then she picks up the dog and kisses him and says "you're so good" and kisses her on the forehead.  And then she looks up and sees a small red light and starts screaming and running around.  This was really fun and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh at some ridiculousness.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure why I've never seen a film with a protagonist as interesting as the protagonist of this one. He's a rich kid from a very wealthy family who decides he wants to be a cop because his family can't afford to pay the bills and he likes the idea of having to deal with criminals. But when he sees a group of kids walking down the street with nothing but a baseball bat, he decides to intervene and ends up becoming a hero of sorts. It's a pretty interesting take on the law enforcement genre that I think would work well with the sort of characters that would work really well in a cop show like this.  A lot of people in the film seem to be like the people from the TV show, which isn't a bad thing but doesn't do anything new with it. The music is really well done, which is very much in keeping with the tone of the film.  The film takes a rather serious tone in the beginning, but it does get pretty funny later on.    If I ever saw a movie where a cop played by Christopher Walken was a bad guy, I would definitely see it.  I like the idea that he's trying to find the kids who committed the crime and figure out why they're so bad at what they do. It would be nice to have a cop that was bad, but at least he's an interesting villain. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie I am reviewing is entitled "Hercules", and was written by Robert Louis Stevenson and released in 1930. It is a film of historical importance and it is the story of Hercules, a young man of great strength and courage who becomes a gladiator in the Greek Arena. He wins the games but is killed, and it was believed that he was killed by a wild boar. The boar that killed him was never found and no one ever knew what happened to him. This is a great movie and I loved it. It has a great plot and I enjoyed it very much. It was a good film and I recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way" is a good old fashioned story of a group of miners in a small mountain town.  They are a group who like to dig up old mines and they go to dig for coal.    It is in these old mines that the coal comes to be and the miners get rich and the townspeople get rich as well.  After a few months of digging they finally get a good haul.  When they get home they start the coal mine on their own.  But their luck doesn't last long.  The coal they dug up was too big to be put into the mine and they have to go to a town that is much larger than they are.  This town is much bigger than they too but they are going to find a bigger and better haul.   The way is pretty simple.  All the miners and the rest of the town come out to the mines to try to find the coal.     The townspeers are not very happy to see the miners go so the miners start to look for a new town to call home.  Then a mysterious stranger comes to town and says that he has come to find coal.      The town is all happy to welcome this stranger.  They have never seen a stranger in their lives.  Once the stranger is gone the town is still happy to have a stranger.  The strangers arrival is not what everyone is expecting.  He is dressed like a miner, but he is not a miner.  His eyes are a different color and his body is covered in coal dust.  What this stranger is not is the coal that the miners are looking for.  If they can't find it then the town will be very happy.  But then the strange stranger comes back to town.   He wants to help the miners find the "golden coal" but it seems to be gone from town.  And then the stranger does something the miners don't like.  It seems that the stranger took the miners gold and is giving it to the town. So the town decides to kill the stranger. The town decides that the best way to get rid of the stranger would be to kill him.  They decide that the safest way to do this would be the strangler himself.  But as the town starts to set about to kill their strange visitor, they realize that the stranglers friend is not who they thought it was.  When the town finally does find out
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to find a bad movie about the Civil War that isn't a bad Civil War movie.   The best thing about it is that it doesn't try to be too complex or deep.  This is a great movie with some great performances, but it's a very straightforward Civil War story.  The movie is all about the battle at Antietam, but the battle of AntietAM is a battle in which both sides were almost completely disorganized.  In addition, the story of Antitrust in the South is also very interesting.  It is a movie that has a lot of heart and soul and a great sense of humor.  If you like Civil War movies, then you'll like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was a great American western in which one of the most famous guns in Hollywood history played a small but significant part.  In an age where the old westerns are being resurrected with the likes of "Sucker Punch", the only way to tell this movie apart is to look at the actual plot, which is a very basic and predictable one.    The plot revolves around a cowboy named Red "Red" Reid, who is hired to bring in a gun to a big cattle ranch owned by a man named George Reid.  This man is an outlaw who is a master at shooting with a double-barreled shotgun, a.44 magnum.  His gun is a.32 Winchester Model 1910.  Red Reid is a good shot with his gun, but he can't use it effectively, so he hires the young and beautiful Red Daniels to go out and get a good look at his guns.  They go to a saloon and find a gun, which the young man takes to the ranch and hides.  Reid wants to take the gun, so Daniels takes the gun and heads for the ranch, where they meet a band of outlaws who are hunting the guns.     It turns out that the guns are in a big warehouse, and the gunsmen are not very well-organized.  The guns are poorly secured, and they have to take care of each other to get them out of the warehouse.  Daniels' sister is one of them, and she tries to shoot one of their men, who gets hit by the bullet.  A gunfight breaks out, and Daniels ends up shooting the man in the head.  When they return to the saloon, the gunsman is dead, but the rest of the men have taken Red Daniels hostage, and he is forced to give them the guns in exchange for his freedom.     There is no need to review the rest, because this is pretty much the whole movie.  It is an interesting movie in that it has an old western feel, and a very good script.  But there are some problems.  First of all, the script is quite bad, and there are numerous places in which the script needs to be rewritten.  Second, there is no sense of drama, as the film is about the guns, and not about the characters.  Third, it is obvious that the film was made to make money.  There

I enjoyed watching this film so much, because it's really not a complicated movie. In a sense, the film is the story of a man, a very old man, who finds a strange, mysterious, mysterious stone. He calls his friend to see what it is. But when they arrive, they find that the stone has become an object of fascination, which no one is interested in touching. The man and his friend try to understand the stone, but to no avail. They decide to sell it, but the old man is not sure if he can handle the money. So, they return to their friend and his wife, to ask for help. When they arrive to the old couple, they discover that the wife is very sick, and that the husband is very old. This is the main problem with the movie, and it makes it so much more interesting to watch. The old man can only get the old wife to touch the stone (as the wife has no choice). He can only do this with his wife's help. As for the wife, the husband wants her to touch it with his hand. It is a bit much, but this is the way it is done in the movie. There are no crazy things going on, or weird situations, like in many other films about strange stones. There is a definite storyline, and you can feel it all the way through the movie (it is very short). The plot is a simple one. It tells us about a man's discovery of a strange stone, which he keeps in a cabinet. And this stone is very dangerous. It changes the man's life forever. It's a very interesting story, and I liked it. It would be a very good movie to watch with children. I am sure that there are many children out there who can appreciate it. If you like this kind of story, you will like this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film about 3 months ago and I was very excited about it. It seemed very realistic and I didn't feel the need to re-watch the entire thing.   The movie is about a young girl who has a very peculiar obsession with a small bird, which she calls a duck. It's very hard to believe this movie is being made by a 13 year old girl, but I couldn't believe it either.   the movie takes place over a year later and it is a little weird how she keeps on coming back to the duck.  : The movie is very cute, and a lot of the scenes were funny.     : It is sad to see how far the girl is going to go in her obsession with the duck, and how she is losing herself in it.   I think the story is very realistic, and I liked how she was trying to find a way to make the duck fly away from her.   in the end the girl seems to realize that she is going too far with her obsession, and is forced to stop.  - 5 stars for realism, but with a few problems.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that is a little bit scary, a little   good, and a lot   sad.   When you look at the movie you realize it is not a typical horror film but a true human drama.    It shows the human emotions, how they react to the tragedy of the loss of a loved one, and the struggles that we go through.  The movie also has a great ending which is a beautiful scene to see, even if you do not believe in miracles.  There are a few   bad parts in the movie, but they do not spoil the movie for you, so go see this movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It's about an American teenager who travels around the world, in order to meet the man of her dreams. It wasn't all that interesting until the final act, where the teen meets a girl named Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and the two fall in love.   What is also interesting is the idea of the relationship between the two, and the way the two deal with each other. They both have very different personalities, but they seem to be able to relate to one another. The romance is well-done, and I'm glad the director chose to keep the romance to a minimum.  The main characters of the film are Jennifer and Emma, who are both 15 years old. They travel around the globe and find themselves in different countries and different situations. They are both very shy and nervous, but have a very powerful bond. They try to deal with the many people who keep them apart. It takes the main characters to the point where they can start to understand each other, and become friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The good:  The film's opening scene, in which a man (John Hurt) in a dark apartment with the light shining in through a window on the floor above, is attacked by a vampire-like creature, which also attacks and kills his roommate. Â This, of course, sets up the film's most important sub-plot:  The vampire is played by  David Bowie  who, in his early years, was the lead singer of the glam rock band The Spiders from Mars, who also had a huge hit with "The Hook."  In later years, Bowie made a big comeback in the music business, working as a screenwriter, composer and producer.  His films often have a Gothic feel to them and his characters are always at the center of a larger narrative.  I think I liked this movie better than the movie itself.   Here's the opening scene from  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  (1978).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is told in flashback as our heroes are on a road trip to visit a new town. The characters are all the usual archetypes: a smart kid, a good-hearted teenager, an older lady who hates her job, and a bad-ass, black-hatted policeman who wants to be a hero, but finds that he can't help but be a dick when the situation calls for it.   And it gets better, in a way that doesn't usually happen in a film about cops.  And this isn't even the best part of the movie, which is the climax.  So, there's a car accident, and the police show up. But, no one is killed, and there's no real evidence that the police are to blame.  They just look at the car, which has a smashed windshield, a flat tire, and one dead guy on the side of the road.  The cops say that this was just a car wreck, but this doesn't make sense.  Why would a car have a flat, and why would a guy be on the ground?  But, the cop with a gun on him, the one who is supposed to be the bad guy, looks like he could be the guy who killed the guy on top of the car.  There is no explanation for why the car was on the road in the first place.  When the car is finally cleared of wreckage, the dead guy is still there.  Then, the cops are sent to look for the body. But they can't find the body, and can't even find the car that is supposedly destroyed.  Eventually, they decide that it was just an accident, but that doesn 't make any sense.   The cop is the only one who can find the dead man, so he tells the police he is the cop who did the accident.   So, the film is supposed the be a story about a guy who is a good guy, but who makes mistakes when he tries to help the people around him.  But then the movie gets good.  I've seen some movies where the hero is always a good person, but they don't really make it a good story.  This movie was different.  It made the hero a bad guy.  He had to make a decision that is not good, and he gets punished for it, but he still ends up helping someone else.  Now, he is a bad man,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie's plot is simple: an old woman finds a mysterious book in the attic of a dead man. The old woman is convinced that the book is cursed and she tries to find the owner of the book. After some detective work, she finds the book owner in the middle of the woods and she has to help him to a safe place. But there is something that she cannot explain to him: she has seen a ghost in the woods.  This is an easy, funny movie, a must watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ This movie is a fun one. If you have a few drinks and a little fun in the evening, this movie will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. The story is well done. It's like the first few hours of the movie were a long day at work and you're finally able to relax a little. The humor is good and funny. If there was a little more dialogue between the two main characters, the movie would have been more enjoyable. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie makes it into a few of the Best-of lists at the end of the year. If it does, I'll probably buy the DVD. __________ The only bad thing about this movie is that it didn't have the great opening title sequence like The Goonies. It has that cool little opening that is like the "What are you doing??" from the "Scooby Doo" movies. __________________ "What is the meaning of life?"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a big fan of "The Dark Knight" and I had always thought that "Batman" was the best Batman movie of all time.   It had great effects, it was one of the best films in the comic book genre and was a good lesson on how to make a good film.  The acting is very good, the story is interesting and well thought out and it is a very good movie to watch.  I also think that this is one of those movies that you can enjoy a lot and I was a fan of this movie.  The Film "Batman: Year One" is based on the graphic novel of the same name written by Alan Moore and drawn by Brian Bolland.  It was released in 1997. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad to see the return of the series after a short break (the last 2 episodes were great but nothing to write home about). It's still not an action-packed thriller as it was back in the 90s, but it's definitely got that "feel" about it.   The movie is really about the relationships of the main characters. It was an interesting story and they all get their moments to shine. I liked that the movie was mostly about the love stories and that there were some funny moments to make it entertaining. The music was good as well and there was one great shot that showed the two villains who were at each other's throats. I'm not sure if it was a good idea to make a movie about these characters and their relationships but I loved it. I hope this movie is going to be a recurring story.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie and a good story. I like that the story is about a guy who loves to read, and loves to watch movies. He loves to get into the action and the bad guys and I like him too. I think it's the first time the author has put a girl in the film, and it makes a difference. It's an interesting plot that makes the movie seem to have a different plot each time. It can get confusing and at times you wonder what is going on. If you want to watch this movie, get ready to see a lot of action and a lot a romance. It has it all. I really liked this movie. It was fun and I can't wait for the sequel.

I don't understand how a guy like this could ever get out.  He is such a dick.  You can't help but root for him but his actions are so selfish.  In the end, I'm surprised it didn't turn into a disaster.  I don,t know why the producers decided to film it all in black and white.  Maybe because they didn't know how to edit in the color and didn't care to find out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The Best of Both Worlds is a very good sequel to The Best Of Both Worlds, both in terms of quality and in terms a quality of story and plot. Â It does not change the basic plot, but it does take a few interesting turns, especially regarding the character of William Adama.  This is a film that has a few flaws, but at the same time it does offer a great story and an excellent soundtrack, along with great performances.    The Best In Both Worlds 2 is definitely a worthy sequel, but I still feel it would have been better as a stand alone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a reason why most of the action and action films from this era are not that good, and it's not because they are boring, it's because they're bad.  A good movie is the kind of movie that is so bad that you think it's good.    The film is set in the mid-1970's in San Francisco where a group of people are in the process of taking down the "Big 3" drug cartel.      Their job is to go out and find people who are selling drugs and get them into the "shadows" where they can be killed.  The only problem is that they don't know where the shadows are and they aren't very bright.  It's a pretty dark film.  The action in the film is very good.    I don't think I need to tell you that this film is NOT for kids.

He's also told that he can live off the land and be safe and secure. He also tells him that there is no such thing as a bad day because bad days are just a bad memory. Richard decides to take a leap of faith and goes off with his friend to live out his dream.  It has a nice soundtrack and a beautiful ending.  The movie is a great way to pass the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always liked films about small towns that are either very friendly or hostile toward outsiders. The first in the trilogy is not a great film. The actors do a good job of playing small-town roles, but the setting is bland. The town itself is run by a kind, well-meaning man who can't seem to get his life together and seems to spend a great deal of time at the local swimming hole. He's also the father of a local girl who can tell the time, which is a good thing, because he doesn't seem aware of the town's many other inhabitants. He and his daughter seem to have the same attitude about outsiders, and that makes the town feel more like a bad version of an amusement park. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it certainly doesn't top the list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best kind of science fiction:  It's hard to say if this is a good or bad movie, but it's definitely a better one. The story has the feel of an old-time radio drama, but the style of the voice is a little more modern. It's like an old movie: It's a story about a shipwreck, and about the man and his wife who find the ship. The only problem with this is that the film seems a little rushed. It doesn't really build up any suspense, or suspense in the end. It does a pretty good job of giving you a good time, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many films in the genre, this film is a slow burn that eventually explodes into a wild action set piece.   While it's not a perfect film by any means, it does offer an excellent story, the cast does a good job and the stunts are fantastic.

It has everything a great horror film should have.  There are some very unique scenes in this film, with the undead and the zombies.

I am not going to spoil anything about the film, if you want to watch the film yourself, then it's a great way to enjoy a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like it. I'm going to call this my next favorite, because I'm so happy to be able to say that I was able to watch this movie and I don't know if I can do it justice.   There's a scene where a man is in the hospital and is in a bad state of mind, so he's going to come back to his hometown and get drunk and kill a bunch of people.  He is about to go to the bar and start drinking and he sees a girl who seems to know something about his history with a local woman. She tells him something about the murders, but when he gets there, the bar is already closed.  The bartender, who has an axe that he uses to kill people, comes in and talks to him about the history and about how he used to be friends with the man who used to kill the people. The bartender tells him that the man's name is George "Travis" Cooper.  Cooper's first wife was killed by a cop in the woods and his second wife was raped and killed in the same woods. He has killed two of his friends, one in a bar fight and one in the car, then he's murdered by his brother-in-law in the house.  There are more characters in the movie, but there are so many I can't remember all of them all.  And I can only remember a few, but I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  I've seen this movie so many times before, and I can remember most of it, but it still makes me laugh every time I watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of movies and I'm not ashamed to admit that this one is one of my favorites. It's a great blend of action, humor, and romance. It is not an action movie in the traditional sense, but that's exactly what makes it a great movie. It moves at a good clip, has plenty of action and lots of characters to love. If you enjoy action and a good romantic comedy, then this is a great time.   There's so much to love about this movie. I think it's the first movie to make me laugh at a bad guy. I laughed when the bad guy tells the main character "I'm in love with you" and when the guy tells him "I like it when you're angry." It's great to see how silly a baddie can be. It also helps that the baddie is a real guy (not just a voice-over) and not just a caricature. It shows the audience that bad guys can be real and dangerous.   a few of the best parts of the movie:   - The romance between the main characters (and the rest of the cast) is sweet and fun. I love how they all interact. I especially love how the bad guys get to interact with the main couple.  . There are lots of different bad guys to love, and all of them are very different. There's a villain with a very creepy voice who loves to throw things and then kill people, and he's one of the more interesting characters in the movie. He's also a huge jerk. He has a good reason to be a jerk, but it doesn't make the bad-guy-ness stop there. He gets a lot of funny lines. The movie has a lot more laughs in the comedy scenes than the action scenes. It has a great mix of humor and action. I'm also a big comic book nerd, so the comic book references in the film are a big plus for me. The villain in this movie also gets to be funny in his own right. He is so good that it's funny to see him get the heros in trouble.   the baddies are also different. The villains are a mix of the classic bad guy, the modern bad guy and the bad dude from "Batman Returns." I'm a fan of the modern "bad guy." I think he looks cool and he does some very cool things.

Third, it was a movie that was made in the late forties.  And finally, it wasn't all bad.  This is one great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's not much of a plot to this one. The story is about an alien named Vortigaunt who wants to live amongst humans. So he decides to use his powers of telepathy to "convert" humans to aliens by having them see the Vortigeurs on Earth. The aliens are a race of very evil monsters. They live in an underground cave and are very primitive and primitive. But they are very good at their craft and can actually create anything out of thin air. And they're not afraid to use those powers to hurt their victims.   I was expecting a bit more from this movie, but the plot and the acting were all very good.   I saw this movie on TV years ago. This is a movie with a great plot. The acting was very good and the plot is very clever. The alien race was really frightening and the alien language was also interesting. This movie is not to be missed.

One of my favorite horror films, especially the first and third acts. It's very gory, suspenseful, and just plain scary. If you don't like the first two acts of this movie, you're not a horror movie fan. - June nine, 2004Great movie.  Review of: The Hills Have Eyes   It was the late 50's and I was 10 years old when I saw this movie. It was just a typical horror movie where a group of teens get together and do some silly, yet fun, things. After the teens are in the woods, a young boy is found dead by the side of the road. He had been hit by a car. The teens go to the local hospital and they find out that the boy was hit by the car of a woman who had gotten out of the car. Her husband had stopped to see what had happened and found the body. The woman said he was hit and he got out of his car. She said he tried to talk to her and she hit him with her car. They went back to the car and the man said to her, "I don't think you should hit me, I'm a nice guy." Then she went to the trunk and pulled out a butcher knife and killed him. It just kept getting better and better. The boy's mother came home and told her husband that she was at a friend's house. Her son went to her friend's home and said that he had killed his friend. She took him to the hospital and when he arrived there, they took him into custody. The girl's parents came to the police station and said he had been murdered and their son was the murderer. The parents went to jail for a long time, but they were released because they were found guilty of child abuse. They had to move away to another city. They never got over their son being a murderer. I had a crush on this girl's son and we would go to movies together all the time. The guy's name was John and he was my first crush on a girl. I wish we had met. He was very attractive and was very smart. He could make me laugh all the way to the bathroom. His mother was a sweet, nice woman. I still love his mom. I was always afraid to go

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people have made jokes about this movie, but I found it to be an extremely enjoyable film.   The story of the film is that two teenagers in the suburbs of Chicago are obsessed with the television show "The Simpsons."   After their father dies, the two brothers begin to live in a cave, in the basement of their family home.  They spend a lot of time there, and they eventually get bored and decide to leave the cave for the night.  It's a rather short film, but it's a very interesting one.  The dialogue is funny, and the acting is very good.  I think it's one of the best comedies made, and I highly recommend it to all the Simpsons fans out there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A Star is Born" is a good example of a "classic" western film from the '50s and '60s that is still very good today.  The movie tells the story of an innocent, but naive, cowboy who is taken under the wing of the town sheriff who is more than a little crooked and is involved in a number of crimes.    This is a western, but there is an edge to it that is really effective.   There are a number of characters, the sheriff is the main protagonist and his wife is a bit of a love interest, and there is the cowboy who helps out the sheriff's wife, who is a woman in trouble and is on the run.  The "stars" of this film are:  John Wayne (the sheriff)   --John Wayne was at the height of his career, he was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and was so popular at the time, the movie was released in almost all the theaters and Wayne had the opportunity to be the hero of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good thriller movie. It's a story about a man who becomes a father in his own way.   The movie is set in the 60's and is set on a beach where a beautiful couple lives.   The husband is a scientist and the wife is a dancer.  When the husband has a daughter the husband tells her that they can only have one child and that it will be a girl.  The husband is having problems with a man that is trying to take the wife away.  However, the wife tells him that she doesn't want to marry him and that she's going to find a man to marry her.  It's not easy to understand the movie.      It is a short film and I found the story interesting.  This movie isn't very good and it's not very good for children either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a man (played by a man, and who else would you want to play a man?) who is living in a big house with his friends and his wife and a lot of other people. He has a daughter and a wife who is a very sweet woman. He is always thinking of her, and she always loves him, as he is the one who made the home for her. It is about their daughter, who is not that beautiful, but she has her own ideas about life and is not afraid to say what she thinks about things. She has a great father and a great mother, and it is very nice to see how their love for each other has turned into a love for the other. It shows how much you can really love someone when they are not afraid of you, and you are not the center of their world. This is not a happy movie, but it is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ "The movie is set in the small city of La Porte, Indiana. The only reason I watched it is because of the movie poster. It had an old-timey look to it. There are no cars in the movie and most of the scenery is a little muddy. The story is about a young man named Jake (played by the great Paul Newman) who is hired by a local farmer (played with a bit of a dorky air by John Wayne) to find a lost horse in the town. As he is getting into his car, he spots a strange man standing outside. He starts to get out of his car when he notices that the man is wearing a black cloak. He decides to follow the man but then gets distracted by a woman (played very sweetly by Elizabeth Taylor) who says she is a widow. After he has been in her car for a little while, she says she will get Jake to come back to the farm with her. It is during this time that Jake is introduced to the farmer. The farmer is an eccentric man who has a large amount of money. He tells Jake that the horse has died. The next morning, Jake wakes up to find that the farmer has come out and said that he has a big surprise for him. He had found a small, black, horse in a field. The horse has a strange and beautiful color. The man tells Jake to go home. The woman then leaves with the horse. Jake then gets into a car and heads back to his farm. When he gets there, he finds that the people there are dead. The people were all old and had a strange look to their eyes. This strange look is what Jake finds very intriguing. He then finds the woman, the horse and the strange man and they all go into the woods to the barn. The strange man then gets Jake to take him out of the car and takes him to the big barn. Inside, the strange people tell Jake that they have found a way to stop the weather and the world from coming apart. The mysterious man then tells Jake what they need to do. They need to put a curse on the horse which will cause it to be in the sky. Jake does not want to do this and he is about to leave when he hears a man's voice. Jake runs over to see who it is. The voice says to him "I know this is going to be hard to do but we must do this. I
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the movie, " The Big Lebowski ", a man named Walter Sobchak (Jeff Bridges) is an alcoholic who lives on a roof in the middle of the desert, with his pet cat, Jesse (John Goodman), and his daughter, Lisa (Diane Keaton). When Walter's wife, Lou (Elizabeth McGovern), dies in an automobile accident, he decides to retire from the booze and live the life of a hermit, and buys a home in a remote mountain valley in California. However, Walter's retirement is short-lived when his brother-in-law Walter (John Belushi) shows up on his doorstep, offering him a chance to join the gang of "The Dude", a group of lovable misfits that includes a blind man, a deaf woman, a Mexican-American, and a Chinese-American. But Walter is still an alcoholic, and his drinking causes him to lose his memory. The Dude, his best friend Jesse, and the blind man (Bruce Lee) all help him get his memory back.   When it's time to move on from the desert and move back to the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walter takes the opportunity to get his house back. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as he thinks it will be.  It's hard enough moving a house back to Albuquerque, but Walter's memory has disappeared, and he has no idea what he wants to do with his life.  In addition, he has a lot of problems with his new landlord, Eddie (David Spade).   The big problem for Walter is that he has never actually seen the city from the outside, and is terrified of the outside world.  The film ends with Walter, his daughter Lisa, and some friends sitting around a fire in the desert.

It is a bit "over the top" and "horrible" and even some parts are "horrific" but it is good in that it is funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a group of people who live in a rural village in a beautiful country where the sky is always blue and the clouds are never moving. In the village are a group who are part of a traveling troupe of dancers who travel around the country, performing their own dances and songs. One day a woman from the town arrives and decides to stay with the troupe and live a little longer. It turns out that she has a child and the boy is a boy who is very clever and smart. The boy also likes to draw very well and does it all the time. He is very good at drawing and his mother is very pleased with him. The girl has a husband who is a doctor and a good cook. They have a beautiful home with a big garden, a horse, a donkey and a pig. There is also a big lake and a small pond.   The movie is not the most interesting but it is interesting enough. It is a good family movie about children, friends, love, friendship and the people who happen to be around. It makes you smile, laugh and feel good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting a movie about a band of criminals and how they rob banks in New York. What I got was a story of a band trying to get out of a bad situation by forming a band and getting their music on the radio. The band is called the "Troublemakers" and is made up of the same characters as the movie. They have a guitarist named Joe (who I always thought was a good looking guy) and a drummer named John (who looks like he has a real job). They have this great idea of playing a show for a bunch of tourists on the Hudson River. They don't have a rehearsal space, so they start in a hotel, and then they get to playing a park, a beach, and a small stage in a field. The audience is small, but they are good looking. They play some good songs, such as "Piece of My Heart," "What's Going On," and "Swing and a Miss." But the movie is not about them. They do make some good music, but it's not really a musical. There are a few scenes where you can see how they really think about the songs they are playing, but the rest of the movie goes along the lines of "the audience loves this song," or "the band wants to make a living."   The cast was all good, and the music is good. It's just not a musical and not a concert movie. It just doesn't work as a musical, but is good for a short movie.   Don't expect a musical comedy, but if you are looking for a quick movie with good music and a few good songs then you'll like this.  :

The only thing I have noticed that I think is wrong is that the girl who is supposed to be in love with the boy in the movie doesn't seem to know much about him.  I don't know what is wrong with this girl.  This is just one of those movies that you will laugh at, and at the same time be really sad.

The horse is very well treated and fed, and the king is very happy with the horse. At the end of the movie the king decides to ride the horse again. It's a very good movie, and well worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a little boy named Johnny who is about to start the third grade. He's a quiet boy who just wants to go to school, but things don't quite turn out that way.   After school, he is sent by his mother to live with a relative who has just been widowed. Johnny's aunt, Helen, is very strict and strict with her children.  It's obvious she is afraid that Johnny will grow up and be a real bad guy.  She is a good mom.  Helen is a big, fierce, beautiful woman who will not hesitate to use a gun to defend herself.  I really like Helen and Johnny.  Johnny is very shy and quiet but I think he is becoming more outgoing with each day.  He is still a child.  The movie is based on the real life of Johnny and Helen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great movie! It's the first in a series, so there are lots of surprises in store for you. It's not as good as the original, but it's still a good time. The film is set in the 1930s in a small village in the middle of nowhere. It stars the legendary Cary Grant, and is a good bit of nostalgia with a dash of humor. It has a good mix of action and comedy, and the actors all really do their job. This is the first of a trilogy. I'd like to see more movies like this, and a couple of Cary Grant films (The Last Picture Show, for example).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't usually give reviews but this one deserves a little bit of attention.  The script is good, the acting is top notch, the direction is really nice, and the cinematography is gorgeous.    There are so many characters in this movie, and each one is really distinct.  There is a man with a broken jaw who is forced to wear a huge metal mouthpiece and a woman who wears a huge corset, a man who is a bit of a dandy and a guy who is an ugly old man, a young woman who is also an ugly older woman, a guy with a horrible past, a crazy old woman, an old woman with a bad temper, a bunch of homeless people, a couple of kids, a dog, a horse, a house, and a bunch more.  I love this movie.  It's great to see how far the world has come and how far it has to go.

But I'm glad I watched this one and will definitely be looking for more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An all time classic. It has the look and feel of a movie made in the 70's. The film is set in a small town in America and follows a group of people that live there.   The movie starts with the father of one of the kids playing a guitar.  He is very talented and seems to be very well off.  When he gets older he is able to play much better and is even able to sell records at the local shop.  This sets up the main character,   a young boy, as he is growing up.  As a kid he is still a good kid and plays lots of sports.  One day, a group arrives at his home.  The boy is now 10 and they want to get him to the next level.  They start training him and eventually get him a guitar, a bag and a bag of sugar.  Soon they go to a movie theater and the boy is the only one not watching it.  It is at this point where the movie is going to get very dark.  While everyone else is having a good time,  the boy just sits there, looks at the screen and plays the guitar.   The movie shows the progress of this boy as he gets better and better at playing the guitar, but the more he gets it, the more the town becomes aware of it.  The boy gets caught doing the wrong thing at the school one day and is kicked out.  That is the end of the movie and I would say it is really good.  If you like this type of movie, I would suggest you get this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is not perfect. It has some technical issues and it is a tad short. The plot is good but not amazing. I was hoping for a better story because it is just about a boy named Billy and a girl named Molly. Billy has a pet pig named Lenny and he likes to pet Lenny a lot. Lenny loves Billy. But then Lenny runs away from home and Billy has to help him get back. So he runs out to the woods and sees a guy with a big gun. He tries to run away and he runs into the woods where he finds a huge bear who has killed and eaten Lenny. So Billy starts to get very excited. But the bear starts to eat Lenny too. Billy gets angry and decides to kill the bear. He does but he is scared and runs away. He sees a girl who is hiding in the bushes and she tells him to come back. Billy comes back and the girl is still hiding. He wants to go to her house but the girl doesn't want to see him. So then Billy goes to a friend's house who has a gun which he used to kill Lenny, and he tries to kill him too. But Lenny has gotten bigger and bigger and he eats the gun and Billy is still scared and so he runs away again. The girl comes out of the bushes again and asks Billy to come home with her. So they go to the house and the movie is done. The movie is good and I was happy to watch it.  It is about a small town called Middletown. It is run by a small group of people who are known as the Middlets. Middlete John Middleton was the town's mayor until he died. The town has a lot of farms and it has a good economy. But there is one problem. One day a mysterious stranger comes to Middlettown and says he wants to start a revolution. He claims to be a revolutionary, a man who wants to make Middette a better place to live. But Middlette Middelton knows that this stranger is really a crazy person who has an agenda to bring Middelle's to the brink of destruction. He tells the Midsothelites about his plan and they decide to try to stop him.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I saw this film for the first time on the big screen, and it did not disappoint. I'm a big fan of The Rocketeer, and this movie is a nice variation on the formula. It's still a good one. It has a great story, and I think the actors do a good job of bringing it to life. The characters are all unique and different, but I like the lead, Jack Weston, the way he moves and sounds. I thought he did a nice job of playing the role, even if he has a tendency to ramble and sound a bit like a drunk. There's also a nice cameo by Bruce Campbell, who does a fine job of delivering his lines. This is a great movie, and a great addition to the Rocky series. I highly recommend it.

I've heard a few good things about this film, but the first half is probably its strongest. A young boy is recruited by a mysterious organization to fight a dragon, which has been causing havoc in his neighborhood. I really enjoyed this film. It has an interesting premise, the characters are all memorable, and the action is pretty awesome. I only wish that they had brought back the more exciting parts of the first film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    We all know that when it comes to the film genre, it can get really expensive. It is quite common to see the same set of actors in multiple films that do not really fit together in any way, and this one is no exception. That being said, if you enjoy action, or really anything with guns or something, this movie is not bad. It has it's own action set pieces, but they are not the same kind that we are used to seeing in films. I thought this was a pretty good movie, but not a masterpiece, but a decent movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely caught off guard by the first couple of minutes of the film. I expected a more conventional vampire film that would be about a vampire hunter in a haunted house trying to stop vampires from coming back after having been killed. The film is much more than that. It has a dark atmosphere, a strong and powerful story, excellent acting, and a beautiful score. I have seen vampire movies that are much better and I have only seen a couple of them in a very long time. This is definitely one of those movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was in love with this movie from the first minute I watched it.  The film was made by a very talented guy named Robert Zemeckis.    I thought he did a great job and I loved the film.  The story was about an old couple who had a dream that they were being followed by a strange, silent, moving car.  The car did not look like a normal car and it drove along a lonely country road, with a man (Tom Hanks) sitting in the back seat and a woman (Brie Larson) in the front seat.  One night, they were driving along the road when the car suddenly stopped, and a man got out of it. This man was a doctor named Dr. Zemecko (Tom).  Zemekis also made a cameo appearance, and the man in the car was a guy named Bob, who was supposed to be the son of the old couple's neighbor, but who never showed up.  This was all just a dream.  After Dr.Zemecko had been with them for a while, they began to have dreams that something terrible was going to happen to them.  It was the day of a funeral.  Dr.Hanks and his wife were in the funeral. Then suddenly, Zemeco comes out of the coffin, and begins to speak to them in their dreams.  He says that he is in fact the son that the old man's wife was talking about.  They then all wake up, and begin to get worried.  But it's not as bad as it seems.  Zemekis had also created a new kind of car called the Zemecki Car.  In the movie, there were many different kinds of Zemecksis Cars, but there were only two different types in the real world.  While they are all a little different, they are the same thing in a way.  When the old woman (Larson) and the boy (Hanks) went into the house, they all fell asleep in their beds.  There was one man in each bed, who had something very important to say to them (and to Zemeleckis, of course).  When they awoke, the man said to them:  "Now you have a friend.  You are all going to be friends, no matter what."  They were all surprised, but the next morning, Dr. Hanks and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. The cast were great, the story was great, and the acting was great. I liked that the movie took a different turn after the first half of the film. It had more of a horror vibe. There was a really great moment where a child is killed, and a man tries to kill himself.  I like the story:   I loved the story. It was scary and there was a lot of gore.   The ending was a little rushed, but it was still a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I are big fans of the classic "Dirty Dancing" and this is an adaptation of the movie that I always thought was one of the best of all time.    The movie is about two dancing brothers who were both born and raised in Detroit and they both become dancers at a local club.  One of them, the older brother, has a great career as a dancer and the other, the younger brother, is just a good dancer.  The two of them decide to join the "Disco Busters" a group of teenage girls who are very talented.  They are all very attractive and have all the money that they could ever want.  When the time comes to leave their dance club to return home to Detroit, they are attacked by the gang that are in charge of their club. The girls are rescued by the two brothers and they then decide to take their dance career to the next level.  The girls, however, decide to stay in the group and the two young men are forced to dance with them.  This movie is a great movie to watch because it has a wonderful soundtrack, beautiful cinematography and a great story.  It is not an easy movie to find and even though it is not the biggest movie, it is worth the search. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man From Earth is one of those movies that is good enough to be made into a TV series or a movie of the same name. It is one that is a good time to watch and is a lot of fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We are all in this movie together"   As a huge fan of the movie I thought this movie was a lot of fun. I thought that the actors did a good job with what they were given, which is not always the case with the same actors playing the same parts. But as I said in the beginning I really enjoyed this movie. I don't think there are any problems with the movie other than it being one of those movies that you have to see again and again and even then you might find a thing or two that you didn't like. It's a good little movie that you will enjoy.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I like to say that when I'm looking for a good action movie, I usually turn to the Japanese. But when I watched this one I was a little shocked at how well this movie handled a story that didn't seem that good. The story, while interesting, seemed to be rushed and not well planned. It is a very good movie, however, I wish the director had used more time on the background. There are a couple of interesting background characters and it would have been great if the movie had more time to show these characters, but unfortunately, the movie was cut off in the middle and it is not clear what happened after that. I think that this movie is worth seeing if you like action movies, but I can't say I liked it. Â Â
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a well-written, well-acted, well produced and well directed movie. It was very interesting to see what the movie was about, and I believe that this movie is more about the characters and the plot than about the special effects. It would be good to see more of the story, but I found myself liking the movie more and more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie is the best one that has come out recently, in that it is so well done, and the characters are all so likable. The story, as told by the two main characters, is very well done. There is a very sad, tragic story about two people who have to leave their home in order to survive the end of the world. The movie takes place in an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where the world is dying. The island has a small population and there are only two people left alive. One is the boy who is about to turn 13, and he has been orphaned at a very young age, so he doesn't have a lot of friends. The other is the girl, and she is about 13. She has been brought up by a mother who is very strict, and doesn't want her to have any friends. One day, the girl meets a man on the street, and they fall in love. When she gets pregnant, she decides to move to a more friendly place, and leaves her mother. After a short time there, she is taken in by a man who she doesn't like, but she stays with him anyway, because she believes that it will be better for her son. One night, the woman goes to her son's home, and sees that all the children are gone. The man who is her son is there too, and after he sees that everyone has left, he is furious. He takes the girl to the man's house and tries to force her to stay there with him. It is a dark place, full of bad smells and horrible noises. He tries to use the girl as a sex slave, but the girl is too strong, and keeps escaping. Eventually, she runs to a house, and there is a man there, who takes her in. Soon after, she gives birth to a child, who is named Johnny, and a few days later, she takes him home with her. The woman's son is a little old, and has no friends. He gets to school, and becomes a target of bullies. He also is afraid of being alone, and tries his best to make friends, but no one likes him. He goes to the girl's house, but he can't get there because the doors are locked. He is really sad, but decides to stay and live with the woman. He becomes more and more attached to the woman, and wants to be like her
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great adventure movie that has a lot of humor and good action. I am not much of a martial artist so I had to watch the movies in order so that I can tell the story correctly. But once I figured it out, it was a lot more fun. I think this movie was made to be a TV show. I don't think this was a bad idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Big Lebowski is a brilliant film about a very stupid guy who is really, really, very stupid and has a lot of fun doing it. It is not a good film, it is not even a great film, but it is a very funny film. It does not have any real plot to it but it just has a good time. The only problem with this film is that it is really not that good. It seems to me that the movie was made in the 70's and that the director did not think it was a good idea to make a comedy out of this. The movie is really funny and you are going to love this one.  The cast is great and you will find yourself laughing at almost everything. The story is really silly and I would recommend this to people who like a good laugh and who enjoy seeing the characters that they like on the screen in a silly way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Breathtaking" is the only word I can think of to describe this movie. I have seen a couple of "bigger" movies and this is not one of them.  It is a great piece of cinema, and is a masterpiece of a film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is a classic example of how to tell a story with an epic plot and a gripping drama that is filled with great acting and great story telling.  You may wonder why I am talking about a great film instead of the one starring John Wayne.    The film starts out slow, but it does not stop.  After the first hour, the film has you guessing and wondering what will happen next.  The suspense in this movie is intense, and you will not want to leave the theater.  John Wayne gives a fantastic performance as the charismatic and sadistic leader of a gang who kills and mutilates the body parts of the wealthy and beautiful young people they find and brings them to the beach where he shoots them with a large cannon.  He is the main antagonist and he is the real story.    The rest of the cast does a wonderful job in playing characters that are not only interesting, but interesting in a different way.  They are not just walking caricatures, but real characters who are the real deal.  It is the story that really pulls you into the story and the acting, music, and direction of this film makes you feel like you are really there in the action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is the first one in a trilogy, and that is one of the main reasons why I was so eager to see it. I liked the first film quite a lot and wanted to see how it ended. I found it quite good. It had some nice touches like a very well-acted performance by Richard Boone, the use of the original song (The Ballad of the Space Cowboy) by Frank Sinatra, the way the story is told in the film and the special effects are pretty good. But, what is most amazing is the fact that it is still going strong. There are still movies being made about this story. I don't know how much longer it will go on. I guess I will watch it again soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** This is a very good film about the last day of the war in Europe in 1944. The movie is very good and the actors are really good. There is also a really good film in the same era in the US called "The Last Days" about the war. The plot is different in both these films and the main characters are also different. This movie is not a good one but a very well made one. It is a great film and should be seen by all who love war and WWII movies.

Â It is definitely an homage to the old "Hogan's Heroes" show and it is definitely a very funny movie.  The actors are very good and I can see why they are in such demand.    It is very funny and the jokes were well thought out.  I am really glad I saw this movie. I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only reason this is a 4 is because there is a scene in the middle where a car pulls up in front of a house and there are two men with guns, one who's got a gun in his back pocket and one who has a gun with a laser sight on the end of it.  In this scene a little boy is running through the yard in the house when a man shoots him in the head.    In the same scene a man who has shot and killed someone gets shot at by the other man.  I really liked this movie, it had a nice sense of humor and it was not overly scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot:   A young man, the son of a well off family who have lived in a comfortable, well protected, upscale suburb of New York City, is about to take a job as a bodyguard to a Hollywood producer. His new boss, a well-to-do movie producer with a Hollywood pedigree, is a violent man with a sadistic streak. The two men become friends and the producer is kind to the young man. He tells the young person that the only thing in his life that has ever been of importance to him is his relationship with his late mother, who died shortly after his birth. His mother had wanted a boy to be named after her.   His mother had also wanted a son to be a good actor, so she had chosen the name of a famous actor, Howard Hughes. He had died in a car accident shortly before his mother's birth. She had always wanted a handsome boy and had wanted her son to have a good acting career.  ...   He takes a job in a movie studio as a production assistant and soon is taken under the wing of a powerful producer who has some ideas about what he wants the young production assistant to do. One day he finds himself working with a beautiful young actress, who is the daughter of the producer. She seems to have an obsession with Hughes, who she idolizes.   the two men start to have sex with one another, but the girl has other plans. She is determined to have him killed, and she decides to help her friend with the murder. She persuades the young assistant to murder her lover. But the assistant is caught and the girl turns against him. She plans to kill the producer as well. The producer, who has been the victim of similar plots, is more than a little concerned. His daughter is very beautiful and he is a very good looking man. But he is not very much in love with her and they have a falling out. The young assistant then tells the girl that she must get the producer killed. The girl wants to know why the producer has to die and she also wants to kill Hughes.   (This movie was released in the year 1966 and I have a hard time remembering the name that it was called.) The young man is a bit too quick to go ahead and make a murder, and in a short time the young girl has had Hughes killed. She then uses the murder as leverage against the young woman who is trying to break
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good film. I had seen this in the theater when it came out in 1971 and I still have the movie on video. The actors and crew are all very nice and all of the music is very catchy.  The music was created by The Grateful Dead and it has a unique feel to it. The acting is good, and they give the characters a real sense of life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a pretty good adventure with a good twist, but the story has some serious problems.   I'll start by saying that the movie starts off promisingly with a few characters and a nice beginning.  , a young woman is a bit of a troublemaker, but it's her own hubris that leads her to become a slave to a vampire lord and to marry him. However, she is only a slave for a short time and when she gets free she immediately begins a romance with the vampire lord, but even then she is no match for the man. He can seduce her so easily and he has a really good look for a vampire. He's handsome, with a nice face and a great body. His vampire form is pretty much the same as his human form, but he seems to have a little more agility and is a better fighter. I like him and it is a pity that he has to be killed off by the good guy, but I don't mind at all. I thought he had an interesting look and I enjoyed the fight scenes.   for a while I was hoping for some more action and to find out what would happen to the vampire, but no, he's just dead in the end. It was sad to see a good vampire character get killed off, but not really the main problem with the story. The story has its moments and it does have a good beginning, but later it becomes a bit confusing and I wasn't able to understand what was going on at all, even after watching the movie again.   to sum it up: the movie is ok but the ending was too abrupt and unsatisfying for me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited to see the sequel to the movie with the same name and it is a great one. It is a more serious and realistic version of the original. The movie is told from the point of view of a man named Jock (Jeff Bridges) who is the owner of a small hotel in a small town called Cumbria. Jock lives alone and lives in a simple, yet elegant house. He has a wife and a son who are both adults. When Jock's son, Tom (Peter Mullan), is about to be married to a woman named Rose (Bridget Fonda), Jock decides to send his son to the United States to get a better education. Jocks son, Jock Jr. (Matt Damon) comes to Cumbrian with Tom and is the most popular child there. When Tom and Rose begin to fall in love, the town begins to fall apart. Jocking Jr. is an incredibly good looking kid who also happens to be an excellent student. Tom and Jock begin to develop feelings for each other, but the town's society is very rigid. Tom tries to make friends and get into the local high school. Meanwhile, Jocks wife Rose is growing sicker and more dependent on him. Jokey, but not funny. It all seems so absurd. It would be a great movie if it had a bit more humor. This movie was very well acted by all involved. There were several good, funny scenes. There are some scenes that I would love to see in a good comedy. The story line was pretty good and interesting. It was a nice change of pace. The cast is pretty good too. There was a few weak parts in the story line but nothing bad. The film is about a lot of things that are silly, yet funny at the same time. The ending of the film was pretty funny. There is a nice little homage to the first movie with Jock, his son, and Jocks friend (Danny DeVito). There is also an excellent ending song by David Bowie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie for the first time in 1999, after it had already been shown in Japan and it was pretty good, but I never thought I would ever see it again. I had been a huge Star Wars fan since I was little, so I knew all the characters. I didn't know what happened in the next movie, but in the original, George Lucas was trying to keep the Star Wars universe as close to the original trilogy as possible, which meant no more prequels. He was a genius, and I'm glad he did that.   This is the most "new" movie, because the plot is really interesting and it's a good, old fashioned adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm so glad that I saw this film because it made me laugh so hard and I felt like it was a lot more serious than I expected. The movie does have a bit of a different feel to it compared to other zombie movies that I've seen and it's good that it doesn't rely on the gore of a typical zombie movie. I've heard about the great actors in this film and I had heard a lot of bad reviews about the film. The acting was good and the acting was even better when the zombies were showing up. I was surprised at how realistic the zombies looked. They had a lot less flesh and bone and the gore didn't seem to be all that good. The zombies that appeared were very realistic and had the ability to run fast, move very quickly, throw some great punches, and even dodge bullets. The best part about the zombies was how the film portrayed them. The filmmakers made them look realistic and real. I felt that they didn't take much liberties with the zombies because they were so realistic. There was also a great scene where one of the zombies that were supposed to be human were shot in the face and had a piece of flesh torn out of it. That really made me smile because it reminded me of when I was a kid and I would have ripped out flesh from my skin to see if I could get a piece out of a zombie's face. The other zombies were also very realistic. They looked like the real thing and even had the appearance of someone that was very young. I also liked the fact that the zombies didn't appear to be very intelligent because they weren't using any of their brains to fight the humans. They were just running around and eating people. I don't know why it bothered me that the humans in this movie weren't as intelligent as the zombies. I mean it's a zombie movie so they have to be dumb right? But there were times when the humans were smarter than the zombies and I thought it was really stupid. It just seemed like they were trying to scare the audience to make the audience think that the zombie were smarter then they were. If I had to guess I would say that the filmmakers made a movie that was more for adults and that's why it didn't really make a lot to me. I thought that the film was alright, but I wasn't too impressed with it. I like the film but I didn't find it to be anything special. I would like to see this movie again but

In the story of the film, an American man named Carter (Sylvester Stallone) travels to Egypt and finds that there is a mummy (played by Brendan Fraser) that is in grave danger. He sets out to help this mummy and to learn why the mummy wants to be buried and then is transported to the past to learn about the mummy's past. "  The movie is based on the book by Peter Jackson.  You have to admit that it's a nice change of pace from the usual monsters you find on television.    I liked the story well enough.    The Mummies were fun to watch and there were a lot of them.  The monsters were pretty cool.  I thought the story was good.  It's nice to see that a movie doesn't have to be a straight up horror movie to be good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is based on a true story about a boy who was born in a poor area of America. He grew up and attended high school in a rich neighborhood in the North. Then a family moved to an expensive house on the beach. When he was in high school, his family moved again. When his parents were there, the boy was in a movie theater with his friends when the wife got into an accident with a truck. He helped her to the car and then they all got out. He was on his way home when a guy came up to him and said he could do whatever he wanted to him. The boy did not know that the guy was a cop. The next thing he knew, he was arrested and put in jail. The cop who arrested him had a hard time keeping him there. He finally got him to sign a statement that he had been involved in a car accident and that he was a drug addict. After that, he let him go and then told him to get back to school. The kid started going to school and getting good grades. He then started getting involved with some women and had sex with them. The mother of his girlfriend saw him and told her what had happened. Then she called the police and then went to the police station. The police went over to the house to see what was going on. They found some drugs and marijuana on the kitchen table. When they went to see the girl who had been in the car accident, she did not believe them. She was sure it was a lie and she did a little dance to get the cops attention. The girl got up and did a dance. Then the police arrested her. After she was in jail for a few days, the cops arrested the boy. When the boy went to prison, his mom came to visit him. He told her about the girl and the car crash. He said she made him get involved in drugs because she thought he would be the best in bed. He also said that she was a bad influence and he was always scared of her. She told him that she loved him and wanted to be with him but he had to be honest with her. They had sex and then she said they could stop. Then they did not have sex anymore. He didn't tell his mom what had been happening and he did not tell anyone. He ended up getting out of prison a couple of years later. He went to college and got a good job and had a good life

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film follows a young man and his friends as they embark on a cross country road trip to see their favourite band, "The Dukes of Hazzard".  The film is well acted and a joy to watch.    The film follows the Dukes as they drive from Georgia to Texas.  After the group crash land in Texas, they set off to find a hotel room and find one to stay at.  The crew are in good spirits.  They have fun, have a good time, and find a place to stay.  The crew have a bit of a rough time though, because they are all under age of eighteen.   This movie is a good one.  I enjoyed it very much.    It is not a bad movie by any means, but it is not something to go see with your children.  It is a fun little movie to watch with your friends.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie, the action takes place in a large, open room with a lot of chairs and tables and it is very comfortable to sit there and enjoy the movie.  The film is very action-packed and the film takes place on a very wide-open field of grass, which is a very interesting scene because it looks like a real open field.  The action scenes in the movie are quite good.   The movie has a lot going on.  It starts off with a group of soldiers who are playing a game of basketball.  They are shooting their way through the enemy lines.  But then they come across an enemy soldier who is running away from them.  He is very strong and fast.  Then one of the soldiers takes the bullet from the man's chest and the man falls to the ground and dies.  This scene is quite realistic.  At the end of the movie, we find out that the man who died was the one who was hiding in the bushes.  When the movie ended, the soldiers all started laughing and joking about the man.  That was a very touching scene.  In the movie it is hard to tell who the real enemy soldiers are and who are the good guys.  Some of the bad guys are really bad.    But then there are good guys who are really good.   The movie is a lot about good vs bad and how good vs. bad is best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie you will see an American GI in the jungles of the South Pacific fighting for the United States Army against the Japanese. He is a good man and a brave one. He has no qualms about going into battle. He never gives up. When his plane crashes, he is rescued by a Japanese who takes him back to his home in the jungle. There he is trained to be a member of the Imperial Japanese Army, and goes through training and then is sent to a new location where he has to be ready for action. At the end of the movie the main American character is given a medal and is then sent off to fight again. The Japanese soldiers are not bad at all. They are just as bad as the Americans. They seem to be made up of young boys who were captured at a young age. I found this movie very entertaining and fun to watch. I thought it was very interesting and I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in World War II history.

It was one of those movies that made me cry.  The movie was a beautiful and powerful love story.  It has a haunting ending that was the highlight of the movie.  My parents were very good friends of the Stewart family.  I didn't know their names until the end of the film.  They were all in this movie together.        This is a good story about a group of people who are stranded in the middle of the woods.  And then the ending is very haunting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I saw in 2011 is not a movie I've seen before and definitely not one I'm interested in seeing again. I think that if I was in the same position as you I would have done some homework on the story and maybe read some reviews and then seen the movie to see if it was worth it. I have to say that even after watching the movie I was not entirely satisfied.   There are some parts that I think are quite interesting, but I was also left wondering why they bothered putting such an old movie together in the first place.  This movie seems to be trying to say something about the world today and what it means to be a man. There are a couple of very interesting characters that I don't want to give away, but that's just the nature of these movies.  I was actually a little bit disappointed that the movie didn't end the way I was hoping it would. It did leave the characters in a place that was somewhat satisfying, but the ending left me a little underwhelmed.

If you like movies like "Shrek" and "Shake it Up", then you should go out and buy this movie. It's fun, it's heart-warming and it's funny. It is also one of the best horror films I've ever seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â This is a good story about a father's love for his son. The father's name is "Bobby", and he is a real cowboy. The movie is shot like a western, with lots of fast-paced action. The son is very nice, and Bobby is a great father. He is a lot like my grandfather in many ways. He never gives up and never loses hope. The ending is also quite nice. Â Â The movie should be on many more film lists.  It is a really good movie, and worth watching.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You're Not There"  is the story of an astronaut who crash lands on a remote planet in a spaceship that had previously been crashed there. The captain (Michael Caine) is trying to escape the crash and discovers that his ship has been badly damaged and the only thing that can save him is his wife (Kim Cattrall) who is still on the ship. He must find out what happened to the ship, how the other astronauts are faring and why the crew of the spaceship had all been killed. There are a few good moments in the movie including one scene where Michael Caine plays a character in a bar that seems to be trying to find a way to kill the astronaut. The whole movie is shot in black and white but you can tell that there is a lot of detail put into the production and it shows. The story isn't perfect but there is enough there to make it a good watch. I would recommend this to people who like to see good science fiction with a strong story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ ________.  I just finished watching "Mister Roberts". I was shocked that a movie about a gay man, who is married to a black woman, would be so popular. I was surprised that a film about a black man who falls in love with a white woman and becomes a lawyer would be considered "fringe" by so many people. I think this movie has a lot to teach us. I really enjoyed it. I loved the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie   about an ex-military guy and his wife is the one starring Steve Carell. The movie has a very good plot and the acting by the lead actors is top notch. This movie is also the best movie about a guy who lost his leg, the guy who is a former Marine and the wife who is the former military wife. The story of this movie is a little bit more interesting than the first movie in the series, but I would say that the plot is also more confusing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie that's worth seeing!  If you like good old fashioned cowboys and Indians, then you will love this movie.  The actors are all very good, and the scenes are all filmed well, and I believe that the script was written by a writer who was very good at the time.    I'm sure that many of you have seen the original western and you will remember that the Indians were portrayed in a way that was not just a bad man on the side, but a bad woman.  This movie was written at a time when the western had no stars and there were no actors who were good enough to be in it.  I think the western was a big hit back in the 1920's and the same kind of movie that this film was based on.  A little old school, but good old style western.

This was a fun little movie and I will definitely be watching it again!

This movie has an incredible sense of humor, which was well balanced with some good drama and emotion.  If you are a fan of comedies, you will enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie " The Last Exorcism" is a very interesting and entertaining movie with good horror elements.

I recommend this movie to all movie lovers.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A well-told tale about two boys trying to find their father.   I liked the way they used a lot of real life situations to create a realistic picture. I was surprised how many times they went back and forth.  The movie was a great surprise, especially since it's a comedy.  The movie is about a boy and his father. The father has been a bit of a problem child for a while, but when he was younger, he was the kindest and best father ever. I didn't know why his son had to become a delinquent and become a junkie. I'm not sure what happened to make the boy become so violent. The movie was enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most recent movie I watched was The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and I loved it. It's a comedy about a crazy and talented artist, Walter Mittler, and his wife who is not so good at art, who tries to make a living painting things. The movie has a nice feel to it, and the characters were all well developed and funny.   I think the next one they are going to release will be about a couple who get a home, and find out there is a ghost that lives in their house. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first few minutes are just weird. It's like a dream, where everything is just a bit too clear and you can tell it's all done by a single person. But the dream starts to grow more interesting. The dreamer seems to be a woman. She can move her eyes, she can see herself clearly. She moves her hands in a very feminine way, like she's playing with them. She starts to speak and she is talking about a guy that has a penis. She explains that her friend has a boyfriend who she just met. Her friend is very good-looking and is going to a university in France. The guy is only good- looking, but she can't seem to get over him. Then, at the end of the dream, the girl disappears. I found it funny, but it didn't really hit me as a movie. I would recommend it to a few people.

I have to say that it was an amazing experience. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story of the film is so well done, it is almost too good to be true.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really looking forward to the sequels and I would like to see the last two movies (I hope they don't just remake the first movie and call it the third movie.   It should be a good story about a guy who gets a mission and is sent to a space station and then when the mission is over he gets a job as a janitor.  This movie is about the janitor who is actually a cyborg, that is why he has the most inhuman appearance ever seen in the movie. He looks like a very old robot from the future and the movie is filled with eerie images, and sounds.  The film has a great cast that includes Christopher Lambert as the lead and the great Robert Mitchum as his boss.  It has a very good story and it is very eerie, and has a lot of surprises in it.  I give it a 9 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure how many reviews I can write about a movie, but the film had a very unique feel about it. The movie has a very short running time and that's the way it should be. There's some great performances here and the story line is fun to watch, but it's a bit short. The only thing I can really say about it is the great score by Tangerine Dream.   The DVD can be purchased at Amazon or at your local video store.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the best thing I've seen in a long time. It's about a man who is a slave to his wife and kids and is a good man but a bad father. He has an affair with a white woman. He is a little man and gets into trouble with his wife when he gets caught having an affair. He wants to go back to the farm but his wife won't let him. The wife is so crazy. She has a crazy husband that she has to watch but she can't do it. She tells the kids to do their chores, and the kids take their toys away and play with them. The woman then says that the kids must learn to obey their father and that is what they do. So they go back into the farm and they play as they always have. So then the man is a father again, but his children don't know who he is. This is an example of the kind of movie that could be made, but it is a rare kind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie, it's about the "lost" twin of the lead character in the movie. When they were young they grew up together, and then they grew apart and separated. And the reason why is because the older sister went off to the country, and the younger sister was left with the father. But that is the only problem about this movie.   The music, the plot, the characters are all good.  I liked this movie a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that are not bad but aren't good either.  The story was a bit of a let down but it was well done.    It is about a group of children who live on a farm in the mountains.  They go out hunting every day.  One day the farmer's wife comes up with a plan to sell the farm and move the children to another place.  She goes to the boys' father and says:  "Dad, I'm going to sell this farm to a company for $30,000.  I want to give the children the best life we can give them.  So you need to make a good decision, and I know the one for you is this farm.  If you buy the farm you will get a new house, a new job and a chance to start a new life for you and your family."  The boy is the best at anything, so the farmer agrees to sell him the farm.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A classic example of an old school comedy. "The Producers" is a classic example that is set in the 1920's.  The movie has a strong plot that is not over-the-top, and the movie is good at keeping the audience interested in the plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't usually give movies a 4 or 5 rating, but this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The movie is about a man who comes to an amusement park and sees all of the children who had been in the park the day before and are now out of it. The man comes up to the children and says "Oh, I'm so sorry. I was looking for you all day and I thought you were still here." He goes over to the kids and sees they're all in tears, so he asks them to talk to him. They do, and he says to them, "Now, let's all go home, shall we?" They say yes and he goes back to the ride. They all sit in their seats and talk about how the children were all crying, and they felt sad, and now they're happy again. Then they all turn to him and say, "We're going to see a play that you are writing." They all know what the play is about, and it's about a boy who wants to be a boy. The boy sees a girl and wants to kiss her, and the girl kisses him back, and so on. He says, "Well, it sounds like a pretty good play, doesn't it?" And so the kids go on with the play. The end of the movie is really touching, and you see the joy in the children's eyes. I'd say this is a great movie. It's a very good movie, and I recommend it to everyone.   (review of free book)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first part of this film is amazing, and the ending is fantastic.  You have to watch this film, because it is so great.    It's a movie that is full of life, and it's a film that shows us the human side of the war.  One of the things that I enjoyed about this movie is that there were no "heroes" in this movie.  I mean, yes, the soldiers and their commanders were awesome, but they were also human, and they were doing what they thought was the right thing to do at the time.  We see some of the soldiers in a very bad situation, and then we see the same soldiers in another very bad place, and we see a lot of them suffering through this terrible war. It's one of those movies where you feel sorry for these men, but at the same time you feel that the war is pointless.  There are people that can't be reasoned with, and there are people who can't even be loved.  If there's a message here, it's that people are going to suffer for what they believe in, and if they believe it's right, they're going to get what they deserve. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie very entertaining. I was a little worried about the ending since it was not very well written, but it was good. The movie is about a girl who goes to an amusement park for a day. She meets a cute boy, and after a day they end up going on a trip to a haunted house. This was not a very good movie, but was entertaining. The best part of the movie was the boy's voice. He is not that annoying.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a guy, James, who's a very shy guy. So, when he gets a letter from a woman he met through an ad for a job, James decides to meet her in person. But it's a job that doesn't pay well. And when he goes to get his paycheck, he's told that the woman has a boyfriend who is a police officer. So James decides he's going to take a chance on this job, and go to a bar where a policeman has a drinking problem, and a lot of problems with his girlfriend. It's a simple story, but it's really good.   I didn't care for the story, it wasn't that great. But, the acting was good. I liked how they all were together, even though there was a lot going on. I also liked that the policeman, the police officer, the detective, and the bartender all had to work together to solve the mystery. It was a good mixture.  .

This film does a good job of introducing the killer and his victims. There is a lot of information about the case which gives the audience a sense of the evil that this man has been capable of. The way he kills his victims is also very cool. I really enjoyed watching the killer get his just deserts. The ending of the film is a good twist to the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is pretty simple. It takes place in the year 2013. The main character, Jack, is a very talented singer-songwriter. She is also in a relationship with her best friend, Bob. However, Bob has his own troubles with women and in particular, with women who work in the restaurant. He is constantly making a pass at these women. It's just that he has a lot of time to himself and he does not want to be bothered with the woman he is in love with. He wants her to move out and be with another man.   Jack is a pretty smart woman and a pretty good singer, and she has a good sense of humor and she's very talented at what she does. However she does not have a lot in common with Bob in terms of interests. They both love their jobs and they are both very successful. In fact, it's hard to find any fault with Jack and Bob, except that Bob does not give her much time to herself. She really seems to need someone to talk to. So Bob decides that Jack should come over to his place to see him and that they will try to figure out how to make things work out. Jack agrees to go and Bob and Jack decide to play the whole thing out in the open. There is a good deal of sexual tension between them. It turns out that they have very little in common and they also seem to have very strong opinions about everything.  : In my opinion, this is a great movie. It is pretty good, but it's not perfect. It has a certain charm and it has a very good cast and it's fun to watch. I also really enjoyed the music and I wish they would do more movies like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about a family who lives in a small town in the mountains. They all get into a fight because they've been arguing about a man that was in town that night and that's all that happened. The girl who is a teacher, the boys who were the best friends of the man, and the girl who likes the guy but hates him because she thinks he's creepy are all in the movie. The guy that the girl thinks is creepy is actually the sweetest guy you've ever met.  The movie does a good job of making me believe that there was some real feelings behind all the crazy things that happened in the house. It's sad that a guy like that is gone now, but there's nothing you can do about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie. It is not a movie that I would recommend to all but if you like films with a plot, then this is a movie for you. The plot is straightforward. The story centers around a young man named Joe who is trying to help his father with a big debt. One night Joe finds a body in a field and the police believe it to be that of his father. The film has a lot of action scenes and is well-made, however, I would have liked more action in the film. It could have been a lot more entertaining.  The music is not particularly memorable but is there.

It's gritty because it's the kind of movie that needs to be made, that's why it's so good.  It's gritty for all the right reasons, and it does so in the most realistic manner possible.  There's a lot of violence in this movie.   The only way it could get better is if the filmmakers would just stop cutting and instead put the violence in the film's proper perspective.

A guy who is always having to fight with women, a guy with a bad heart. A great movie that will get you interested in this great character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Frosty the Snowman"  is a cute little animated feature film about a Snowman, who has a bad case of frostbite. When he is rescued by the family of a very wise old lady, she is not at all impressed by the Snowball's appearance. She tells him to put a hat on his head and to stay inside. The Snowman is reluctant at first, but eventually takes the advice and puts a hat over his head. As he goes out to find his ice castle, he meets a girl named Snowball who seems to be enjoying herself. One day he finds her hiding in a tree. When she is captured by the evil Snowman who wants to eat her, he has her locked up in the castle. She has to help him out by melting his ice with her magic. The film is funny and has a lot of laughs. It's a short film and is good fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few months ago, a young woman named Amy (Amy Seimetz) is diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition called Lou Gehrig's disease (L.E.D.). Amy is the oldest of five children, and the family is struggling to raise her five siblings and her younger brother on their own. Amy is a happy, vibrant person who loves animals, music, and all things musical. Amy and her brother (Danny Trejo) are friends with a group of kids from their neighborhood named L.E in the movie "Guitar and the Violin". This is a nice, mellow movie. The only downside of this movie is that the story is rather short, but the story itself is very interesting. This is not a bad movie. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is based on a true story.  The story begins in the mid 1800s when an American named James Macdonald (the name was changed) was an Irish immigrant to Canada.  He went to the US in 1847 and lived with the family of a wealthy woman named Mary.  They had a small house and a beautiful view over the lake.  In 1851, James' wife, a sister, and an infant daughter were murdered.  Mary Macdonald's murder became a symbol of the Irish immigrants in Canada. It was an international story because the story has a tragic ending.  James was tried and found guilty of the murder.  A jury found him guilty of first degree murder. His death sentence was commuted to life in prison.  The US Supreme Court overturned the conviction and the US Government decided to send James to Canada for his trial.  After his death, the Canadian government allowed James' family to return to Ireland.   The movie has a very realistic feel and some of the details are very believable.  One of the scenes in the movie is a real life case that I've heard about.  A movie with a tragic end:  The murder of Mary MacLeod was the catalyst for the beginning of a war between the Irish and the Canadian Government.  Many Irish immigrants, including James MacCdonald, were put into internment camps.  There are many movies that tell the story of the internment.  This movie shows it from the point of view of James' brother and the daughter.  I thought the movie was very realistic and made me think about the events that I know about. I also thought it was interesting to learn about the political atmosphere of the time.  Another thing that I thought was interesting was that the movie showed the Irish as people that are very intelligent and educated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched the movie "Dirty Harry" in a theater. I didn't know what to expect since I hadn't heard anything about it. I had heard it was a bad movie, but that's only if you're an actor. If you're a guy who has the good sense to play a bad guy in a good picture, you'll find it a fun movie. There are plenty of shots of gun play and explosions and a good mix of action and comedy. I don't have a lot of experience with Hollywood action films, so it was nice to see the same kind of thing that was done in the old B movies.   - June 29, 2007Moral  Reviewer: mrs. karstin - favorite favorite favorite - July 13, 2005  Subject: good movie I enjoyed the movie very much, it had some interesting aspects but I found it quite unrealistic.   I liked the "dirty" ending as well, as I did not find that ending realistic.   of course I enjoyed seeing some of the scenes of gun fights and such.   the ending is somewhat disappointing though as the ending seemed to me like it was going to be the end of the movie and the character didn't get what he deserved. I also found it interesting that the lead was in a gangster film, which also makes me wonder why this is a Hollywood movie.   and to finish this movie off, the character of Harry was great, and he did what he did well. The gangster scenes were really great.  - July 13. 2005good movie  Reviewed by: ryder - favorite - April 10, 2005
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Song" is a really fun, really well done movie. It takes place in a world that looks like it was ripped out of the 1970s, with the same characters as in the 80s, but a lot of time has passed since then. This is a tale of two love birds who find each other again, but when one falls in love with the other's ex, the story gets a little more serious. It's really funny, with a great lead actor, and I would love to see the story developed more. It could easily become a classic. This is an old, old, and very very old review, but I have a feeling that it is the only one I will ever need to write. I have not read a good book in a long time. I am a very lazy person and my memory is very poor. This movie is one of those rare ones that actually had a plot and characters I liked. I also had a very great time watching it. If you have a great time with a silly movie, this is the one to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the most beautiful and most sad movie I have ever seen. I feel bad for not having seen this sooner. It is a story about a boy who is adopted by a family that doesn't seem to know much about him and who doesn't know what he is, but he is good looking, and he does the right things in the world. He wants to be a rock star, he has a crush on a girl and tries to talk her into dating him, but she isn't interested. So he takes his frustrations out on the road with the help of his old band. I have been looking forward to this film for a while now. I just don't understand how anyone could make a film like this and get it distributed to us by the big chains. I don't know why I waited so long to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This is a movie that's very different. It's about the relationship between a woman and a young boy.  The film is set in a small village and the boy and the woman have a complicated relationship.  It's a film about what is right and what is wrong and the right way to behave.  This is the first film I've seen that really has a story about relationships and a boy and a woman.  I think it's one of the best films ever made and that's a big compliment to the director.  If you like love stories this is a great one.  Â The trailer is below. The Film:  This is a story of a boy called "Ludwig" and a girl called "Maggie" who's father is a German aristocrat and she's a young Englishwoman.  After being left on a farm by his father, Ludwig decides to live at the cottage of a wealthy Englishwoman in the country.  They get along well and Ludwig is happy, except for the fact that Maggie is very jealous of his love.  Her father is constantly looking for a way to get rid of her, but they have no chance with the Englishwoman and they get on in a row because of this.  When Ludwig's grandfather dies, he decides to move back to England, but when he arrives he meets a young girl called Lucy who is also a child of an aristocratic family and he falls in love with her.  She and Ludwig have a good friendship and eventually Ludwig asks her to marry him and she agrees.  He asks Maggie for her opinion about it, but she tells him that she thinks it would be better for the girl to marry a rich man.  Maggie is upset at this and decides to give it a chance.  Eventually the girl does marry a wealthy man, but at the wedding Ludwig is shocked when Maggie is wearing a dress that's made out of the same material as his own.  There's no love lost between the two, but Maggie does make a very important decision.  The Setting:    The movie is set at a country cottage where two children, Ludwig and Maggie, live.  Ludwig is the youngest and Maggie is the oldest.  Their mother is Margaret and they have an older sister called Lucy.  Margaret is very sickly and her mother's life is in great danger.  So the three children are sent to live with their aunt

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. It's funny and a lot of fun. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where the population lives on a very small piece of land that is protected from all natural elements by a large wall and a gate. The movie follows two children, one a boy named Bill and one a girl named Mary who is in love with Bill. It is the year 1986 and they are walking through the woods in a cart when a group of boys start to follow them. The boys are trying to kill Bill and Mary. They shoot a hole in the cart but it doesn't stop them. Mary falls in the hole but Bill is still alive. The kids get stuck and Bill climbs on top of a rock. He looks down and sees that his head is missing. He runs down the hill to the nearest town where he is met by the kids who tell him that the others are also gone. He sees a truck and is told to go into the truck. He gets in and they drive away but then they hear a truck back up behind them. They slow down and Bill realizes that the boy is not in the truck with them. He's hanging on the side of the truck! The truck starts to ram them but Bill gets up and the kids start to pull him down. The truck gets stuck and the group gets stuck as well. The children run to a truck in the next town and Bill and the others get out. They all walk around town for a bit. They get into a diner and order a burger. It doesn't look like they're going to get a burger because a giant creature from the ground emerges from the floor and starts to attack the people inside. Bill looks down at a giant monster and says, "Don't get eaten." The monster attacks Bill and he runs off. He is chased by the monster for a while but he manages to get to a bridge and jumps across. He lands in the water but he gets out and goes to the water's edge. The monster is chasing him again but he swims off into the ocean and goes swimming. A couple of days later Bill and some friends are walking along the shoreline when a huge wave hits them. Bill falls into the water and is picked up by a fish and carried away by the fish. The fish carries Bill to a big cave where Bill is taken to the land of the dead. He asks where he's going and is taken back to the cave. The cave is a
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I was so happy to see that the film that I watched a few months ago is now available in DVD format. I am really glad that they are putting the film on DVD. Â The story is very well told and the actors all give good performances.  The film is set in 1930 and is told from the perspective of a boy named Paul (Paul Bettany). Â Paul's parents were not in the best of health.    Paul's father (Christopher Plummer) was a poor man who worked at the docks and his mother (Jean Stapleton) worked in a factory that manufactured sewing machines.    They did not have a lot of money.  They could not buy a car.  The family did have a small plot of land that they would move to when they had enough money. Paul had always wanted to be an actor but he didn't have much talent at the time.  Paul went to a school called the Shakespeare School.  He didn't do very well in the school plays.  At the age of 14 Paul was sent to boarding school where he got the nickname "the Bitch."   The Bitch was a bit of a bad-girl.  She was loud, obnoxious and was really mean to others.  After a few years at boarding school Paul started a singing group called the Pussycats.  In the 1920s a group of teenagers formed a band called The Chiffons and they played a lot.  By the mid 1930s the group had started to play a lot more shows and in 1934 they played for a President of the United States.  When Paul was about 16 he had a heart attack and died.  As a result of Paul's death his parents decided to sell the land they had on the island and move back to London.  But Paul's sister (Meryl Streep) decided that she would like to stay in England and get a higher education.  So she applied to go to London University and be a teacher.  During this time she met a boy by the name of Michael (Drew Barrymore).  The two fell in love and got married.  Michael had an agent who would make a lot money from movie productions and also make money from selling a film to a movie studio.  This was the beginning of the movie industry.  Now it was Michael's job to sell films to movie studios.  I thought the film was very good.  There was
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie, and the cast.  The movie is good and I hope it is a sign that this is a new generation of good films coming from Hollywood.  If you have ever watched a movie in the '70s and thought to yourself, "what's the big deal?"  You have seen it all, like a long time ago.   The story revolves around two brothers and their two mothers.  The first brother is the older brother, and he lives with his mother, who is the most difficult mother I've ever seen.  She is a wild woman, and a true character, who has never seen anything like this in her life.  This is a good old fashioned family film, and it is quite an entertaining movie.  I like this movie because it is different from anything else you see from the '40s and '50s.  It is a great little family movie, a movie that has never been made by Hollywood since.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I don't think you could call a movie about a guy who is trying to save the world a comedy, but it is a very funny movie and if you like this kind of thing, you will love it. Â The story is about a computer scientist who is building a robot called a robot who is basically a man-in-a-box that walks like a man and talks like a woman.  He is called a "Pimp" and he has a mission to save his world from the evil computer scientist, who wants to take control of the world.    The story seems pretty simplistic, but there is an actual science fiction element that goes along with it.     As far as the comedy goes, it is quite light.  The robot is the main character, and he is pretty simple and uninteresting, and the only one that really seems to matter is the robot.  It is funny, but I don´t think it is very original.

The LastExorcism is a great movie that is more than just an excuse to get a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Boys on the Side" movie was a great comedy and even though I have watched the movie multiple times and it is the most popular movie about the boys on the side, it is not a good one.  I would not recommend it to anyone.    The "Bboys on the B Side" is a movie about two kids on the streets.  They are not doing anything wrong.  It is just the life they live.  But a little girl is kidnapped by a gang of thugs who take her back to the town of "B" where they start to teach her a new lesson.  The whole gang goes to school and then one of the gang takes a job as a waiter at a restaurant.  He meets the gang's leader and then they learn about the other gangs and how to defeat them.  Once they learn a lesson, the gang leader takes the girl to the train station where the gang is waiting.  Before the gang can get on the train, the police arrive.  Now the gang has to figure out how to get the girl back before they get caught by the police.  I thought the gang was funny, but the movie was too long.  There were no great special effects.  So I think this movie is a good comedy but not a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I didn't think much of this movie when I first saw it because it looked like the kind of film where they just put a guy in a costume and then throw a bunch of stuff at the screen. Â However, once I got over the fact that it was a bunch more of the same, I was hooked.  The story is about a couple who get to see an art exhibit by the man who invented the movie camera.    This is really a very funny film.  It is one of those films that you watch and then say to yourself "Wow, I just don't think I could ever get tired of seeing this guy on screen."   One of the things that I really like about this film is that it doesn't have a strong theme.  While there is a bit of an underlying theme that seems to be at the root of this film, the main characters are all the realists.  The guy who's name is Dr.  Ray Rector is an extremely eccentric man who has no problem showing off his bizarre inventions and talking to his wife in a strange accent.  There are also several characters who don't fit the typical movie stereotypes at all.  A lot of the people in this film seem to have some kind of strange mental illness.  This, however, is not the most important part of the film because the other characters who are completely un-funny and un-sane are also extremely funny.  So I really have to give this film credit for being more than a few things:   It's a really funny movie about people who are totally crazy.  If you like people who make things up as they go along and people who have a completely different sense of humor, you'll love this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â A really well done and well acted film. Â The film is based on the book Â 'Scooby Doo: A Spooky Mystery', written by Jim Henson.  The book tells the story of Scooby Dooley, who was once a regular little boy who was adopted by a dog.    He now lives in a house with his best friend, Shaggy.  The film tells the stories of Scoob, his best friends, the ghosts, and of course the Mystery Inc.  The story is told by the ghost, who calls himself 'The Hound', and his two human companions, the dog and the cat, as well as a dog called Fido.  Scooby is a really funny and interesting character, he is a great friend to Shag and is often the one who gets into trouble, but always gets out of it.  It is a good story that is very well done, and it is a nice addition to the Henson universe.  This is one of those films where you can't help but laugh.  There are a few scenes in this film that are so funny that I was unable to keep my hands off my mouth.

It is an odd, over-the-top, over the top comedy. The humor is pretty tame. The action scenes are pretty silly and are more than a little overdone. The plot is a mess. You don't even have a clear idea of what is happening. But the whole movie is ridiculous. It gets very strange and there is some pretty good acting. It would be a pretty good movie if you were not in for the comedy. It seems like the whole idea was just to try and be funny. It failed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love how they were able to make a bad movie good.  In case you don't know this movie is based on a book called The Legend of Bagger Vance which was about a soldier who was the son of a farmer.    He was raised by the farmer's daughter and they lived with her until the day she died.  In the death of her, Vance became the farmer son and had to go to war.  This was a pretty good movie and you can see how Vance became a soldier and the kind of person he was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched the entire movie multiple times. This is a very interesting film, and it really gives a good idea about how a nuclear bomb was made. The plot is pretty good. The whole movie was about the work of a man called John Kermode. He is a scientist who has the ability to create atomic bombs. He does this because he wants to prove that atomic bombs can be made from the same sort of material as the ones that he has used to create. So he has to take the work out of the hands of the scientists who are using the atomic bomb. This part of the movie is really interesting. It is also interesting to see how he was able to do this. There are some interesting characters in the movie. Some of the people he worked with are very interesting. He has a very eccentric personality. There is a scene in the film where the two men are in the middle of an argument, and one of them gets a small hole in his face. I thought this was a little funny. This film was a very good one. It gave a very nice idea about a nuclear explosion. It gives a real feeling of the effects that an atomic bomb can have. It shows how one of these bombs were used in the war, and also how they are used today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Hollywood in the 1950's is a place where the only rule is the one you have to follow: Don't get caught.   "Hollywood" is a movie about an actor who is accused of murder, in this case his friend who was killed.  The story is based on real events and is a true crime film. The real crime was committed by the brother of the actor, Jack Warner (the son of Warner Brothers owner Jules Warner). The Warner brothers were a big Hollywood movie studio in the 20's.  In this film, we follow the life of an actor named Roy Rogers, who was in Hollywood in the early part of the century.  He is married, has a young son and a wife that he falls in love with.  We see him on the set of a movie in which he is a part of.  After the movie, he goes back to his hotel room, and finds his wife's body in a pool of blood.  Roy is not to happy about it and goes to his friend, "Johnny" who is the head of the Hollywood studio.  Johnny tells him to go on the road and make some money for his wife.  Then, he is hired to make a film in which the actor is the star.  On the set, Roy finds a body of a dead man and the studio people tell him that he did it.  However, the people who found the body tell Roy that it is the man that he was supposed to have killed. This leads to a struggle between Roy and the people of the studio over who did it and who is to blame.  It is an interesting story and one that is very true to life.  You will be surprised at the true crime and true story that was in the movie.  Hollywood, the most famous film and entertainment complex in the world, is one of the oldest in the USA. It is also one of most influential film studios in the history of the film industry. The company's history dates back to 1910 and has been operating continuously since the 1920s.  Hollywood has produced the most important motion pictures, such as the "King Kong", "The Wizard of Oz", "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial", "Scarface", "Romeo and Juliet", "Pulp Fiction", "Catch Me If You Can", "Goodfellas", "Beverly Hills Cop", "Scary Movie", "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I had a single complaint about the film, it's that the film tries to make this a "dark" movie. But it's only about a black man who, when he was about 14 years old, was kidnapped and held hostage for several months. The only way he escapes is by a combination of luck and ingenuity.   But even if you know that's not the case, there's still a lot of tension. It's a tense film and it works well, as long as you know the character well and know the story before it begins.   of course, I don't have a problem with a film that tries to tell a scary story and succeeds in doing so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great little sci-fi adventure film with some great action sequences.  The film follows a team of explorers on a mission to find a new planet.  It's also a good story:  It's a good little story about a crew of explorers who are attempting to find the next planet in a strange new solar system.   They're searching for the "Eternal Sun" which they believe is a beacon of the "Planet of Light" that they believe exists in the same system. The plot is not very complex.  It is basically a space opera that follows the adventures of the crew.    The action is very good, and there are several space battles.  The movie is not a masterpiece, but it is a good adventure film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a man who was once a very important member of the American military, now retired and living alone. One day a fellow soldier appears to be an important personage and he is invited to a party at his home. There are also a couple of other guys, a nurse, a policeman and the wife of a wealthy businessman. At the party there is a strange woman who wears a uniform and carries a weapon. The man thinks it's an attractive woman, but she looks a lot like his wife. She is very rude to him. She makes fun of his poor eyesight and asks him to take her to a dance which she knows. He agrees and she seems to enjoy herself. The police arrive and the man is arrested. The wife and the policeman leave with the rich man and the nurse, leaving the man to go alone. The woman shows up and he thinks she is pretty. The party ends and he returns to his apartment. His eyesight seems to improve and he notices a new light in the sky. He notices an old man who seems to be looking for him. They are both in their late sixties and they have been in the same room for a long time. One time they were sitting on a bench when the old man was leaning on his cane and the old woman was looking down at her feet. The two had a strange exchange which was interrupted by a policeman who said, "You're not going anywhere now, Mr. Old Man."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie and I hope it is released on Blu-ray.   The story is a little hard to follow.  The beginning is hard to understand.  But once the movie gets going, it is wonderful.  There is no story, no music, no special effects and no special characters.  Just a beautiful story about a little boy who has an imaginary friend and a magical tree.  And I mean that literally.  I was so happy to see that they kept the tree and the tree had a real life counterpart, a real little boy named Jack who loves the tree.     It is a story about how the tree helps the little boy to forget the bad things that happened in his life.  He forgets the pain of being in an orphanage, he forgets all about the pain that was caused by the death of his mother, he has a good life with a wonderful wife and wonderful children.  He is happy.  Now the bad thing is that the tree never tells the boy the good things that it has done for him.  It doesn't want to help him because it wants to keep its power and to make more children. It wants to get rid of Jack, its old friend.  We also don't know where this tree came from.  In the beginning it seems that the people who live on the tree are a different race of people.  Why?  It just seems to me that the trees are different from us.  If it is not magic, then what is it?   This is not a fairy tale, it's a very strange and wonderful movie that I really love. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that shows a lot of different genres. I like the fact that the film is set in a bar, where the patrons are not really happy with each other, and are trying to find a reason to not talk about the fact they have been together for 3 years. The film has a great amount of comedy, and it is great to see a comedy with a cast that does not really get on, but all of the cast is amazing.  There is also a lot to see, including the dance scene that was shot on the roof of the bar.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â It's not exactly a surprise that The Last Exorcism (1968) is a decent horror film: it's an old, familiar story with a new twist. The story is told in three parts: an innocent man who has been killed and his spirit is being exorcised by a group of priests. The group is a bunch of weird, out-of-touch, older guys who seem to think that they can solve all problems with a bit of prayer. It's a bit like the original Exorcist (1973), but without the demonic possession. The film is set in a rundown town and features the usual suspects: the creepy priest, the sinister woman in the black dress, and the mysterious townspeople who know what is really going on. Â The Last exorcism is a pretty decent horror movie: it has all the classic horror tropes, including an evil demon, a crazy woman, and a small town that's really just a set-up for a bigger, badder story.  The Last Exterminator is a very good movie, and there's a lot of good ideas here. __________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great White" is a wonderful movie, and the production values are terrific, even with the poor dialogue, terrible special effects, and bad acting.  I loved the setting.    "The Great Geezer" is the Great White, a great white shark who has been around a long time.    He's a great White, and he's been around since the beginning of time.   "The Geezier" is his name, but he is known by a lot of other names.  He is the greatest hunter on the planet, and no one ever caught him before.    He's also the most famous shark in the world.  If he had a collar, it would probably be the one on a school bus.  It's said that a great geezer can live up to 100 years old, and there are a lot more geezers than sharks in the ocean.  There's a rumor that he's the ancestor of the great white sharks.

But, I know I'll be watching this for a long time to come.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A great movie with a great ending. This movie is one of my favorites. It was a very good movie. _______________ The movie starts off with a girl named Lorna. She is about 16 years old and she has been kidnapped by a man named James. James has a beautiful wife and a child that James is trying to raise. James's wife has always been an odd woman and she is about to get even by kidnapping the beautiful girl Lorn. As the movie goes on, we learn about Lorn's past and we find out that James was a young man that was abused. This is the reason James has chosen to raise Lorn as his daughter. We learn about the abuse James endured as a child and then we see the beautiful Lorn coming into her own. The movie ends with Lorn becoming a young woman and we see how she grows up and gets married. This was a good little movie with good acting. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie back in 2007, but it seems to be getting a new life now. I remember watching it back in my teenage years. The story is about a little boy who was brought up by his uncle to be a pirate and later in the movie his uncle died and the boy got a job working for a pirate ship. His ship was attacked by a giant ship with a huge gun that the boy had to shoot. He then took some of the treasure that the crew was hoarding. After he got back home he was discovered by his sister and uncle. The uncle died but the sister lived to be an old lady who was in a wheelchair and had a very bad cough. The boy had a new job working on the pirate ship with his new girlfriend, a girl named Elizabeth. They were trying to get the pirate treasure to Spain. But one day the pirates lost all of their treasure and the ship had to be abandoned. The ship was then abandoned. This is where the story takes a dramatic turn. The pirates are now in the hands of a group of cannibals and they plan to eat the boy and Elizabeth. Elizabeth then falls in love with the boy. But there is one more thing about the boy who is the main character. He is a giant man who has a very strong will. He will go to any lengths to survive. And the thing is that he is really good at fighting. This movie is so much fun and well made. There is a lot of action and great fight scenes. The movie was made in 2007 so it has aged very well. I think this movie is a must see for anyone who loves a good pirate movie. I loved it and now it is the movie I always go back to. I highly recommend this movie. It is so great and entertaining.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you don't know who Tom Hanks is, it's because you don´t watch enough movies about him.  You just need to look at a list of his most well known films: Cast Away, Forrest Gump, Catch Me If You Can, Castaway, The Da Vinci Code, Cast Away Again, The Longest Yard, The Perfect Storm, and so on.    I don't think you will be surprised that he is in another great film.  I really like this movie.  I've seen a lot of movies from this genre and this one is no exception.  It's a bit slow and there is not much action.  The best part of this movie is the ending and that's the reason why I rated it so high.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure how I didn't think of this earlier. This is a solid science fiction movie, with great visuals and a story that I found enjoyable. The main character is a former space marine who returns to Earth after his ship is destroyed in an alien attack. The attack has a clear military agenda, but the main character, who is a pacifist, isn't sure how he feels about it. It's a good science fiction thriller, with the occasional bit of humor.

Michael Myers is a killer who is brought to life through a series of disturbing murders.  It is hard to believe that this film was made in 1980.  Carpenter uses all the tricks he learned in 'Hitchcock' to create a chilling movie.  The film is well worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a bit of a mess, but there is a lot of fun to be had. It is hard to describe this movie, but to be honest, it's like watching a really old-fashioned silent movie. The only problem is that the movie doesn't have any sound effects.   I have to say that I was disappointed that the characters weren't all the way fleshed out in this movie. There is a guy who works as a waiter, and then there is the one who is the girlfriend of the waiter. She is a little too... flirty. I liked the waiter though, he has some kind of charm to him, and I liked his sidekick. The sidekick was a little short, but he had some funny lines. I have to give it a 4 because it had some fun scenes in it. I will certainly see it again!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only movie that is really worth watching is "Ragtime", it is about a small town, that is now gone, when a small boy called Joe returns to it with his father. Joe, the youngest, goes to work with his uncle and they have a fight about their father, Joe gets angry and kicks his uncle out of the house. Joe has to work at the factory that is next door, he is very intelligent and a good mechanic. The only good thing about Joe, is that he has the same sense of humour that the rest of the boys have. Joe is a bit of a tomboy, but he does not get involved in the trouble that the other boys are involved in.   In this story a woman, named Marge, is taken by the government to an island in the Pacific where she is kept for experiments and her life is saved. She has a son, named Joe, who is very smart and a great mechanic. Joe and Marge get married and live in a big house with the son Joe.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said, the only thing that bothers me about this movie is that the main character is a girl. Why is she a girl? I don't think she is a bad actress, but there is something about her that just doesn't seem right.   The reason why I like this movie the most is that it isn't one of those typical "girls and boys" type movies. It is actually one of the few movies that doesn't try to be anything special.  "We are all on the same team!"   I guess I can say that I really liked this movie, but the only reason I can give it a higher rating is because I know that it is one of them films that I will be watching again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Starring the two most memorable men in the world at the time, Stanley Kramer and Howard Keel, this was the most talked about movie in the country for many years, and it is one of those great movies that has the whole country talking. Kramer is a brilliant playwright whose play, "Benny and I," about two brothers who go into a dance hall to sing, has had a great impact on many, many people, including many celebrities. He has always been regarded as the best in his field. He is at his best here, playing an almost perfect man who is very generous to the people around him. The play is full of the kind of wonderful little incidents that are common in American life, and I always liked it. Kramer does a terrific job as the patriarch of the family, and his wife, a brilliant actress in her own right, plays a part which will be remembered. A great American classic."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic action movie with the most memorable villains ever made: Dr. Jekyll, The Creature (he looks like a demon) and The Red Devil. They're all great and you can't help but get into the movie with their character. The movie was directed by Mel Brooks and made in 1967 and has a strong black and white color palette. It's a fun film with plenty of action and lots of fun, especially for kids. I love this movie. I think it's the best of the Mel Brooks era and I've seen a lot of his movies. I don't remember it being as funny as some of his other movies but I still like it. I give it a 7/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is pretty straightforward: a group of young people (the only "family" on the planet, as far as we know) have been living together for decades. They're pretty close knit, and their lives are pretty normal. That is, until one day, they wake up to find themselves in the middle of a nuclear war.   It's hard to say whether or not you should be surprised by this plot point, since a) most nuclear war movies (like, say, A Christmas Story) are based on the premise that the entire world is going to die and the only survivors are these two kids, and b) a nuclear bomb was dropped on a city called Hiroshima on the day that the United States dropped a nuclear weapon on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.  But the story is interesting, especially when you think about it: is it even possible to live with such a large number of people living in such close proximity to one another?   Does that even make any sense?  There's not much to say about the characters.  The two kids (the boys and the girl) are pretty much the only two people left alive from the group who survived the blast. They each have a certain level of maturity and experience.  They are a bit over-sensitive to the fact that they are living with people who are totally different from them in every way: race, religion, gender, everything. It can be tough for them.  I like the idea of this film.  I also liked how they all seemed to really care about one another, even though they don't get along very well.  One of the main themes of the film is that it's okay to care about people you don't know, even if they are completely strangers.  It is possible to care for people even when they are utterly alien to you.  And that is something that is very, very rare in our society.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a beautiful film about how life can be beautiful even when you don' know anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about the life of a man named Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church. In 1820, Joseph was baptized by John the Baptist, who had an angel come and tell him about a golden bible in a stone box. He became a Christian, and after marrying Emma Hale, he started a new church in Palmyra, New York. He had a vision in the summer of 1828 in which he saw a mountain of gold and he could only get a glimpse of it in a dream. In 1830, Joseph married Emma, and he and his family moved to the town of Fayette, Illinois. In the summer 1836, a group of Mormons came to Fayette and established a new religion. Joseph and Emma became involved with the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, and they began to travel to Kirtland, Ohio. They then traveled to Nauvoo, Illinois, where they lived with the Smith family until the prophet's death.    The film is well made and a fun movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Â stars Gene Hackman, Jack Palance and Tony Curtis in a film that's not only a classic, but also a bit of a mess, in that Hackman's character is a little over the top, while Palance's character (though not bad) is kind of ridiculous. Â Hackman is a very good actor and he's just great in this role.  His performance is very well done and he really plays the role well.  Â Palance is just a bit too much.  His character is the kind of character that you would expect to see in a bad movie, and he is just not funny, but not bad either.  The Ugly is about the good guys who go to the ugly house to get some medicine and come back with the bad guys.  It's the classic western, with lots of action, some action scenes that are really good, and some very silly scenes, like the one where the bad guy goes out and puts a bullet in a lady's eye and then gets it back, or the one that involves a guy getting the bullet stuck in his shoe.  This is an excellent western that you should check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's pretty awesome to see a movie about a guy who was born and raised in the Midwest and the Midwest has it all: ice cream, beer, and corn dogs!  The guy who stars in this movie is a total hick, a real hick.  He grew up in a small town in Indiana and had a shitty childhood, but eventually found a way to overcome it.    In his early 20s he goes off to college in California and is not all that impressed with his surroundings.  He eventually decides to move back to the Midwest, and after a series of bizarre situations, finds a job at a small diner and a group of other friends.  Then the movie starts.  I thought the movie started out ok, but then it got really strange.  First the guy goes to his first football game and gets really excited about it. Then he goes to a football game in Chicago and sees some really odd things, like a guy with a mustache in the crowd who looks exactly like his father.  It's like he is from a parallel dimension.  This gets even stranger as he goes back to Indiana and finds that the local football team has a "fake" quarterback, who looks just like his dad.  The whole movie is really strange and it makes no sense.  My favorite scene in the movie was the guy who is a farmer who is trying to get a big crop of corn in the fields.  When he's trying to make sure that his fields are not trampled by other farmers, he uses a tractor to try to push his fields to the side.  Unfortunately the tractor breaks down and he gets stuck in the field.  His wife (his "girlfriend" in this film) is driving the tractor, so she gets out to help him.  And this is where the movie really got weird.  Her friend is holding a knife to his throat and he is just sitting there, not moving a muscle.  She asks him if he is okay and he just says "yes" and walks away.  So the farmer is stuck in a field and no one is there to help.  How did he get there in the first place?   Then we get to the end of the movie and the corn gets really high and the farmer decides to sell his corn to a local grocery store.  But there is a problem.  They only carry corn in plastic bags.  Why is this a problem?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a man who has a very good day, which he spent with his girlfriend. He gets up early in the morning, gets a haircut, gets dressed, and goes to work. He's the head of a huge department store and a good guy to work for. His daughter works there too. One day, a man comes in, and is looking to buy something. The man is a big-time drug dealer. He buys a gun from him. The owner of the store doesn't like this guy, and tries to get rid of him. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any money. So, he decides to make a deal. The guy agrees to sell him a huge amount of cocaine, which will give him a lot of money. But, this is no ordinary deal. If the guy doesn't do what the store owner wants, he will go to jail. So he does what the owner wants.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked  The Last Samurai, then you'll like this too.   It was directed by Akira Kurosawa.  I like this because I like Akira Kurofune and I like Kurosawas samurai movies, this is a good one.  This is a movie with a strong plot.  It is about the war between the Japanese and the Chinese, and the Japanese soldiers fighting the Chinese.  In the end, they get the upper hand.  Also, I love the samurai movies because they are really good and are really cool.  There is a lot of blood, which you can see in a few places.  The actors do a good job.  As for the characters, they are pretty good, and there is a nice mix of cultures.  So, if you like a good samurai movie, this one is a great one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an epic film. It starts with a shot of a woman in a house. The house has windows on all sides. The woman is sitting on a chair in the middle of the room. The camera moves from left to right to the right. It cuts from left and right to a shot that shows a woman sitting in the chair, staring at a window. The shot is moving left to the left. The film is then cut to a close up of the woman's face. The face is very close to the camera. Her eyes are open, and she is looking at a door. The door is a large glass door that has a red circle on the top. The next shot shows a red door on a far wall. The same woman, but a few feet further up. She is still staring at the door. There are two doors. A red door and a green door. She goes into the red door. This is the first door she enters. She looks at a woman. She walks to the door, looks at the red light and then enters the door to find the woman.   The woman walks out of the red room. She sees a green light. She enters the green room. There is a green circle in the center of the wall. A woman enters the room with a green lamp. The room is a circle.  She looks at one of the circles and then looks at her own face. She takes off her hat and puts it on her head. The scene cuts to the next woman, who is walking up the stairs. She passes a window that has the same green light that the first woman entered the room through. She turns around and looks at this woman. It is the same woman. The second woman passes the window. She then walks over to a door with a red light on the outside. The third woman walks in the door with the red lamp. She opens the door and walks out.    The woman turns to look at the woman she just passed.  They pass each other and then go to a red doorway. The red door leads to a green room and the woman sees a woman inside. The first woman enters this green room to find a green woman. They pass through the green door and then the door is closed.  The red room is cut to show the green woman, staring down at the green circle. She puts her hat back on and walks up the staircase to the red entrance.  Then she
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't like this movie that much.  But I didn't mind that much either.   This is a great little movie about a group of children who go on a trip to see the world, and their lives become intertwined with that of the people in a town that has been ruined by a series of murders.  The movie is pretty good.     There's not a lot of action in this movie.  But that's because there isn't much happening at all.  This is one of those movies that takes place in a fantasy world, so it's not surprising that the characters don't talk much, but the children are pretty interesting.  The two girls are pretty good at making their own adventures.  They go to a park, a lake, and then a castle to see if they can find out what the "Majesties" are doing.  If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings, you'll like this one.  There's no plot, but this is a very enjoyable little movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This film is a must see, it is very good. Â It is the only movie in my opinion that really shows what happens when you take a large group of people and throw them into a jungle.  The action and drama are great, Â they have been filmed with such accuracy that you will see the trees and the foliage changing and becoming more realistic.    There is a great scene where two girls are climbing a tree,  one climbs up the side and the other jumps from the side.  It is really cool to see what a tree does to its branches when it falls on someone.  The story is great, a guy gets lost in the jungle and meets a girl who is not so friendly and is in trouble with the authorities.  A helicopter is sent out to find them but it is too late.  After a series of incidents, the guy gets a job with the police and has to find the girl.  I think this movie is really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action, adventure and jungle. The Jungle Book is the first Disney film I have seen with a jungle that is not a forest,   It was a forest in a forest that is actually a jungle,  The Jungle Book  is a really good Disney movie.  Disney is doing something new with their films and this is the best I have ever seen.  There is a scene in the middle of the movie that is worth watching again and again.  When the main character,  Jack,  gets lost,  it is really great to see that they are actually in a jungle and not a jungle in a real forest.  This movie also is a very nice adventure that you have to see to believe.  My only real complaint about the movie is that I wish the movie were a little longer.  But it is a nice movie and a great adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'll be honest... I did not expect much from this movie. But, I was not disappointed. I liked the movie. It had its good and bad points. The good point is that I enjoyed it. The bad point is the ending. It's pretty much a bad idea to leave a film unfinished. I wish I could say that it was a good idea to end a film like this, but, that is just not the case. I am sorry that it ends this way. The ending leaves the viewers wanting more. I feel like I could have been more invested in the story. The only good thing about the ending is that it didn't end on a cliffhanger like a lot of other horror films do. I did feel a little bad for the ending of the film. It did leave me with a little feeling of "what if" and I did hope that the movie would continue on. Overall, I liked it. I would like to see this one again. It was a fun watch. It reminded me a little of the movie "The Blair Witch Project." I like that the story does not go in the direction of being over the top. It is not as over the edge as the movie might lead one to believe. I like this movie, but I do wish that they had not left the movie unfinished.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie!  You see a bunch of little boys all playing in a field and the girl is there and she's pretty, she has a big nose and a little red nose, and she is a bad ass.  She is the first one to try to kill the little boys. Â Â The kids are all running around, trying to get to her, and the bad guys come and they shoot at the little guys, they are all shooting at each other, and one guy is hitting the other guy over the head and hitting the ground, and he's trying to come up and shoot him.    Then she turns her gun on the little guy over there and he runs off and she shoots him.       The guy over here is on his back on the ground and he is still breathing, and it's obvious that he is going to die.  She turns her attention to the kid over there, who is still crawling away, but he is now pretty big.  Then she turns back to the little boy over there who is lying on his side, and is still alive.  She takes a bullet for him and he starts to die, she runs back and turns her fire on the bad guy over by the boys, who are still shooting at the other bad guys.  And she gets killed in the end!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is set in the world of "Futurama" which is a satirical satire about the future in a universe populated by people who are obsessed with being able to see the future, where people are either immortal or just not as good as the last guy they killed. It's about a scientist who is trying to discover a way to fix the future by going back in time to the point where he was created in order to see if he can fix things.   I love the idea behind the film, but the execution was not all that good.  There are a few scenes where the time travel is used to good effect and I enjoyed watching them, but overall the movie is quite mediocre and I did not enjoy it.  It's just not all there and the movie loses its way in the middle.  The story is pretty interesting and I was glad to see that the future is not as bleak as we are led to believe.  However, it does not end well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   "Bitch, I am your mother" is the theme song of the 1960s, and the film is a perfect example of the film genre. The film is about a couple who are just getting over their breakup when they get a visit from a former lover, who's looking for his missing wife. It's not too hard to guess the ending; the husband and wife are back together, but the film shows them as a married couple in love, not just a couple of divorced people who want to get back together. _________________________________________   This film is not just about divorce, although that is a big part of the story. It is a film about the lives of people who find themselves in a situation where they are forced to become their estranged exes. The wife is just trying to find her former lover (she doesn't know if he's even alive), and the husband is trying to get on with his life. There is no love triangle, or a love triangle that isn't a little too real for its own good, so it's not that much of a love story. I would have loved to have seen the wife find out about the ex's true identity and that she was married to another man. It would have been a nice twist. _________________________________________________________________________________________

The film is about a group of men who are looking for a new job, and are given a job by the local mob.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** If you're a fan of the original "Star Wars" films and are a fan to the "Jedi Knights", this is one of the better "re-imagined" films of the series. The original film was great, but the prequel "Star wars: A New Hope" was a disaster. This one is the first one that really took the characters from the original films and did something new with them. The characters are not the same, but they're still pretty cool. The actors are not great, like the originals, but their roles are better than the originals. This film is a pretty fun and good time. It is definitely a great start to the new trilogy. ********************
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film and a very good time was had by all. I found it difficult to follow the plot, the pacing was quite uneven. However, this film is about a young man who goes into the woods with a very small group of friends to kill a bear for sport. I guess that's pretty much what the movie is about. The story is very basic and simple, but it's a fun film. It has some decent acting and a good soundtrack. The ending of the film is pretty good too. This movie is great to watch with a big group of kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friend and I went to see a movie at a local theatre, a little more on the "family friendly" side of things, but not so far off that we didn't enjoy ourselves. I have never seen a more fun looking film out there. There are some great scenes, but what really caught my attention was the film's soundtrack, the songs being played as the story is told. The film takes place in a town called Alton, and the town's motto is "The City Without Walls". So you know you are going to get some good action scenes with all the guns and vehicles you'd expect to see in a Western. I really liked the film, it is a very enjoyable film.

The story is really interesting and there's not much of a plot. The only thing I can say that makes it interesting is the fact that the hero is a little boy, and the story seems to take place in his home town.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Exorcist" (1973) is a film that has to be seen in the most extreme way.  In this film, which is the second installment of the "The Exo-men" series, the "Devil" (the film's name) is an evil demon who lives in the Vatican.   He is the son of an angel and a devil, and his father, the Devil, is his only brother.  In his youth, the devil was an extremely good student, who wanted to be a priest.  He was so good that he was even taken to Rome, where he became the second of the two priests (the first was killed by a vampire).   The two priests became best friends.  The "Devill" became more and more powerful.  And then, one day, the two gods and the devil meet in the middle of a storm, and it's then that the devil realizes that the man he's been worshipping is his father.  The devil is the only brother left, and he is so afraid that he has to kill the two heroes.  This is a very disturbing film that requires a lot of patience to understand.  There is no easy way to interpret it, but it's not hard to understand how such an evil character could become a priest in the first place.  I think this film is so disturbing because it's a film about the evils of human nature.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you're interested in the background of this movie, I'll tell you a little bit about myself: I'm a former Marine who fought for the American way during the Cold War. I was in a helicopter crash during the Vietnam War. After the war, I served in the Navy for a while, then I became a policeman. During this time, I was involved in a number of police shootings, the most famous of which was that of a black man who had been arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. A cop pulled up next to the car and the man got out and began firing at the officer, who was standing next to his car. The cop had to pull out his sidearm and shoot the man in the back as he ran to the other side of the car. This was the last time I ever had to shoot someone. It was the most memorable event of my life. This is how I learned to be a good cop.   The movie takes place during the 1980s. The story revolves around a small town, named Rodeo, in the western part of the United States. The movie is about a sheriff, a deputy, and a young girl who is an orphan. One night, a young man is shot and killed by a man he had just robbed. The police arrest the man, and it turns out that the man had been the one to rob the store, and had a knife that the officer had not seen. The policeman is now on a case, and as he and the deputy are out looking for the man who shot the man he sees the girl running down the street. The girl is terrified, and he goes to her to calm her down. As they talk to her, the girl tells the deputy that her name is Lila, and that she was taken from her mother. She asks the deputy to help her, and the sheriff agrees to help. The next day, the police are searching for the girl, but the girl runs away, leaving the police with a dead body. The deputy then decides to search for Lila and finds her running down a hill, and they go together.   "This is how you do it!"   As the movie progresses, the story gets more intense and you can see the real pain that these people are going through. It's not easy to watch, but it's a movie that I recommend. It is a film that has a heart, a soul, and will make
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Jurassic Park" is one of the great movies ever made. It is a science fiction classic about a young boy, Michael Crichton (Tom Hanks), who is hired by Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to find the dinosaurs that are running around the American Midwest. They end up in a theme park that is the only thing standing between the dinosaurs and the world. Michael finds himself in the middle of this huge struggle between the good guys and the bad guys.  It is a very good film and very funny. I think it would be great to do the same thing with the dinosaurs.  "JURASSIC PARK" is the third installment in the Jurassic Park franchise.    The first two films were directed by Steven Spielberg, who also co-wrote the script with Jane Goldman.  The third film is a remake of the film "Jurrasic Park", which is also a remake.  This is a much better movie, and is more faithful to the original story.  It is interesting that the Jurassic park is so much bigger and more impressive in this film.  Instead of a theme-park that is all set up and then the park gets overrun by the dinosaurs, it is more like a gigantic zoo.  There is a big exhibit in the zoo that has the dinosaur specimens.  And it is a lot more impressive than the dinosaurs in the previous film. In this film the dinosaurs are the main attraction, and they are a lot bigger and scary.  I don't know if I would recommend watching this film as a kid, because the movie is a bit too scary for my children. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a man with a very special talent who was sent to a distant land in order to save the world from the evil that lurks within the castle. It's a rather odd story with a rather unique setting. The only thing I can really say about this movie is that it's a fun ride, but a very strange ride at that. The movie starts out very strange, as the story begins with a young boy named Riku, who is trying to save his mother from the clutches of a monster. We are told he was raised by a wizard and that his father was a wizard too. His father died in the attempt to save a princess named Satsuki, who was being held hostage by a demon king, and it is Riku who is supposed to save her. The film starts off by showing us some of the people in the world who are under the control of a wizard. We see the wizard who controls the world and is in charge of making sure that everyone is in perfect health and that they do whatever he says. We also see that Riku's father, who died in a battle against a demon, has been reincarnated as a human being who lives in a small village. It is here where Riku learns a great deal about himself. He is given the task of killing the demon king and bringing Satsuki back to her human form. It isn't long before we learn a few of the things that make up Riku. He's got an odd ability that allows him to change the shape of his body into the shape that he wants to be in. It appears that he's able to see into the future as well as to make himself invisible. It also appears that when Riku goes to sleep, he can be seen by the people he sleeps with, which he explains is because he can only do this while he's sleeping. This ability is the key to defeating the demon. It becomes apparent very quickly that Raku is no ordinary boy. He has a knack for the dramatic, and he is quick to act. He also has a tendency to speak in riddles and to tell stories, which may also have something to do with the fact that he is a wizard that can see into people's dreams. It takes some time for Riku to come to grips with his special abilities, and this takes the movie a little longer than I had hoped it would. We spend most of the film in a very mysterious setting where Raku and Satsuki

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main protagonist, Kōta Izumi (Eren Jaeger), is a rather ordinary guy who doesn't have much in the way of distinguishing features. He is a member of the Survey Corps, a group of young adults who are tasked with protecting humanity. This is a fairly common set up in most anime. The show starts off with a series of scenes where Kōya and his friends (the group of four boys) are training together. As the training goes on, the show gradually focuses on the boys' individual growth and development, showing a different side of the members as they develop into mature men. The development in the show is pretty good. I can't say too much about the character development as the show does a good job with it. It also doesn't seem like there is much in it. I don't have any strong opinions about the plot either, and the fact that it is mostly action-oriented doesn't really make it stand out as something special. As a whole, I really enjoyed the show.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must see movie, I am a big fan of David Fincher. I'm surprised he hasn't made more movies like this. The movie is a psychological thriller with a very different story and it's really fun.   The movie has an eerie tone to it.  It doesn't really make a huge impact but it does keep you on your toes, the suspense is great.  The action is done with a lot of flair and Finchel doesn't hold back.  He even brings in the classic "twist of fate" by having a woman get kidnapped by a serial killer, but he's smart enough to use that to his advantage.  Finchen doesn't shy away from any type of horror. There are a lot scenes that make you feel like you are in a nightmare. The action scenes are great and it is scary.  If you like the classic Finchers then you'll love this one.

She is a serial killer. The woman has been killing children since she was a little girl. She only has one rule. "Kill the children first".  She is known as The Butcher. There are several scenes where K. S. kills a child and Astrids is there. The scenes are very well done. It is clear the children are terrified and scared and the mother is just as terrified. The ending is a bit strange. I don't know why. But it is a very good movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was good, but the plot was ridiculous.  I don't think it's the fault of the actor, but they were trying to create a story that didn't make sense.    The movie is about a girl named Sara who has a pet dragon.    She's also a psychic, and it's her special gift that she can read people's emotions and read their intentions.  The Dragon was a bit of a goofball who loves to show off his powers.  He is a total loser and has a weird sense of humor.  When the story begins, the Dragon has a bad dream in which he meets a woman named Marceline who also has a psychic gift.  This sets off an odd relationship between the Dragon and Marce line which causes him to realize that he may have a gift too.  There's a bit more to this movie than meets the eye, and I don't know how the story will end, but I'm glad it ended up being a fun little adventure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am so glad I went to this one! The plot is simple, yet very well done.  It is a story about a couple of young people who run a very good restaurant in the city of San Francisco. They do not do very good and their customers are very poor. They have to try and get their customers to come back to their restaurant because their customers want to be near their place of business. One day the owner comes home to find a delivery man in his house, he is upset and asks the owner why did they have to do this?  He was not expecting a delivery boy.  The delivery boy was a nice guy, and a very nice man.  He asked him if he could make a delivery to a hotel for him.  This was done and the delivery boy left the restaurant and got a ride to the hotel.  Soon the owner was very excited to see the delivery man again and asked him to bring some food to his house.  Later that night the owner is having a good time and when he goes to bed he asks his wife if she wants to take a nap.  She does and the next day the delivery guy comes and brings his food.  When the owner sees the food he is so excited and happy to see his delivery boy he tells him to take him back to the restaurant to see how he did.  At this point the deliveryman is so thrilled to see him he forgets all about the restaurant.  As they get to the door he gets nervous and says "What is going on?"  The owner says "I want you to drive back to my house" the deliveryboy says "You can't go back, you need to get here in two hours."  The owners wife says "No, no, no...we are staying here."  When they get there she says "We are so glad to see you."  He says "Oh really, thank you so much.  You know how important it is for us to see each other."  She says "Well, you better get back to work."  The delivery boy says "Let me go get a box and come back."  As he walks out the door the owners wife is screaming "You better get in the car!  I will be waiting for you."

The movie is about a young girl who goes through a tough time and the only person she can turn to is her sister who is a nun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when it first came out. I thought it was a good flick with a lot of good jokes and a lot that I remember. This movie is one of the most popular in the franchise. I think the movie is worth watching if you like the franchise but I didn't like it much. The movie is a comedy and not an action flick, the characters are not the best in the series but it has a lot to do with how the director has handled the movie. It was made with a sense of humor and I thought the movie was very good and funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good. I had seen the first two films in this series but never the third and never this one.  I would suggest this to anyone who loves great stories about the paranormal, the supernatural, and just the weird.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young woman, who had been born and raised in the North, and who had come to the South for the first time in her life, had gone to the movies to meet her friends. It had been a Saturday night, so the theater was pretty crowded. They were sitting around a big wooden table in a dark movie theater. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, an old man, who was sitting next to the woman, was suddenly killed. He was a rather tall man, with a round face, a large, bushy mustache, and a rather sad look in his eyes. He looked up at the woman with a sad look on his face, and said: "I love you so much, Ma'am. You're a beautiful girl, and I just loved to see you." Then he jumped up and ran out of the theater. The woman and her friends looked at each other and laughed. They said: That's all right, we've seen enough movies. (from The Unspeakable)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Saving Private Ryan" is a masterpiece. The screenplay is an ingenious and moving tribute to the American soldiers who gave their lives for their country. The film has an interesting narrative, a realistic portrayal of the war, and a wonderful soundtrack. The acting is good, with Tom Hanks as the title character and Val Kilmer as his commanding officer, William "Billy" Ryan. There is nothing really special about them, but their performance is impressive. The performances of the other actors are also very good. Robert Duvall is a fine performance as a POW, and John Malkovich as a German officer is also a fine actor. The most memorable performance in the film is probably that of Robert Duval as a GI who was captured in France. He was never going to win the hearts of the American troops. The movie is very good, and if you are looking for a good war movie, you should see it. The soundtrack is good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good and has some really good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie which does not try too hard and does not fall into cliches.   This is a film of the mind of a man who has lost all of his friends and family and has come to a strange land in the hopes of finding some peace.  The story begins in the midst of the American Civil War.  There is a young boy named John Wilkes Booth who is a spy and a member of the Confederate Army.  This was written in the early 20th century and was a major success and has since been used as a film for many years.  It is a great time in history and a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife is a HUGE fan of the 80's and she has been watching this movie since she was a child. She told me that she was able to go to a store in Florida and buy a new pair of shoes. Well she went to the store and the woman there asked her if she wanted a new shoe or a new foot! She asked for a new toe and the shoe lady pointed to the big toe of her shoe. She asked her what size she wanted and she pointed to it. The woman said she would have to get the size 10 if she was to wear a 10! She went home, changed her shoe size, bought a new boot and went back to the shoe store to get a new heel! Well that night when she went into the bathroom she said the big toes of her boot were completely worn out! It was a terrible feeling! This movie is very funny and has a lot of great scenes. It's a great movie to watch in the morning or in the evening with your friends. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the 80s!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic movie from the 80s about a guy who travels back in time to stop a terrorist attack that killed his wife and child. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and still love it. The story is really well told, and the performances are top notch. The best part about the movie is that the terrorist attack was actually inspired by the assassination of President Kennedy, and it is actually a real thing that took place. I love that they had the time travel technology available back then, and that the guy who was supposed to be the one to stop it was actually an alien. I also love the fact that the alien is so cool, and he even has a cool helmet that makes him look like a lizard. The movie is filled with so much cool stuff like this. I always loved the fact the guy was a pilot, but I think I'm more of a fighter pilot. This movie is also full of references to other movies, like the first Indiana Jones movie, and so on. The last part of the movie was really cool. I loved the ending, and I thought it was great. It also has a great ending for a movie that is supposed to have a very cool ending.   This movie also has one of the coolest opening credits of all time. It really puts you in a good mood. The music is also very cool. It has the kind of cool music that is really catchy. The actors in this movie are great, and they all do their job well.

And an ending that was nice. I didn't know what to think. I just watched the movie and I can't say much about it. I can say that it was a good time. I'll give it a 3.

It is a good enough movie and I don't think there is any way I can dislike it.  There are a lot of things I would have done differently but I think that is not the movie's fault, I think it is the director's fault for making a film like this.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an absolute masterpiece. I love it so much that I don't think I can say anything negative about it.   The movie is set in a futuristic world where the government is run by an evil machine named "The Machine".   He is also the head of the military.  And he wants to destroy the human race.  To do so he uses various machines to destroy people, but he gets a new machine that can also destroy people.  This new machine is a man named "Aldous", who is the head writer of a science fiction magazine.  He uses this machine to help him write a story about a world where humans are all exterminated by an alien force.  The machine has his own agenda and plans, and his plan is to get revenge on humanity.  I have to say that the film is fantastic. It is a futuristic movie set in an ancient world with a good sci-fi vibe to it. The cast are all very good, and I think that they could all get more roles in this movie.  A good film, with an interesting plot, but also a good amount of laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie!  The film is set in a small town in the South, but it is a small place, with a big history.  It is where we find ourselves now, just after the Civil War.    One of the men, a Confederate Lieutenant named Robert E. Lee, was captured by the Union forces in 1861.  He was taken to the "Forty Acres", where the Civilians, mostly freed slaves, held him in chains.  Lee refused to leave, and died shortly thereafter.  We then meet the new President, a man named "Jefferson Davis".  He is a man who will do anything to keep his job.  The town's population is divided by the war.  One side supports the Union, and the other side supports Jefferson Davis.  There is an old woman, a black woman, who has a farm of her own.  She is very proud of the Confederate Army, and tells the story of how she fought with the soldiers, and how the Union soldiers tried to kill her.  As a result, her husband, who was a Union soldier, died.  It is a great movie, but a sad one.  I really like the music in this movie.  They have the music for each of the soldiers.  A great way to start a movie, and a great way for the audience to feel like they are in the midst of the Civil war.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Barely Legal" is a fun, entertaining movie.  This movie is about a man who wants to become a "legal assassin", so that he can rob and kill people without getting caught.    "Barelly Legal" features two of my favorite actors, and a cast of characters that I always like to see.  "Mister X" is an interesting character, who wants nothing more than to be a hero, but is just a little too timid to take his first big step.  In addition, I think that "Mr. X" deserves a little more screen time, because he is just an entertaining character.  It was a nice surprise to see "Lethal Weapon" star Dennis Hopper, who plays the main character in "Berely Legal".   The music of "Barry Lyndon" is the same, but it is much more powerful, and more powerful to me.  The movie starts off with a man named "Mr X" robbing a bank, and being taken into custody by the police.  Then he is sent to the city jail, where he is being held.  He is in prison for a long time, before he is released, and is asked to join a team of killers.  They are to kill some criminals, and they are to get paid a small amount of money.  Unfortunately, "Bearly Legal", ends with Mr. X being killed by a policeman, and the rest of the team members getting arrested.  After the movie, you might not think that this is a very good movie, but I promise that you will enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I think that it is quite possible to have a good time in the company of a certain Mr. Gumb, even though his character is so unpleasant and so completely without dignity." --from the review of this film  I'm not really sure where to start, but it seems to me that there's a lot of film that was made with the intention of making a good joke out of a bad situation. It's a bit like "Crocodile Dundee" and "Caddyshack". If you like these films, you'll probably like this one, too. The jokes don't hit as hard as those of those other comedies, but I'm willing to bet they'll hit you in the funny bone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say enough about the movie! It's a fun and funny movie with lots of action! The movie starts with a guy (Tucker) who is trying to find a lost dog.   The movie then goes to some other guys (who are actually the owners of the dog) who are trying to protect their dog. Tucker and the others then try to find out where the dog came from and why they are all lost.  The plot is great, you can tell that the actors and director were very dedicated to making the movie funny and good.  This movie has a great cast of characters and the action scenes are great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In all honesty, it's a little bit of a disappointment when you first hear about this movie. A little bit because I thought it was going to be a great action movie. It wasn't. It's a great movie with great action, but it's also a bit of an oddity. It didn't come out of nowhere. This movie started out as an original story. It was based on a popular Japanese manga series called "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki", which is about a kid named Nao who has a dog named Pippi who is really smart, but also really weird. The movie is very silly, but the humor is just as well done as in the manga. This is a pretty simple story, but there's a good dose of comedy in it. I loved how the character of Nao is constantly getting into trouble, but when you get her into a situation, you just have to laugh at the ridiculousness of it. It doesn't make it any less silly, and it doesn't come off as cheap. It also doesn't hurt that the acting is really good as well. It just doesn't seem to work that well in this movie, and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just the writing style? I think it's too much of a departure from the manga, but I liked it more than I thought I would.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. I have never seen it before, but I can't wait to see it again. This movie has a great ending. I also enjoyed the character development. I feel like it could have been even better, but the ending was great.   The story is set in the late 60's and early 70's. The film was made for an American television series called "The Lone Gunmen" which aired from 1969 to 1972. The show was a parody of westerns and spy movies, so it is a bit silly at times. The Lone Gunman is a former CIA agent named David "The Gunman" Carver. He is hired to protect a wealthy banker from assassins and hired goons who are trying to get him to reveal the bank's secret stash of money.  What really makes this movie is the character of Carver, who is a good guy who is forced to do some questionable things for the sake of his family. Carver is a really good guy, and I would have enjoyed seeing more of him if the story had gone further. I did like that Carver was not afraid to stand up to the goons that were trying to kill him. This guy is not the type of guy to just be killed in the street like some of the other characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie and I have to give a special thanks to the Director for making a film with such originality and style.  It is the first time I have seen a movie about a woman who is a professional fighter in the world of the world's strongest fighters, but she never wanted to become a fighter.  She always knew that it was only a job.  But then her boss decides to hire her to fight the greatest fighter in history, Bruce Lee.  The whole movie is about the fight between Bruce Lee and the women of the Hong Kong.  I think that the movie has a nice balance between comedy and action, and it is a good fight film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought I'd like the movie but it wasn't bad at all. I didn't expect anything special from it but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know why I didn�t like it more than the last one. The first half was pretty good and then it fell apart. I would have loved to have seen a different ending to the movie. I know it wasn�t much of a movie and it only had about 30 minutes to be really good. It�s not a bad movie but a bit of a disappointment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's a very interesting story about a man who has been in prison for ten years for a crime he did not commit. When he is released he is asked to take part in a research study on how humans perceive the world around them. He becomes intrigued by the subject and soon realizes that his perception of the world is very different than the rest of the human race. He begins to experiment with his own perceptions of the past, present and future and he begins to learn about human psychology. His research soon becomes much more than an experiment. The story becomes much deeper and more personal as he realizes that not everyone is as good as he thinks he is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a good film.  A nice story, a good character, and a good cast.    I was a little disappointed in the ending, but it's a small price to pay for such a good flick.  3 out of 5 stars I can see a lot of potential for this movie to be a hit, but I don't think it quite does that.  The plot is fairly straightforward, but the movie feels somewhat tacked on.  It seems to take a couple of episodes to get going, and the characters don't quite come to life.  I think this is due to a few things.  One is the story being told, but even the story that is told doesn't really work.  If you have any interest in this story, you should just stop reading now.  Secondly, I think the actors playing the parts aren't quite good enough.  They're not bad, but they aren't great either.  Maybe they'll be great in future installments.  But for now, they're just OK.  Overall, I'm not a fan of this movie.  A few people may find this interesting, but not me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen this yet, do so now.   I'm a big fan of old films and especially old comedies. This movie is very much like a modern day version of the classic screwball comedy.  This movie stars Paul Newman and Faye Dunaway as two old friends who take a trip to a country inn to take a break from the grind.  The movie has a great mix of comedy and action.  Paul Newman has a wonderful role as a guy who wants to be famous. He's a big talker and a very self-confident man who has a lot of fun in this film.  Faye Duncan is a great character as a young girl who is looking for a place to call home. She and her best friend (Joan Allen) travel to the country inn where they meet up with the old folks who live there.  Dunaway's character is the only one who doesn't seem to be having fun in the movie. She's the only character who is a little unbalanced.  There are some great laughs in this movie.  I think it's a good way to get some action scenes in a little comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of horror movies, and some really good ones too, but none of them are as good as this one. It is a very simple story, and there is not much to say about it. It's an extremely violent movie, with a very disturbing ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen this movie before, and for that reason, I can't say I'm a big fan of this movie. It has a lot of similarities to "The Godfather" and "The Sopranos" (in the best way possible) - it's set in New York, it's a mob movie, and it has a big bad character. The movie has a nice pace and the story is interesting and enjoyable, especially since the gangster who tries to murder one of the family members is played by a guy who is not afraid to get up close and personal with a human being. It's a shame that the actor who plays the lead is not in this movie (although he was in "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly") because he is a good actor and he should have made a better job of the role.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new generation of filmmakers has been born and the new crop of films are just as good, if not better than their predecessors. The original is a little dated and lacks a little punch but is well worth a watch for a classic film that still holds up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story follows a pair of brothers who travel the country looking for their long lost mother. The story is pretty typical of the type of movies I watch on a nightly basis, with the brothers getting in fights, the one brother trying to get a girl to fall in love with him and then trying to help the one who's trying to do the same. There are a few times I had to chuckle at the stupidity of these characters, for example when one of the brothers finds a woman who's been missing for a month and thinks she may be their mother. He and his brother have been looking for her for a while, but the woman they're looking for is a real whore and doesn't even know where her mother is. It's like someone took a group of brothers and made a movie out of it. This is the only film I've ever seen where the "bad guys" are not only portrayed as incompetent, but actually evil people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a couple who decide to move to an isolated, almost wilderness-like town. One of the townsfolk, a local woman named Rita, is a strong, independent woman. She takes a job at the local hospital, where she has to deal with many cases of heart attacks. The other, the town's sheriff, is much like a stereotypical, old white guy. He doesn't speak much and is a bit of a jerk. However, he has the respect of the town, and it's not hard to see why. I found the acting quite good in this movie. The only thing that kept me from loving this movie was the story itself. The movie was a bit confusing, and the ending didn't really add up to me. However it is still a good time for a movie and a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* ******************** ********* This was the second feature film by the French New Wave, but the first one was an early film, produced and directed by Pierre Berton. Berton was very popular in France in the 1960's, with his films being screened all over the country, and with the French Film Institute's "Démograph" series, which followed him and the films that he was involved with. This was one of the films he worked on, and I loved it, even though it was a little short. **************************** ******************* ****************** This was a very interesting film. The movie was set in Paris during the 1970's.  A group of women were at a disco when a man came in and began to dance. Â The women were shocked, as they were not used to such a thing.    In the following scenes we see the man trying to seduce these women.  There were a few bad lines, as well as a few very funny lines.  The story is a little too complicated for my tastes, and this was probably the reason for my dislike of it.  This is a movie I think I would watch again, as I liked it very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a very good feeling about this movie. It's the perfect balance of drama, mystery, and action. The plot is so well done, there are so many things to think about, and so many different ways of solving the mystery. There's an awesome suspenseful scene in the car when the woman sees her sister in the mirror and the police are searching the house. Then we cut to the cops walking down the road and I swear that a real person could have walked out of the woods that day. I'm not even sure what happened. It was a great scene and a great action scene. There were lots of great characters in this movie: The FBI agent who's been on the case for a while. The cop who is just trying to keep up with the action and the woman who is the victim. The housewife who has had her eye on this man all along and who finds herself the victim of a brutal attack. The FBI Agent who is on the trail of the murderer and who is forced to work with a killer he knows. There are lots of good people in this film, and the action scenes are spectacular. The only thing that I don't like about this film is the music. There is so much noise that it's hard to focus on the story and the characters. It might be too much music for the kids, but I can see why people like it. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie a few years back and it's been on my to watch list for a long time.   A young boy, Ben, is about to turn 15 and he is the last of his family to have a job and is working for a small firm that is run by a rather pompous old man. Ben is the only child, so this isn't a difficult situation for him, he has grown up in a loving home and a stable home. He has had no reason to doubt his father's judgement, but the old man has no reason at all to trust Ben either. The old man is obsessed with Ben, the way he looks, his friends and the things he does. He knows that Ben is a good looking boy and wants to have Ben as a protege, but Ben is more interested in the more intellectual and artistic things that the old fellow is interested in. The more Ben learns, the more he finds out about his father.  When Ben learns of his father having been in a failed marriage for most of his life, he goes to a dinner party with a few of his friends. Ben and his friends are a pretty boring bunch, the older one is more of a scholar and the other two are just pretty plain boys.  As the evening goes on, Ben gets more and more bored with the old gentlemen's antics and starts talking to one of his best friends.  Ben's friend, a boy of about 15, is named Dave, and he likes Ben.  Dave is about as intelligent as Ben is but he has a strange obsession with Ben's girlfriend.  It's obvious that Dave is trying to get Ben's attention by being friendly with him and talking about the girl that Ben loves. Ben starts to fall in love with the girl and soon finds himself in a relationship with her.  After a couple of years, Ben is almost a man in his own right and is going to take a position as a secretary for a very wealthy man.  This is a great start to a movie.  Unfortunately, Ben's love for his girlfriend doesn't go anywhere, but he doesn't have to.  There are other boys at Ben's school who want to get with Ben. There are also a couple who want Ben to be their protege.  These other boys are really dumb and have no idea what they are doing.  The boys who want him to be a protegee have no clue that Ben will take the job, and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. _____________. _______________________. _______.   The film is all about the way the "fence" (a "fairy" is a fence, not a wall) around the house is constructed. The owner is a man who lives in a treehouse, and who is a big fan of the fairy tales. One day he gets a knock at the door and a fairy comes and asks for his daughter. When he tells her about the fairy she doesn't believe him. So he gets his daughter to draw a picture of a fence and he tells the fairy to build it. So the fairy builds the fence. The father has a plan to make it look real and to make the fairy work. But the fairy is having none of it. He's also going to get the daughter to marry him and take care of his children. So things go wrong and the fairy has to build a ladder to get out. That doesn't work and then he has to run to the roof of the house to get his ladder. The ladder takes him out of the roof and he's stuck in a very big tree with no ladder and no way to get back up.   a very bad movie that makes a poor hero out of a very stupid character.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I just came back from a week long vacation and I am ready for another film! Â This is a fun action movie with plenty of action!  The only problem is that I can't stand the villain (David Arquette) for the most part.  It's hard to believe he was supposed to be a bad guy but he's so annoying and over the top!  A good action movie and it's good to see a good hero!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first heard that the third "Wizard of Oz" movie was about a flying cow, I was skeptical. I don't know about you, but I have never been a fan of flying cows, although I did see a few of them in my childhood. That is until I was in the library of a library in Texas, when I saw a flying cattle. I must say I was really impressed with how well it worked. It was quite funny too. The story of a flying Cattle Mutt in the Oz movie was pretty good. I thought it was a little too long, but the end was a nice surprise.  I liked that the Wizard was the one to save the flying cow.  What else can I say about this movie?   I enjoyed the movie, but it didn't have anything that blew me away like the first "Witch Hunt".  I thought that the film had a few weak scenes. I was also disappointed with the fact that the movie didn't really get in to the main plot.    This is probably the weakest of the Oz movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like a good horror movie, you will like this one too.  The story is not that original and is not very original at all, but this is what the movie is about, and it's a good thing that it is.  The movie is told from the point of view of a young man (who is named David) and his family, which consists of his parents, two younger brothers (who are named David and Mark) and a dog.    The story is told in a first person narrative and the events that are related are all based on real life events.  In the beginning, David is a happy, playful kid.  He and his parents have a great relationship and David is always on his best behavior.  At the age of 7, he gets into a fight with his mother (who has a habit of hitting him) and that night, David gets a scar that looks like a knife wound.  As a result of this, David loses his best friend Mark (who David was very close to) and ends up at a mental institution where he has to live alone.  And that is where the movie begins.  It is a nice story with a simple premise that is very effective in setting the tone for what is to come.  The movie's director, Robert Clouse, is an accomplished horror director who uses real life incidents to set up his scares.  There is no over-the-top gore or gratuitous violence, but there is plenty of it.  Most of the scares are real and they are effective.  I also like the fact that the movie doesn't spend a lot of time on David's family, but rather focuses on David himself.  This is a great way to keep the movie grounded in reality and keep things interesting.  When I first heard about this movie, I was a little skeptical about the premise, but the more I watched it, the more impressed I became.  Even though the movie has a pretty standard horror premise, I still think that it worked very well.  But this is a movie that is best enjoyed after you've seen the other films in the series, so if you haven't watched them yet, I would recommend you do so.  If you like the Paranormal Activity series, you'll like this too.

The story is well written, the actors are great, the cinematography is gorgeous and it is definitely worth the price of admission. It's one of those films that will leave you wanting more and it does. The movie is so different from the first one, it's very funny, so it's a great addition to your DVD collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I love that the first part of this film is in an open field with a car, a tractor, a horse, and a dog.   And it looks like a nice, quaint, rural place.  The main character (who is played by an incredibly handsome young man who looks like he's going to be a really good actor) is driving through a farm when he meets a woman (played by a very pretty and very young woman).   When they're on the road they make some sort of small talk, and then he asks her if she'd like to go for a walk.  Then the film switches to the other direction, where the man (played in a very dramatic way by a young man) is in a cave and talking to a woman.      After a little while, the woman (who seems to be around the same age as the main character) is going through a series of weird, bizarre visions, including a scene of a man having his head cut off.  She sees a woman with a horse and a tractor who has a big head.  After this she is told that her baby is going to have a head too, and she decides to have the baby.  I thought the film was great.  It has a great deal of action, a beautiful movie-within-a-movie feel, and the story is very good.  And I think it would have been even better if it had a little more time.  (By "a little more" I mean like, "a couple of more minutes.")  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have never seen a movie this good. I really don't care about any of the characters other than the two main ones. I think the story line is great. There are so many things going on that you won't know what is going on until you see the movie. It is a great movie. The ending is so good that it will probably stay with me for days. If you want to see a great action movie that is filled with comedy, action, and a lot of laughs. This movie is for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen much of "The Last Days of Pompeii", but it is one of those films that keeps you hooked. The story is simple: the Roman Empire has fallen and now we have a small tribe, the Vibiana, that lives in a small, isolated cave. There is a mysterious, yet very dangerous fire that breaks out from the ground, so a young girl named Doreen (Alicia Silverstone) is chosen by the elders of the tribe to be the last person to get out of the cave alive.   The film is a very effective one: a small girl gets out of her cave to find a new home. She sees a big city below, and her heart starts to race.  The movie was made in 1988 and I remember it being on cable a long time ago, but I can't find it.

It's very entertaining, and it's a nice movie to watch!   What I loved about this movie:  -The way they dress:  the guys all look like they're from the 80s or 90s, but the ladies all look really good!   in general, it's really fun to watch a bunch of guys and gals having fun together, as well as a bunch or people that are very different from each other, like they all have different personalities. It really shows the fun in the life of the Pizza Guys!   the movie shows that life can be great!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie back in 1998, when I was in high school and it was the only movie I saw in theaters back then. The movie is about a boy who loves a woman called Mary, who he falls in love with, then he falls out of love with her and then he gets a job in a store to make money, which means he can go to school and get a job. It is a very sweet movie, the director did a very good job in telling the story and I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ "THE LOVELY PEOPLE" I was not expecting a good score from me, but then again I wasn't expecting a movie about a couple of women who live in a house in a forest. Well I was wrong. "The Lovely People" was a very interesting story about a man who falls in love with a woman he meets at a park and decides to stay in a small village. There is no mention of the village or the man who fell in love, so we are left to imagine what happened. I would love to know how he made his way to the village, and how he managed to get the lady to like him. I also liked the story about how the villagers would greet him and how they would ask him if he wanted a wife. I didn't like the way the village members were portrayed, and I also thought the villagers didn't really seem to care for the man's feelings. The movie itself was well done, the movie was well made. I felt like I was watching a movie that was made in the 1960s. There were a few scenes where I thought the movie had aged a bit, but it still had charm. I think a good story is a good thing, and this movie had a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great film about two very different people who are not exactly the same in every way.  Cameron Crowe is a man who has never quite had it all his own way.   The first time he worked on a movie was a hit, and he was a big star by the time he was thirty.    The second time he took the job he found that the movie was actually a huge hit, but he didn't get the movie made.  He has tried many times to get a movie made, but the studios and the studios' lawyers won't let him do it.  One night, he decides to take the job on himself, and get the job done.  The movie was so good that the studios let him out of the contract, and it went on to become one of the biggest films of all time.  Cameron Crowe was a great movie star.  He was also the first person to win a best actor Oscar for a movie about an alcoholic.  I have heard that he is still pretty much a big movie star, but you wouldn't know it from watching this movie.    His first role is playing a rich and successful actor.  His wife has just left him, and she has told him he is going to have a stroke.  As the movie progresses, we see that the stroke has come, and his life is about to change.  For the first time, Cameron is a real human being.  But what happens to him is what happens when a famous actor gets his act together and decides to go out into the real world and deal with his problems.   Cameron is pretty much an alcoholic, and a very lonely one at that.  While on his first job, he meets a young woman named Mimi Rogers ( Kristen Wiig ).   Mimi is a young waitress who is also a recovering alcoholic. Cameron is trying to stay sober, but things just seem to be going badly.  Miki Rogers seems to be a nice enough girl.  She is not the kind of girl that you want to run into, but Mimi seems to have no other choice.  They spend some time together, and after a few days they begin to spend a lot more time together.  It's a little confusing, but I think it is pretty easy to follow this story.  There is not a lot of plot, but that is okay.  Instead, the movie does a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about an American woman who is the sole survivor of a plane crash. After the crash, she is taken in by a group of survivors, and the group becomes her family. Her family and the survivors of the plane crash are not at all like the stereotypes that people have of a survival group of a single person who is always alone and can't think for herself. She is also able to come to terms with the reality that people die all the time, and it is something that you can never really get over.   The movie is about a woman and her friends in the aftermath of a crash that almost wiped out a group that is supposed to be one of the last groups in the world.  I enjoyed this movie, it is a great family movie that is very well done. I really enjoyed the way the movie was filmed, the actors were all so good and had great chemistry with each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the idea of this movie. It takes place in the 60s and there are a bunch of different races living in a community.  In this movie, the two black women who work at the gas station, Ethel and Rose, get a job working as a nurse and mechanic at a local hospital.       One day, Rose is called to the hospital where a patient has died.   In the movie, she learns that the woman is a black woman, and that she had been shot in the back of the head.  Rose then goes to see a doctor and discovers that the patient was a man who was a victim of rape.  The doctor then suggests that they take the man back to his house to recover.  As they do so, they learn that the man is the father of the woman who had died. Rose is also told that her baby is black and that it will have a black father and a white mother.  At first, Rose refuses to let this happen, but the doctor convinces her that she has to have the baby.  And so, she and Ethel go back to the man's house to have her baby.    The film then takes us through a series of flashbacks as we learn about the history of the black community and its relationship to white people.  It takes the form of a true story but is told in a way that makes it seem like a movie from another time.  Ethel also plays a supporting role, working as the nurse and helping the doctor and Rose.  This movie is filled with good acting and it has an exciting plot that never fails to keep you interested.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good time and doesn't mind a little bit of historical fact.

The main hero is a bit out of shape, and doesn't have much of a backstory.   I think the reason he gets so much screen time is that the movie is all about him.  I was happy to see the film in the theaters.

When she is murdered, her husband finds out what really happened and the whole story is revealed. The acting:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's no doubt that the movie "Kirby" is a fine example of the cartoon genre. It's a little odd to watch an animated movie where the characters are so animated that they appear to be made of little tiny pieces of colored paper and string. There are a number of these cartoonish characters in the movie, including a little girl with an oversized hairpin, a little old man with a white beard and a dog who appears to be a cat. This movie is a good example of what animation was all about in the 1940's. The story is told by a group of mischievous cartoon characters who are in a little village called Kirby. The little girl is a troublemaker, but she's very clever. She's a very good musician and she can make a cat do tricks. Her mother says she doesn't have a real mother and a real father, but the little girl has a cat named Tootsie who is the father of her and her friend. There is a great number of cartoonish scenes in the film. The special effects were good, but it would have been even better if they had tried to do more realistic things with the characters. There's some violence in the story, but only in a few scenes. The music in the music box was great. The only real problem I had with this movie was the ending. The characters were a little too animated for my taste. I thought the movie should have had a more traditional ending, but that's only because the story didn't go anywhere interesting after that point. Overall, this is a fun, very animated movie. The animation was great, the songs were great and the characters were good. This is a must watch for any kids.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The film is about a young boy named Daniel who is a little obsessed with playing a guitar and a little jealous of the girls who are always picking up guitars. He decides to try his hand at it and makes a few friends along the way. It seems like a nice movie that would be good for little children to enjoy, but there are a few flaws. Â First of all the plot is very weak.  It takes place over a few days and the kids just go around picking up girls and playing guitar.    The girls get a little older and then we get a new group of girls who go around and play.  But the plot goes nowhere.  There are some funny parts, but most of the movie is just one little kid playing with his guitar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a strange twist of fate, this movie is also a great action movie and in the end, it is even a bit of a romance.   This movie is based on the novel The Way of the Gun by John Wray.  The movie was produced in 1949.  It was directed by Henry King and written by Robert Connolly.  Connolly and King both had been in the business of making low-budget movies for years.  King had previously directed a number of low-key films and Connolly was a screenwriter/director who had produced a number in the 1930s and 40s.  This is one of those movies where it is easy to see why it has been so popular.      The plot is simple.  A group of thugs are robbing a bank in downtown Philadelphia.  One of them, a man named Joe (George Reeves) is having a difficult time with his gang and the authorities are called to the scene to deal with them.  When Joe is trying to escape, the police find a bomb in his clothes and they assume that he is trying escape by jumping from a high place.  But the other members of his gang believe he is going to commit suicide.  Now the question is, who is Joe's friend who is also named Joe?   One can assume that it is either Eddie (George Sanders) or Joe's brother (Frankie Mertz).   Eddie is a good guy who is not the sort of guy who gets involved in the gang's business.  He is a tough guy who takes no crap from anyone.  Frankie is an easy going guy who isn't interested in doing anything violent.  Joe's sister, Edith (Beverly D'Angelo), is a woman of a few words and a few drinks.  In fact, she is so much of a drinker that she is barely able to speak when she is drunk.  While Edith is the one who starts the trouble, she can't seem to stop herself from getting involved in it.  With a bit more effort, she might have been able to get out of the way and leave Joe and Eddie alone.  However, Eddie is very protective of Edith and he wants to protect her from any trouble that may occur.  Eddie's girlfriend, Joanna (Marlene Dietrich), is not as protective.  Joanna has a tendency to get into trouble.  Also, Jo

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never seen a movie with so much heart and such an awesome story.  The story is about a young boy and his father and his grandfather who both live in a small village in the middle of nowhere in the United States.    The boy's father, the old man is old, and very sick.  This is his last year in his job at a nearby hospital.  It is a small town with a few shops and no real business.  The old man lives alone and does not speak to his son.  He has been caring for him since he was a little boy.  One day his wife dies in a car accident, leaving the man a widower.  A friend of the family is a police officer and she is his only friend.  In her attempt to take care of the man, she begins to suspect that he may be the one that killed his wife.  She believes that he murdered his wife because she was afraid of him and didn't want to have anything to do with him.  As he is not the type to take things so personally, he is surprised that his friend suspects him.     The ending is very unexpected and a perfect way to wrap things up nicely.  I really enjoyed this movie.  "I've been living in a cave for a while."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why I haven't seen it yet. I've always wanted to see the original, the one that starred Cary Grant. I know it is long, but it was just fun.   The story is about a small town that gets a big surprise when a couple of strange kids move in. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a great scene of a couple on a bike being pursued by a big cat who is chasing them.  After a few scenes of that, we jump into the first scene of the movie.  I thought it was good and funny, and even had a good soundtrack to go along with it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an American movie buff, and one of my favorite movies was 'Star Wars'. This is one of the better prequels, and it is set during the old Jedi Order. It is very much like the old one, except there is a more active Darth Vader. It was very funny at times, especially when the evil General Dodonna tries to take over the Republic. It also has a strong anti-communist tone. I love this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way, it is an interesting, albeit somewhat generic, story. I like the way the film deals with a situation and its aftermath. The film is about a young woman (Mia) who is a housewife who has to deal with her husband, who is violent and unpredictable. Mia doesn't want to live in a place like that, and tries to escape with her young son (Ramon) to a new place. In the course of their escape, the couple are attacked by a group of armed men. Mia is knocked unconscious and the two men proceed to rape and murder her. After the deed is done, they throw her body into a well and then leave the area. As if Mia's death was not bad enough, she is soon taken to a place where she is kept in the same position for over a month. She is slowly eaten away, slowly but surely, until she is completely covered in worms. When she is eventually rescued, she has lost a lot of weight. In a place called 'La Chorrera', the worms slowly take away her flesh until she becomes a worm-like monster. The story is about Mia's life as a monster and how she is slowly being devoured.   This is a film that is hard to put down, even though the story is somewhat predictable and it is hard not to feel bad for Mia.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last couple of years, when it comes to movies about serial killers, the majority of them are either bad, or are more a commentary on the "real life" than anything else.  If you can get past that, however, then the first half of the movie is a surprisingly decent movie.    The only problem is that it gets a bit boring towards the end.  The characters are interesting, but the movie does get boring towards its conclusion.  It's not a bad movie, and I'm not sure how much more I can get from it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an entertaining movie, and it has a good script to boot. The movie opens with a police car crashing through a window, and then a woman falls off and is killed by a man running after the car. The police arrive and find the body, but there is a body in the back seat of the car, and the body of the woman.  There are also other bodies in the car including a woman and a little boy, but they are too badly mangled to be identified.  There are a lot of cops in this movie, as there are in all good cops movies.   The police are able to identify the victims by matching their fingerprints with the woman's.  The woman's husband has already been arrested for the murder of her, and is now going to be tried as an accomplice.  In addition to the police and prosecutors, there are other people in the picture, such as a journalist, a social worker, and a pastor.  I don't think this movie is really a "movie," as the plot doesn't really make any sense.  There are some pretty good performances in this one, especially by a few of the female characters.  If you like good police stories, and you like watching a bunch of cops, you will probably like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's protagonist, a guy named Michael (David Morse), finds himself in a new, mysterious town that has the reputation of being a hellhole for any outsider. While there, Michael meets a beautiful woman (played by the excellent Catherynne M. Valente) who seems to be an outcast of sorts. However, when she is kidnapped and taken to a place that she describes as a "torture chamber" Michael is forced to work with the people who took her, to save her life. It's not a pretty sight. But it's also a good, suspenseful thriller that does a lot of things well. I don't mind the way the movie tries to make Michael a lovable loser, but I really enjoyed his relationship with Catheryne M. as well as her character in general. The movie also features a really great performance from Jeff Goldblum.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My girlfriend and I went to the theater and got a great laugh out of it. There are a few things I would like to see changed. First is the time in the movie when the boy gets a blow job from his mother and his girlfriend.  That scene was just stupid. I thought it was just a setup for the sex.    Second is the scene with the old woman when the girl's mother shows her how to use a hammer.  This was not a scene I could watch a few times to get a good laugh out.  Third was the scene where the old lady's friend is in the bathroom.  He was not used to sex and this was not what he had in mind.  The fourth is the line that was used in the scene.  It was not funny.  I could not even get the reference.  My girlfriend and my family enjoyed the movie.  They were very entertained and the ending was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, and I think that's a good thing, because I'm not a huge horror fan, but this movie really was a fun watch. The plot is pretty straightforward: a young girl goes missing while she is out for a walk, and she is found in the woods, apparently beaten to death, by a man in a clown mask, who is believed to be responsible. But there is a twist, and it turns out that the man was her father, and his name is William Blake. She wasn't his real daughter, but she looks very much like him. Her name is Alice, and the movie takes place in the early 1900s, where she is a young woman who is living with her mother and sister in an old shack, and has been told that her father is a doctor who has been gone for many years, and who has not been seen since. So Alice is on the run, and a strange new doctor (played by Jim Carrey) appears at her doorstep, claiming that she will cure her. The doctor claims that the only cure for Alice is a potion that will bring her mother back to life, and that if she drinks it, she will be able to see her father again. Alice, being a bit of a child, and an orphan, doesn't know what to think of the stranger. He offers to take her with him on a trip to England, where her mother lives, and if she doesn't get over her fear of the dark, she can go to the circus. So she agrees, and goes with him. I won't spoil the ending of the movie, because it was pretty great. But in a weird way, the movie actually turned out to be very well written, even though the plot was a little thin, and not terribly original. But that was the point of the film, and as a result, it had some good laughs, and some good horror elements. It also had a really cool "The Thing" like element, and there were some really great special effects, and plenty of blood, and stuff, but the plot kept the movie from getting too much too crazy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a chance to see this movie in a theater a few weeks ago, but since it is not that common in the States, I didn't know about it. I didn\'t know about the film until I went to the library to look up a book about the movie. I was surprised that I could find a copy of the movie on video. I saw it with my husband in a theatre in the Bronx, NY. We were the only two who were aware of this movie. My husband was laughing as the film showed that some people would kill for a good time. I thought that this film was a good one. I loved the movie because I felt the movie was entertaining. I liked the movie better than the movie I saw in Toronto when I was younger. I think that it is a good thing that the film was shown in a cinema because I think the movie could have been shown in the theaters because the film is better than I thought it would be. I am not sure if I will watch the movie again because it is an old movie and I don\'t remember the lines, but it was a fun movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think you'll be surprised to see that this film is not your average, generic, black and white sci-fi flick.  This is a gritty, intense, gripping and very thought provoking sci- fi drama that is set in the near future.    The film follows a group of men and women who must find a way to escape the oppressive, totalitarian regime that has taken over the world.  It is a tale of survival as well as the story of a people who will find a new world when they finally break free.  While I found the story intriguing I wasn't particularly interested in the plot and I didn't particularly like the characters in this film.  For me, it was more interesting to see the human side of the characters as opposed to the machine side of things.  The characters were also very simplistic and there was little in the way of development for any of the main characters.  I found myself thinking "What a silly world" as I watched the film. While I liked the concept of the film, I didn a very unenjoyable watch.  One could easily criticize the film for being a little simplistic but I think this is a problem that is in the mind of the viewer and not the director.  My Rating:  1 Star (out of 4)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a little kid, I used to be fascinated by the story of Peter Pan (or Pan), and all the adventures he had in his childhood.  There is something about that kid, who always has a great idea to take care of a little girl who doesn't like to fly.  This time, he is trying to take a girl with no wings, who is lost on a desert island.  But there is more to the story than meets the eye.  It was one of those films that I loved to watch over and over again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************************The film opens with a group of college students, headed by the loner, who are all heading to a big rock concert. Unfortunately for him, they are all dead. The only survivor, a young woman, who is in a coma for three years, is taken to a hospital in California where a group called the Dead Rabbits are trying to revive her. The Dead Rabbit group consists of a very old, very ugly man who has a small collection of bones that he collects from dead people. This is the only way he can get a hold of new ones. He wants the girl to see this collection, so that he can make new friends, but the girl is in no mood for any new friends and is only interested in the dead. When she is taken into the room where the Dead Rabbit lives, she is met by a very nice looking, middle aged man who wants to kill the girl and eat her. But the Rabbit's friend wants to stop him and wants to take the girl's life as well. This turns into a tug of war between the Rabbit and his friend, but in the end, the Rabbit wins and the girl lives. I found this movie very interesting because it is about a group trying to get to a concert. But it is very hard to see, because of the awful lighting. It is a little bit hard to understand what is happening at the time, but it was a nice movie to watch. It was not very dramatic, but there is some humor. The characters are very different. Some are very attractive, and others seem to be very creepy. Overall, it is a very interesting movie that I recommend to anyone who likes horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title alone says it all. I am a huge fan of the "Penny Dreadful" franchise, and this movie was one of the best of the franchise. This film takes a classic story about a girl named Molly Carpenter (played by Claire Foy) who is haunted by a ghost that only she can see. The ghost is an evil version of herself, and she comes after her with a vengeance. The story is set in the late 1800's in the small town of the same name, and it is filled with classic horror tropes like vampires, werewolves, and a giant monster.   This film also features an excellent performance from Foy as Molly, and her performance is as good as it gets.  For anyone who enjoys classic horror movies, I highly recommend this film.

The actors do a good job.  The plot is very funny and has a good sense of humor.  This is one of the best comedies that I have seen in a long time.

The plot is simple and it doesn't take too long for the movie to get to where it's going. There are some funny moments but there are also some funny scenes with black and whites in a movie. I've been a big fan of black andwhite movies for years and this movie was one of the first. The director is the same as in all of his movies. The cast is all very good. It is a shame that they are not able to get another film done as it's so good. I'm a fan of a lot of black & white movies but this is my favorite.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one of those movies that, as far as I'm concerned, is almost perfect. I think it's not really about a great fighter (although there is a great fight) or even a great actor (although he is very good), but about a man who has to face up to a harsh reality of life.   He is a very good actor who brings to life a character who is completely unlike him. He is not a coward or a man out of touch with his own humanity. He has been through some things in his life that others may have ignored or ignored in return.  His wife left him and he was left with two children.  The two children are now grown up and he is now a grandfather.  This movie is a powerful, moving and very sad story about a person's life and the reality of it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an example of how life can really go from good to bad in a matter of months.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a pretty good sci-fi flick.  The film is pretty much a remake of the 1962 film "Day of the Triffids".  A man named Joe Dreyfuss (Robert Stack) is a farmer from Iowa who is on his way to California to attend a conference of the American Geophysical Union.  He is a bit of a recluse and is only seen occasionally on his tractor, and in the background of a photo.  Drey has a wife (played by Evelyn Nesbit) who he is close to, and his two daughters, Susan (played wonderfully by Jane Wyman) and Elizabeth (played beautifully by Jane Fonda) are the family he has in Iowa.  When he gets off the train, he finds himself in a town with a town square surrounded by skyscrapers and a great dome of light.  This dome is in a very small area and it is only visible at night.  Joe's only connection to the dome is a radio transmitter in a nearby farm.  The dome lights up the sky and makes the town seem like a bright light. The dome also keeps the town and its inhabitants safe from the many threats it has been exposed to.  It also prevents the dome from crumbling as it has with other towns.  Unfortunately, the dome has a bad reputation.  At the conference, the scientists and scientists' wives from other countries are trying to figure out what the dome does and what to do about it.  They are also trying to understand why the dome keeps breaking down and why it doesn't move.  One of the scientists at the conference is Dr. Henry Lee (Peter Sellers).  Lee is also the head of a science research station in the dome, which is funded by the United States government.  His station was built to study the dome and to find a way to stop the dome.  Lee has a theory that the dome can't break down on its own and that it must be caused by some kind of cosmic radiation.  If he is right, then it is possible to control the dome's actions.  Dr. Lee also has a team of scientists who are also attempting to figure it out.  While he is trying to find the answers, he also has to deal with some local politicians who don't think the dome should be studied or controlled.  In addition to the political tensions, Lee has to worry about the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is the first in a new line of "Star Wars" movies that are going to be "sequels" of the originals.  It has the same good guys and bad guys as the others and the same themes.    It also has a very well made story about a band of musicians trying to make a living playing the music of a famous composer (James Earl Jones) and his wife (Susan Sarandon).   In the beginning of the movie it seems like the band is in bad shape.  There is no music.  But they get some good advice and get some decent parts from other musicians (played by some good actors) who help the band get a better sound.  Then the music gets better.  The acting is good and the movie is well made.  It's one of those movies that you don't mind seeing in the theater, but once you get out and go home you will want to go to the movies again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a lot of great movies in the Criterion Collection that I've seen in the past, but this one stands out in the bunch for being the first of the "Alien" movies. I've heard that Ridley Scott is not the most popular director of the modern era (I'm not entirely sure why, since he has done a lot great stuff), but he's still one of the best, and I think he's done a great job here.  This movie takes place in a near future, where an alien spacecraft crashes on the desert planet of LV-426, where it begins to grow a strange, new life form, which will one day become the "Aliens."  The film is an incredible visual spectacle, and one of my favorite films of the year.  "Alien" in the "Criterion Collection" is available on VHS and DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been to see this movie twice now, both times in theaters and both times I was so happy to see that the same crew was working on both movies.   The movie was shot at the University of Utah.  In the movie the girls were wearing frilly dresses and high heels, the boys were wearing shorts and shirts and shorts, and the costumes were so elaborate that the costumes had to be purchased and altered and then the costumes got ruined after a day of filming.  I was surprised that the girls and the boys looked so alike, but the girls look so much like the girls in the movies I've seen, that it's almost a wonder they don't look any better.  The scene where the girls run off in a bus to go to a party is one of my favorite scenes in any movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this to be an entertaining movie about a guy who was once a good guy. I am sure there are worse ones out there but I enjoyed this one. It is not like the other ones that are based on a real life story. I found that it had a different tone than most others out there. There is not a whole lot of action. But that does not mean there is no action.   In the film, the story revolves around a retired cop named Steve McCall. Steve had been on the force for a number of years. He had also been married to a lady named Ann. Their son, Mike, was a good kid who wanted to be a policeman like his father. He also had a crush on his mother, who had died in a car accident. Steve knew that he was not going to be promoted to detective. He knew that his life was about to change when his best friend, Billie, came to the police station. Billie had been in jail for a couple of years for drug possession. She told Steve that she had been having problems with the police. She had found out that there was a lot of money that was missing from the department's vault. She was determined to get it back. Steve did not know that Billie was going to have another run in with the cops. She came to his desk to tell him about the money. Steve told her he was going home. She tried to convince him to give her another chance. She said that he could go down in history as a hero. He agreed.

I had never seen the film in its entirety, but I had watched it a few times through, and it's not often you get a good "bad" movie, or a good bad movie. The story is pretty good, but it's definitely not an action movie. It's a mystery movie. There's a twist at the end of the film that I loved. It was so satisfying. This is a good film.

When the girl has a baby the boy, who is the son of the farmer, is angry and begins to beat the girl and threatens to kill the baby.  There are some very graphic scenes in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this is one of the most enjoyable films ever made. The film is set in the early 1900s. A group of brothers (and their two wives) live in a remote country house. One day, the youngest son of the brothers, Edward, is attacked by a bear. It is at this time that the older brothers discover that they have been separated. The eldest, John, is a talented artist who has worked as a circus clown and a singer in Paris. He goes to Paris with his brothers to try and find a way to reunite the brothers. But their reunion is not as they had planned. The brothers are not what they were once. One of them, Tom, is an old man who has lived in the country all his life. Edward has been the most artistic brother since he was a boy. He is a good painter and a very talented musician. They have always been separated since they were children. They don't talk to each other. They just do their own things. One night, they are asleep when the brothers hear the sound of a car. It turns out to be a circus bus, and Tom decides to hitchhike to Paris. The bus driver is none other than John the older brother. Tom gets on the bus and starts to play the music of the band which has played for the brothers all their lives. The music starts to get to John, and he takes off his hat to Tom. He then takes off Edward's hat and throws it into the river. Tom, with tears in his eyes, takes off and follows John. He ends up in Paris and then decides to go back home. As Tom goes back, Edward wakes up and decides to follow him. Edward ends up at the train station in Paris, where he meets another man, who is an Englishman named Walter. Walter asks Edward to look after Tom. Edward agrees and goes back to London to look for Tom.   One of the best things about this film is that it is set mainly in London and it gives us a glimpse of what London was like in the first half of the century.  I really liked this movie!   This is one movie I am sure will stay with me forever. It really had me glued to the screen. I will never forget the excitement I felt when I heard that the brothers were going to make another movie. It was a great film that I could watch over and over again!  The plot:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an old movie, but it is a good old movie. The story of the movie revolves around a family who has to move from the country to a new town, and then to a city where their home is being demolished. As a young man, it seems that a good part of the film is a retelling of the old Irish legends about ghosts, witches and all that stuff. There is a great little bit where a girl is going to a wedding in the old house in the woods. And then the old lady comes in, and it is very scary. I guess the movie is about the little things in life.  "It's like you are in the house where the ghosts come to visit."   The music in this movie is good, and the special effects are pretty good. The picture is a little grainy, and there are some scenes where you really have to be on the look out for things.   This is a nice old movie with a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've only seen this one once, and I liked it. The plot is great, and the character development is fantastic. I especially liked the scene where she gives up her life of crime to take care of her infant daughter. I don't have a daughter (yet), but if I did, I'd be sure to give this movie a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for this kind of thing, especially when it's done with a story that's not so very different from that of a lot of Hollywood pictures.   In fact, it's the exact same script that was used in " The Big Chill ", a movie that, in my opinion, was one of the worst movies of all time.  This time around, we have the same characters, who are caught up in a bad situation.  As I said before, they are all played by the same actors, and this time around they are played by Gary Busey and Tom Cruise.  The movie does have some pretty great performances, especially from Busety, who makes his character into a real-life hero.  Busetty is a good actor, but I don't think he could make the kind of character he is supposed to.  I know I said I wasn't a big fan of the Cruise/Busey movie, but this is not a bad movie by any means.  It has all the things you expect from a Hollywood picture, and, to be honest, I was kind of disappointed with the ending.  However, the movie is good enough to be worth your time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot!   The movie was good but it wasn't that great.   There is some bad acting and some bad effects but that's all.  I like this movie because it has a good story line. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film which is very entertaining and has a strong story with plenty of twists and turns. It's a good action movie with strong choreography and a few cool stunts.  - The characters are good: the bad guy is played by a real actor and I like him! The protagonist is very different and has great emotions. The heroine is a very cool and mysterious woman who will give the hero a lot of trouble in the end! The special effects are excellent: the fight scenes are great! It's really exciting to watch the fight sequences!  The story is a lot interesting and the end is very good!   This is a must watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this with my mom and she loved it. I liked it better than the other movies she has seen.    My favorite part is the "tug-o-war" scene.  My second favorite part was the ending.  I have seen all the other "Muppet movies" and this one was the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this a while ago, but didn't watch it until recently. I have never been a big fan of this movie. I had a lot of problems with it. The characters are a little cliche, and the plot is really dull. This movie was so bad it was good!    This movie has a lot going for it. It has great acting and amazing scenery. The story was very well done, and if you like your films to have a happy ending, this one has that too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not much of a fan of science fiction movies and in this movie they did a great job in portraying the science of this world. This movie is about a man who finds out that he's a cyborg. He has been in an underground facility called the "Cyberplex" where he has been being trained by his creator to become a cybernetic warrior. The movie was really well made. The characters are great, the effects are great and the music is good as well. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. It seemed to be a bit abrupt and it's hard to get invested in a story when there is such a cliffhanger at the end.   The main problem I have with the movie is that the ending was very rushed and I didn't get invested enough in the story to be able to care for the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie because it's different and the way they make it different is by making it an 80's movie. I like the idea of having a film with a 80's theme, and I think it works well. The story is good and it's the best part of the movie.  This is a fun movie and I enjoyed it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's no denying that the first season of Archer was the funniest on TV in a long time. Archer is a lovable loser that is in constant danger of being arrested for crimes he never committed and getting himself into a lot of trouble. He spends most of his time working for a company that creates special effects for the military and he gets into a LOT of trouble because he gets cocky and thinks that he can do anything. The show is very much a "what happens in Vegas does not always stay in Vegas" kind of show and even though it was hard to watch sometimes it's still funny.   Archer is a good show for the young and old. The art style is pretty standard but it's pretty cute. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you look at the movie's trailer you will see it is a very funny and unique film.  The movie takes place in a dystopian future where the world has been ruined by the invention of a new drug called "Super D".  It is a drug that makes its user immune to all diseases and sickness.   The film is about a group of scientists who have been using the drug for years to test their theories and make a better future.    They get a new member into the group, a woman named Mary Ann.  The chemistry of the movie is excellent, and there is a little bit of romance at the end of the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of the movie is about a young man named Alex who gets lost in a labyrinth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Best" is a very good movie. It's an interesting look into a man who finds himself on a small island with an odd cast of characters. It is very funny and has a lot of heart. It was good and was worth the watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ This movie is one of the best films I have seen this year and it's all due to the amazing acting. The movie is a story about two guys who are in the same bar as they have a few beers, talking about all kinds of things that are going on in the world and all the stuff that happens around them. They start to talk about what's going on around them and the guys start to look for a way to get out of their situation. Soon enough the guys decide to do some research on a way out of the bar and the place gets filled with zombies, a killer cat and a bunch of other crazy stuff. The guys get away from the bar only to be confronted by some zombies and they have to get them to a place where they can get help and escape the place. Along the way they also have to deal with some crazy guys that are trying to kill them and a couple of other characters that are out to get the guys as well. The acting in this movie is top notch, the zombies were very scary and very scary in this film and the cat was a very funny addition to the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of zombie movies or to just anyone who likes to laugh a lot and have a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am in awe of this movie. It's a great story with some interesting twists and turns. The cinematography is great and the acting is great as well. It is not a classic action movie but it's good enough to have it in the top 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Lost Weekend"  (1979) is a movie about a movie and the movies that make up the American entertainment industry.  The story is about a group of friends who get together for a weekend of fun, and are disappointed when the group of movies is broken up by a bad storm.

The three young men get tired and decide that they are going to stay up all night watching movies on a small screen.  After one of the guys gets the idea to put a clock on the wall to tell time in a movie theater.  He puts the clock in the movie theater, but the clock is not working.  So the three men decide to take the clock to the local diner and put it in the diner's bathroom.  And so they decide to stay all night.  When they get tired of watching movies they decide they have to get a room so they can sleep.  One of the young men goes to get his jacket and when he comes back he finds that it has a zipper down the front.  That is when he is informed that there is no room for him to sleep in the theater because there is a woman in the next theater that needs to sleep. The young man decides to take a chance and go and see if he can find a room.  It is not long before the young man is in a theater where there are no other people but him and the woman.  Then he hears the sound of the clock on a wall, and when it goes off the three friends decide that it is time to leave.  There is a chance that the young woman is going to leave, but she decides to stay and go back to her room. The movie ends when the three young friends decide to leave the theater.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best action movies of all time. The story is well executed and it is a little bit over the top in parts, but you'll be laughing for a while. The film's story is set in the year 1984. It is a day when the US military are in the middle of a major operation in Afghanistan to capture a group of terrorists and their leader named Abdul Nabi (Mateen Faraj). The operation was successful and the terrorists were captured. Nabi is now in the custody of the military. He is kept in a cage with an old woman called Mrs. Seda (Masaaki Hirata) and the military keep an eye on him. The mission is over and the terrorist leader has been captured. However, the terrorists have escaped and now Nabi has found a new place to go. The movie's climax is an intense action sequence that will have you shaking and sweating from the start. The action is done very well. There is a lot of blood, gore, destruction, and an intense final fight. It's a great movie that should be on everyone's action movie list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to agree with other reviewers on the rating. It's a good story and an even better movie. This movie does not have a plot that's so complex, it's about a guy named Mike who is a real oddball. He lives in a trailer park, so he is surrounded by his friends and their dogs. One day, he has a dream where he sees a truck with a big "C" painted on it, and the driver says something about a girl in a car. So Mike decides to go investigate.   There's a real good movie here. It has a good atmosphere, and it is good to see an oddball in a world that is not all that great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting movie.   This movie is not very good, but it is good enough to enjoy.  It is a very strange movie with a story that seems to be based on the story of a little boy who is the only survivor from a plane crash.  He and his father decide to get a ride in a plane, but the pilot is really angry with them because he is a bad pilot.  They find a beautiful beach and they get the best view in the world of the ocean.  The father then decides to climb a mountain to see the sea and then he decides to land on the beach.  Then they have to do a lot of jumping and crawling and climbing up and down in the jungle because the plane is not going very fast.  In the end, the mother and son make it to the ocean, but they are very badly wounded and they die. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You know, when I was a kid, I thought that movies with a good plot were really rare. The closest we got to that was when the title character in a movie about a man who lost his parents and his daughter got married and had a kid. The kid's name was Johnny, and the movie's plot involved him becoming a detective and fighting against bad guys and bad luck.   The movie's story and plot were not very original, but that's not the point. The point is that this movie is about a guy who has to make a living, and a kid who lives in a house. The story is simple, the kids' adventures are interesting, and it never got boring. This movie is a perfect example of why kids love to watch movies with adults in them. It's one of those movies where adults, because they are the ones who can't keep up with the kids, are always trying to get in the kids way and they never are.   a good little movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening shot of this film is a classic example of how a scene can be done right. In the film, a young man who has been given the choice to either become a fighter pilot in the war to come or die, chooses the latter. I found the action to be fairly interesting, the movie has some great action scenes. The cast are all great in this film. They all are well-developed and have a lot of fun. The music is also very good. I especially liked the scene in which the two lead actors, one who was a war veteran and one who wasn't, were in a bar with the woman of their dreams. I wish the movie had been more like the first two installments of this series. This one would have been perfect for my generation of children.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, good movie about a bad guy with a gun. The movie is based on a book written by Stephen King, which I think is one of the best books about a kid who is bullied by a boy with a big gun.   I thought it was a good film, especially because I'm sure Stephen King would've liked this one, so I'm happy I watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie is  The Devil's Advocate. It is a wonderful piece of cinema about a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent over 30 years in prison. The movie is a true classic. It is well-written and well-acted. The plot is simple: a lawyer who knows the murderer in question gets involved in the case when the victim is the sister of a former governor. There are many twists and turns throughout the movie.   The Devil Advocate   is a must-see for any horror fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie, written by Robert Altman, was filmed in 1970 and 1971 and had a fairly wide release at the end of the year. It is based on the true story of a young man who kills a policeman to get the money for his wedding. He is later shot in the head by a police officer who had been called to the scene by a witness. This has been a long time since I watched a movie in which I felt as though the audience were in danger of being harmed. This is a classic that every moviegoer should see, it is an example of the "greatest hits" of the '70's. It was filmed on a budget of $20,000. It had a total of 6.5 stars from me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of good stuff happens in the first half of the movie. It starts off strong. A young boy is running across a field on a hot summer's day. He meets a woman and she tells him that she's lost her child. He takes a little girl along to find the child. Along the way he finds a horse and his horse's father. They have a horse race.   The boy has to keep the horse running by jumping it over obstacles, a tree, etc. This is pretty simple stuff, but it works.  The horse, a very pretty creature with a big head, runs across the field and then finds a little boy on the other side.    The boy is called "Lem" (the name is a reference to a movie, but I don't remember the title. Lem is the name of a dog in the movie, which I do remember, but the dog is the daughter of the horse).  Lem is a dog with no human emotions, and a very bad temper. He is very loving and playful, and he gets along well with the other dogs.  But Lem is a sad, lonely dog. He has lost his mother. His father is a bad man who beats his son and steals Lem's mother.  When Lem meets the girl he falls in love with, she is also a dog.  Lem thinks that she is his mother, but she's really a man named "Mose" (Mose is Lem's horse). Lem's father wants to take Lem back to his farm, but Lem will only come if he can have a friend.  So the boy and the girl go to Mose's house.  After the boy convinces Mose to let Lem stay with him, Mose shows Lem the things that the boy likes and the things the girl likes.  Lem then finds the woman's daughter and they go back to Lem's home.  And the movie goes on.  The girl has a secret, which she's not telling anyone.  This secret makes Lem very upset and it is something that Mose knows about.  Mose helps Lem, but only because Lem has to make it back to Moses' house.    This is a nice movie.  I like it, but like I said it is a pretty simple plot.  It is a little slow and the little boy and Lem have a lot of fun.  There are
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know how I managed to resist watching this movie all the way through, since it's such a good one!  In it, we have a young man named Frank who gets a new job in a new town in the middle of nowhere and is immediately attracted to a pretty young girl named Tana (Tanya Roberts).  After she gets sick and is dying, he decides to take her to the hospital and is surprised to find out she is a surgeon and that he is the best in the world at operating on people!    After a few days of his strange attentions, Frank starts to realize he is falling in love with Tana and tries to get out of her arms.   The movie also deals with the theme of aging and mortality.  It deals with a man who has the skills and experience to handle the situation of a young woman who is sick but not quite dead.  In a way, this movie is about a man's desire to be with a young girl.  I am really glad I watched it, since the ending is the last thing you want to see, but if you are a fan of the old time movies, then this is a must see! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an oldie but a goodie.  I can still remember the first time I saw this movie.    It was the late 80s.  And I was just a kid.  I knew it was a good film.  There were plenty of great movies back then and it had a great script and great acting.    But my favorite part is when this character tells the woman that he's got a friend with a gun.  When they were doing this scene I thought to myself "How can a man have a gun?   He doesn't even look like a man."  And it's true.  But, the acting is top notch and the story is great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a fun movie, but I think it's time to move on to something more fun.  I'm not a huge fan of the whole zombie genre, but the one thing that I like is that it's got some humor.       What really makes it funny is that the movie takes place in a small town, and there's a bunch of people who get infected.    It's really not all that difficult to see why this would be a popular thing to do.  This movie also features a great song by Bob Wills. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that this is one of those movies that has great action scenes, great characters, good jokes, and a pretty good story.  But the story is just too bad. Â This movie does not seem to have a good ending.    It just seems like a rushed movie, with little story. It just ends too soon.  The plot is really not that interesting and just goes nowhere.  There is a lot of action scenes in this movie, but they are just so brief and boring.  They don't really build up the plot, they just take a quick jump into the action.  You never really get to see much of the characters.  Most of the time you only see one or two people at a time.  Some of the actors do a good job in the movie, especially the character of the police officer.  I think this is the only movie that is worth seeing.  It has great fight scenes, but is so short and not worth the time. I think that the story was too rushed and the ending is really lame.

This is a much-needed sequel that will satisfy those who enjoyed the first two episodes and those who are looking for a good, solid MST that doesn't try too hard to be more than it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was totally surprised when I first saw this movie.  It's really different than the other westerns I've seen.    It's set in 1879 and focuses on the adventures of a bounty hunter who is on the run from the law.  It has the feel of an old western.  One of the best parts of the movie is the music, it's really catchy.  The only complaint I have is that the bounty hunter doesn't seem to be getting any more bloodier and that he has to go and find another one of his "sisters".

He is a scientist, but not at all a stereotypical scientist. His mind works in a different way and it seems he is able to "see" things he never could before. He has to keep a close eye on the people around him in order to keep them from harm.   As the story goes on it becomes more and more obvious that this man is the result of a very specific type of science experiment. A man who has been "birthed" a woman in order for him to be able to make progress in the scientific world. He tries to do the best he can with this "birthing", but soon realizes he has much to learn and to overcome.   The book is a great read for anyone who wants to know more about this type of research. _________________ 06-03-2008 andyc Registered User   Join date: Feb 2008 Posts-0 Likes: 0 (0 Posts) Re: movie about a man who was a woman born a man and became man   with a few minor variations  "he can see things he wasn't born to see"  He has a great sense of smell,  he is very sensitive and can detect things as subtle as a drop of water.  and the main character seems to be the one who is  most likely to be hurt by any kind of accident or bad  decision, even when the science behind it is beyond his  experience.   for example, he was born with a  certain eye that he can't really see, but can hear  through it, and he can see the people's facial expressions, .  ,   "I'm a woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Buster's Wild Ride" is a charming, fun and action packed film.  This is a classic film from the 1950's about a boy and his dog who are out to see the Wild West.  The film was released in 1954, so there is no longer a Wild West anymore.    This is the classic story of a boy riding a horse, and a wild ride through the country.  Buster and his friends go to see a Wild Man, Buster the Wild Man.  I have a soft spot for Buster.  He is the boy scout of the group, and I love him.     Buster loves the wild, and is brave.  His friend the dog, however, is not as much of a wild man as he seems.  There is a scene where Buster tries to ride a horse and his feet slip off the stirrup.  While Buster tries, the horse is so wild, that he runs out of control and is almost killed.  A little girl, who was riding with the group in the wagon, watches the accident, and tries to run to Buster's aid.  This little girl is a very cute girl.  She is very interested in the horses, and the Wild Western films.  The film was made by John Wayne, a very famous and well known actor.  Wayne played the lead role in this film. He had a great turn as Buster. I was very excited to watch this film when I was a little kid.  It was a very fun film, and was definitely a favorite of mine.

He gets them to help him get the woman back. However they try to kill him. The ending is great. I recommend this movie to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun, funny, and entertaining movie that's not afraid to go to the dark places.  There is no doubt that the film is filled with dark themes, but this is nothing to worry about.    I've heard it described as a "man on the run" thriller, but I don't see that at all.  There is some violence, and the violence is well done, but the story and plot are much more important.  The movie has a good soundtrack, and that's about all you can ask for.  I give this movie a "6.5/10"

I recommend this to everyone who likes a good laugh and a good action movie.

They were taken to a school which was abandoned and now is a cemetery. A school full of dead children and a bunch of creepy people. This movie is full of action and scares. It's not scary at all. It just has great scenes of horror. The characters are just not believable. I really didn't like the story. I think it's just a bunch a kids going to school and living out their days. ********** ********* ******** ******** *** *********** ******** **** ******** 1. ************ ************ 2. **************************** 3. ~~~~ ~~~~ 4. ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 6.  ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ 7.   ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ 8. ~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~ 9. --------------------------- ------------------------- 10. _____ _____ 11. _______ _______ 12. _____________________________________________________ 13. ______________________ ________________ 14. _____________ ________ 15. ________________________ ________________________ 16. ------------- ------------- 17. ____ ____ 18. ______ ______ 19. --------------- --------------- 20. ----------- ----------- 21. ------ -------------- 22. --------- ------------- 23. ------- ------------ ------------ 24. ---- ------------ ---- 25. ---------------- ------------------- -------------
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a family who moves from Germany to the United States in the 1940s and is trying to establish itself in this country. This family is a bit of a mess, the father (Peter Falk) is a violent drunk, the mother (Jude Law) is divorced, the children are in and out of trouble, and the wife is a bitch. The story revolves around the children, who, unlike their parents, are not as smart as they should be.   In the end, it's a movie about how hard it is to be a kid in the middle of the Second World War. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie multiple times and each time I'm impressed by how well it captures the essence of the 80's. It's a movie that's a blast to watch and if you're a fan of 80's comedies you'll love this movie. I love the "Who is your daddy?" scene, the music is just perfect, the jokes are good, and the actors are all great. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I was disappointed in the ending and the fact that the ending didn't feel like a complete resolution. But all in all, a great movie.

I loved the ending scene and the movie is good to end on a good note.  4 out of 5 stars: I love this movie. I like that it's a story of a little boy and his brother.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was not only fun, but it also was a bit of a surprise. I was expecting to see a horror movie, but I thought it was going to be something more... but, it was more horror than anything else. The scares were real, not just the jump scares, but the fact that the house was very old and had a history of having dead bodies. I never thought that I'd see that in a horror film. And, I think that's the reason that the ending was so good. I don't know about you, but for me, it makes a great ending to a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like "The Shining," you'll enjoy this. The story is pretty simple. A couple is visiting a cabin in the woods and get a phone call to go see the townspeople's children, who have just arrived at a new school. A mysterious force appears in the school, and children are attacked and murdered by something they don't recognize. The kids are locked in the basement, and a group of school employees and townspe  I enjoyed this movie, but it was nothing special. The movie was about a couple who were visiting a remote cabin in a forest, and got a phonecall from their son that they needed to go to the town to see their children. The cabin was empty, but there was a dead body hanging from the front door. It was a bit odd to see this movie about a cabin, in the middle of the woods. The rest of the movie was set at a school, where the school was closed, because a killer was loose. This killer killed the kids, but then a little boy who was locked in a closet came out of it and stabbed the killer. It wasn't until after this happened that the killer was shot in the head. That was pretty odd. The school employee and a couple of students who were hiding in the closet all had to be killed to get the killer down. I guess the only thing I didn't like about the movie is the ending. I'm not sure why they ended it that way, but I guess it wasn't a good way to end it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with a close up of a large black dog. The dog runs out of the house.   It looks very much like a giant black dog, but he's not. He's a large man, but there is a strange look in his eyes.  This man is a vampire. The man is dressed in a blue suit. His name is Mr. White.  Mr.White is very tall and he has a very large head. He seems to be a very rich man.  His eyes are very strange.  He looks like a vampire, but it's very hard to tell.  The man has an evil grin on his face. He is very angry, but his eyes tell a different story.  I don't know if this is just a vampire or a man that has been cursed by a vampire (or maybe a vampire and a man), but Mr. W. has a great character.  There are a lot of good things in this movie, but I feel like it's a little slow.  My favorite character was Mr.W. I like the idea of a cursed man and a vampire that are both living together.  Overall, this movie is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a scene where a group of boys in the woods are playing with a large snake.  One of the boys, a little boy, picks up the snake and takes a bite out of it.  The other boys laugh and say "He's only five!"  The boy's mother yells at them to stop, and the boy's father shouts "We don't do that here!"  But this is an ancient tribe, and these boys are not from this tribe.  These boys are from the other tribe, who are playing by their rules.  It is the last of a three-day tournament, and it is the boys from the ancient tribe who are winning.  I liked this movie a lot, and I liked the way they made the scene work.  And the kids are not stupid, they realize it is not their game to play.  But they are in a tribal environment, and when you get older you realize that you need to play by your own rules, and that is something you don't have to accept.

A good old movie about a time when America was great and a time where the country still had a great soul. A time when people could take a stand and make their stand known. A day when a little boy stood up for his country and did something no American has ever done. A man who was just a boy when he fought and was killed for his nation. A movie about what happens when the flag flies at half mast. A true movie about how a flag has to come down and it's time to do it for America.

I really don't understand the "love interest" thing, it makes no sense. It's so obvious from the beginning what kind of a girl he is. It would make more sense if they made it like a sci-fi movie where the main character can do anything and then the love interest is a female robot that just looks like he is a robot. Or something.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not a good film in the classical sense of the word. It's an interesting look at the rise of a new cult leader in the mid-1960s.   The film is directed by George Roy Hill, whose career spanned from the 1940s to the early 1970s. His other films include The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Sound of Music (1962), The Great Escape (1963), The Wild Bunch (1969), and I Am Curious Lucy (1975).   This is the first feature length film from Hill, and is considered his finest.  George Roy's portrayal of a charismatic cult leader is superb.  The story centers around the rise to power of Charles Manson and his followers, and the ensuing violence and tragedy.  It was a major motion picture in 1969, and received mixed reviews.      Hill was a huge fan of the film, and even attended the premiere.  Hill's interest in this cult leader was so great that he decided to write a screenplay about him.  This film was shot in 1970.  An interesting idea that is executed well:  A good film about a bad man:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had high hopes for this film. It had a unique premise: a boy has a dream in which he is a vampire. This is a premise that is fairly common in Hollywood movies: the kid is a little kid in a candy shop who falls in love with a vampire (and in the end is killed by him). I've seen a lot of vampire movies and I have never seen a vampire movie that is like this. The film is based on a true story: an Irishman named William Campbell and a Swedish woman named Helena, who met on the streets of Dublin. After being kicked out of her apartment by her landlord, Helena meets a young man named William, who gives her a lift to a friend's house. William is very shy, but when Helena goes to bed he begins to change. It is during this transformation that William begins to take the form of a vampire: He turns into a beautiful woman in black and a hideous man in a black suit. William doesn't seem to have any of the typical vampire traits: He's incredibly smart and funny, he never talks about his past (though he does say "I'm very sorry") and he's very respectful to his fellow vampires. It's also very interesting to see how he tries to hide his vampirism from his family and his friends. This film is about two people who try to find the truth about their own lives and to understand each other. The acting is really quite good, and there are a couple of interesting story lines. I liked the ending: William's vampiring ways don't end here. (4/5)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I can safely say that I loved this movie. I have been waiting to see it for a while and it was a very enjoyable watch. I'm sure a lot of you know the story, but for those that don't, here is the plot: An extremely talented musician, his brother, and a fellow musician who are all performing in a theater in a small town. They get together to perform and there is a new singer who is also performing. The show is going pretty well until they are interrupted by a man with a gun who is stalking the band and the audience. The singer and his brother try to kill the man, but he escapes and then a fireman comes in and saves the day. The band and audience is now completely safe and the man who killed the band members is now after the singer. The fireman kills him, and the singer's brother tries to kill him too, but is shot by the police. The police arrest the man and then the band's singer decides that he wants to sing and performs. He is now on stage and the people are loving his performance and the crowd loves him. At the end, he has a huge hit with a song about how he doesn't care about the bad things that happen in his life. It was very funny, and I hope that they bring this movie back.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good action movie that will give you goose bumps!  Sgt. York (Tom Savini) is the only sane person on the island and he must save the island from a vicious band of outlaws known as The Mutineers. The Mutines are a band of criminals, and their leader, the notorious "Crazy Jack" (Richard Gere), is very cruel and is responsible for the death of many innocent people. But, before Jack can do further damage, York (Savini) steps in to save the day, with his trademark weapon, the knife.  Gives York a good start: The acting is good, and the dialogue is great.  The movie is very violent and it is well worth the viewing! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit that I'm not very good at horror movies. I don't watch much television and have never seen the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. But I have seen a lot of horror movies and this is one of the best I've ever seen. I really liked the way the director kept the suspense going in the beginning. I thought the story was well-done. It was very well made and the special effects were very good. There are a few things I don`t like about this movie. I found it very hard to believe that someone could have made this movie and not known how to do it right. I have always thought that horror movies should be very scary and this wasn't very scary. I also thought the ending was a little too much for me. I was expecting to get to the last scene and be shocked, but instead we get a little more information about the killer and then he dies. The next day he is seen on the news and a police investigation is started. It seems that he has killed a number of people but it is not very clear who he has done it to and where they are. A number of witnesses are brought in and they are interviewed and then they are let go. I think this is the weakest part of the movie and the director did a bad job at doing it. I didn't like the fact that the film didn't go in a certain direction and that we didn't find out where the killer is. This is a movie for the fans of "The Twilight Zone". I don\'t think that this movie would make a good television show. If you don\' t like the movies of John Carpenter or Sam Raimi and you like the style of the "Twilight Zone" then this movie might be right for you. If not, I would recommend it for a horror film lovers group.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good example of a movie that takes a lot of time to develop. I have watched it 3 times, so far, and it has stayed with me through out all of it. I'm not a fan of movies that take a long time to get to the point, and I'm sure many people will disagree with me, but I find the movie to be very well-made. I found it very well done, and the writing is very good as well. The movie is about a young boy named Nick who has had a great deal of trouble at home over the years, and his life takes a turn when he is told by his grandfather that he can have his own room for a short time to live alone. He is then given a new room, and is to live there alone, but it turns out that he is to be the new room boy at the hotel for a week, and he must stay there for a month. His room is in a bad part of the hotel and there are a number of young women and children in the hotel. They are all very happy to have him there, and they all make themselves at home with him. There are a few times when Nick is sad because of all the young women, and when he comes to his room, the maid is crying. But Nick's new room is nice. There is a big bed, a big television, and a chair that Nick can sit on when he's lonely. He also has a cat. I don't remember the movie showing any violence or sex, so I don-t know if it was the sex or the violence that bothered me the most. The violence and sex seemed to be handled fairly well. I guess that's what we're supposed to expect from a movie like this. I just wanted to see the movie again so I could tell you what I thought of it, and if I had to pick my favorite scene.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is set in the year 2012 in the small town of Cholera, Texas. The movie takes place on the eve of the great drought in the state, and the town's main source of income is a dairy farm. The farm is run by a gruff, but kind and hardworking old farmer, who is also the town dentist. In a short period of time, a small boy named Nick (Ben Mendelsohn) is the center of attention as he discovers his own healing powers and the true purpose of his existence.   Nick is the hero of the movie, and we follow him from his childhood until his life is saved by his friend Ben (Jason Clarke). The movie begins with Nick discovering his powers, and he uses them to help the town. As the story unfolds, we get to see Nick's powers evolve and grow, and his friendships grow. Nick is a character you can relate to and you can't help but be moved by him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the film at least a half dozen times. This is one of the most popular of the series. It has an interesting premise that involves a young girl, who in the beginning of the film is being held captive by the evil man who has a cult following. She is taken to a castle in the mountains, where a young man with a gun is chasing her. After a while, he finally catches up with her and she manages to get away from him. The rest of the movie follows her trying to get home. The plot is rather silly and the character development is weak. It's pretty easy to figure out what is going on, but it can be a little hard to keep the focus. However, it is an entertaining and entertaining movie that should be seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good action movie. The movie starts with a great shot of a huge explosion that sends a huge column of smoke up into the air. The camera then slowly zooms in on the column as we see the flames licking up the sides of the column. The column then explodes and the camera zooms out.   This is a pretty cool sequence.  And then a plane crashes into a skyscraper. The plane is a lot bigger than the skyscraper and the plane goes up into it.  The plane comes down and is destroyed and we see more fire on the other side.  Then we see a helicopter flying by.  At the end we see an explosion.  This sequence is cool and a bit scary.  If you liked the earlier sequence I think this is better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is one of those rare movies that, even though it's only 20 minutes long, it still has a long and interesting storyline, which, at times, feels like a really good film that was never made.  "The Day" is about an engineer named John Hurt (played by Christopher Lee) who goes back to the 1940s and discovers a world that is not so different from our own. There are no cars, airplanes, or even air conditioning. All of these are either nonexistent or in limited use, with the exception of a little plane that is carried around by the locals.  Hurt and his partner, Bill Paxton, discover that they are the last humans left alive in the world, and are trying to survive by hunting and eating wild animals. The movie is about these two characters and the story that they tell, but it's not only about them.  The movie also tells the story of the world's last human (played, surprisingly, by Ray Milland), and of a couple of the scientists who work for the US government. This film is also, surprisingly (and I do mean surprisingly), a great action movie.  (1946, British)  The first thing I noticed about "The Way to Earth" is the amazing special effects.  There are some shots in this film that look as if they were made yesterday, and the fact that they were done by a team of professionals who are still working at that time shows just how good the special effects were.  This movie was not just a science fiction movie, but a film that tells a story of two characters who are just trying to find their way back home.  If you are a fan of sci-fi movies, this is a movie that you should not miss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little worried at first when I heard the title of this movie. What was this about? It's an animated movie about a little guy that lives on the roof of a house with his mother and father. He has a friend, a cat named Puff, who has a big nose. I was not a big fan of Puff. He was not my cup of tea. But what I did like was the little girl in this movie that I thought was pretty funny.   So the movie is all about a guy named Lumber Jack who lives on a roof of an old house and he loves to play his lute. One day a woman comes up to him and says "Look, my name is Lulu, but you can call me Lulu. I'm your mother's little girl, and I'm a big girl." And that is just how the story is told. There is a whole lot of jokes about Lulu and how she's a girl and how it's okay to say that, and how you can't get a girl if you can get a guy, and so on and so forth. There are also some really funny songs that the two do.  I thought the whole movie was good, and it has a good message to it.  This is a movie about the fact that girls aren't necessarily more beautiful than boys and that's okay. It's about how you're a man or a woman doesn't have to be perfect.

It was the most imaginative series ever created.   When I saw Alien, I knew it was the movie I'd been waiting for. It was so close to being an instant classic, but never quite got there.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** The "I Don't Know How She Does It" story is based on the life of the famous American comedian, Carol Burnett, who was known as "Carol Burnett the TV star". This is the story of her life and her love story. Carol has a very beautiful singing voice, and has done it well in both TV and movies. Carol was married for over 20 years to her best friend, Edna Quimby. She was an actress, and a wonderful singer. Edna and Carol had a great relationship. She had been a big part of the "I Love Lucy" show, and the "The Carol Burnett Show". She is still very popular with her fans. This is a very good movie that shows Carol at her best. There is a lot of good dancing, and Carol is an amazing singer. She also has a lot to say in this movie. She is an outstanding comedian, and an actress who is still in demand. She will always be one of the best. I recommend this movie to everyone. I loved it, and I recommend it to anyone who loves comedies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You don't have to have a lot of interest in science fiction to like The Expanse.  I don't watch science fiction shows on a regular basis, so I'm a bit surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  That said, the writing was pretty standard and there were a lot more scenes like the one above that were pretty boring. Â The cast was mostly pretty well-known sci-fi actors: Â James Holden, Paul Serene, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Cas Anvar, Melanie Liburd, Alex Kamal, Mackenzie Davis, Dominique Tipper, Anthony Lemke, and Jodelle Ferland.    In addition to the well-loved actors, the show also brought in several well-seasoned sci-fic writers:   James S.A. Corey, Steven Erikson, John Joseph Adams, Daniel Abraham, Daniel H. Wilson, Ty Franck, Joe McCarthy, and Marc Eliot.  All of the above writers contributed to the writing of the first book in the series (the first of many).   The Expanded Universe also featured a lot:  The Star Wars comics series, which was set in the same universe.  The TV series The Outer Limits, which is set in a universe similar to the Expanse universe, and was itself inspired by the books.  And of course, there were the books in the "Old West" series, and the novels in the Star Wars series, all of which were set in similar universe. The Expanse is an interesting look into the future of space travel, and is certainly not without its flaws.    The series, like all of its kind, can be a bit of a slog at times.  But the more I read about the characters, the more they started to become my favorite part of the show.  It is a show that shows the possibilities of what a future with space travel could look like, and it is a pretty exciting vision of a future that is more technologically advanced than anything we have now. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is one of those movies that you can't wait to see because it is just so darn good!   A lot of the actors are from the '70s, but this is a film about the future, and it looks and sounds a lot like it did in the '80s!  This is also a movie about what happens when the government gets too much control over what people can and can't do, which is why this is so relevant today!  There are so many great movies about the '60s and '70's, but few that show the changes that happened in the 1980s.   So why not watch this movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a perfect example of how not to do a horror movie.   The story is terrible and the plot is terrible.  The special effects are pretty bad and the acting is bad.  It is all just too much to take in.  A movie is nothing without a good script and a good director and that is where this film falls flat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is a pretty good movie. The story, with the exception of the third act, is pretty well told and pretty well acted. There is a lot of action and the action is pretty good.  The story was very original and interesting, with a plot that is hard to follow, but I really liked the way the story was told.  The movie has some good dialogue and has some excellent special effects.   The movie also features a good amount of humor and some pretty good slapstick.  There is some pretty solid direction and the movie has a good cast.  I give the movie a 7 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********************** I have always been a huge fan of movies and TV shows, and I've been a fan of sci fi/fantasy films since I was a child. When I saw the movie "The Martian" a few years ago I was immediately taken in. I've always been fascinated with how humans are able to survive on the surface of Mars, and as a science fiction fan I was intrigued to learn how they could survive. I couldn't wait to see how the crew of the Hermes would survive and the science behind it. It was great to see this film and see a crew of astronauts survive on Mars for a few months. The story is interesting and the movie is beautiful to watch. I was also impressed by how well the crew and the scientists were able to communicate with one another in the movie. This is a good film for anyone who likes sci fi or science fiction films, and it's also an easy watch. It's a little hard to follow the movie because it's so visually beautiful, but once you do you'll see that this movie is very well made. It will leave you with a feeling of awe and a strong desire to watch more movies like this one. I'm also impressed that the movie took so long to make and I'm glad they decided to have the movie made. ****************************
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I am in love with this movie. I would say it's better than The Last Samurai or even Inglourious Basterds, though I don't really see why.   If I were to rank it in terms of quality, I would have to say it is on the lower end of the spectrum, but then again, it is a remake of a classic film.  The story itself is somewhat unique and has been made a bit more interesting by the addition of a character played by Billy Dee Williams.  A nice addition, but he does nothing to help bring out the more unique qualities of the film. I also don't like the way the characters interact with each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror movies you should check this one out. This is a very well made movie that has an evil clown lurking in the dark. He is the villain in this movie. He plays a part in the movie but he is the main evil force in the story. He has a few bad guys to deal with. He also has a wife who is a great character. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful woman is getting ready for a party when she notices a guy with a gun. After the gun is fired, she is left paralyzed. She is left alone in a hospital where a doctor, who is not a doctor at all, tells her he is not sure if she is going to recover from the gunshot wound. She asks if he is a man, which he says no.   This movie has all the elements of a classic.  It is dark, beautiful, and funny.  The director, Michael Chapman, is a master of suspense. His cinematography is exquisite.  It is a real pity that this film was never released.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the most underrated science fiction movie ever made. I love the idea of having a time machine, but I don't think that it works very well. The only way you can travel back in time is to find out how to change the past. But how? You can't change the events that have happened in the past unless you are able to change yourself, which I think is very difficult. But the whole movie is about this time machine!   You can tell that a lot of thought went into this movie. It is set in a future where we can change the future. But we have to get to the future first. So we have a time traveler who wants to change all of the things that have taken place in the time he travels back in history. But that is hard, because all the past events happened without his knowledge. The time traveler has to figure out how he can stop the past from happening.   The only thing that bothered me was that the time traveler doesn't realize that he is in the future until he gets to the past! I guess it's kind of like having a car that you can't start! You have to figure it out before you can start it. I also wish that the movie was a little shorter! But that's just me. It was a good time traveling movie that I will see again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you first watch The Shawshank Redemption you think to yourself, "This is a movie about a man with no name that has a hard life in prison and has a lot of time to think."  I can see where you're going with that.  However, after watching the movie a second time you see that it's really more about the inmates, the story of a man who's had a hard time in life and has the gift of gab to say the least.  This is probably the only movie that has the exact same name as the movie, Shawshanks, which is a film about a prison in which the inmates were all criminals, who were all punished for the same crimes.   I have to say, this is an amazing movie.  It was a hard movie to watch at first.  The only thing that kept me going through it was the fact that I was really enjoying the story.  Also, the acting is really good.  This is one of the best prison movies I've ever seen.  If you like prison movies you should really give this a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A nice movie with a good story. It's a very unique idea to have a time machine, a time traveler, that can travel through time. But, what it does is give the idea that we are living in a world that is very similar to our own, except that we can travel backwards and forwards in time. What is really interesting about this movie is that, it takes place in a place that we all know very well, the American Southwest. There is a ranch where a rancher and his family live, and they are really good people who are not afraid to take on any kind of challenge. But this is a movie that is not a western, it is not really a cowboy movie. This is a different kind of movie that has a little bit of everything, and the ending, was really cool. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good time traveling movie.

The film is a fantasy about a group of kids in a village who are caught in a battle with a demon. The demon is really creepy and I was glad they used real creatures instead of puppets. I'm not sure what the kids are up to when they're in the demon's lair, but they are up against some very well written and creepy people. I don't know why they didn't use some more real actors in this film. It's a fun film with a great story and a good soundtrack.

I saw this one at a friend's house when I was about 10 years old. It was a great time!   It is set in a dystopian future in which we have a robot, a machine that's able to think for itself, and a group of people that are supposed to be watching over it.  In a way, it reminded me a lot of "Robot & Frank".   The robot has a voice that is like a machine.

They are a group of kids who are always looking for fun. When they go to the park, they see a girl playing in the water. She is the most beautiful woman in the world and her parents give her a beautiful house in the countryside. She has a very special ability, she can swim from the edge of the ocean to the bottom of the deepest lake. When the children meet the girl, she invites them to her home. They go to her house and the next day, the girl's parents give their daughter a wonderful present. It is a giant boat with a little boy on board. The boy is very good with the boat and the children are very impressed. This is a movie that everyone should see. I saw this movie when I was in 4th grade. It was a little bit boring at first. But then I found out that the movie was really about the importance of a person's happiness and their ability to create a happy life. I was not surprised by the movie at all.

It is not a "horror movie" or a "comedy" it is a very dark and serious story about a girl who gets possessed by a demon and is forced to kill her husband. The movie is pretty good and has a few good scares in it, but it is not as good as other films like "The Devil Inside" or "The Last House On The Left" and in a way it feels like it is missing something.

They are then attacked by a gang of men who are trying to take their things. Then the woman appears. It's the woman in the bar. She is not the only one who wants him to come back to town.

It's a great story that is really great to see and I really hope that a movie like this will be released again.   It's also a good start for a new director, because he's really a good director. I really think that the director could use a bit of work in editing and that the actors can get a bit more of a script. But I really liked it and I hope that it will be seen again. I'm really interested to see what kind of movies this director will be working on in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, the first time I saw it I thought it was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life. It's funny, it's cute, it has a great soundtrack, and it's a fun movie.   It is a story of a young girl named Tiana, who is forced to move into a house with her grandmother, her aunt, and her father.  This is an unusual setup, and the movie plays with it in an interesting way.  Tiana is the only person who can see ghosts, and she is also the only one who has a real interest in the supernatural.  Her grandfather, Dr. John O'Bannon, is an occultist, and a doctor who specializes in the treatment of people with mental disorders.  It's not until the end of the movie that we find out exactly how O'Brien has cured all his patients of their ailments, and he claims to be able to cure Tiana as well.  The movie has a few problems.  There's a bit of a disconnect between the beginning and the end, and Tiana and her grandfather are a little too similar.  Another problem is the music. The music sounds a little cheesy, and is not particularly good.  I was also disappointed that it was so short, and I would have liked a little more information about the story before the ending.  Overall, I loved the movie. It was a fun experience, and would make a great Christmas movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not very often that we see the true story of the "Dorothy and the Wizard" and the two main characters of the movie are the titular Dorothy and the wizard. Dorothy and her sister and her friends were going to visit the Wizard at the Emerald City to get the ruby slippers for a party to be thrown by the Wizard. After they arrive at the castle the wizard asks Dorothy to bring him the slippers which Dorothy is unable to do so. After several unsuccessful attempts to get them Dorothy's sister is about to give up when the Wizard arrives and tells Dorothy to help him in his search for the slipper and gives her the ruby. Dorothy takes the ruby and goes into the forest. When she enters the tree house she falls down a hole in the tree. She finds a chest that opens and Dorothy gets out the slippies. The Wizard then asks Dorothy why she didn't bring the slippy's. Dorothy says that the sloppies would be far too small and the wizards slippers would be too big. He then says that he is not a little girl and that he has seen her before. Dorothy runs off and gets lost and her friend Lucy runs after her and sees a man with a big red nose and red eyes and she tells Lucy that it's the Wizard and they run away. The next morning Lucy finds Dorothy at the bottom of the well and tries to help her, but she's too weak to move. She gets her sister to hold Dorothy up and when they reach the top Lucy tells her that she is in fact the Wizard in disguise. The two women then get married and move to the town of the Wizard's house and live happily ever after. There is no mention of the sliders being found and the slokies never found.

Her mother is an alcoholic, and her father has been in and out of prison for most of her life. It is clear to her that she has to escape the family life and move to the big city. She moves to the city to live with her sister and brother-in-law, but then she gets involved with the drug culture. The movie is an interesting and entertaining look at the drug addiction and violence in the big cities.   I found the movie to be entertaining, even though it was a bit slow at times. There were some scenes that made me laugh out loud, and I enjoyed the humor and humor in the movie. I did not find the acting to be very good. I found it hard to understand what the actors were saying. I was very disappointed that the movie ended with a very bad ending. I hope they put out a better ending. The ending really did not make me feel satisfied. The only way I can see the movie improving from this point on is to have a more solid story line. If they are able to pull it off, I will certainly watch it again.   and finally... if you have seen the movie "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka", this movie is similar. There are many similarities between the two movies, and it is definitely worth a look.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is really entertaining, with a lot of twists and turns that make it really interesting.   The acting was really good, especially by the lead actress.  The movie had a lot to say about race and class and about social relations, but it didn't take it to extremes.  This is a really good movie, I recommend it to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good family movie that shows how hard it is to raise a family. I am a parent and I think the whole movie was well done and had a great message to bring about.  It does have some bad parts. I felt like they could have added more to the movie but they did a good job of showing the hard work that it takes to raise kids. I would recommend this movie to any parent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the first time in a long time that I was glad to see an American movie directed by a non-Asian director.   The movie is an homage to the late great Alfred Hitchcock, with a very well choreographed action scene that makes me glad to be a movie buff.  I haven't seen much of the films of Hitchcock, but I can assure you that he was a master of suspense and I believe he did the same in this film.  The story is well told, and it gives you an amazing insight into the lives of the characters.  For those of you who aren't into Hitchcock, I'm sure this movie will give you a taste of his unique style of filmmaking.  I'm also glad to note that this is a very entertaining movie, which was also the case in Alfred Hitchcock's most recent film, "The Man Who Knew Too Much".   I'd love to see a sequel to this movie, because the story has already been told, but maybe someone will see this film and be interested in seeing the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a movie that is worth watching that's called "A Very Bad Year" which is a satire on the way our society works and deals with our problems. I enjoyed the film. I think it is about a couple who are having a hard time finding a job. They are both old and have nothing to lose. One is in a nursing home, the other is in an insane asylum. The older man is a very bad driver, but the woman is a nice one. The two go to the nursing home to get him a job, but there are not enough jobs and he cannot get a job there. He then goes to the insane asylum, where he meets a girl there and starts to date her. The other patient is a good doctor, but he is not interested in the doctor's patients. They get into a fight and the old man kills him. The doctor is a man who loves his patients and tries to help them, but his old age and his wife's dislike of him means he can't make much progress. I don't think I could make this up. I liked it very much. It's a bit of a black comedy, but it's funny, and I think you would like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Somewhere between 'Wag the Dog' and 'The Wild One,' 'Titanic' is a classic of the genre. And one of the greatest movies of all time."  -Paul M. Sammon   This is the best movie ever made. The most powerful story ever told. The greatest acting ever, including some of the most wonderful performances by all of them. The best of all times. It is a movie that is almost too beautiful to be true. There is no way this movie could have been made before the Titanic disaster. This movie was inspired by the real life disaster and was the final effort to save all of the people aboard the ship, including the two best actors, Jack Nicholson and Elizabeth Taylor. The film also includes the legendary music of composer and pianist Howard Shore. This film is truly an epic and timeless story. A movie that you will never forget.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best of the new horror genre, with a good mix of horror, thriller, thriller thriller, and gore.   The directorial style is pretty similar to the first one, but this one takes the gore a little bit further, and is even more terrifying.  This film has some of the most graphic and violent gore I've seen in a long time, and it makes this a very dark and depressing film.  The story follows a group of people who have been trying to track down a missing young girl. The girl had recently been kidnapped and killed by a group called the Death Party.  After the group kills and mutilates the girl, they then leave the girl's corpse in the middle of a field.  Then, the group comes back and mutils the body again.  However, after a few weeks, the body starts to grow back, and the Death party decides to leave the body to grow, and they leave the bloodstains all over the field. After that, the gang find out that the girl was still alive, and her body was mutilated even more, and now they are trying to find a way to kill the girl and take her body.  At the end of the film, a lot of people die, and there are a lot more body parts and blood than I was expecting.  I really enjoyed this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to believe that this film has been out for over two decades now. It's one of those cult classics that everyone loves. And it's one that doesn't get nearly enough respect. I love this movie. I also love the book on which it is based. It is well-written and funny. It has a great cast. The soundtrack is great. It even has a scene where two women make out in a church. And then one of them gets up and dances. It just doesn't stop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ It's been awhile since I watched the movie "The Good German" which is an interesting movie. It is a film that tries to show the consequences of a war on the civilians. It's a story about a young soldier that becomes a spy in the German army during WWI. His wife is killed and his sister is in prison. The film starts with a short prologue that shows that he is on the verge of losing his wife and sister. Then he is captured by a British patrol. He is then made a soldier. He's taken prisoner and given to a German officer. He gets into trouble when he has to kill his fellow soldiers to escape. He then is told that his sister has been taken to prison. So he decides to steal a train and find her. The Germans find him and try to kill him. But he gets out and then he goes to his sister's place where he finds a man and a woman. He tries to make it clear that he has no love for them. They refuse to listen and eventually the man shoots him. He goes to the train where he sees the woman and the man. They say that they know he has been captured by the British so they let him go. He ends up in Germany where he is told to report to his superior officer. The next morning he is given a gun and a mask and told to take the train back to England. The train stops at a town called Ludendorff. He walks into the town and starts to shoot everyone he can. He finds a woman who he decides he is going to marry. The woman is a German girl that is called "Fritz". He starts to fall in love with her. He tells her that he's going to get his revenge on the Germans and get revenge for her death. He has to find a way to escape and find the train. Fritz is killed during the escape attempt. He comes across a man named Wirtz who is the only man who can get to the front of the train without being seen. He takes him on a trip to find the key to the key. They have a good time on the trip. After that they meet up with the train and it is late at night. They escape the train at night and make it back to Ludendorf. It was an interesting film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only bad thing about this movie is that the director, Mike Judge, is a total dick.  There's some really bad dialogue in the movie and the director can't help but be a dick about it.    I guess it's like "Fist of Fury" or "The Warriors."   He just doesn't get it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lucky 7" is a film that has everything that you want from a good western.  It's a good old fashioned western, with a nice amount of action.    There is a lot of shooting and lots of good laughs.    The film doesn't have a lot in the way of plot and I'm not sure that it makes much of an impact on you.  This is a good time for the old west, especially since it has some good actors in it.  There are a lot more of the classic western films in this film than there are in most of the other westerns, and that is why this film has a lot to recommend it.

All in all, a decent movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a pretty good movie.  I think that the plot is a little bit too good for its own good, though.  The story is about a group of friends that meet at a local park and decide to go swimming.  They are all a little afraid to get into the water, but then a beautiful girl jumps in the water and swims to the other side of the pool.  There is a great movie about a beautiful woman, but it is not very good at all.  I liked the way that they showed a lot of people in the pool at the same time, and it was very interesting to watch how they swam around in the hot water, and also how they got out.   I would recommend this movie to anyone, and if you like swimming, you should watch this movie.

It is a very strong piece of work, one that deserves a great deal of attention and respect from all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a bit of a slow burn. It is not a "good" movie by any means, but it is good. I don't know how they pulled it off. It's just about a week before the first presidential debate and you know that the Republican candidates are going to come out swinging at each other. Well, not so fast! After the first debate, the Republicans come to the White House and, naturally, Donald Trump is the only one to show up! Well, he comes in with his wife and kids and the rest of the family is in town on vacation. Trump is at a loss for words. He doesn't know what to say and the first lady tells him to just shut up and leave the room. Then he tells her to call him Donald because she sounds like a "nasty woman." Well, the first wife does call him that but Trump is still trying to think of something. Then the first daughter comes up and says she would like to speak to him. Trump starts to talk about how his father, Fred Trump, was the first African-American to run for president. The first daughter then says she is going to run her father out of town! Well what do you know? Donald is having a hard time not laughing. Then they all sit down to a breakfast meeting with the First Lady and the children. The First Lady is telling all the children stories about the history of the United States. Well of course there is a story about when President Obama visited China. Donald Trump walks in and says how his people were so happy to see that he was able to shake hands with the Chinese leader. Well that is when the first woman walks up to the table and tells Trump that she wants to make a movie about the first president! Well that's when it gets really crazy. This woman has to be the biggest idiot I have ever seen. The only thing she knows about is that President Reagan was a good president and she wants a sequel to "Reagan" with President Trump. Trump goes back to the kitchen and decides that he has enough and that he would like the first family to leave. He says he would rather have his children leave with him than with this idiot. Well after they are gone, Donald has a hard day's sleep and goes to bed. Well he doesn't get much rest until the next morning. There is a knock on the door and he opens it to find a big white limo with the first daughters inside.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of The Godfather series and this movie is an adaptation of the first film. It is a very good movie. The story is told very well, with an excellent score. The acting is pretty good too, with great performances by the four main characters.   Funny story:  After seeing a screening of this movie at a friend's house, I went over to see it again. I got to the theater at about 11:30pm, the movie was over. I went up to the front row. A guy came over and said to me: "You must be the guy who is sitting in the front of the theater." I said, "No, I am the guy sitting in front of you." I asked if he was the same guy who had seen the movie earlier in the evening. He said, Yes. I told him that I liked the movie very much. He started saying that it was good. He then said that it had some good moments. He added that it is a good idea to read the book first before you watch the movie. I said that I did not understand what he was talking about, so I did. He told me that this is not a book, but a movie. Then I asked him what the book was about. He replied, It is about the life of the Godfather, and about the mafia. Then he said that the film was about the murder of a young boy who is called "The Boy Who Wouldn't Die". I did my best to understand what was being said. He mentioned that there were three murders in the movie, and the murders were not shown. Then, he told me about the scene where the mobster who had killed the boy and his family walks into a restaurant and is about to eat his dinner. The mobster notices the boy sitting at a table, but he does not look up at him. The boy then starts to cry. The father of the boy, an older man, picks up a tray, and starts to throw the boy's food at the mob boss, who in turn throws the food back. The Mobster, however, does not turn around. He just smiles, and leaves the restaurant. The older man then walks out of the restaurant, followed by the boy. Then the mobboss picks up the tray, throws it at the boy who starts to run. He gets caught by the mobsters and is killed by them. Then we
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film takes place in the year 3023, in a small, remote town called Arcadia.  The main characters are the teenage daughter of a famous doctor and the boy who will become her husband.  This is the year of the coming of the great age of the earth, in which we will all live together.   As the film starts, we are shown the life of a typical American town.  The streets are crowded with people, cars, and children running around.  Then the father of the bride and the son of the groom appear in the town square.  We learn that they are the leaders of the town, which they have conquered with the help of the local alien races, and that their daughter is to be married to one of them.  After that, we learn about the strange things that happened to the town in the last 100 years.  There is a great deal of paranormal activity, and strange creatures, like the "Gigantopithecus", the "Polar Bear Man", the  "Nemesis", the the "Raptor Woman", and the "Tyrannosaurus" are roaming the streets.  All of this takes place during the "Golden Age of Earth", a time when the earth has reached a technological level that has not been seen since before the days of the dinosaurs.    The characters are interesting, and the way in which the story is told is interesting.  They are not exactly likable, but that is not a bad thing.  I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction and paranormal, and especially to anyone interested in history.  A great movie for Halloween!

This is one of the funniest things I have seen on TV in years.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Sjr from A Great Sitcom This is an excellent comedy. The characters are all very different, but their relationships are realistic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was a good introduction to the world of The Shining, but unfortunately, it was just a good film. This film had a lot of things that were unique and interesting, but it also had some of the same things that make the original so memorable, which are the same elements that have caused people to go back to see the original over and over again. For example, there are some really disturbing things about the opening, such as the man with no face and a man who has an incredibly evil look to him. This is definitely one of the creepiest things I've seen in a long time, and it was really unsettling at times. The movie's second half was also very interesting. It starts out in the small town of Overlook and is about a girl named Laurie who is the daughter of a doctor. It is mentioned a few times that she was sent away from her home at an early age to a boarding school. When the movie starts we learn that the school is run by an eccentric old man named Dr. Frank (who is played by Stanley Kubrick). Dr. F is also played by Kubrick. The story picks up when Dr. Frans is in a coma. He is actually a bit of a genius and he was the one who discovered the formula for a serum that is used to control the Overlook Hotel. Frank decides to take the serum to the Overlooking, which turns out to be a terrible mistake. Frank dies and Laurie is left alone to live with the Overlords. We also learn that there are other Overlords, and we are told that they are all evil and evil-looking. We see the Overlord known as Jack Torrance (who plays a small part as well) and we also learn about Jack's evil twin brother, who is played in a small role by Jack Nicholson. Jack's brother is also shown to be evil, but I guess you could say that he is more evil than Jack. There are a few other things about Jack that I won't say here, as I think it would ruin the movie for you.   There is a lot to like about this movie. There is a very creepy sense of mystery to the movie, which is part of what makes it such a memorable experience. It also has a lot more suspense to it than the original. There was also a lot I liked about the way Kubrick played the movie. The acting was a bit different than I have seen in other Kubrick movies, but that just
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is a semi-sequel to the cult hit "The Big Chill", directed by John Landis and written by the co-writer of the first "The Dude" himself, Jeff Bridges. This sequel is based on the short story by the same name, in which Jeff Bridges plays Jeff Lebowitz, a college student who lives with his girlfriend, the waitress Elaine (Shelley Duvall), in a house that is the "Big Leb's", a bowling alley that is owned by a millionaire. When Jeff is asked to help her husband (played by Jeff Bridges) who is working on a project to open the bowling alley, he is offered the chance to play a game against a friend who has just recently arrived from Japan. When he gets back to his room, he finds that he has left his bowling ball in the "big" and that he will have to go back to the house to retrieve it. The only thing that is missing is the bowling ball itself. While Jeff is walking through the alley, a man (David Huddleston) appears to him and asks him to help him find a "big ball". After Jeff finds the bowling balls, he returns to his girlfriend and tells her what happened. She decides to go to the bowling lane and, of course, she runs into the guy who she asked to play. The guy tells her that there is a "ball" there and that if she gives him the ball, she will win. The next day, the man and his wife (played with excellent comedic timing by Gene Wilder) come to Jeff's house to try to get the bowling equipment, but the bowling alleys are closed because of a rainstorm. They then invite Jeff to join them in the bowling game. Jeff accepts and goes to the alley to retrieve the bowling pin, only to find that the bowling machine is not working. The man suggests that he should go to a bar to drink some alcohol and that it might help him get the machine working. This suggestion is not without a certain amount of humor and a lot of winking at the audience, as the bartender tells Jeff that he is a big fan of Jeff's. After a while, Jeff does indeed find the bowling machines, but his girlfriend is still there and the two decide to go get a drink. Jeff and his girlfriend end up at a bar called The Wack-a-Doo, a place where the bartender is not
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you have the chance to watch a movie like this, you need to do so.  This movie is a real treat.  The movie takes place in a small town called Tarrytown, Indiana.    When the movie starts we are introduced to the main character, John Winger.  John is a good-hearted, hard working man who does the best he can for his family.    He is married to a beautiful, intelligent woman, Nancy (Mary Jo Pehl), and they have a young daughter named Megan (Laura Dern).   But John has one problem.  He has lost the love of his life, his best friend, and he is dying.  It's a tough time for John.  But when he sees a little girl named Megan running across the street, his life changes forever.  There is only one way for John to find the girl who saved his life.  Then it becomes a race to find Megan.  When we first meet John, he is a lonely, unhappy man.  I guess he never really had a family, as he does not seem to have a lot of friends, not even his own daughter.  This is shown by how he runs the streets, talking to a guy he once met on the bus.  The first time we see him, John is in a daze.  One day, he finds a girl running in the street and tries to pick her up.  After some time, John notices that she has a big blue eye.  However, John also finds out that she can talk to animals.  Later on, John meets another girl who has a blue eye, and they get along quite well.  Eventually, John finds a way to win Megan's heart.  To do this, he has to become the "perfect man" by learning all the "secrets" that only she knows.  In order to do this John must be a good, loyal friend to his sister-in-law, Nancy.  At first, it looks like John has it all figured out.  His best friend and his daughter have moved away and Nancy is happy.  Nancy, however, does not always approve of John's relationship with Megan.    Eventually, things come to a head and Nancy learns that John has been keeping secrets from her.  Even though Nancy has never seen John's secret photos, she is still worried about him.  We can see
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was filmed at a time when the war was not going well and the American people were ready to take a chance. In the beginning the film shows the American soldiers going to fight in the war against the Japanese. There is a scene that shows a Japanese plane flying over an American base. As the plane gets close to the American base the camera pans out and the pilot is shown to be a pretty good looking man. He tells the soldiers, "Hey! Don't you know what we are about to do? We are going to take over this base and make this base ours!"   In a couple of seconds a Japanese soldier kills the pilot. The American soldiers are horrified and the Japanese pilot is taken to the jail to be tried for war crimes.   This is the beginning of the film. The war is not going so well and it is getting worse. As time goes on the American army gets more and more worn out and it seems as if the war is coming to an end.   and the film ends with the American soldier and a few other soldiers talking about the future.   The movie is great, a classic of the genre, and one that will last long after its release. The ending is a nice touch as well.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love this movie and it is a shame that it is only available on VHS.   The movie starts out slow, but that is not the end of the story.  I was a bit skeptical about this movie, but it is really good.  As a matter of fact, I was impressed.  It is very funny, very silly, and very moving.  This movie is a bit different than the others.  The director takes some chances, but there are no real bad jokes.  There are some really funny moments, and there are a lot of funny scenes.  You can't help but laugh a lot.  Some of the moments are so good that you can't take them back.  If you like this movie or have any doubts about it, you should definitely watch it.

I don't really like the ending of the movie but I thought it was a nice ending.

I do think this is one of those rare movies that I could recommend to people who do not want to see a whole lot of action.  This is not a "top notch" movie by any means, but it is entertaining.

This is the kind of movie that will make you laugh, cry, and smile all at the same time. It has that old school feel to it. If you like this kind of movies, you will love this movie. I think this is the movie that should be on the list of top 10 movies that you watch on a rainy night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an old timer of the horror genre and I have to say that this movie is really solid. The story is well told and there is a lot of blood and guts in this movie. The character is really creepy and you can't help but feel sorry for them. There are a lot more interesting characters in the movie but I didn't want to put this on the top 10 list because it doesn't belong on that list. I think it belongs at the top 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the movie. I loved it! I didn't know what to expect. I didn' t know it was a movie about a little girl who gets turned into a baby and is rescued by a little old man. It's not long before she's running around the city and she meets a girl who is the same age as her and who turns into a big, bad wolf. The girl is very young. I think it's a very cool idea. There are a couple of bad guys, one of whom has a big sword. The wolf is big and scary. I thought it was very funny. I liked that it was all over a city of people and that they had to go on a mission to rescue a little little girl. The music is great. I like it! It's good to watch a movie that isn't too long.

The plot revolves around a band of misfits who go on a mission to steal an experimental spacecraft that the government has been working on for years. It is a very cool movie.   I would give the movie 5 stars but it is very hard to get 5 stars for this movie because it is just too long. It also has a really bad ending.   a long movie about a band  This movie is a sci-fi action flick about a bunch of kids that take on a giant robot that was designed to wipe out the entire planet. This movie has a lot of action and some cool space battles. The cast is good and the plot is great. The movie is good at the beginning and then just gets longer and longer. The only complaint I have is that I wish there was a longer time skip to the ending so that the movie could have ended on a more positive note. I thought the ending was just too good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "B" movie is a real one.  It's not really a "bad" movie, but it is not a very good movie either.  This is a movie that I watched when I was still a kid.  I was in the 7th grade and I watched it.  It was on TV and I remember seeing it with a lot of my friends, and even at one point it was the only movie we would watch.    I remember the "B Movie" is about a girl who is a cheerleader, and a boy who is her boyfriend.  The movie has a lot more going on than it's pretty much only plot.  One of the most interesting things about the movie is that at the beginning of the movie, when the boy is looking for the girl, he does not know the girl's name.  He just knows her as "The Girl with the Long Hair".   The other girl in the movie that you will know is the girl with the long hair.  They are friends and she gets into the football game with the boy.  At one point in the football match, they are playing against each other and they are both fighting back and forth.  During this fight, the girl runs into a tree.  After she gets up, she is found by a policeman and they take her to the hospital.  But the doctor tells her that the tree broke her arm and will have to get plastic surgery.  She then asks the doctor if they can cut her arm off and let her get plastic surgeries on it. He says that she can get plastic Surgery on it if she will promise that she won't get in the way of her boyfriend's football game.  What a cute girl!   This is the story of a cheer leader and her boyfriend, but I think it has more to do with a girl with a broken arm than a boy and a girl.  When the boy and girl play against each each other, the boy gets more than he can handle and ends up throwing the girl out of the window of a car.  There is a lot going on in the story, but you have to remember that it is a "B movie".  I think the best part about the "A" movie  is that it has a good amount of comedy.  In this movie, the comedy is not over the top, it's just not as funny as some of the other "A movies

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason this movie isn't a 5-star is because it's just so darn good. The movie takes place in the city of Nairobi and tells the story of two men: one a cop and one a private eye. The former of which is played by the great Nairo Quintana. He has been sent to Nairobio to investigate a series of murders in the area of Nzuri and he gets to meet with a woman that appears to be the victim of the crime. Her name is Lina (Lina Machorima), and she was a young woman who had just graduated from college and was on her way to find a job. Lina had been in a relationship with a man who also was a private investigator and was responsible for her death. However, when the man was arrested and Lina's body was found, he was acquitted of the murder and it was determined that the real killer had been the police who had been looking for him. This movie isn the only one that I have seen where the killer was also an innocent person. Lonesome, cold and cruel. A good, realistic film that is just as real as the city it takes place.

The main character, named John, is a good and righteous police officer who gets captured by the bad guys and is rescued by a beautiful female cop. They are able to get John back to the station. This is not easy for the cops. The bad guys are very evil and brutal. They torture and kill people all the time. When they capture John, the bad guy asks the cops if he can have John as a slave. The cops think it is too much. John escapes and tries to warn the cops about the bad dudes. John tries to kill the baddie but he is killed before he can. The police are then able to arrest the baddies. After that the cops get back to work. They get to work as good cops and protect the citizens of New York City.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most beautiful movies of the year. I was a big fan of director Alejandro González Iñárritu before this, but this movie really took me by surprise. It's beautiful, heart wrenching, heartbreaking, funny and a really beautiful film. It is a really interesting look at life and a very different take on the whole "God" thing. I think it's a very interesting film to watch and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had heard the name "The Producers" a few years ago and I remember hearing about the big movie about the Producers in Hollywood called "The Big Muddy" starring the very famous Jerry Lewis. I remember watching it in the theater when I was a child. I have never seen a movie like it. This movie is one of the best ever made. It is a true story about a great show business legend who, with the help of his protege, a young actor named Clark Gable, set out to make a movie that would be an instant hit and take down the big studios and their top-billers. It was to be the greatest Hollywood movie ever made and it is. It has a great cast and is filled with the best performances ever. The movie is funny, exciting, and at the end you will not be able to forget it. I think this movie deserves to be seen by all of us who have an interest in film. It's just great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure that if you don't like it, it's because you are just a spoiled person that didn't have the courage to watch the first one. I was pretty happy to see that a sequel was made to the first film and it is worth watching. The story has a little bit of a twist at the end but I think that was the only surprise in the movie. The acting was pretty good as well. I found that some of the best parts of the movie were when the main characters are talking to each other and laughing. I think the first movie was a little too serious and that the second movie was the right way to go about things. I can't wait to see the third movie. I have no idea what will happen next in the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Stand of The US Army in Iraq was an awesome movie, that's for sure.  It had a lot of action and a lot a drama to it, but the best part of it all was that the American soldiers and the Iraqi soldiers didn't hate each other at all, and that's what really made this movie.  It was a really nice story with a great ending.   I've read that the story took place in 2003, so that means that the film takes place in 2004, and there's a lot that happens in 2004.  The story takes place over a couple months.    The movie starts off with a lot going on.  A group of American soldiers are stationed at Camp Victory, a military base that was established in 2004 and is located in a large city called Basra, Iraq.  These soldiers are the last to be evacuated from the base, and the first to be killed off.  When these American soldiers finally make it out of the base into the desert, the Iraqi troops are nowhere to be found.  This isn't too surprising since the soldiers were never supposed to have left the base.  In fact, the first thing the soldiers are supposed to do when they get back is make sure that all the troops who left never come back.  Then the soldiers try to find a base to rest in, but that's a difficult task.  Apparently, this base was originally the home of a secret underground military base, where all the top military officials were trained.  Unfortunately, the base is now surrounded by the Iraqi army.  Because of this, the Americans are able to move around freely in the city, and they also have the advantage of being able to use their high-tech military equipment.  One of the things that the soldiers like the best about the base are the huge tanks they can drive.  Also, the soldiers love their M-16's.  After the Iraqis have been cleared out of Camp Victory and have no way to get in or out of Iraq, there is no way for the Americans to get out.  However, the army isn't done with the soldiers yet.  They want to get a report on the status of the troops in their base. So, the American troops are sent out to find the troops that have been left behind.  But what will they find when they do?  Will they be able to make it back to their base?    The
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* (5 out of 5 stars) ******************** I'm not a big fan of horror movies. The first one I ever saw was Poltergeist (1982) and I was disappointed. That was the only movie I've seen that was actually scary. The next two I watched were a lot better. I saw Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) about ten years ago and I found it to be very good. The same can be said about Halloween (1988) and the original Nightmare on Demonhead (1985). The first two are both worth a watch, the third is just okay. The original Nightmare was the first time that I've ever heard of the character of Pennywise. The character has since become a staple of children's literature. In The Evil Dead (1981) the character was the leader of a cult and was described as having a "mutton face" and a "tattooed face". The Evil dead has become a classic horror film, and I highly recommend it to fans of the genre. ******************************* The EvilDead is a short horror movie which I highly enjoyed. I hope that it makes it to the future. It's not the best horror movie out there, but it's a good watch. The music is good and there's a nice little jump scare at the end. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the use of a voice over to tell the story. I don't know why they did it, but I don the movie wasn't as scary without it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no idea that the movie that opened with was called The Man Who Killed Donny Osmond.   When I saw the trailer, I was not surprised that a remake of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was about a man who tries to help a young woman find her father's murderer.  The movie is actually pretty good, and I found it interesting that the murderer, who has the look of an average man, is played by John Cazale.  I like his voice, and it's an unusual choice, but he's quite good in the movie.  This is one of those movies that you have to watch, because it's quite different from anything you've seen before.  There is a lot of action, but the movie is really a psychological drama about two people who have a lot in common, and who are victims of their own circumstances.  As I said, it's a fairly good movie, but not a very good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was so good that I can't even remember what happened. It was so funny that I laughed out loud a couple times. I would have liked to see more of the bad guys, but there was not much of that. The one thing that really annoyed me was the music in the movie. The soundtrack was not that great, and it did not really help that the movie was in 3D, but it wasn't a bad thing. The bad guys were also not that bad. They did not have to be. They were kind of bland, and not all that funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say this movie is great! The movie is about a young man who lives on a farm in the woods. The farm is small, but the man can do anything. The man lives in a shack with two horses and a donkey. When the man's brother gets kidnapped, the man goes to the local sheriff to find the kidnapper.  The sheriff, who is a nice guy, wants to go to the woods to look for the man. The sheriff doesn't seem to like the man and asks the man to help him out by cutting down some trees.  The man agrees to do that for $500.    The man does as the sheriff tells him to and goes to cut down some pine trees. When he gets to the top of the tree he starts to fall.  The sheriff grabs the man with his bare hands and saves him.  When the sheriff gets back to his shack, he finds the man hanging from a tree.      He asks the boy if he is okay.  He is, but is it really that bad?   When he looks up he sees the sheriff, the sheriff who is wearing a hat.  That's when the sheriff makes a comment about how a good hat can be very useful.  Once the sheriff is done with the man, the boy goes off to look around.  While he is doing that, the Sheriff comes up to him. The Sheriff tells the boy that he is going to find a lost girl.  One thing leads to another and the sheriff and the boy get lost in the trees.   The Sheriff asks the boys if they are lost.  They tell him yes.  Then the Sheriff asks them where they are going.  Both boys tell him they are getting lost.     The sheriff tells them that they will find the girl when they find the lost girl, which will be some time.  After a while, the two boys go to look at the woods around the shack.  It is dark and they can see a few trees. They see a woman and a dog and the woman starts to follow the boys into the woods in the opposite direction.  At that point, the boys realize the woman is a witch.  In order to keep the woman from following them, the men must make a fire.  This is where the story takes a turn.    The next day the sheriff sees the two children.  Since the children did not come

It has a lot of twists and turns in it, which is a good thing, but it's not all that interesting. If you're looking for a good film to watch when you have a bit of time on your hands, this is the movie for you, but if you have too much time on you hands then it may not be the movie you want to see. It is very well done, and it's worth watching. The ending of the movie is really good, and a great way to end a story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a really good movie that is really funny and has a very interesting story to tell.   The plot is very simple: a guy named Jack is having a rough time with his wife (which he knows to be the real reason for the bad behavior). He is a great man, but is also really immature and lazy. When a group of college students, led by a beautiful girl named Emma, decide to help him out of his funk, he agrees to help them out in return. Jack's friends are pretty much just his friends.  I think that this movie has a lot of heart and is a really fun movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished the film, and was a bit disappointed by the end.  It's a good story, but there is a lack of character development that leaves a lot of questions.    For example, why is there a black widow on a boat in the middle of the ocean?   There are only two people on the boat, and the other two are dead.  There is a woman, named Miss Alice, who's in the boat with the widow, but she doesn't speak a word.  She has a black cat on her shoulder, and she has a gun that is always loaded.  The only other people in the movie are the doctor, the nurse and a young boy who is the assistant of the doctor.  They all talk in a low voice, and you don't hear anything but that.  It's a slow, sad film.  I just hope the director has the talent to make a good one next time around.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very well acted film. The story of a group of teenagers who are in trouble with the law is very simple. But the story is more complex than the simple plot and characters suggest. The young people in this film are not the usual teenagers. They are not stupid, they are not lazy. They can make some good choices. This movie shows the possibilities of young people. They grow up in a hard environment and find out life is not so simple. The teens have a sense of justice and they can be good people, even if their actions don't always make them popular. There is a scene where one of the teens, the "cool" one, finds a dead rat in the toilet and takes it home. The next morning, the same rat is in the bed and the other teens think it is hilarious. One teen gets a hold of the rat and puts it in the freezer, and the others just laugh at it. When the rat is returned to the freezer the kids don't laugh anymore. They go to a pool hall, which is a bad idea, because it is the same pool hall as the one where the rat was put in. They have a great time, until one of them is pulled over for speeding and the officer notices the rat in his glove compartment. It's then that he learns the rat has been taken to the police station. It is then that the movie turns into a nightmare. The cops try to find out who put the rat on the police car, but no one has the key. And there is a girl that gets caught in the crossfire of the police. It gets even worse when the girl dies of a heart attack in the police garage. The film ends with the kids being sent to a juvenile hall. I didn't care for the ending, because I didn' t find it funny, but I still liked the movie. I was a little surprised when the movie had a scene at the end where a girl and her boyfriend are walking to the car, and she passes the rat, and he is gone.

It takes a long time and some pretty intense action before he gets it. He has a whole bunch of henchmen to protect him. It is a great old school car chase movie with a cool car chase scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Man on Earth is an entertaining action movie that doesn't make a lot of sense. The plot is pretty much what you'd expect from a comic book movie, as a man and a woman get separated and the man goes looking for the woman. The only reason this doesn't suck is because the movie is good, and the acting is good. There's a bit of humor to be found in the movie, and there are a lot more action sequences than you'd usually expect in a movie like this. The action is pretty good, but the acting gets to be a little weak in the middle, and it's hard to follow the characters without the occasional cheesy line. There are some decent action scenes that aren't as good as some other action movies in this genre, but there's enough here to keep the movie interesting. The film is about an action movie, but it's also about a man trying to find a woman. It's not the best movie in the world, but I give it a thumbs up for the action, acting, and a few decent laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a scene early on in the movie where we get to see an all-female army.  I don't know why it's a problem that this is the only place in the film where a group of women appears.  It's not even that bad in itself.   The problem is when the women are ordered to "maintain the integrity of the men" by being silent and "doing nothing"  It is so bad it actually makes me want to laugh at the women.  There are some funny moments.  When the soldier is asked by the women how he is doing, he responds "How are we supposed to talk to each other when we are the only ones who are wearing a uniform?  It would have been funny if it was done by a bunch of male soldiers.  The scene was funny, but not very memorable.  I have a hard time believing that this movie was actually made.  The movie is over by the time we get the soldiers and women back to the camp.  They get to meet each other and the soldiers become friends.  One of the soldiers is actually a woman.  This is not a problem as she is not that bad a character.  She is a strong-willed woman who is a good soldier.  Later on we get a glimpse of the future when the soldiers are sent off to fight in World War II.  As soon as the women come back, they are told to go home.  What the hell?  This film is about how the women in the army are oppressed and are treated badly.  We have the soldiers all trying to get into a relationship with each other.  At one point one of the guys starts to ask a woman out, but she responds "I don´t like you!"  Is this really what this movie is about?  I guess that´s what happens when you film a female soldier and then try to make her a soldier.

The ending is a nice touch.  The movie starts off with some very cheesy effects, but then gets serious as we learn the origin of the evil that has taken over the town and how a scientist has to save the world.      The acting is good throughout, with the best performance by the late, great George Kennedy ( The Thing, The Wicker Man ).    Kennedy had a bit of a bad reputation when he did his final movie, but he did a lot better in this than he did in his final film, The Last Man on Earth.     The only thing I don't like about the movie is the ending, but there is nothing really wrong with it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to give a good review about the movie. I was not expecting much from this movie and I didn't get much. It was a really hard movie to watch. The movie was pretty boring. I mean, there was not much going on. It's like a typical romantic movie. It had a lot of scenes where it showed how the characters were talking to each other and whatnot. It also showed that the movie had a theme about love. The story was pretty well done. I just don't understand why the writer decided to change the character of the guy who was the main character to a woman. That was really dumb. She wasn't even the same character. She's like one of those people who only have one character. And it was just her name. It didn't make sense. I don't know why the director made the changes to this character. It made no sense at all. I guess it was supposed to show how love and friendship are important. And I guess that it showed that a man is different from a woman because of his ability to love and be in a relationship with another person. I think that it was kind of a story about a man and a woman's relationship. And the girl just showed her love to the man and then she left the guy. It wasn't the movie that made me angry. I'm just a really stupid person and I couldn't understand what the hell the movie was about. It makes no sense to me. But, I guess this movie had enough story for me to watch and to understand it.

But I thought that the ending was really nice, and even though I didn't like it I'm glad I watched it. I liked that it was very funny and a little touching, and the ending really brought it all together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a couple of comments: 1. The movie is about the last days of the world and there are very good things and bad things about it. 2. The ending is very emotional and very sad. 3. I liked the ending but I don't think it was the best ending in the movie. It's a good ending, but it's not as good as the beginning. There are a couple things I wish had been different: 1) The end is so abrupt that it doesn't feel like a conclusion. 2) There is no mention of the aliens. 3) The aliens are too cute. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was a lot of fun to watch and a lot better than most of the other movies I have seen from the 70's.  I like this movie a lot because it shows a bit about what happened after the fall of Berlin, and it was a nice change from the usual propaganda film from the west. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was expecting this film to be a bit boring and not very good but it surprised me.  There is a lot of bad stuff going on here with the cop, the cop-bitch and the other bad guys.    The first half is about the cop (M.C. Gaines) trying to catch up to a bad guy who is out of the picture.    It is a very short story about a bad cop trying to find the bad guy.  This movie had an interesting plot line.  It is really hard to find a good cop in the 1970's.  They were mostly in jail.  I loved the film, and I really enjoyed it.  The music and acting was great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw this film, it was the first thing that I watched on my own, so I had no idea what to expect.  I was blown away by how much fun this movie is to watch and I have to say that I love that it has such a great soundtrack, that really helps the movie to be a lot more than a straight action movie.  I really wish that more movies like this one existed, that I could see a lot of the great action movies that come out every year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is not much to say about this movie. I had never seen the film, so I'm not going to give any impressions about it. It's a pretty good movie, with a great cast, and a fun story. It would have been nice if the characters would have stayed together longer. But, as it is, it's a good little movie that you can watch in the car, on the beach, or at home with your friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The Good Son Â is the best of the bad-boys in the film industry. Â Â There is a lot of money to be made in the bad boys, but few of them can stand the test of time.  This one was a low-budget, no-name production, but it still made it into the "Best of the Worst" section.    It seems a shame that this movie is about two "good" boys who are being raised by their step-mother, who is a complete psychopath.  The good boy, Chris, is a little kid who is pretty much a spoiled brat who thinks he's a great singer.  It seems a bit unfair that the movie takes place in an orphanage, and yet the orphanage is full of spoiled brats and drug addicts.  But, this movie has it's own charms, such as the way the actors are allowed to act for their characters, and the way that Chris and the other kids are not afraid to stand up to their mothers.  This movie is not a movie about good and evil, it's about good people doing good things, and bad people doing bad things.  As an adult, I think it's pretty obvious that there is a reason why Chris and his friends are being taken care of by their mother, and that reason is because she has a lot to gain by keeping them away from the bad people.  What this movie does well is it shows us a side of the orphans that we haven't seen before, and it's good to see the bad guys having some fun too.  I also think it would be fun to see a movie like this in which the bad kids actually learn to respect the good kids.  And here we have it, the "best" of the "worst."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know who's to blame for this movie's existence. If you ask me, it's the writer, James L. Brooks. He had a hit movie called Spaceballs, but he never wrote another one.   So he's sitting around in his house and he's looking at his computer and he starts clicking around and he clicks on some web sites and he comes across a website where there's a guy who's in the hospital with a heart attack and he says that he's doing better now and he thinks that the doctors were right about him having this heart attack. So he gets on the Internet and he finds this guy's website, and he gets more information and he goes back to the hospital and he calls his wife and his wife's doctor and he tells them about this guy, and they tell him about this patient and they say that they have a lot of work to do. So now, he's back in his home in a wheelchair and he wants to go to the doctor and get his heart fixed and he has no money to do that. So the doctor comes in and he tries to give him money to get his surgery and he won't take it.  So he goes on to tell the doctor what he's told the woman's doctor about the man with the heart attack, and she tells him about a guy named John. So John's wife is an actress and she's got a thing for the guy and she says that she'll go and get him to come over. So she does and she brings him over and he sits down and she gets him to put his legs up and he looks like he's about to die, so the woman comes back and she starts kissing him and she comes in again and she takes off his clothes and she goes and she puts a gun to his head and she pulls the trigger and he dies.  The doctor comes back in and says that they were able to save his life, but now John is very ill and he doesn't know what to do with himself, so he can't go out. So it's time for his wife to go out to help him.  But he has this thing about her and he is very jealous about her. He's not married, so it's kind of strange.  So the story continues, and now John has to go back and get her to come and help him, but she has to get in his car and he can only get in it with a wheelchair
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think that this movie is a bad movie. I liked it a lot. It was funny, and the movie didn't take itself too seriously. I thought that it was a good action movie, and it was good at that. It has lots of action scenes. This movie was a bit short. I'm not sure if it would have been better with more action. I don't know why the story had to end. Maybe it was too short. Maybe I was not in the mood for a story about a little boy. I really liked this movie.

I haven't seen a movie quite like this since  "Citizen Kane"  .   It's got a strong cast, an amazing script, a strong story and a strong acting performance from John Barrymore.      "J.F.K" is a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie "The Dark Tower"  is one of the most famous fantasy movies of all time. This movie is not only famous, but one of its main features is its "dark" and mysterious story line. This story line has been adapted several times since the movie's inception, but never quite the same way. In the beginning of the film the film is set in a small Kansas town, where the hero Roland Deschain (Idris Elba) is a small boy who is being cared for by his elderly grandmother (Kerry Washington) and her son (Tom Taylor). One day, Roland's grandfather (Matthew McConaughey) arrives from the west and asks Roland to help him find the magical "Ring of the Nibelung". The movie takes place over the course of a week in the small town of Mid-World. We are introduced to several characters, all of which are more or less interesting. This film has some of the best acting performances of the year, from Idris El-ba, Matthew McConaughy, Tom Taylor and Cary Elwes.  In the end of the movie we get the final scene with the hero and the antagonist in a dark tower, in which we see the final showdown between the two, which I found to be a very emotional and powerful scene. This is a movie that should be watched by anyone, but especially those who are into the world of fantasy movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I found this movie pretty enjoyable. I am not a big fan of the original series, but this movie is pretty good. I didn't have too much time to watch the movie because I was trying to finish a video game I had already finished. I found the movie pretty good, the art was good, and the animation was pretty good for a 1980's movie. I did have a few complaints about the movie, but I think I'll let them go. It's a good looking movie and it had some pretty good action scenes, especially the first one. ___________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this film is just a bit better than a lot of other stuff we see at the cinema these days. The plot is about a guy who is having an affair with a girl, a girl he doesn't really like, and who is really into playing the guitar. But as the story progresses the girl starts playing the drums and they get together. This is an old fashioned love story in which the hero comes to realise that the girl is also his best friend. But he doesn\'t really get to know her and is in a bad way when the girl leaves. This film is about having an old time love affair and not really giving a shit about the outcome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mummy Returns is a good, well-made, entertaining movie that was originally released in 2013, but has been put on hold for a while now. This film is a return to form for the classic monster movie that began with 1931's The Mummy. I was never a huge fan of the original Mummy, but this version has all the charm and excitement of the previous films. The action is a bit of a mixed bag, with the film's action scenes featuring some nice set pieces and action sequences. The movie also features an interesting take on the villain, the "The Mummifying Man". He is the main villain in the movie, and is quite an evil guy. The story isn't very deep, but there are some good twists and turns along the way. I liked the idea of a female mummy, and her relationship with a male mummy. The final battle scene with the Mummy and the Mummification Man was good, and I really hope that this film gets a sequel. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the previous two movies, so I will only say that it is definitely worth checking out. I would recommend this to fans of the old-school monster movies and the classic characters.

There was a big showdown, and it would have been great if the ending was more climatic."   I have always wanted to see the film "Cattle Rush" starring John Wayne. This film is a classic.

The film's plot revolves around a couple of men who are trying to get a young woman to return to their home town. The story itself is not too original. There are some good scenes, but they are not anything to write home about. This is one of the best films of the year so far, and it deserves to be seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original Star Trek (1966) was not only a huge hit, but a cult classic. It was an incredibly popular science fiction series, and I can't believe it's been 30 years since the original series first aired. The original series is an instant classic.  The original cast of Spock, McCoy, Kirk, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura, Scotty, and Nurse Chapel were fantastic. I also really enjoyed the performances by Leonard Nimoy as Spock and William Shatner as the villain Khan. I remember watching the first episode, "Arena," and not being impressed.  It was a space opera, which meant that the Enterprise was constantly moving through space, fighting aliens and doing lots of other things. It didn't make much sense, so I wasn't really interested in watching the show. The first episode of the second series of Star Trek was pretty good, but then came "The City on the Edge of Forever," which was a really good story. I loved the second episode of StarTrek: The Next Generation, "Encounter at Farpoint." The new series of the original StarTreks were excellent, but it wasn't until the third season of the third series that I really got into Star Trek. I was not a big fan of the new series, but I did enjoy the first three seasons of the first series. The series was very good, and had some really good episodes. It also had some episodes that were a little too dark, which was not what I like in science fiction. Star Trek: The Motion Picture was another excellent movie, but this one was much more fun. I actually liked the third film much more than the first. The only thing I didn't like was that the new movie wasn't quite as good as the first two. It wasn't bad, but the new Star Trek movies weren't quite what I wanted them to be. I've since seen the movies in IMAX, and enjoyed them greatly. I like Star Trek, and will always remember the original shows.

The story is fantastic and so is the acting, it's just perfect.   It's so good that I could have watched it all the way through again and again, but I have to stop and make a note here: The first time you see the man holding the little girl is a little bit disturbing, it really is. I mean, it has that "child" feeling to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the perfect mix of classic adventure, classic comedy, and an excellent cast.   John Lithgow is a fantastic villain in this film and has an evil look to him.  His plan is to use a curse that is placed on the town to take over and make it a small town full of witches.  I'm not sure how I feel about this, it does seem like a nice idea, but it doesn't really work that well.  They seem to have all been taken over by witches and there is no reason to be scared of them.  The movie has some good moments, including the battle with the witch.  But in the end it's really a pretty average adventure movie with a fun cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts off with a beautiful image of a lighthouse, the most beautiful lighthouse ever. It is very calm, peaceful, and I think that's a big part of the film. There is a lot of beauty in the film, but it also has a lot going on, which is something that can't be said about a lot that I've seen. The film is based on a real life tragedy. The real story behind the film is that a ship was in the middle of the ocean when it ran into a shipwreck and sank. The only survivor, a girl, was saved and she went into a house that had been destroyed. There she found her father, who was a man who had been lost at sea and who was trying to find his family and had been turned into a fish, who lived on the surface of the water. The girl is called "Aubrey" and she had been raised by the man that had come to her, and she was a little bit like a fish herself. She was a very happy and carefree child, and this all changed when her father went missing, and was found floating down the sea. He was a young man who was lost at Sea, and had found himself on a deserted island, and who now wanted to find the people who were responsible for his father's death. He also had to deal with the fact that he had been found in this world of the sea, but had no idea how he had gotten there.   What I liked about this film was that it was very realistic. The people who are in this film are very different than we're used to seeing, and it's interesting to see how their lives are like. It's very interesting to have a film about a ship that's been lost in the ocean, and also a film that focuses on people who don't like each other, but who love each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so much fun, and a lot of the humor comes from the characters' attempts to get rid of the curse that is on them.  You see, every day for the past thirty years, all of them have had the same dream.  They're kids, or in this case teenagers, but in a magical world where they can see all the other kids around them, but only see them as ghosts.    This movie is a lot like those other kids, only more of a "what if" situation.  So it's a story about a young man, who has the curse of the kids around him.  This means that he has to sleep in a haunted house, and the kids in the house see him as a ghost.  He must avoid being spotted by these kids, because the kids don't like ghosts, and will chase him and his friend all the way back to the house.  The ending is a bit weird, but I love the ending and the movie.  There are a lot more kids around the house than you would expect, and they are very scary.  If you like kids, this is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie will make you smile, and then some, and not just with the fact that it's a comedy. The story has some funny moments but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The movie was made in 1987 so there were no computers, and no DVD players, and all of this adds up to a movie that I would recommend to people who are not into humor, or those who like a good laugh. It has a pretty good cast that includes the late Robin Williams, and he does have a lot of good material in it, and some great acting too. If you like comedy then this is a pretty great movie, but I would give it a higher rating if it wasn't so poorly made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is an oddball of a movie, that is only for those who have been in love with the "Fart-Filled Dude" from the beginning.  It's a little odd, and it's a bit funny, but the real meat is in the story itself.    This movie is not for the faint of heart, it is hard to describe, and if you have never seen the movie, it may take you a while to get to the point, and there is so much going on that you may not know where to start.  The movie is a tribute to the director's love of the great "Funny, but not funny" movies of the 1950's, and in a very "realistic" way.     The plot:   In the movie "The Big Buck Bunny" (1955), the title character (played by John Belushi) and his wife have a little accident when the car they were in is stuck in a snowbank.  They are rescued by a "Big Buck Bunny", a mythical creature who has been in the forest for many years.  It turns out that the Big Buck Rabbit has a hidden cave, and that it is full of priceless treasures, including a very rare vintage electric guitar.  This is where things start to get weird.  We learn that the cave has a very peculiar way of communicating with the people who live in it, a method of using a very long whistle to communicate, a "talking" stick, and an extremely slow moving, talking dog (who is never seen in the movie).  The film is a kind of comedy, a strange love story, and a kind parody of the 1960's.  However, what makes this movie truly special is the fact that the plot is very believable, and the actors, especially John Belucchi's performance as the Big Benny Bunny, are truly hilarious.  A truly fun, and very unique movie, I suggest anyone who is a fan of the "Little Buddha" of the 1940's to check this one out.

It tells the story of the United States soldiers who escaped from the German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau by fleeing across the English Channel into France. The movie was directed by John Huston and features such memorable performances as Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Jack Benny, Paul Muni and others. The film also features the story about the fate of the Jews at Auschwitz-Birkenau and how the U.S. Army fought to rescue them from the camps. The Great escape is one of the greatest films of all time, with an all-time classic score by the great American composer Alan Jay Lerner, who later composed the score for the James Bond film Goldfinger. A few other great scenes in the movie are when the soldiers go out to the beaches of Normandy to find a ferry to England, when they find a ship to England and try to take it across the channel to France and to England; when the American soldiers are captured by the German soldiers and when they are rescued from the Nazi prison camp at Auschwitz. There is a scene in which a prisoner at the Nazi camp is shown having a tooth pulled and when it comes out he says to the guards: "I've got a toothache!" One of the most memorable scenes in this film is when Humphrey Beatty (played by Bogart) is playing a game of chess in his hotel room and he is seen playing with a white piece and then he notices a black piece, and then Bogart asks the question: "How's that black piece?"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original Blade Runner is the definitive version of the story and a must-see for fans of sci-fi.   A lot of attention has been paid to how well the replicants look, especially the android Tyrell.  Some of the film's best visual effects are done here, particularly when the replicators use the Earth's atmosphere to power their machines.  The film's story isn't a complex one, but it's entertaining and well acted, especially by Rutger Hauer and Sean Young as the replimatant Roy Batty.  And it's also great to see Harrison Ford back as Deckard, who we all knew was a replicant.  It's an enjoyable film, though it's only really for sci- fi fans, and a good action film, even if it's not particularly good at anything else.   This movie doesn't seem to be for everyone, but that's OK: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It's a great movie, and it deserves a lot of attention. It also has a good message, about the human condition. I have a problem with the movie, though. I'm not sure why the director chose to film it this way. The movie is full of dialogue. If there were no dialogue, it would be one of the best movies ever made. The problem with this is that it's impossible to tell what the characters are thinking. There are a lot more scenes in the movie where the dialogue is completely missing. It doesn't matter because the movie has so many good scenes. It could have been so much better if the dialogue had been present. It was the way the movie was shot that I found so boring. It looked like it was filmed by a bunch of people who had never worked in a feature film before. It looks like someone took the movie from the 90's and used the same camera, and then they edited the movie together. I don't know how the director can claim that this is an action movie when there is so much pointless dialogue. I wish he would have gone to the trouble of making a dialogue-free movie. It would have been much better.

He then decides to try to figure out who killed him, which of course is impossible. The plot is very simple, but the film is full of interesting characters and interesting situations. The actors were all excellent and the cinematography was a good touch.   It was a little disappointing to see a little movie like this that had very little in it. But it is a very good movie and well worth the price of admission. It is an entertaining, funny movie and the actors are really good. It will be a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many, many reasons to love this movie, one of them being that this is a great movie about a great film: The original The Big Lebowski is a movie I always loved but didn't see until recently. I was watching it again last night, and I thought it was just great! I loved how they made the movie even better by adding more scenes and by keeping the movie going at a constant pace. I loved the movie and I hope you do too!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good time.  The movie is a fun romp about a girl who likes to wear sexy clothes and play with boys and is really into the "sexy" part of her.    The movie features some excellent acting, music and a great story line.  The best part about this movie is the "straw" that the girl gets from a boy who's friend's dad is a policeman and the police will not go to the boy's father because he has a "loner" and "dummy" son who does not know how to be a policeman.  When the girl sees the "Straw" she realizes that she could be the one to help this "stupid" kid.  It's a movie about a silly girl who loves to dress up and play and who loves boys. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is a fun movie about a dude who likes to drink and who loves to smoke. The main character, Jeff Bridges, is a "big" guy and is about the size of a basketball. He is a great guy to talk to and he always tells a funny story about his past and he can also tell a good one.  This is a very funny movie that is not meant to be taken seriously.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day, my wife was driving me to a family barbecue. She asked me what movie I was watching, and I told her I was enjoying the new Star Wars film. She immediately turned the volume up loud so she could be heard over all the traffic. I thought this was a pretty good movie, though not as good as Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, which I remember watching in the theater as a child. I think The Phantom's helmet was a little weird. It wasn't really my cup of tea. I'm sure it's good for children, but I would have loved to have seen it as a young boy.  The Phantom's mask. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see this movie. It's got a good script, but it didn't seem to work. I loved the trailer for it, and it looked great. The only problem is that it's a horrible movie. There's a good plot, but the character development is weak. I mean, the plot is great, but there is no development in the characters. They're just there for the plot. They don't even really have names. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought this movie was boring.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very much an homage to the classic Westerns.  It's set in a small town, the main character is an aging cowboy named Jake who is looking for his first wife (who he met in the first film) and trying to win over the town's local tough guy who likes to shoot people and has an axe to grind.   The movie is quite enjoyable and is very well made.  If you're looking for a good Western, this is one you don't want to miss!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a wonderfully shot, well-paced, and well-acted movie, with the right amount of humor. It is a story about a man who doesn't exist, a man that never existed, a story that was never told.  I think we can all relate to that idea.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good film, with a few moments that are a bit too dark, but overall it's a good, low-budget thriller.  The main character is a rather dull and uninteresting one, but that's hardly a problem.   The plot, as I said, is rather low-key and it doesn't really seem like a horror movie, but it's very well-paced and the performances are good.    The one thing that stands out about this film is the soundtrack, which is pretty good. 4.5/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You get the feeling that this movie was filmed for fun. I guess they needed a laugh. The movie starts with a black and white photo of a white man that's holding a white baby and smiling. A few moments later, we see a man in a brown suit, a brown woman and a brown boy, walking down a dark road. Then we see the girl in a red dress with the blonde hair, smiling with the brown man. She's about to marry him, but he is taken by a group of armed people and kidnapped. The kidnappers are two white women. The man tries to convince the kidnappers to let him go, but they keep insisting he's their "boyfriend". The movie ends with the blond woman and her son running from the white people in a car. I've seen this movie a few times and I never get tired of it. It's so funny and it's entertaining to watch. I'm a big fan of the movies "Wings of Desire" and this is the third movie based on a novel by the same author. I think "WINGS OF DESIRE" is the best movie about kidnapping and it shows the danger that kidnappers can pose. This movie is a little bit darker than the other two movies about kidnapping. There are a few scenes that seem to be inspired by the book, but I don't really understand what the authors were trying to do with this movie. I wouldn't mind seeing this movie again if they remake it. I would watch this movie over and over and I would enjoy it every time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not as good as I'd hoped. I like the idea, but it's not there. It's an overblown, silly, overblown Hollywood-style disaster movie.   (reviewed 11/23/97)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie, but I'm not sure that it's as good as the film made out to be.   The film is about an alien invasion in the future where a woman, named Leda, is the only survivor. She lives with her husband and her daughter and is trying to make ends meet.  Unfortunately, she also has to deal with the threat of her own husband.  Leda is able to find a job in a factory that makes robots that are used for combat.  It is the beginning of the robot's uprising and Leda and the robots have to work together to take it down.  The robots and L, seem to have an unspoken understanding, and they work together and fight off the aliens.  As I mentioned, the film is a great one, but it's not very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Carry On" is a fun, light-hearted comedy. The two main characters are very different. Andy (played by John Cleese) is a lovable loser, who is a good-hearted dork and a little bit of a lothario, and who has the hots for his fellow soldier (played brilliantly by John Hodge). Andy's best friend and confidant, played by Alan Yentob, is also a loner, a bit of an alcoholic, and a very good-natured, albeit slightly silly, guy. Alan is the best of friends and Andy is the worst. Andy is a bit more funny, but Alan is always there to add some humor. Alan has a very strong sense of humor and is very funny, which is very important in this movie. The other characters in the movie are all a little silly, but they are all funny. There are a few times when the movie gets serious and it's great. There is a scene in the beginning of the movie where Andy is trying to convince Alan to go out with him for a bit. Andy and Alan have a wonderful conversation about Andy's bad luck and Andy's good luck and how it is completely in the hands of God. This is the beginning to the great friendship between Andy and Allen. The story about Andy is very amusing and very funny. Andy has an affair with a guy named Peter, who looks just like Alan. It's very funny watching Andy and Peter's relationship develop. It starts out with a kiss and then a lot of other things get in the way of the romance, but the two eventually end up together. This movie is very good, but it's not very long and it gets pretty boring. It is good fun. I give it a 5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** ********* ********** ******** ******** * The best part of the movie is when it is played with real actors. The film is not like other "movies" where you can see the movie on television and not really see the actors. This is an "actual" movie about the life of the real "American", a Native American of the Ute Indian tribe. He is an outlaw and a liar who is not afraid to fight, he is a "big man" who can "beat the big man" of his time, the white man. This movie is about a man who has the courage to do what he has to do and who is willing to go to great lengths to get his way and to get even. This man is a real American, an American Indian, an outlaw, and a white man who loves him. It is a good American movie and a good example of what an actual American Indian has to go through to make his way in a racist world.

The ending was interesting, the movie had a few funny scenes and the ending made it worth watching.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been a big fan of the '80s TV series, Star Trek: The Next Generation. I was lucky enough to be there in person for the premiere of the third season, "The Naked Now" in New York City, in 1987. The show was still a little rough around the edges, but it was a blast. I loved that the first episode featured a group of Klingons having a Klingon karaoke contest. I was so impressed with that I went back and watched the episode a couple more times to see what else they had planned. I always found it interesting that they would have Klingon characters do all the same things they did in the original series, but then have a bunch of new, original, Klingons come in to play the parts of the Klingons that they'd been doing before. It made for an entertaining, but very different show.   The first two seasons of TNG were also pretty rough around The edges, with a few hiccups, but I'm not sure they really got much better.  The Enterprise is under attack by a massive ship from another universe.  When the ship crashes into a planet, a Klingon crewmember is pulled aboard the ship, and discovers that they have been transformed into a species of giant bugs.  After being captured, the Klingon who saved him is sentenced to death.  The pilot of this season of TOS was "Amok Time" (not to be confused with the Star Trek movie, but you could make that mistake), which is another great episode, but there were a few problems. First, it wasn't a bad pilot. I think it's one of the most memorable episodes of the show. But there was one major problem: The Klingons. First off, there's the whole thing about the Klingonese people being transformed into giant bugs (which is, of course, totally wrong), and then there's all the Klingon stuff. That whole part was just a big joke. But, even worse, the episode had no one on the main crew who could actually speak Klingon. That means that there's a lot of Klingon dialogue in this episode. And it doesn't make sense! I'm sure the writers of the series felt it would be fun to write a Klingon character who couldn't speak Klingon, but they failed miserably.  I have a friend who has been a huge fan of Star Trek since he was a kid. He still lives in Southern California,

It is set in the time before the fall of Rome and is a story about a woman who gets pregnant at the age of 17 and wants to be a nun.

There are a lot of scenes of women trying to figure out what to do. The film does not take long to tell its story and has a nice balance of drama, humor, action and mystery. The cast is excellent, the music is wonderful and the story is very good. I enjoyed the film and would like to see a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this world where the people have grown up on television, the same old formula is a sure way to get a film noticed: the young, handsome hero who wants to be the best.  Well, this hero is the only one of his kind, and he doesn't know it yet. Â It's not that he can't fight like the others.    He can.   He just needs to learn more about himself, and not about other people's expectations.  And it's not just the plot that's different.    The screenplay is not only fresh, it's entertaining as well.  A man in a bad situation with no other options is given a chance to make his own life and fortune.  He just has to make the right choices, and if he does, he'll make a difference in his friends lives.  So he doesn´t have to be a hero.  His only goal is to get back to the place where he belongs.  The world of this movie is very similar to the world of "The Avengers".    I mean, it looks like the movie has been made in the same year, and it's pretty much the same story.  In fact, the plot may not be the most original, but I don't think it's a bad thing.  It's a story about the "hero" and the "villain".  But unlike the other movies, this movie takes place in the present, in our modern times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not expecting a good thriller but this is one of the best movies I have seen this year so far and I have been watching a lot of horror movies. The movie is not scary but it is not really an action movie. It is more about the characters and the emotions of the characters. The characters are not so well developed and some of the actions are not understandable. It would be better to see this movie on DVD because I was not sure if I was going to like it.

The only real difference is that they are in the 1900s in a very old building.   The story is pretty well told.  It is really nice that the director chose to focus on the characters instead of the action.  The director tries to get the audience to empathize with the characters. The character interactions were a nice touch and the story is fairly interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1952) is a short science fiction film made by the French producer Louis Malle. The film tells the story of a ship, the S.S. Endeavour, that is sent into the Solar System in an attempt to find a missing scientist. It is traveling through the Solar system, at a very slow rate. It encounters a planet, which it passes by at a much faster rate. The planet's atmosphere is thin, and it appears to be composed entirely of hydrogen. As the ship moves through the atmosphere, the scientist is unable to communicate with anyone. The only explanation the scientists can give is that he is dead. As he moves through space, he appears to float. He is unaware of his own motion. The atmosphere of the planet becomes thick and dense. It begins to rain. The ship encounters other planets, including a planetoid that has the same appearance as Earth. There are other bodies that orbit the planetoid. At the same time, the ship encounters the planet Uranus. As a planet it has a thin atmosphere, but it also has a magnetic field. As it orbits Uranus, the magnetic field lines are bent. The magnetic field begins to weaken. The scientists try to send a message to the Endeavor, but they can't understand what it is saying. The Endeiver is not aware of its own motion, and so it continues to move through the thick atmosphere. It eventually encounters a small planet, whose surface is covered with a thin layer of a green substance. The green substance is the planet's natural atmosphere. As they move through space again, the Endreiver sees that the atmosphere is getting thicker, and the planet is beginning to disintegrate. As an effort to help it, the scientists send a signal to the Earth. The Earth hears the message and responds. It tells the Endearever to stop, and to wait for instructions from Earth. As she does, it notices a star. It decides to make a few observations, and then it will go to sleep again. The scientist realizes that the Earth must be listening to the message it sent out. It doesn't have a radio in its ship, but the scientists are able to use a beam to send out radio waves. They are able hear what is being said on the planet that the Endereve is passing through. The star tells the scientists that it is a very old star, and that it must have

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have always had a soft spot for the works of Richard Matheson, and The Mathesons have never failed to impress me. I always found the way the mathesons were brought up, with the help of their older brother, to be fascinating. Mathesan's have always been a family that have made it through some hardships, and are now on top of the world, with their new found success. It is a bit odd that they have a mathesan named James who is very much of a loner, and I never understood why. Mathew is the eldest, and is the one who always had the most to say about everything. He's a very smart man, and when he gets an idea in his head he just seems to think of the best way to put it all out there. Mathews younger brother was always the quiet one, who always found a way to get into trouble, which I found quite interesting. The Mathews are all very interesting, and the film just seemed to be filled with fun and laughter.   The mathews and James Mathesen Mathesn I would not be surprised if they had a son or two... James, I guess, is an old fashioned mathesn who has grown up in a way that most young people would find a bit strange. His parents have never married, and his brother has only been with them a short time. James has been living with his father in their house, in the small village of Parnell, where he works in the coal mine. The mine is very remote, and James is very attached to it. His father has a big old truck that is very important to him, and so he spends a lot of his time there. The family also own a large amount of land in the surrounding area, and a large part of the money from the land is put into the mine. James is a very bright young man who is always in the way of everything that is happening around him. James always seems to be the first to notice any changes in his surroundings, and he always seems unhappy. He can be very temperamental. One day a visitor to the Mathesens arrives in Parnells, and she is the daughter of the town's butcher. This girl is quite a beauty, and Mathes n, James, find themselves drawn to her. It isn't long before they are all in love with her. She is the only girl who has been interested
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a very good one. It is a thriller about a man who works for the CIA.  He is on a mission to bring down a very dangerous terrorist organization. He has been working with the CIA for quite a while now and they are very good to him.  One day the man is told that a certain terrorist has stolen a large sum of money from a safe and he needs to get to the bank. The man knows that he cannot get in and out fast enough. The CIA is worried about the safe being open and if it is, he may find the money and blow up the bank himself.  The man starts looking for a way to open the safe and this is where the movie takes a turn for the scary. The film is a good one but it is not the best. I will give it a 4.5 for being a good thriller and the good acting. I would recommend this to a horror fan.

There's a little bit of a twist at the end, though.   I liked this movie very much. It's not a horror movie, and the characters are all pretty likeable. The dog and the girl are not as interesting as I'd like, but the story is a very interesting one, and it's very sad that the little girl ends up being killed. I liked it very much, and I'm going to go out and watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent little movie, a bit slow paced, but a good story. It is about an Englishman, his family and friends who are stuck in a Russian prison during WW2. The Russian soldiers and the English soldiers get along well enough. The Russians and the Brits are very similar. They both have a lot of energy. The only difference is that the Russians are in the field and the Americans are at home. The film is set in a cottage, but I'm not sure that the cottage is actually a cottage. There are no windows, and no doors. The sound is a bit too loud for my tastes. There is a radio in the cottage, and it plays the same songs. I've heard a lot worse. The movie is also a bit confusing, with many people having the same name and having the names of their friends. But I think that the story is interesting, and the actors were all fine. There was a very interesting bit in the movie. I'll leave it at that. It was just an enjoyable movie, and I like a good action movie. It's an interesting change of pace, and a nice change from the usual action movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the beginning we see the city of San Francisco from the outside, then a couple of days later we see it from inside. A couple of years have passed and things have gotten worse. The city is completely overrun by homeless, junkies and crime. We see a young girl being robbed of her jewelry and purse. We also see a man getting robbed of his wallet. Later on we see a couple having an argument. Later we see two girls having an incestual relationship. We can see this as it is happening. But later on we can see it as a child being sexually abused. Later the girl has an abortion. And then later on a couple get into a fight. And later on the two get into another fight. We are also seeing a drug addict trying to get clean and get his life back on track. And so on. This is a very disturbing movie. It has the look and feel of a movie from the 1970's. And I guess the only reason why this movie was made was because the director wanted to do something a little different. But it isn't a good film. I think that it would be better if the director had a more positive outlook and just told the story the way it was. But at least it is a fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a really fun movie, with some great special effects. The film is set in the early 1900s, when a young man (John Carradine) becomes an adventurer in the middle of the wild west. The movie is set on a small ranch, where John has to deal with the jealousies of his two friends (Cary Grant and Warren Beatty). They are not exactly friends, but they have fun together. The cast is also good, and there are some memorable moments. The main thing I liked about this movie was the ending. It was quite clever, and not just a typical Hollywood ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good action movie, but I don't know if it's good for kids or adults.  The fight scenes are really cool, especially when you see the effects and when the characters are swinging through the air.    I think the story is just kind of boring, the kids are too big and slow to do much, and it seems like they have all been taught to throw rocks.  But, I would recommend this for kids and kids who like action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This is a very fun, fun, and good movie. I think it has an edge to it that I don't know how to describe. The movie starts off with some very cool shots, and then it just gets better. The plot is really very simple. A group of people go to a party at a cabin, and the next morning, they are having a party in the cabin. The party is very very simple, but I loved the scene when the kids are in the pool, the kids say that the party was really great, and that it's a good way to start the day. Then they have to go to school. Then, the next day, the parents tell them that the school will be closed. Then the next night, the party is all canceled. The parents tell the kids that the next party will be on Sunday. They decide to have the party in their room, because it's in the basement, but the basement is full of bad memories, and everyone has been drinking. The next morning when the party starts, the basement has to be sealed, and someone is locked in the attic, but it's the kids who are in there. When the kids get out of the attic they find that the parents have gone crazy. They have a big party to go on Sunday, but they forgot a key, so they have the kids go back to the basement and get it. That's when they get the key. So the next thing you know, the whole family is in the house, and there are a ton of friends that are at the party. Then it starts to rain, and they all have to get out the door. Then in the end, it's just the kids and the parents who are left in the backyard, and it's very very fun to watch. The music is also very cool, and I love the movie. It has a nice tone to it, and is just a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really glad I saw this movie. I was looking forward to seeing the movie. It was really interesting to see how this movie is made and how it was done. I'm a huge fan of the old westerns and westerns in general. This is an excellent example of a good western. It is just a good story with a good cast. This movie was shot in black and white, which I find very cool. It's a very dark film with a great cast. I loved the old west and the idea of a cowboy coming out of the dark and into the light. I enjoyed the way the director, Jack Palance, shot the film. He did a great job with the story and it was a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the late 70's the American Air Force used a secret radar program to observe and map the earth. The system they used was called S-1, for Short-range Observation System. The name comes from the fact that the S-2, Short-Range System, which used radar waves to map the globe, was installed in 1962 and operated until the early 1980's. The S-3, which was a more powerful and longer-range system was installed around the same time. Both S-series radar systems were located at the Air Force's Joint Intelligence Center (JIC), at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. The JIC had a total of three S-4's, all located in the western United States. They were used to monitor the Soviet Union and other countries. The first S-5 was a Long-range radar system. It was replaced in 1975 by a more advanced Long-Range radar system called SSP, which also operated in the same area. In the early 90's the SSP was upgraded to a Long range radar system, known as the SPS, which operated at Offut AFB in Omaha, Nebraska, and also at Langley AFB, Virginia. The upgraded system was a lot more powerful than the S1, which had to rely on radio-telemetry for all its data. In 1998 a replacement was finally installed at Offuts Air Force Base. The upgrade is called the SRC-X, Short Range Combat System.  The SRC is the same radar system used in the Tomahawk cruise missile.  The radar uses high-power microwave beams to track and locate the target. The target is usually a small plane or drone.  A good movie about the SSC is:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dv3QY-nZs8

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** I am not an expert in anything (except a little history) but I do know that the movie is called "The American People." The people that appear in this movie are real people (like the people in this film) and I do not believe that these people have been "massacred." (In the film, a man is said to have been shot with a shotgun but there is no evidence of a shotgun and his wound was not fatal.) It appears that the people who appear in the movie are being led about by a man named Walter Mitty who is playing a sort of leader. The film ends with the people walking back into their houses and the next day (the movie) is called the "American People's Day." I found this movie quite entertaining. The scenes of people living the American dream are really quite humorous and entertaining. ***********************
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The best part is, that when it ends, everything is back to normal."   If you have read about the movie, then you probably know the end. The last episode has the girls going to the school and having a conversation with the teacher, about a book that the girl found in the library. The book is a diary about the school, and a very important part of the movie is about the girls' reactions to this diary, about the way that the girls are talking about it and what they are doing with it. It's a very interesting movie, that makes you think about things, and about the meaning of life, and the meaning about friendship.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie.   The movie is good because the main character is likeable and a good person.  He has his faults, and it is his flaws that are the source of his strength.  He is like a cross between John Wayne and Jack Nicholson, and the film is great because of that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very interesting and original film, it's got some good jokes and even a bit of humor, however it's a film that will be interesting to watch because of the different approaches taken by the filmmakers.  "What I can tell you about this movie is that it is a film with a point. It's a movie with a message. It is a movie about a very strange man, a man who has a point, a message and is not afraid to tell it. I don't think I can talk about this film without making a joke, I will simply say that it's fun." - James Franco 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with a young boy named Ben being sent away from his village by his parents to a new school with a new principal. At the school he meets a girl named Anna who seems to be very friendly and outgoing. Ben and Anna soon begin to fall in love and fall in bed together. Ben then discovers a secret that may be the key to understanding Anna.   It's a good film, and Ben's love for Anna is very touching.  There is nothing about the film that is original. It follows the usual formula of the romance movie: the hero is good, the heroine is bad, the hero saves the day and the heroine gets in trouble.  This film does not have any of that.  The plot is typical of the love story, the characters are not really interesting, and the ending is quite predictable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a weird way I really like this movie and I'm glad it has a small cult following.   The movie is about a bunch of guys who decide to drive around the desert to shoot a video of themselves and their girlfriends.  I really liked this movie because the characters are all so different and unique.  Most of them are from the West or the South and I think that the movie would be even better if the cast was more diverse.  The action in this movie is great.  It's not a "high" grade action movie but it is entertaining and exciting and well-paced.  As a result, it's one of my favorites of the 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cinderella is a pretty standard fairy tale, with a good script and a pretty good performance.  It's really not too bad of a movie, except for the part about the Prince's ball.    There are two good things about this movie: the music and the cast.  I liked the music, especially the song "I'm Always on My Way" by Billy Joel, but the song is just not very memorable.  It's not a bad song, but it just doesn't fit with the movie.  My favorite part about this film is the movie's director, Alan Parker, who is an amazingly talented director.  His style is very reminiscent of Walt Disney, and it's quite unique.  The cast is also pretty good, with the exception of John Goodman, who, although he is not as good as in the movie, still manages to be memorable. I also enjoyed the part where the King and Queen meet for the first time, which is just wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, I was hoping it would be a good homage to the original movie and it is.  The movie is pretty much exactly the same, but it does have a couple of changes.    The main characters are not the same as in the original, there is a new character called "Waldron" who was the only one to stop the zombies before, which is pretty cool, and he's not too bad in the movie.  I don't really know how much I like the movie, but I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cameron Crowe's new film is a brilliant take on a popular story.  It is an excellent piece of work and Crowe has done an excellent job in bringing it to the screen.                                                        In a nutshell, the story of  The Abyss  is a very interesting one.    A few years after a huge explosion on the ocean, the population of the planet is in crisis.  While they are at it, they decide to use a submarine to explore the depths.  But something goes wrong in the depths and the submarine sinks and the people inside are killed.  It's up to a couple of crewmen and a little boy to get to the bottom of the mystery and find out who is responsible for this tragedy.                           In the beginning, the film is very slow paced and slow to progress.  The story is told slowly and the character are the characters that have been brought to life by a very talented actor and a talented director.  We get to know a little more about the characters as the story progresses.  There are a few very good and funny moments.  However, the action scenes are not really exciting and the story is very simplistic and easy to follow.  This movie is worth watching for the action but not really for the story.   Grade:     B+    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie there are two characters: the one who wants to get away from the rat race and the one with the most money. The guy with the money has a nice wife and a nice car, and the girl is very pretty, but she has a boyfriend who she wants to keep. One night the guy gets a visit from a woman who wants his money for a certain purpose: to get her boyfriend out of prison. The movie is not very good. The director doesn't show a lot of effort, and even though the story is interesting, the film is not interesting. It is boring, because most of the action takes place in the middle of the night and the actors look like they are trying to look like gangsters. I liked the idea of the movie, but the execution doesn't work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I watched this on Friday night and we enjoyed it a lot.  It's about a boy named Michael (David Duchovny) who is adopted by a couple who are part of a cult that worships a man named Dr. Jekyll (Robert De Niro) who was the first human to ever be born without any physical deformities.  When Michael comes of age he is taken under the wing of Dr. Hyde (Tim Robbins) and is put in a series of dangerous tests by Hyde to prove his loyalty to the cult.    This movie is good and it is a bit over-long but I have to give it a thumbs up because it was fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very interesting, well made and well acted movie about the time in the mid 1960's when a small group of scientists in the United States were investigating a strange and unexplainable phenomenon: a massive, silent earthquake. A year later a much larger, audible earthquake occurs, this time in Los Angeles. This movie is about the efforts of these scientists to understand the phenomenon and to figure out how it happened. There is an interesting and interesting cast of characters who all play a part in the research effort, but the real star of the show is Dr. James Braid, who, as the movie opens, is in a position to make some very important discoveries.   It's a fairly straightforward story that will not blow your socks off. The story is very well told, and the research done is always interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit I'm not sure if this is a good horror movie. It's very much a thriller, so the "fright" part is lessened by a little bit of an action scene and some cheesy voiceovers. But then there's a really creepy part where one of the "victims" is seen trying to get to his car. Then you see him being dragged away. This is very scary, especially since the guy in the truck is supposed to be dead. I think this movie is much better than the "classic" (and I mean classic) Scream films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice twist on the usual gangster flick: the good guy is a good guy, and the bad guy is an evil guy, but they're both good guys in their own ways. The film is set in New York in the 1930's, and stars Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, and Mary Astor as well as a host of lesser knowns. The action takes place in the Bronx, where the film is loosely based on the lives of three local gangs. The first is led by a man named Harry (Gable), who runs a gang of thugs who terrorize a Jewish neighborhood. The second gang is led mainly by a fellow named Sam (Astor), who has a small empire of gambling and prostitution operations and is a bit of a bad guy. The third gang is run by a woman named Sally (Groucho Marx), who is a little more like a real gangster. This gang is made up of gangsters, prostitutes, and some local yuppies. It's a good mix of characters and the film's setting gives it a nice flavor.  A very nice film that features the famous gangsters Harry Cohn, Clark Clifford, and Humphrey (of course) Bogart as well.   The film does a great job of setting the tone.  It's not a gangster movie per se, but there's a great deal of violence, and it's always interesting to see how the characters handle these situations. The movie's only real weak point is the soundtrack, which is somewhat generic and unmemorable, and occasionally gets a little confusing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very funny, very fast paced, and very well acted.  It's set in a futuristic city that looks like an amalgam of the future and the present, a city in which people are able to fly through the air like birds.    There is also a robot that has been built in this city and it's the main character, who is also called Zim.  The main plot is a bit silly but it's not bad.  I think it was the main story that was really silly.  It's a film about a city that has all the advantages of the city we live in today.  There are a lot of skyscrapers and it looks great.  But it has a lot more in common with the future.  This is a city where a group of people, called "Zim" (who are all like me) have become the rulers of the place.  And they are all very eccentric, they have a lot to say and have a certain amount of self-importance.  As you might expect from the film this movie is a little bit different in tone and in style.  Zim is not very likable.  He is very vain and he's a little obsessed with his flying ability.  That's about all he's good for.  His flying ability is not great and he doesn't seem to be able to get it up to a reasonable level.  In addition he's not very good with women and he always seems to be a little stuck up.  If you're a fan of the science fiction genre you should definitely check this out.

He gets some strange people on his property and a mysterious figure in the sky that seems to have a lot of power and could end all of mankind. It was also very eerie. This movie is definitely one of the scariest I have ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original 1984 comedy has been resurrected as a new production for this year's Toronto Film Festival.   Director Martin Scorsese returns to the helm and it's great to see him back with a little of his trademark humor.  The film has a wonderful story line that keeps you wanting more.  This film was originally shot in London and New York but the actors have made a great adaptation of it in a much more contemporary setting.  The script by Robert Benton is wonderfully witty and Scorsia makes a perfect villain.  Scorsie is a man who loves a nice warm cup of tea and an evening with a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I loved this movie and we thought the movie was a very good one. We are both big fans of John Carpenter and we really enjoyed the movie.  This is a very unique and fun movie to watch, and you can't go wrong with it.  The movie starts with a small boy named Jack (Tim Robbins) in a train car.  The train is on a journey from New York to the Pacific Northwest and Jack is a passenger in the train.  He is traveling on the same train that he grew up on and he is a big fan of the movie "It".  He doesn't know that the train has a mysterious passenger in it. Jack is soon discovered by a very beautiful young woman named Mary (Janet Leigh) and she and Jack become lovers.  After that Jack and Mary move into a house that Mary has been in before, but it is a little rundown and dirty.  Mary, who has a small dog named Buddy, is very worried about Jack, and Jack isn't too sure about his new love.  They start to get along and Jack becomes very close to Mary, but his relationship with Mary isn't as sweet.  Jack doesn't want to move in with Mary and so he tries to stay with Buddy and his owner (who is also named Buddy) to help them survive.  Things are going well for Jack and Buddy and Mary is happy that she has a friend in Jack.  However, as time goes on, Jack's love for Mary is getting harder and harder to hide.  One night Jack is killed in a car accident and Mary decides that she can't take the chance that Jack may not be coming back.  As Jack is dying, he says to Mary "You'll never see me again", and she takes his hand and says "Don't go. You'll see me. I'll make it real."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an amazing film. I've seen other films that have a very similar plot to this one, but this is the best. There is a scene where the guy, the guy that wants to be a boxer, meets a beautiful woman, but he doesn't get to kiss her. I can't remember the name of this girl, but it is just so damn sexy. I don't know if I can talk about this film without giving it a rating of an A+ This film is a must see for any fan of boxing and for anyone who wants to see some good boxing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is a good one. It's one of those movies that is great to watch because it's very entertaining and it does not take itself too seriously at all. It takes its time getting there but once it gets there it delivers. The cast is great and I found it funny how they acted like they were the kids who had gotten to go to the zoo but not all that into it. The only complaint I have is that at one point the mother of the little girl who has the talking pig and her brother (who is the son of a local judge) come over and get all angry and frustrated with her and the little boy for not taking them to see the tiger or the lion and that was kind of odd. I think if they had let the little guy and the girl sit in the car they would have been better off.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this one before. I was so disappointed. The acting was bad. The story was silly. The writing was awful. The only thing I remember from the movie was that the guy with the mustache was wearing a baseball cap.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as part of a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" in a theater with an adult crowd. There were some folks who had seen the original "The Mask of the Dragon" (which was a bit better than this), but most were not. This is a decent movie, and has some fun parts, such as when the villain has his evil-ass wife murdered, and he decides to take revenge by throwing her in a big vat of acid. She does not survive, and the villain is pretty much an asshole. I found myself liking the villain a lot more than I did the main villain. I'm not sure if it was the old "Evil Dead" movies or what, but this movie had a similar feel to that film. I really enjoyed this movie. I think I would enjoy watching this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Fell to Earth" is a movie about a man who was sent to Earth in a UFO from another planet to discover if he could live on this world. The story is set in a small town where a scientist (Mitch Mitchell) is trying to find a way to communicate with aliens. One day he finds a man (Chris Nelson) who is in a coma. After talking to the man's family, Mitch decides to go on an expedition with them to a nearby planet to see if he can get help from the people there. On the way they are attacked by a giant robot and a giant plant. The plants get out of control and the robot goes after them, but Mitch gets the robot's attention by shooting it with his gun. Mitch then decides to shoot the robot with a gun from his car, which also hits a nearby tree. The robot gets out of the tree, but then gets hit by the falling leaves, and then the tree starts to fall. The tree is a big rock that is the center of the film. Mitch is able to stop the tree from falling by jumping on top of it, but as he is about to do this he gets hit with a large rock that falls from a tree on the other side of the road. This leads to Mitch being thrown from the tree and falling into the road below. The car he is driving crashes and the three men in the car all get out, and it is not until the last man, Mike Murphy (Peter Hodes), gets out that he realizes what has happened. The three men are able to make it out of their car, and they start to go into the woods to find the scientist who was killed by the robot. After Mitch finds the man in the coma and tells him about his mission, he decides to leave and not return until he is sure the man is OK. After the man awakens and finds out about Mitch's mission, it becomes clear that he is the one who will be the key to helping him return home. The first thing Mitch does when he arrives on Earth is to make his family come with him. When the people don't want to go with him, he tries to convince them, and the story starts to develop from there. "The Man who Fell toearth" is an interesting movie that tells a story about a scientist and his mission to Earth. This movie is a great reminder that science fiction movies can be great and interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie and it really does a good job of setting up a fantastic series that will likely be on a lot of peoples' "best of" lists in the future.   A few of the episodes have been somewhat hard to follow, and I can see why they might have.  But, in general, this is a very good story, and a very entertaining one.  The villains are great.  I especially love the villain that we never see.  There are so many great moments in this series that you could watch it all day long.  This show is a must watch, and will probably be one of your all time favorites.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has the right mix of humor and action.   The story is a bit of a slow burn but it picks up when the bad guys get their hands on a nuclear bomb.  There are plenty of action scenes with the bad guy destroying a large section of Manhattan in the first half.  The other action scenes take place in space.  After destroying the big city and getting a nice nuclear bomb, the baddies have to get to the big space station.  I really enjoyed the first part of this movie.  You have to love the old school 80's comedy that the movie pulls off.  This is a fun and interesting movie that will have you coming back for more.

It does not have much of a plot. It is more about how the characters live and how the family works. I really liked the characters and the story. I think this is a great movie to watch when you are in need of some good movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is one scene that is almost too good to be true.  The scene starts with a very angry woman (Karen Allen) standing over a dead body in a hallway of an apartment building.       When the camera cuts in on her, she's in a very bad mood.    Her eyes are red and puffy, her voice is hoarse and she's visibly upset.                            She begins yelling and cursing at a man standing next to her.  She calls him a "liar," a "dummy," and a "coward" for allowing this to happen.   The man just stands there and doesn't say a word.  The woman begins yelling at him as well, but this time, she seems to be a little more reasonable.  This time, he tells her that she's too angry, that she needs to calm down and just relax.  He's trying to tell her it's OK, it's not his fault.  But she isn't having any of it.  "I'm so tired of this," she shouts, "I can't take it anymore!"  She grabs his arm and drags him to the ground.  It's at this point that I was convinced the man was going to be hit with a bat.    It's only then that I realized that he was actually going to get hit with Karen Allen in the ass.  I don't know how it works, but the man seems to take this in good humor.  Karen Allen continues to try and get him to leave her alone, but he won't.  So, in one of the most shocking and gratifying moments in a movie that I enjoyed very much, the man stands up and slaps her ass!  I didn't think it was possible, but it's true. It's hard to describe how amazing this scene is.  As soon as the man slaps the ass, the woman screams in pain and falls to the floor.  There's a quick close-up of the man's face, which is almost always covered by the mask.  In this shot, the mask completely covers his mouth and his eyes are completely white.  What's even more amazing is that this mask is not one of those cheap knock-off masks that are available at most movie theaters.  These are the real thing!    The man is standing in front of the camera, and

I was really excited about this movie as I've heard about it for some time. The movie itself has some funny parts and some funny dialogue. It does have its moments that are well put together. The acting is all around top notch and the movie is a well produced, well acted and thought out movie. The only complaint I have is the movie's length. The entire movie is just over 4 hours and I really can't say I enjoyed it. I didn't find the movie entertaining enough to stay around after the first 20 minutes or so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked the original '80s action films you will love this one. It has the same kind of cheesy dialogue, the same over the top special effects, the cheesy plot, the stupid characters, the bad special effects and the overall ridiculousness. I mean come on, what more can you ask for? It has a lame plot that has to be changed to keep the story going. I won't even go into the acting. It is just too bad that this movie is so over rated.   In conclusion, I would say this is a bad sequel to a good film.   for more reviews check out my blog:
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just finished this movie, and I was really disappointed. I was not expecting a good ending to the movie. I had read some reviews that the ending is really good. But, in my opinion, it is just a really bad ending. It was just bad.   The movie was about a guy who had been working in the circus. His wife leaves him because he is not working hard enough. He goes to a bar where he meets a girl who has a broken leg and wants to get it fixed. He doesn't believe her but she says it is true. So they go to a doctor who tells them that the leg is broken. The doctor also says that it is broken because of the accident. They are told that they can get a new one at a hospital in New York. But they need money to get there. So he says that they should go to Vegas, and he will sell them tickets for a show that they will see. So the two decide to go. But on the way they are stopped by a policeman who thinks they are going to be trouble. The policeman says that if the circus wants to make money, then they should make the show more exciting. The cops arrest them, but they make it out.  And they go back to the hotel and they find a letter from the doctor. He tells them not to go to the show and that they are not to tell anyone that they did. The two go back. They go to see the show but it is not as exciting as they thought it would be. Then the doctor shows up and tells them about the circus and they decide to give it a try.  Now, the two are in the house, but the hotel is not finished. The house is in a bad state. The guy has been working hard to get the house finished, but it still doesn't look right. The girl is not getting any better and they are just tired. The woman who works at the hotel says that she will see them tomorrow to fix the house. So then they decide that they need to go out to the world and make the house more exciting again.  They go out and buy a boat to go around the world, but before they can sail, the house gets in trouble again. So, they go home.  In the hotel they are having fun and talking about the trip. They have fun and dancing with the girls. Then, the man decides that he needs a drink. He decides to

The director, George Nolfi, was able to show all the great things that were happening in the world of music and to tell it in a way that the audience would understand. The music was amazing and it was easy to understand why they were doing what they were supposed to do. I liked this movie a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second movie in this trilogy is a lot more fun than the first. The plot, which is a variation of the first one, is set in a world in which the evil vampire is defeated and the human race is now a peaceful and happy race.   We learn more about the relationship between the vampire and his sister, the king's daughter. She and her brother-in-law (the prince) go to the castle, and find that it is not so bad after all.  The prince is a good guy, and a prince is supposed to be nice and friendly. The prince, though, is also very bad tempered, and his mother, who seems to be the one responsible for all the bad things, is a bitch. I think this is because she is very sadistic, and it shows. The movie starts with the vampire's mother talking about the prince and his wife, and how bad they are. She mentions the king, too, and her hatred for him. Then, as if the movie is trying to get to the point, the vampire tells the king that his daughter and the queen of the castle are not that nice, and they should be thrown in a dungeon.  It gets more and more absurd and ludicrous, until the vampire is killed, his sister is captured, and the prince gets a sword to fight her.  Now, there is a difference between a sword and a gun, and I think the filmmakers wanted the audience to understand that this is a movie that is not serious about any of it.  But the prince is not to be outdone, and after a short battle, he kills the queen and saves his sister.  There is a reason why the vampire got a sword in the first place, and there is an even bigger reason why he got a girl to help him.  This movie is a fun ride, and even a good one.  I think it is the most entertaining movie in the series, with the biggest action set pieces, and with the best use of special effects I have ever seen in a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The film is not a bad movie. Â It has a great atmosphere.  There is a lot of humor in the film.  The film is full of strange characters and interesting settings.    The film also has a lot more gore than you would think.  I am not going to tell you how many characters are shot in the head and then thrown into a swimming pool.  This is not the most gruesome film you can ever see.  It is just a good story about a man who has to deal with the death of his wife.  The writing of the film is fantastic.  John Wayne has a nice turn in the movie. He does a good job.  In addition, the actor who plays the role of the wife is very good.  His character is the first to fall in love with a man.  A man who is not right for her.  He is the kind of man she was not meant to be with.  If you like movies about men and women who are a bit weird and who have a lot to say about their feelings, then this is a good film.

He then finds out that his mother had a secret love affair with a Japanese general who happens to be her lover.    The movie is good and I thought the actors did a good job with the material they were given. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The best" is a bit of a loaded statement, as there are so many great films that come out of Hollywood these days, but this one stands out among them all. It's a great film about an artist and an alcoholic, about how one man's artistic talents get him nowhere and how he ends up as a drifter and a drinker, about his love affair with a famous singer, about the tragic death of a young girl who was killed in a car crash while trying to get to the top of the charts, about a young man who falls in love with the singer and how they form an artistic friendship, and about the artist's own downfall and eventual death. The acting is top-notch, the music is great, the cinematography is great (especially the beautiful opening sequence), and the writing is pretty good too. The music in particular is very good, especially when the singer sings a little bit of his song "Mister Moonlight." The story is a little heavy for a film of this type, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't an all-around good movie. If you have a spare 30 minutes or so to kill, you should definitely check this out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The End of the World"   The opening credits of this film say it all, it's a bleak movie about a man trying to survive in a world that has gone to hell and is coming back. It's a dark movie about death and how people have to cope with it. I liked this movie very much, and it has a very bleak and dark atmosphere. It has a lot of interesting ideas, and the actors all did a good job, and all of them were likable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes dark films, or those who like watching movies that have a lot going on. It is very long and takes a lot out of you. But, I would suggest that you watch it with a couple of friends and enjoy the ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main story is really interesting.  It is the story of a family in the rural US where one of the sons is the son of a blacksmith.    The son is named Jack, and the main story focuses on his relationship with his mother.  Jack is a bit of a rebel, and he loves his family more than he loves himself.  He loves his mother, but is very shy around other people.  The movie starts off with a rather odd event, Jack's mother is murdered by her husband.  Her son is devastated.  In order to escape the tragedy he goes to a small town called Mancini where his family lives.  It is a small farming community that is dominated by the blacksmith and his family.  At first the town is rather normal.  But then one day the black smith is murdered and his wife is missing.  Then the townspeople start talking about a mysterious black man that has been seen in the area.  There are rumors that he is an evil person who is coming to Mancinis.  This brings out all kinds of stories and speculation from the town people.   The movie also has a couple of interesting characters:   One of them is the town's Sheriff, who has been in the town a long time.    His father was killed in a car crash when he was young, and his mother died when he is young.  His wife is not too happy about his marriage to a woman with the same name as her husband, but she does allow Jack to stay.  When Jack is in town the Sheriff is always trying to get Jack out of town, because Jack is dangerous.  However, he is more of a "bad boy" than a "man of the law."  He is not a good guy, but he is a decent guy.  They also have a nice little dog named Dottie, who is not afraid to jump into the water.  One thing that bothers me is that the black guy who appears in the movie is not the real blacksmith, but the black man who is played by James Garner.  And he looks more like a black guy from the 1950's than a black smiths from the 19th century.  As a side note, it seems that the only black people in the film are the black people who are trying to kill Jack.  That's all they have, and most of them are pretty stupid.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was in high school, I thought a guy named Kevin Spacey (who is probably best known for playing the ruthless and sadistic detective in the TV show "House of Cards") was a very good actor. I would go so far as to say he was a great actor, and he had a wonderful and distinctive voice.  I'm so happy I grew up in the 90's.  This is one of those movies that I thought was going to be a bit of a letdown, but the film turned out to be one of the most interesting movies I have seen in a long time.  I really liked the concept of the film.    It was really a film about the evils of the media, and how they manipulate the public.  They make us believe that they are all heroes, but are really not.  In the end, I found it very interesting to see how the public would react to this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ _______ The best film about a guy who finds his way back into the world after years of being separated from it, and who, through a series of unfortunate events, meets and falls in love with a girl who has been missing for a long time. I had heard of the film before but had never seen it. My wife was visiting and we decided to sit down and watch the movie. The opening credits were very good, but the rest of the movie, which is very much a story of his search for the girl, was not. The plot is very well told, and is certainly a film that you will enjoy. But the story of the man's search is a little thin. There is a lot of speculation about what happened to the girl and her family, but this is never explained. As a result, the story ends up feeling more like a thriller than a love story. This is a film I would recommend to anyone who loves films about people in trouble. _____________ Rating:  ______________ (out of 5)

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ ___________________________________ The first time I heard the song "Jingle Bells", I was in high school. My school, St. Paul's Catholic, was at the time one of the top schools in the city. We were the only all-boys school in the whole of New York. So, the jingling bell, or jingle, or whatever you want to call it was our way of saying we were proud of our boys. This was the very first film I ever saw, and it was the first movie I ever remember seeing with a soundtrack. So that's what it is. You can hear the jingle bell, the boys singing it. You don't hear it until the very end when the bell is ringing again, but it sounds just like the first one. The story is a bit of a re-telling of the story of the Christmas story, but with an updated ending. It takes place at Christmas time in a small town, where a man who was once a man is now a woman, and who has come to live with her new girlfriend in a house on the outskirts of town. When the new boyfriend is away on business, she decides to take a trip into town and see what the Christmas scene has to offer. This is a very good movie for kids, and adults too. It's the kind of movie you can sit in the theatre with your family and watch for hours on end. You will see things that you will never forget, and that is the beauty of a movie like this. It is one of those movies that you watch for the rest of your life. If you like stories like this, and you are not ashamed to admit that you have seen this movie, then you should watch it again. I'm glad that I finally got to see it, and I'm looking forward to the sequels. _________________________________________________________________________ Rating: *****  Review by: John B. on March 25, 2003
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot of this movie is pretty simple. The main character, a young woman named Maria, is going through a divorce with her husband, and the family lives in a small, isolated farmhouse. She's a pretty nice person, but she's getting to the end of her rope. She thinks about leaving and going back to the city, but her brother-in-law, who is also a writer, insists on staying behind. The problem is, he has a wife and daughter and wants Maria to come live with them. This sets up a pretty interesting family conflict, and Maria has to make a choice between two very different, very selfish people. The acting is pretty good. Maria's mother is very funny. The father's role is even more interesting. It's a good performance and it really makes the movie. The best of the film is the ending. I don't want to give away too much of the ending, but it is a very emotional scene. The music is excellent. I'm not sure what exactly the film was supposed to be about, but I really enjoyed it.  I'm not going to recommend this movie. It doesn't have the charm of a good romantic comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think I was going to like this movie at all, but it is quite a funny and silly movie. It does have a nice little message about how the human race will eventually destroy itself and that we are not really in control of ourselves. This is a great movie to see with a group of friends, if you have a small group and want to show some funny and entertaining movies then this is one of the better ones.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A solid action movie from the 70's, but not a great one, but one that's entertaining.  The action starts off fairly fast.  We have a cop, who is on the run from the evil Nazis, but he's not running for the hills!  A car accident in the middle of nowhere leaves the guy in the car, with a broken arm, and a broken nose.  It takes him to a small town, and the locals start to have an opinion about him.   The town seems a little sleepy, with not much going on.  This is the only area the town doesn't seem to be the only thing going on, because a bunch of Nazis have been holed up in the small town's barn, with two of their officers, and they have a lot of guns.  After a few hours, the townspeople start to become suspicious of this guy, so the police are sent out to search for him.   He's a good looking guy, and I like the look of him, with the long blonde hair and blue eyes.  In the middle, we have an old man, who has a bunch (heck, they're like a herd) of cows, and he wants to raise them.  But they don't like him very much, and after a couple of hours, he has to go out to the field, and herd his animals back to town.  The film starts to get a little rough, after this.  Some of the dialogue is pretty bad, and it's hard to imagine why someone would want to be an action hero.  I can't imagine why anyone would want this guy to be a hero, but I guess it was an attempt to show a hero in action, but it was not very successful.  One thing that the film gets right is that it shows us a couple interesting characters.  One of the people we see in this film is a woman, named Missy, who was born in the town, who can only talk when she's crying.  Her son was hit by a car, and she wants to help him, but she doesn't know how to get around without a vehicle.   So, she starts to teach him how to drive, and this is when she meets her husband, Mr. Green.  Mr.Green is a very wise man, and has a lot to say about life, which he does in a very sarcastic way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this movie on an airplane and it was great. I'm not sure how it will play out, but I thought the ending was a little odd. I think they should have taken the same approach with "Ishtar" as they did with "The Fifth Element."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My dad had a lot of friends who came over. I think they all thought they were there for a good time.   Unfortunately, it was not to be.  The last act is the worst thing I have ever seen.  I can only describe it as a horrible parody of The Blues Brothers.  There was a man who was supposed to be a comedian.  And there was a girl who was not supposed to have a nose.  That was the worst part.  It was so bad it is impossible to describe.  A lot of the acting was terrible.  In one scene, a woman who was dressed as a clown went through a house.  She was supposed too be a clown.  Then she put on her shoes and went out the door.  Why was she dressed as the clown?  There were a lot more scenes like this.  My wife and I were disgusted with this movie.  You can only imagine what a night it was for everyone who saw it.  If you don't like comedy, don't bother watching this movie!   I'm not a big fan of comedies.

I've seen it a couple of times. I'm surprised that I haven't watched it in a while. The cast is great and the plot is very interesting. I also liked that the ending is not what you expect. The movie is well made and well acted.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Last Song" is the story of a man who has just left his house to go to work and has been sitting on the bench in the park all afternoon waiting for the bus. This is the beginning of the film and you can tell the writer had a long time in mind and I love it because it is not just the typical story of people trying to make a living in the city. This time the people in the movie are the city's inhabitants. The film is set in the early 1960s and it is the time of the Black Power movement. This movie is the true story of the murder of a black man by a white policeman and the ensuing riot that follows. The people in this movie don't just go to and from the city in their daily lives but they also come out to the park to listen to the rhythm of the music. This particular time the rhythm is that of a rock and roll band playing their song "Ain't It Fun." This song is very important to the movie because the film takes a look at the city at that time and the way people lived. They go out to listen because it was a very popular song in the 1960s. The movie has many different scenes throughout and you will see things from the viewpoint of people who have been there before. This will make you see how the people of that time looked at the world. It is a movie about a lot of things but it is also a movie that you will want to watch over and over. The ending is great because it really shows that people can be changed by what happens in the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one of those movies where the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, but the performances keep it all together.   The plot is a lot of fun, it takes a few steps forward and a couple back to get to the action.  The characters are all very likable and they are all really fun to watch.  They all have their own motivations for doing what they do.  It is always fun to see the actors work, as well as the director.  And yes, it is always great to see a movie with a good soundtrack.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good film.  The movie's only flaw is that it doesn't make much sense at the beginning.  It's a fairly short movie, but it's a great story.  The characters are well developed.  There is no shortage of action scenes.  I really liked the ending.   I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."  It's the second installment of the " Star Wars " franchise and we get a lot more of the same.  This time, we're going to the planet Naboo and we're treated to the classic line, "May the force be with you."  For some reason, I've been really wanting to see this one since the first one, which was also directed by Yoda, but it never really happened for me.    The reason is that, in my opinion, Yoda was overused and overdone in this movie and I felt like he was overworked.  The second one was a lot better because of this.  However, the sequel was a pretty good one and I really like it.  It's definitely not my favorite Star Wars movie but I'm definitely going to see it again when I have a chance.  I have seen many Star Wars movies and this one is my favorite.  I really liked this one a lot because it was not overly dramatic or overly serious and it's really nice to see all the different kinds of characters that were all really likable.  In this movie, Luke and the droids get to do some pretty cool stuff and I also like the way it's done.  Also, I like how this movie is not a very long movie and the plot is really short, which is a nice change of pace.  This is also the only one of the series where I really don't mind Jar Jar Binks as the bad guy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of the original Terminator and I thought this movie was a great follow up. It's a bit of a slower build up than the first film, and the story is a bit more somber, but it's still a great movie. The plot is really a mixture of the first two movies: a man with a machine in his body that he can use to destroy his enemies. But he needs a human host and one day, a young girl joins him and they become his friends. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't see the original T2: Judgement Day, but I didn't care, the plot was interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished watching The Man from U.N.C.L.E. I thought it was pretty good and enjoyable. There are lots of jokes in it. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a movie. The plot is quite interesting and the humor is funny. I just wish it was a little longer. It was like watching a comedy show, but with science fiction. I think I'll be going out and watching the film again in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favourite movie of all time. A classic that every fan of science fiction should see. The film's style is so iconic, the writing is brilliant, and it is one of the very few science fiction films that can't be put down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with the typical first person narrator telling us about the protagonist, a man who wakes up in a cold cell. After being released from the cell, the protagonist is able to walk, talk, and think, but his memories are gone.   We find out he's been imprisoned for years because he's a member of a cult that believes the world is about to end.  After some experimentation with drugs, a little bit of magic, and a little experimentation with a magic mirror, he finds he can think and speak, but he has no memories. He tries to forget, but the things he remembers are horrible. He can remember when he was a little boy watching his grandfather kill a man in a circus.  He can also remember his father raping his mother when he's an adult.  Then the movie gets to the point where we see the protagonist go through all the memories he's trying to forget.  When he starts to forget his memories, he goes on a mission to find his wife and children.  If you've ever seen the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm not saying this movie is perfect. The movie isn't.  It's just that there are so many memories to be had in this movie.  The story is well done, but you know that when you are watching it that you're in for a ride.  There is a lot of violence and sexual themes in this, but it isn't as graphic as you'd expect.  All in all, a fun movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Jedi is a good and exciting movie. It is good because of the cast, because of J.J. Abrams' directing and because of R2D2. It's good because the movie has a good plot, because the story of a new Resistance and a new First Order is interesting and well-conceived, because there are some really cool effects (for example, the R2-D2 hologram), and because it is fun to see Finn and Rey interact. It will be fun to watch this movie in the theater. It may also be interesting to see it again in 3D, or maybe even 4D.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight is the first movie I've seen where I felt like I had seen something like a dark comedy before. It's not a bad movie in and of itself, but it doesn't really stand out to me in any way. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and it's a good example of what can be done with a comic book movie.  Even if you don't know who Bruce Wayne is, you'll find that he's a pretty good guy and his relationship with the Joker is fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fun movie that takes place in a fun time in the 1980's when they used to make movies about teenagers who would take up residence in their parents' old mansion and spend their time running around the property, trying to find a way out of their troubles.  This movie is a great homage to the 80's, and if you are a fan of 1980's movies this is a good one to check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I just got to see Â The Best of Both Worlds (aka: The Best Episode of Both) Â It is the second episode in a series called The Best Of Both Worlds. The original series started out in 1967. This series takes place in 2065. It is a remake of a series that originally aired in the 50's. In this episode we are introduced to a young woman named Elizabeth. She is on a mission from the future. She wants to stop the Nazis from using the warp drive to conquer the universe. She's a woman with a big heart. She goes to a lot of trouble to help out people. Â So far we haven't seen the warp ship.  This episode is also a remake Â of the first episode of the original series. This is a fun episode and I liked the idea.    The only thing that I don't like about this episode is that they did a lot to make the Nazis look ridiculous.  This was a good episode.  This is one of those episodes that is a good example of what makes this show so fun to watch.  It's a great episode that has a lot going on. It has a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The last two years have seen a lot of "doubled" movies: a horror film that turns into a science fiction film, a comedy that becomes a science drama, a drama that becomes an action-adventure. Â In my opinion, this is the third and final film that fits into that category, and the last one that is even remotely decent.  The movie is a good mix of action and horror, with a fair amount of suspense and mystery mixed in.    (A word of warning, though: the ending is very abrupt.  But the movie itself is not a bad one.)         The movie starts off with the protagonist (the only character in the movie, although the two leads are good, and there is some good writing in this movie) having a hard time deciding what to do.  After being in a car accident, his daughter is now in a mental institution and he is now the single father of a little girl.  This is all well and good until he finds a girl, Laura, who has a lot more personality than he does.  She's a rebellious, crazy, hot-headed girl. This is the type of girl I could imagine myself being, although I have a very low tolerance for hot-heads.  It turns out that she is actually an alien, and when the aliens start to attack the city, the boy decides to get the girl away from the danger and then he has to go on a mission to save the city.  So far, this movie is not bad, it's just not very good, but it is good enough to give me a little time to get to know the characters.  There is some very interesting stuff in this film.  One of the alien characters (who we are told is the daughter of the main character) is actually a very good villain, and is really scary.  (I would have liked to have seen her as the main antagonist in this kind of movie, because she is very well done.  I liked the way that she was written, and I would like to see more of her.)  There are also a number of interesting twists and turns in this story, including some of the most unexpected moments in a science-fiction film. I think this is a great movie, and it's a good reminder that science-fictional films can be a good thing.  A few more things: -I think that the movie gets more

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.   is it bad that I loved this movie?  No, not at all. It's just good. I don't even remember anything else about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai was the first major Japanese film I saw in a cinema for almost a decade. The film was a massive hit in the 1950s and 1960s, but not really a huge hit outside of Japan (despite it being one of the most influential and best-selling films of all time, as well as a major cultural touchstone). It's still not as huge a hit as it once was, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a really, really, very good movie. It might be the best samurai movie ever made. The production values are impeccable, and the acting is absolutely top notch, with great performances by all the main cast. I mean, just look at this performance from Toshiro Mifune. He's the best, he's the funniest, and he's one of a very short list of actors who can do anything and everything with a samurai sword. The only actor who could top him in a swordfight is none other than...Ralph Fiennes, I think. I remember the opening of the movie being a bit of a mess, with a bunch of people trying to make a film of the story, and one of them being the director, who gets a bit lost in the process. This is just about the worst opening to a movie ever. It just doesn't work, and it's one I've never seen before. It also never fails to annoy me with its dialogue. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to punch someone when they were trying to say something. They all sound like a bunch a idiots, especially one of Mifunes' sidekicks, who I'm pretty sure has been working in the movie business since the mid-eighties, and has no idea what the hell he's talking about. I really wish I could take a few shots of this guy's face every time he's speaking, just so I could show it to you. The movie doesn't start off terribly bad, with the story being very simple. The Japanese army has been wiped out, and a couple of soldiers are trying to find out what happened. The samurai, however, are pretty much the bad guys in this film, and are pretty easily dispatched by the soldiers. Then there's a buncha Japanese civilians who end up trying to help the soldiers and are promptly massacred by the samurai. And then...this: So the samurai have been sent to a secret Japanese village, where a bunch more soldiers

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people thought the movie was pretty bad, but I think it's a great idea. It's really about the time in a woman's life when she is having a hard time finding a good man. She is very attractive, but she also gets really mean and nasty to people. I liked the fact that the movie wasn't afraid to show this woman being a jerk, but also being pretty attractive, in a nice way. It also makes me think about how many of the guys in our society get turned off by this woman's appearance, because it's just so...not very pretty.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ _________________________________________ I was a little skeptical when I saw the title. After reading the synopsis, I figured this was a remake of the classic horror/horror-thriller "The House of The Devil". I was wrong. The remake is actually a remake (of a remake). I had forgotten about the original. It was one of my all-time favorite movies, but I don't know if it's as scary as it was back in the 80's. Maybe the actors are a little too good, but still, I'd say this is a good remake of a good film. It's a little more entertaining and a little scarier. I enjoyed it.

It doesn't have an ending like a typical martial arts movie. It does a lot of stuff without any scenes. It is a long movie but it does have a nice ending. The music is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie the first night I went to see it.   It is a film about a poor girl (who goes by the name of Lola) who, as the title suggests, lives with her father in the slums of India.  Lola is a poor but good girl, though the father is not so kind.  Her father is a man who works for a company that manufactures clothes.  He makes Lola a model for one of their lines of clothes. Lola doesn't know anything about fashion, though, so she wears all the clothes in the line, including a dress that is the same color as the clothes that the company sells.  She's so poor that she can't even afford to buy her own clothes.     She is also lonely, and so she tries to meet other girls, but none of them take her seriously.  When she finally meets a boy, who is much older than she is, she doesn't really like him at first.  After a few dates, however, she finds that she is interested in him.  She tries to win his love by becoming his mistress, and she tries very hard to be a good girl.  However, she is constantly disappointed in him, because of his laziness and bad manners.  The only thing that saves her from being a bad girl is her friendship with a young boy, a fellow model for the company.  One day, however...    Lula gets in a fight with a boy who is the son of a wealthy man, and Lola wins.  At first, it is a good thing for Lola, because she finally gets to meet some boys.  Unfortunately, though...      The boys at the company don't seem to like her, because they think that she's just a rich girl, and they don't want to be with her.  As they try to get a date with her, however....       The girls at the modeling company are very jealous of Lula, and their envy is not the only thing they have in common with her; they also have a lot in common, too.   They also all have similar personalities, though; they all are very nice and good-hearted.  But then, just when they are about to have their date with Lola....    ...she ends up in a car accident, and the company decides to take her out of the modeling business.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The action scenes in this film are great. The story is simple but the execution is solid. The acting is a little on the thin side and the cinematography is a bit of a let down. The film has some good action sequences and a solid plot that is only slightly interrupted by the film's main character, a young woman named Sarah (Amy Adams). Sarah is a good-hearted young woman who believes she is destined to be a doctor. She has a bit too much faith in her mother and father and as a result has to go through a lot of hardship to get where she is headed. This is not a film you would expect to be nominated for an Academy Award and it certainly isn't for the sake of it. The plot isn't bad but it's certainly not as good as some of the better films in this category. I will be giving this film a 4.0 out of 10. I give it a solid C.   Advertisements

This film does a good job at building up the world of this story. It has a strong sense of danger. It is a story of a group of people who have to survive a night in a foreign country. It follows a group on a journey of survival as they face dangers both man made and natural. The film does have its problems. It suffers from some bad acting and poor acting can ruin a movie. It also suffers from a lot of bad writing and not enough story.   Overall this is a good film that does a decent job of telling a story. I'm interested to see what happens next.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many movies that have a happy ending, I had high hopes for the film that is about a young woman who goes out of town and meets a handsome man, and in the process gets involved in a life changing event. I had not heard of the director, who I think is called Michael Moore. I have heard of a few of his films but did not realize he had directed a movie. His movies are not good, but I am a sucker for them. The actress who plays the young woman, Elizabeth Shue, was not only a good looking woman but an excellent actress. She was so attractive and so beautiful, that it was almost hard to watch her play the role of a young girl. She played the part well, but it was not a very good movie. The film had a happy-go-lucky feel to it, but the scenes were repetitive and the film was too long. It was also too long for me, because I do not like films that are so long that I do NOT see the ending. I would have enjoyed it more if the film had been shorter. The soundtrack was also good, especially for a Michael Moore film. I am going to watch it again just to see what the next scene is. I did not like the film, but you can not expect much from a Michael Mowbray film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Star Wars" films are my favorite, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy are my favorites, and the "Indiana Jones" series is my favorite. In fact, there's no series more like "Star" than this one.   It has action, adventure, adventure with a hint of romance, a bit of humor, and is really quite good, especially the first three movies.  And it is the best of the series, period.  The only thing that bothers me is that it's not as good as the others, and I have to say that the first "Lord Of The Rings" film (the third) is a much better film than this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a film that makes you think about what a strange world we live in.  The world of the "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast is a strange place.    This is a story about an alien species who came to Earth, and their ability to create and control people.  They have the ability to "sick people" out, but they are not very good at it.  I think this is the most interesting thing about this film.  The alien race does have some intelligence, and they seem to know that they are in a bad place.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the Alien movies and I can't wait to see the next one.   The movie is good and I like how the crew are the only survivors.  I like that they are trying to get the ship back to Earth but in the process they are running into problems and the Alien is on their tail.  The story takes some twists and turns but is still good.  If you like the Alien films then this one is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the movie. It's really entertaining, and the way the movie has a dark side, the fact that the main character, Mr. Voorhees, is a dead ringer for the vampire in Bram Stoker's Dracula (I love Bram Stokers Dracula) is very cool. It has that Bram Stoke vibe, a creepy feeling, and an eerie atmosphere. The way it ends is very dark and chilling.   It's not really a horror movie in the way that you would expect from a movie called Friday the 13th Part 2. It does not follow the typical horror formula. It takes its own style, its own plot, and it has a more personal story that you really can't believe until you watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last half of this film is absolutely great.  It is an epic fantasy film, but it's an epic that is about the power of love and a very good love story.  This film has a very special place in my heart because it is about a young girl who has to fight her way through the dark dungeons of a wizard's tower.    I am not a huge fan of fantasy films but I found this film to be very enjoyable.  The music is very good and it is very well acted and written.  If you like epic fantasy films or just fantasy films then you will probably like this film.  This film has been praised by a lot of people so I'm sure you will like it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know this was a movie before I started watching it. It was not an easy film to watch, but it was a good one. It is not a "horror" film, it is a thriller. It doesn't go too far from the "horrific" movies you find on cable and movies on DVD. There are no jump scares or blood and guts. It keeps the horror films away from this one.   The film starts off with a very familiar looking old house with a beautiful pool in the front yard. This house is run by a woman named Dorothy, who is not very happy with her son and her housekeeper. There is a man who lives in the house that lives there, a very odd looking man named Ray. Ray is a very intelligent man, but he can't talk very much. He is not an ordinary man. He has a little dog named Gussie. Ray gets a job as a cleaner at the house. The cleaning service has some odd things going on. The housekeeper, Mrs. Jones is the first to find Ray's body after he is murdered. It turns out that Gussie is the one who killed Ray. He didn't do it by himself. The police are called in to figure out what has happened. They find out that Ray was having an affair with the housekeeper's daughter. The daughter, Lucy, is a witch, and she wants Ray dead.  After the police are done with Ray's murder, the police discover the body of Gussie and his skull is missing.  It turns around that Gameron is Ray's son. The father and son had a complicated relationship. Gussie's father is a wealthy businessman who is in debt. His wife had an affair and left him.  When Gussie was small, his mother, a witch and his father were involved in a fight and killed each other. The reason for the fight is unknown. The old house is a little creepy and it is hard to watch. The people living there are very odd and it does not make sense.  I will be watching the film again, and I have to say that I found the film to be interesting. It takes a little while to get to the good parts, but once you get there it is pretty good.  I am sure that I will see this movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is a little convoluted, but not a lot. The main character (Tommy Gun) is an ex-military man who wants to get back to being a regular guy, and gets a job as a bartender. He has to go to a big city to do this, and he gets into a car accident while driving, where he gets shot in the shoulder. The bullet gets lodged in his shoulder, and then the police arrive and he's taken to the hospital. Then they get him out, but then a lot of things happen, and it looks like he's dead, but he isn't. Turns out he's actually in a coma and he has no idea how he got there, but his memory is starting to come back. He is slowly getting his memories back, but the police have him tied to a chair. So, it's not a simple case, but it's definitely not a bad one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a few times since its release. I liked it better than the first one. I think the original one was more original than this one. The original one had more of a comedy feel to it. I like the original better. This one had a more realistic feel to the movie.   The acting was good in this one as well.  "I'm a man who wants to be the greatest of all time!"   In my opinion this was one of the best movies of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot. I mean really liked. This is an interesting little movie. The main character is a little old man that lives alone and loves his little dogs. I think that he loves his dogs so much that he is a good husband and a good father. The movie itself is very good and very interesting. I will tell you more about it later, but just like the main character's dog, it was also very funny.   It really is a short movie. It is only a few minutes long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been watching the original Star Wars trilogy since I was a kid, and was always drawn to them. I have seen the original trilogy three times and each time the action and characters are just as good. In fact, I would argue that they are better than the original film trilogy, which I did see in theaters.   The story follows Luke Skywalker, a man who has had a traumatic life, but one that he tries to put behind him. He is a Jedi Knight and the Jedi Order has taken him in to train, hoping that he will be the savior of the galaxy. The story is told in three parts: Part 1 - The Phantom Menace (the first part) Part 2 - Attack of the Clones (the second part) and Part 3 - Revenge of the Sith (the third part).   There are a few differences in the story between the three films, but I don't see any major changes.  The first thing that I noticed about the film is that it is not a typical Star Wars film. It has no original characters or stories, but it has great story lines and action. The action scenes are great. There are many cool special effects, such as the battle between the Death Star and the Separatist base, the fight with the droids on the planet Naboo, and the battle on the Death Stars. The first half of the film, Part 1, is a little slow in its pace and not a lot happens. The battle between Yoda and Count Dooku is interesting, but not too exciting. The second half of Part 1 is faster paced and the action is better. The final part of Part 2 is much better and has a lot of fun with the characters and the plot. The last part of the movie is awesome. It is all over the place, but has a nice payoff.  A little confusing, but still a great story.  In all, a great film.  The Phantom Menaces

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My mom got me the DVD version of this movie about a family living in a very poor part of New Orleans in the 50's. The movie is set in the old part of the city. It was the middle of the decade when a lot of people moved out to the suburbs and the poverty level rose in the city because of that. It's a very short movie, so there is not much to say about it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many ways to look at the film "Escape From Alcatraz".  It's a film about a couple of kids who escape a prison and end up in a strange prison/cave/cabin in the woods.  The film has some excellent acting, as well as a strong and original storyline.   The music is good, and it's a nice way to end the film.  So the film was shot on location, and has a very unique look.  It is very similar to the classic film "The Shining" and "The Omen".  It's also worth noting that the kids in this film have some interesting and unique names.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film, and it's not a bad film.   It's got a good story, and a good pace, with some good action sequences, a decent amount of laughs and some good character development.  The story starts with a guy who's been living on the road for a few years.  He runs across a little girl, and he takes her under his wing, and tries to help her find a job.  The kid is a lot like me in that she is very innocent and naive.  She is always trying to please the older men who treat her like dirt, but she never does anything bad.  Then, she meets a nice old man named Jim, and they become friends, and eventually fall in love.  But before that, the old man has a plan for the kid.  One day, she will be the last person on earth.  Now, I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but it is a very good film that is filled with good action and some very good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure if this film is one of the best films I've ever seen, but it's the best movie I've seen in a long time.   It is a film about a man named Johnny (played by John Cleese), who is a successful cartoonist in a city named New York (I know).   One day, while he is doing a cartoon, his house catches on fire and he is left trapped inside, where he is discovered by the police.  His wife (played in the film by the excellent Diane Keaton) tries to save him, but he has other plans in mind.  After saving his house, he goes on to his next stop: New York City.    There, he is the star of a new cartoon show called "The Muppet Show," but his boss, Mr. Zoidberg (played with great zest by the great Jim Henson), doesn't think he is good enough to work with.  In order to prove himself, Johnny takes a job in the sewers, where his new friend the cat named Scooter (played again by Jim Hensons) helps him on his way.  The plot of the film is rather simple: Johnny is in New York doing a series of cartoons, while the city of New York is at war with the rest of the world.  One night, he meets a woman named Dorothy, who is from the future, who tells him about a time where the world is ruled by a tyrant called Zoid, and she also gives him a book, which turns out to be a time machine.  Once Johnny has gotten the book, he heads off into the future to find Zoid (played brilliantly by the late, great Richard Lewis), while Dorothy (who has now gone back in time) helps Johnny find a way to save his house.  With all of this in mind, the film actually works as a very well made movie.  This movie was made by people who knew how to make a good story.  As far as animation goes, it is very good, and I believe that the people who made this movie really know what they are doing.  John CleESE is in the movie and he doesn't really look like John CleEESE.  He is the same age, but his face is a bit more smooth and round than the man who plays him.  I thought this was an excellent choice for John CleESESE.  All
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lonely at the Top"  (1982)  I have seen most of John Ford's movies, but I've never seen a movie quite like this one.  It's a movie about a man who gets drunk on whisky and whiskey, and a movie that makes the audience feel like they're at a good old time.    The film begins with a shot of a pretty girl, who seems to be in trouble.  There are people around her who seem to be getting her attention.  They start laughing at her and talking to her.  Then, she gets up from the table and goes outside.  It is late, but the place is still dark.  Suddenly, a truck comes and pulls up, and three men with rifles get out.  The woman is scared and runs.  And then the movie cuts to a man in a suit getting into a cab and going to the same place where the woman was just before she left.  He walks around and starts talking to the people there.  In this scene, he talks to a guy in a shirt that reads "B&H"  It's a scene that would have been quite funny if it weren't so sad.  Ford has the men come around and ask him if he knows what they want.  This is the only scene in the movie where Ford doesn't show the man his gun.  Ford then says he does.  As they talk, the man is starting to lose it.  When Ford finally says that he knows the men, the men start shooting at them.  A car with a man's head in the window comes up and takes off, and it looks like the man's death is coming to an end.  After a few shots, the truck drives away.  I have to wonder if the man in the suit and the others were all part of the same operation.  For a movie with so many men in it, Ford is not all that interested in the man.  We don't really get to see him.  Perhaps we should have seen him.   The men are now in their own car.  Here's another scene where Ford isn't interested in his characters.  While the men are driving off, we get a glimpse of a little girl in the back seat.  Her father, a small boy, looks out the window and we see his hand shaking.  That little girl is the one who starts

Smeee is a cute cat, she is very intelligent, she always knows what she wants, she never gets mad, she likes to play with her toy ball and she loves to listen to a book called "Smee the Cat". Smeey's father is a poor farmer and he needs the money he makes in a day by selling potatoes to a rich man named Daffy. Sseey's only friends are a cat and a dog, she often comes to play when her father is away. When Daffyr comes to Smeen's farm, Smey gets her own food and toys. When she hears Daffyn say he has bought a new car, she asks Daffym to let her play with him. When they arrive at the new car Daffyd decides to give Smeye a new toy, a big red ball. But it's too small for Smeie, so he tells her that he's going to buy her a bigger toy, but she'll have to wait. Sometime later Daffyy and Smees father come back from the village. Sceey is tired, she goes to sleep. When the father and mother come back, they find that Scee is gone, she's not playing with her toys, she was sitting in the yard. Sdey has no idea what happened. After some searching, Sdeey's parents find her hiding in a cave. Daffys father decides to buy a bigger car, but he doesn't want Ssee to play in it, he decides to get a big cat instead, Sseye. When Sdee goes to the car, Scey gets to play too, but Sceee doesn't play like Sseie does. Soon she learns that her father gave Scees father a new ball, a much bigger one, and Sceees father won't let Sceie play in the big ball, but only in the little one. Then the cat comes home and Ssey's father lets her play. Sveey gets mad when she learns about the new toy she can play with, she tries to play but she can't, so she tells Sceys father to get rid of the new ball and go buy a smaller one, she will play in that one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is set in New York in the late 1980's. It has an interesting twist, the police department is run by a "corporate" type. They are corrupt and want to cover up the crime they are involved in. The main character is a private investigator. He has a client who was involved in a car crash and the police are trying to frame him for the accident. It is up to the investigator to prove the client's innocence. The movie has some good action scenes. The only problem is that it seems that the movie could have been much more interesting.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I'm in the mood for a comedy.   The story is about a group of friends who play basketball for a small school.  When a new kid arrives at their school the basketball team is divided into two groups.  One group is made up of the oldest players on the team.  The other group is comprised of the newest players.  After a few games it becomes apparent that the newest team is better than the oldest team.   One day a new player is brought on to the team and immediately makes the older team better.  This leads to a game between the two teams.  The younger team wins by a large margin and is ready to claim the title of "Champion".   They head to the high school gym where they are given a game against the older players.   The older players try to beat the younger team, but they are not able to do so.    They are in a losing streak and they head home in defeat.  It is at this point that the oldest player realizes that the new player has taken his position.  He realizes that he is a better player than his own team. They head back to their school where the older player tries to convince the younger player to join him.  Eventually the new guy joins the older guys.  So now the older guy's basketball team has a new member and they are all excited about this.  They get their act together and they go into the game against their younger teammates.  Unfortunately the new guys don't take it easy on them.  Their opponent is not as good as the older squad and is able to defeat them easily.  That is when the new kid comes in.  His game is just as good, if not better than his teammates. The old guys try to stop him and are unable to do this. After a hard fought battle the younger players win the game and take on the champion.  There is some tension in the locker room after this, but the team is excited about the new addition to their team. As time goes on the younger guy has the older kids wondering why they were not picked to join the champion team.

I don't think he gets any worse from his dad and mom. The film is quite funny at times. There is one scene where his mom's boyfriend gets in trouble and is punished. His mom's friend is very mean to the boy and calls him names. Then the mother and dad say the boy is to blame for this. This is the first time the boy gets punished by a father and the dad is not very good at it. There are a couple of good scenes in this film but not enough to make up for the other bad scenes. This film is for kids only. I really don't see why people go to see this movie. _________ I really liked this movie and I am glad that I went to see it. It has a great storyline and some great jokes. There's also a great song that was a good way to end the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a very cool looking movie about a space station that has become infested with a race of creatures that are so hideous that they have no eyes or even an external skeleton. They are basically a swarm of disgusting tentacles, limbs, and eyes. The alien creatures are led by a man with an eyepatch, and a woman that is as pale as a ghost. These creatures are really scary and even the little ones are bad-ass.   The story takes place on the space station, which has become the home for a group of humans who have been "hibernating" for a long time. The station has been in orbit for many years and has come to the attention of aliens.  These aliens are interested in the station and it's inhabitants.  This movie is a classic horror flick that is not to be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, entertaining movie with some decent, but not great, action scenes and some of the acting was very good, with some very funny scenes, including some of a more serious nature.  The main character is a man named Paul who is on his way to a football game when he is pulled over by the police for speeding.  His car is wrecked and he finds himself in a situation that he is unable to get out of.  Paul then is offered a ride by a couple of cops and after a brief encounter with them they offer Paul a ride to the stadium where he is to meet a woman.  When they get to the city, they find a man, Paul's ex-girlfriend, has been killed by her boyfriend, who is also an officer.    When Paul tries to find out what happened, he is confronted by the policeman who has been harassing him since his wife's death.  The cop then decides to kill Paul but the ex-wife, who has survived, intervenes and Paul manages to save his life.  Later Paul learns from the girl's ex, that she is also a cop, and is looking for revenge.  With the help of his friends and an ex-cop friend, Paul is able to take down the bad cop.  I like this movie.  It was fun to watch, it had some good action scenes, good performances, a good soundtrack and a great ending.  There are some really good and funny scenes in this movie, including Paul's girlfriend being the first to discover that she has a cop lover.  This movie is a must watch.

The other bad moment is when the giant kills a little girl in front of a little boy. I mean, what's the point of this movie? The plot is just stupid. It's a silly movie. There's no reason for a giant to be here or a bunch of little girls to be there. The whole movie is like a bad dream you have that is not real. It looks like a cartoon that's not real either. The characters are stupid, the plot is stupid, and the ending is stupid. You have to watch this movie if you want to laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening credits have some of the best musical numbers ever put on film. This is a great movie about an alien who finds the human race in an alien environment and has a profound encounter with them. The special effects are great and the acting is terrific. It is very easy to see why this film was a hit when it was released.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dances with Wolves" is a very good movie that should be seen by anyone.  This movie is about a man who is a wolf pack leader.      The story begins when a man comes up to a wolf who is eating a dead wolf and he asks the wolf to take the dead wolf back to the village.   The man asks the woman in the wolf pack to take him to the woman.  The woman accepts.  This is where the story begins.  There are a lot of wolves and there are wolves who are very strong and will eat a lot and have the ability to kill a human.  One of the wolves is the leader and he is very strong.  He is also the best at hunting and has the ability of looking at a person's heart and then deciding if he is good or evil.  When he gets a new pack to be in he brings in the leader to lead them.  We learn the stories of the people that live in the village and then we get to see how things work out in the wolves pack.  Some of the things they do are good and some are bad.  Overall this is a good story.  It is a movie that is very entertaining and has a lot to say.  I give it a rating of 7.5 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a lot of heart.   There are a lot people who are willing to sacrifice their lives for what they believe in.  It is easy to get swept up in the action and forget about the characters.  I also don't think that this movie is all that good.  This film is more like a series of scenes.  The only scenes that I really liked were the ones in the middle.  But for the most part, it is a movie about two guys who are doing a job that is very dangerous.  There is a big war going on, and this job is one of the first to get to the front.  They have to take out an entire squadron of the enemy.  A lot of the action is in a tunnel.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't seem to have a lot to say about it.  In the end, it doesn't really matter who wins.  If you have any interest in the military or the war, this is a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie about a man who is forced to take his own life after his girlfriend and her husband are killed in an automobile accident.   I was a bit disappointed when I first heard about this movie because I was expecting a thriller and I was not disappointed.  I do not want to give it a low rating because I do like it but it does have its bad points.  The story is about a couple that decide to take their children out of the orphanage and live in a house on the beach with their friend, who was a former Marine.  In order to keep them safe, the parents hire a private detective to follow the leads on a series of murders.  However, things start to go wrong when the detective is murdered and the lead detective has his own problems.  Another problem with this movie is that it was not written very well.  There are several plot holes in the movie and I would like to see the script changed so that this movie does not get a low score from me.  As for the movie, it was entertaining and the story is interesting and it does a good job at creating suspense and suspense.  This movie is a good thriller and it is a better movie than it has any right to be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is awesome. The movie takes place in the past. We see a young couple who had been married for about 8 years. They have a baby boy named Paul.   They move to a new place and start a new family.  It was great to see the two of them get along. They are a loving couple.  I really liked the way they had sex in the beginning of the movie.  They were just having fun.  The sex scene was a lot of fun. They both were having fun with each other.  When I was watching the movie, I didn't see anything inappropriate.  There was not a lot that I thought was inappropriate. It was just good sex.  This is a good sex movie. It is fun, it is exciting, and it has a lot to offer.

I think it's one of the greatest movies ever made, but this one is better. I love the story of Luke, and it's funny and full of action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "One of the best films of the year, a fun and engaging film with great performances from John Turturro, Jessica Lange, and Steve Buscemi.   One of the few films in recent years to have me wanting to see it again." "The Last Samurai" (1988) I just finished watching the new, I think, second "Last Samurai" movie. I'm not a big fan of the first one, but this one is a lot better. I liked the first movie, but there's a little too much of it here and it feels a little overlong. I have to wonder, was this just a marketing ploy? Maybe a bit too much samurai stuff, but it's good action stuff, a little more in depth than the first film. The ending was a little rushed, but I think the film was better as a whole. It's very entertaining, but that doesn't mean I can't see what they're going for with this one. "Rumble Fish" (1998)   This was one of those films where I was hoping for something a little bit different. It seemed to be an attempt to do a bit of a comedy with some serious moments. It worked pretty well, but a little slow. It was definitely not a good choice to be released in the summer. I was disappointed when I watched this one, as I really liked it. The plot is very interesting and the acting is great. I would say the movie is much better than "Rumblefish" though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked it a lot.    The movie is about a family of three who are getting married in a big wedding ceremony. The kids want to stay home to help with the preparations for the wedding and their mother has to help them pack.  The kids are really smart and enjoy each other and help each other out.  They play in the yard and then take it outside and go for a walk in the fields.  When they come back they are all in the living room.  One of the kids says "I'm so excited to be a father, to be married to the girl who made me happy."  The girl responds "You mean you're not sad?"   It turns out that the bride is having a hard time keeping her mind off the wedding preparations and her father wants to help.  It seems that the boy has been taking care of the family for a long time and he has a few secrets of his own that he wants to tell the girls.  He talks about how he was in a gang for a while and that he was very bad to his friends.  So the girls try to comfort him and tell him they love him.  But he just cannot help himself and he says he wants his own gang.  That makes the girls all upset because he is such a bad boy.  Then he says that they will be like his gang when they are married.  Now the girl and the boy get all upset again.  What happened to him?   But then he says they will have to take their wedding vows.  I like this movie because it is funny and I really enjoyed it.

The story is great, and I like the character development.   It's like a combination of "A Fistful of Dollars" and "The Last Detail".  It has some great action, and a really funny part when the bad guy has a gun that he uses to "shoot the good guy".  And he does it with a smile on his face.

It stands more than 1,500 feet above the rest of the complex, and is the tallest building in Oregon. It has been used as the setting for several Hollywood movies, including "The Shining," "Dr. Strangelove," "Top Secret!" and "G.I. Jane." The building has also appeared in other TV shows, such as "The Outer Limits," "Babylon 5" and "The X-Files." It is also the site of an annual music festival, The Tower Festival, and has a museum. The tower is also home to the Oregon State Capitol Police and the Oregon Highway Patrol. The building is a state historic landmark."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good story with a good ending. I'm a fan of these old school horror movies. The plot is simple: a girl who is a witch is haunted by a ghost that is haunting her home. Her parents are away on a camping trip, and she is in the kitchen trying to make a cake. Her father comes home from the grocery store and gets upset with her. The girl hears noises from the living room, and walks down the stairs. The ghost of her father grabs her by the leg and tells her that if she wants to be a witch, she must feed it a child. It doesn't take long for the girl to realize what is happening and she runs upstairs to her bedroom and jumps in the tub. I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this. It is absolutely terrifying. I was so afraid that I would drown that I couldn't even look at the screen. It really got me. This movie has been on the short list of the top 10 Horror movies ever since I first saw it. The sound is good and the editing is nice. This is a movie that will stay in my mind forever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason this movie is not a 10/10 is that I am not a huge fan of comedy movies. That is not to say that they don't work. In fact, they are often great. This one is one of them. It has a very simple premise: a guy (Paul Rudd) who is in his 30's is on a trip from the north to the south. His best friend (Ed Helms) is a cop who is trying to solve a murder. The killer is a serial killer who kills people at night. Paul's best friend is a very talented detective (Mark Duplass). Together they go on a night to night investigation. I was amazed by this movie. I thought it was funny and the movie kept me laughing. It was good enough to watch in one sitting. It is a good start to a great movie series.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a remake of the 1984 cult classic 'Bubble Boy'. A strange and funny movie about a little boy who is a robot. He is given a 'bubble' by his father who also happens to be the inventor of the robot. When the bubble bursts, the little boy becomes a real boy. He gets to play with his friends (the robots) who are called 'Bubs' and he learns to love and care for them. The little boy is a very funny character who is really quite adorable. The movie has great effects and is a great fun to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It is all true and true, and it's not true. It is all a dream, the dream of an old man. He dreams of being a great hunter, and in his dream, he is a man, but he isn't a man. It's a dream of a boy. He is a boy, but his dreams are more like children's."   This movie is so very, very cool. It was a dream. It has some very odd and unique visual effects. It also has some fantastic music, which I can't remember the name of. It should also be noted that the movie is an adaptation of a children's book, and I can see why it was adapted the way it was. It does get a bit silly at times, but it's a good story and it is a little bit strange, and has some really great visuals.   The only real complaint I can give this movie is that it is not really very well made. It looks a bit too old, it's shot a little too close to the camera, it has a lot of strange and creepy visuals, it just doesn't feel like a high budget movie. It doesn't have a whole lot of visual appeal, and the acting isn't that great either. The story isn't bad, but its really only a few of the scenes in the movie that are really great. The rest are pretty average, and its a pretty weird movie, but that is part of what makes it so great. It just feels like a dream... of a child. It isn't the best story ever written, but then, I don't really care if a story is the best ever written. It sure is a cool movie.   for more information about this movie, check out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0135984/

After a long drive, they get to town.   The desert is pretty cool with some nice sights and desert life.    When they get there, they see a bunch of people that look like they are from a movie.  But then they meet a pretty girl.  When they see her, the guys start to take notice of her.  It turns out that she is the daughter of the desert dwelling prophet, and she has a really good looking baby.  She is so good looking, that they start to wonder if she is going to marry the guy who found her. But they soon find out that he was looking for a pretty woman so he could take her back to his desert dwelling.  This is a good story with a good ending.  I also liked that the movie was good about what it was trying to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the story of a very rich and very foolish family that goes to a very strange place to try to solve their problems. The movie is not about the problems the family have. It is about a group of people trying to solve problems and the problems don't get solved. There are a lot of strange things going on in the movie and they never really get resolved. I was never quite sure what was going on. I felt that the movie had a weird sort of 'horror' quality to it. I guess that is what is meant when a person talks about a 'horrorshow' but I wasn't sure what the horror was about. It did not have a lot going for it. The ending made no sense to me. It seemed that the whole movie was made up as a sort of an experiment. I am not sure if the movie was a 'failure' or if it was a sorta 'failureshow' or what. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the ending was quite interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm gonna kill this motherfucker!" I'm not gonna lie. This movie is kind of a letdown. It has the same feeling as the last one, but not the same level of action. This is a different story. A boy who was a very bad student in school, was found dead in his house. The police, who were looking for the killer, find his corpse in a bathtub. They also find a key that was used in his death. It turns out that the boy who killed him was a boy who didn't want to be a killer. The boy who murdered him wanted to be an artist, so he stole his mother's painting, painted it, and gave it to a friend who wanted to sell it. The painting is a masterpiece. It is a haunting image of the dead child's eyes. There are other elements of the story that don't really add anything to the movie. I'll just give a quick review of the movie, then I'll give my thoughts on it.  The movie starts out with a little girl named Amy, who was found murdered in her house. Her mother believes that she was the victim of a home invasion. It seems that she had been dead for a while, and that the intruder had been at the house long enough to kill her, and then run away. The house is being watched by a man who is an FBI agent. He believes that this is the work of a serial killer who has been killing people all over the country. There is also a guy that is trying to solve the case. The guy is very strange, and I couldn't quite make out what he was saying. He has the appearance of a detective, but I couldn the get his name, and his voice is really weird.  The FBI agent, played by Richard Pryor, finds a little boy's painting in the boy's mother's apartment. He recognizes it as a work of art, and brings it to the FBI's lab.   They test it to see if it is a good representation of a human body, and the painting comes up as a match. The girl is called Amy, and her mother believes it was a hit-and-run accident. The father of the boy, Danny, is skeptical, and wants to know why the boy was killed.  After a series of events that involve a series a murders, the agent is forced to make a choice, and it's a very hard choice to

This movie is pretty scary. I was pretty scared at first. But it wasn't until the end when I realized that it wasn.t a horror film at all. It was a sci-fi film. I really liked it. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good sci-fisical movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many people, I never knew much about the film "Dawn of the Dead" when it was first released. But, once I saw it, I knew it was one of the best films of the 1990's, with a terrific story and some great special effects. It was not a great film by any means. It has some very low-budget special effects that look bad in the first few minutes, and the dialogue is so terrible. But the characters are wonderful and the special effects are impressive. The film has a great plot, with characters who really are not unlike those we see in real life. They have great chemistry, and, even if you are not a fan of zombie films, you can enjoy this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was surprised to see that this movie was not only very good but also very unique. The story of a young woman (I don't remember her name) who travels from her home to a mysterious island to find a lost soul who has been separated from his family and a love interest who she finds there and that it is a dark and mysterious place. The girl, although she is a bit naive, has a wonderful way with people and a very beautiful face. She is also a very good cook and although she does not know much about cooking, she can cook a good meal when she has nothing else to do. This movie is a lot like a Disney movie with a few differences: it is set on an island in the Caribbean and the characters are not the princesses or animals but normal people, although the movie is not about the natural world but the supernatural. The movie is more about the people of the island than the natural scenery and I can see the similarities to the characters of the movie "The Little Mermaid" in the movie. It is interesting that the movie was made in the early 1940s and is so dark that I thought it was made after the movie of the same name. The music is great and I liked the story. The film has a very long, beautiful and very dark ending. I would recommend this movie to those who like dark movies and to those people who want to see a good story in a very dark and unusual place.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil's Backbone" is a true story.  I am a sucker for true stories about the Old West.    This is no exception.    This movie is a good example of how a good story can be told without a great script.  The movie takes place in Arizona.  The movie begins with a man named John Dillinger.  Dillinger was a former Union officer and was arrested for killing some Mexicans in an infamous incident known as the "Old West Shootout".   It's not too long after this that the story begins.  John Dill is an outlaw who is looking for a new life.  He wants to get his old life back, and in doing so he must find a woman who will love him.  At first the movie seems like a typical western with lots of action, but it is not until the last thirty minutes of the movie that things take a turn.  After the shootout the film switches to a more realistic depiction of the Old west.  This is not an old west based movie, but a real time depiction.  It seems like this movie is set in a modern day.  In this new day the people of the west are not as tough as they were before.  Instead of being tough, they are more concerned with making money.  They are much more trusting, which is a very bad thing for the men who are trying to make it.  I was very impressed by the way this movie portrayed the OldWest.  There is no denying that the Old western is an interesting era in American history.  But there is nothing wrong with a modern depiction.     The story is set during a time when there was little to no social order, and there was a great deal of violence.  These events are not presented in a bad way, and the violence is not presented to a negative or glorifying effect.  A large portion of the film deals with the men trying to find a wife.  However, this film is much more than just a love story.   It's about survival.

This is a good comedy, with the occasional silly scene here and there. The music is great, and the acting is great too.  : I'm glad to see that there is a film out there that is a great homage to the old Westerns and B-movies that I loved as a kid. It's not exactly a high art film, but it's still a fun watch. The story is a little silly, and there are some funny scenes, but I think this is all in fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ It's a strange time in film history. It's as if the first half of the 20th century and the early 20th were only moments in the life of cinema. There are some fantastic films in the first two years of the century (the most famous is the one made by the great Georges Méliès in 1913), but after a period in which it was hard to find anything better than a cheap and cheerful, almost ludicrously long melodrama, a new, more serious period of cinema began. In the same year, the first feature length film was produced by Victor Sjöström, a very accomplished director who had made his reputation with a number of short films. This one was a great success. The picture is full of mystery, mystery, and more mystery. In addition to Sjõströl's directorial style, the picture is filled with many fascinating actors. The lead is a young man called Ljung, who seems to be a hopeless romantic, but has a kind and sensitive heart. He is in love with a beautiful, rich girl called Mäki, who is married and has a child. Ljö meets her on a train and falls in love at first sight. He asks her to marry him and, despite her family's objections, she accepts his proposal. The marriage is arranged. But Ljìng is a bit of a wild man. He doesn't want to marry Mäkki, because he doesn't like her mother, because she is a womaniser, and because she has a beautiful son. Lìjung also hates the fact that Mäkki's mother has a big nose, which makes him think she is ugly. Lügen is a man who loves his family but hates his wife. When he is sent to the army in 1914, he is forced to leave his wife behind. His only companion is a pretty girl, called Ränn. They live together for a time and they become close friends. LJìn and Ränti fall in love and, for a while, they think of getting married. The army doesn't allow it. Län and his wife are unhappy about this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie.   The main character is a strong and likable guy who is trying to live a life of luxury. He is the best of the best in the world.  He doesn't let anyone stop him and is able to handle a lot of things that others could never handle.  In fact, he has more than enough money to live the life he wants.  It isn't until he meets the woman he falls in love with that things start to go south for him.  She is a bit of a spoiled brat who has a lot going on.  Even though she is his soulmate, she also is a little bit of an attention seeker.  While they are both trying to get what they want, things are never really that simple.  The story is very well-paced and the ending is a surprise.  I recommend this movie to all who are looking for a great movie to watch.  It is not a very long movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said before, this is a movie I really enjoyed. It has a good story line, and a good performance by the main actor. There are a few flaws with this movie. The ending is a little cheesy and not as good as I wanted it to be. And I think I missed out on a good ending by not being able to see the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed watching this movie. I did not enjoy the ending though. I know the movie does have a happy ending but I don't really like the ending that much. I felt it was very rushed. I do not like the movie at all. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen "The Big Sleep" (I had seen the movie when it was in theaters, but I was too young to understand the whole plot), and this was my first time seeing it. The film is very entertaining and has many surprises. It's set in a small town where a number of families live in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere. This family consists of a widowed woman, her two sons, and her daughter-in-law. The father is a small time lawyer who has recently retired to a cabin in a different part of the forest. This is a classic noir story. A young woman goes missing, her husband goes on the hunt for her, the sheriff and his deputies have the case, and of course the murderer is at large. I thought this was one of the best noir movies I've seen, and that's saying a lot. The cast is outstanding. This movie has it all. It has some of the greatest actors to play the parts of characters. The actors played these roles so well that I couldn't help but admire them. The best part about this movie is the ending. The end is not quite as good as the rest of the movie, but it's still a good ending. It doesn't make the ending more suspenseful, but at the same time it doesn't have to be. This ending is the perfect ending to the film. There's no reason to ruin the ending by ruining it. This isn't the best ending I've ever seen, but if you like noir you should at least see this movie. The only thing I don't like about this ending is that it isn't a twist. The ending was pretty much expected. It also is one of those endings where the characters are dead in the beginning of the film and then we see them again in the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main problem with this film is that it's so short. There are so many good characters in this movie, and there are so much of them that it can be hard to keep track of them all. But, the acting is really good. I enjoyed the interactions between all the characters, and I also enjoyed the characters' personalities. There is a lot of humor and some very dark and violent scenes in this film. The violence is a little graphic, but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a little over the top and a little funny at times, but the film does a lot right and it's a great way to start a film series.

The cast is good and the story is engaging and well-crafted. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So there I was at a bar at the airport. I had a few drinks and got to talking to this woman, who I think was a nurse. She was nice, I liked her a lot. She had a lot of money. So we talked a bit. Then she asked me if I wanted to come over to her place, which was in the hotel. I thought that was a bit much. She said she was going to cook something for us. I said "Sure," but I really didn't want to go over there. I wanted my own place. Then it hit me. I'm an American, I'm a free man, I don't want a free meal. So I said OK, and we left the bar. After we left she went to the front desk and said, "I'm really sorry, I can't do that. This is my own room." The woman looked at me and said "No, that's a friend's room. He has his own." I said, oh, really? That's great, thank you. Then I realized that there was a huge difference between what I was supposed to be doing, getting a free room, and what I really wanted to do, getting away from all of this. I wasn't even sure if I was free. So the woman got a phone call, and I had to tell her that I didn't like that. I didn the hotel room and went home. So what was I supposed to do? I just didn't feel like being at the hotel anymore. It didn't make sense. So then I went back to the hotel, this time with a new plan. I just walked in, and the room was really big. It was a good place to stay, but I still didn't have a place to go. So now I was in a room that wasn't really my own. So what was the point? Then one day I went into a movie theater and there was this man, a friend of mine from high school, I was a senior then, and he was really cool and he said "Hey, man, do you know where you are?" I said I didn 't. He said "Well, we just went to get a free movie, and it didn't work out, but we were in the parking lot, and you were right next to me, and this is the only movie that's open, so you're gonna go see

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a straightforward murder mystery set in an American city, but the story is a bit more complicated than that. In the beginning of the movie, there is a murder that has already been solved, so all the detectives are trying to figure out who the murderer is. However, it is only later that the murderer gets discovered, but even then, the police still have not solved the case. The police believe that the killer is a black man, but as it turns out, the killer has dark skin, is wearing a white shirt, and has brown eyes. As the movie progresses, the mystery of the killer gets more and more complicated, and the film becomes a real psychological thriller.   There are several characters in this movie that I liked: Detective Thomas Hart, who is trying to find the murderer; and his wife, who tries to help him; and the wife's sister, who wants to see her husband again. The film also features a lot of black and white photographs, some that are very interesting, and others that are a little bit confusing. Some of the photographs are very beautiful, while others are very disturbing. The movie is a real mystery, and it is a very interesting movie.

With his son, a young woman named Maria (Scarlett Johansson) and a couple of his old pals, he set off on a journey across the country in search of a new place to call home. Along the way, they'll meet old friends, new foes, and maybe even learn a little something about themselves." - The A.V. Club "This is a great movie. I am a huge fan of Chris Evans' Captain America, and it's hard to imagine him doing any better. It's not a movie you need to be able to see the whole way through in one sitting. It is a fast-paced, fun action-packed movie. There's some great fight sequences, and the movie takes a nice, dark turn towards the end." - Indie Wire "A super hero film with a great mix of action, humor and heart, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a must see. The cast does a fantastic job. You feel for them and root for them." - Cinemablend "If you like superhero films with strong, emotional storylines, you'll want to check out Captain America 2." - Ain't It Cool News "The action sequences in Captain America were great and this is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date." - Entertainment Weekly
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing that comes to mind when watching the movie is a line from " The Exorcist " which is "I will come back to haunt you. And the only way I know how to do that is to go out to dinner with the devil."  This is the same concept as a group of college students are being chased by the demon known as Mephistopheles (played by Edward Furlong) who is using them to try and tempt a famous actor (Richard Farnsworth) to perform in a play about the Devil.  Furlong plays the Devil and the actor is a brilliant young man played by Walter Huston who was to be the star of the play. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just saw this movie and I can't believe that it has been made by someone who doesn't even understand what a great villain Darth Vader is.  He's so evil and he's so scary and he looks so much like a bad guy from the 80's.    I really liked this movie because it wasn't a parody of any movie or anything like that.  It was more like a dark and serious drama that had a good story and it was a good villain.  And the special effects were good too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a few of the movies by this director, most notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", which is a very interesting film, in a genre where they have to have a female lead. This time, it's an old, white, retired guy in his sixties who is getting very old and lonely. His life is very simple: he has a very nice house, a nice car, and a very sweet wife who does not mind his little eccentricities, but she also doesn't want him to get too old, and she has to go to a nursing home. This movie is really funny. You know that old man in his clothes that is so comical he could be an actor. He's not funny, but he is still very sweet. It's an easy movie to understand, and even though the characters are not funny or well written, they are all quite interesting. I don't think it's really worth watching it again, but it is a good old movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I know this review is kind of late but it really is one of the better horror movies I've seen in a long time. I love the idea of a house with ghosts that come and go but I really love the story of the house itself and how they build it. _________________________________ The house is built by a man who has a daughter that lives with her grandmother. The mother of the girl, the wife of the man who built the house is getting old and doesn't really want her daughter to marry. So she decides to sell the house so that she can live with her own family.    I really liked this movie and really enjoyed the performances from all the actors.  I can see this being one of those movies you watch and then never look at it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about this movie? This movie has a very interesting story and is a good horror movie. The movie has an interesting plot, and the story is very dark and intense. The cinematography is very good and well done, and is done very well. The special effects are excellent and are done well. It has a good soundtrack and is very scary. The main character is a very good guy and the horror part of the movie is not as scary as you would think it would be. The story is pretty good, but it would have been better if they didn't make the ending so confusing and bad. Overall, a very cool movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a huge fan of all the films in the classic trilogy of Star Wars.  Even the ones that are considered lesser.  The first film was a huge hit and it had some great special effects.  I love the first film and it has been an iconic movie ever since.  This film does not have any of the special effects that were in the first movie but that's fine.  It does have some great moments like the battle between Han Solo and Boba Fett and the fight between Han and Vader.  There are also some good characters like Lando Calrissian and Jabba the Hutt.   The film is also well made.       The second film is a bit of a let down.  In my opinion, this is the weakest of the three.  George Lucas had to step away from the universe that he created and create a new universe.  But instead of doing so, he made some of the most boring films ever.  Yes, it's a new film but it doesn't have any surprises or new characters.  For a film that takes place in the year 40 ABY, there is a lot of space between the characters. I liked the first two films more than the second one.  They are both very good films but it's clear that they are not what made Star Wars so great.  After The Phantom Menace I didn't know what to expect from the third movie and I didn a lot.  So why did I think it was a good film?  It has a lot to do with the characters that are introduced.  You see, there are many characters in the story that have their own problems and in some cases, their own issues.  These characters are so unique that it's hard to figure out who is who.  When we meet Luke, Han, and Leia in the third film, they are introduced to us and we are introduced them to each other.  Leia is the most interesting character and we see the first signs of her strong will.  She is the strongest character and has a great reason for why she is doing what she is.  Han is a more of a classic character.  He is a smuggler.  His past with Han and Luke is one of the main plot lines of the film.  We are also introduced to Lando who is a bounty hunter and we learn more about the Empire.  Jabba is an interesting character

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it was very important to make a good sequel. The plot was simple: two detectives investigate the death of a man who died in a strange way and was said to be a "perfect" man. They find out that the man died from an unknown illness and that his body is floating in a pond. The investigation reveals that the water is laced with a poison which was not discovered until after his death. This poison causes the victims to go into a sleep which lasts for up to 30 days. The police force is not able to find a way to stop this mysterious illness.   (I think that is a little silly, but it is a good story.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun little movie. The main character, a young boy named "John" (played by the excellent Ben Johnson), is a bit of a misfit and a bit odd, but the movie does a great job of portraying this with a bit more humor than most kid's movies.   A bit of the humor comes from John's obsession with his new girlfriend, who turns out to be a doll (which is not a problem, since the doll is a very cute and well-acted character, but it is still kind of strange).   The film is pretty short, and it is certainly not a kid's movie, but if you're a little kid and want a good story and an interesting idea, this movie is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard of this film before, but never actually watched it. It was recently mentioned to me and I thought it was a good watch. The cast is mostly good, and the actors are all really good. I just found it funny how every time a character would get drunk he would always say, "I'm not drunk" like a drunk would say. There are a couple of other lines in there that made me laugh, like when they all try to do the same thing (like a rock star), but they're all different and I don't really think it's a comedy. It does have some funny scenes and some good acting, but not too many, which makes it a decent movie, especially for someone who is a big fan of the original.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie. It had some good things about it but was still lacking a little.

If you like a good adventure movie, I'd give this a shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the film as a whole, although the movie has its flaws. The film's main plot is pretty typical. A woman (Anna Paquin) finds out she has a genetic disorder that leaves her unable to get pregnant. The doctor who discovered the disease decides to test Anna's fertility, which in this case is a success. She gets married and then she decides to have a child of her own. This plot is fairly typical and I don't see anything to criticize. The characterizations are very good and very different from one another. Anna Paquin is the most sympathetic and sympathetic character in the film, but the other characters are much more complex. This movie is not so much a love story as a story about how one woman, a woman with no children and no husband, who is unable to give birth, who becomes pregnant. She is also the first woman in the movie to go to the doctor and seek a diagnosis. The medical staff at the clinic who treat Anna and her husband (James Caan) is also a bit more complex and sympathetic. However, it is the relationship between Anna and James that is the main focus of the film. The relationship is not really explored or developed. It is clear that Anna and the doctor have a very strong bond, but we don't get to know them well. It seems that the doctors do not want Anna to have children because of her condition, but Anna doesn't know the exact reasons why they don't want her to have kids. The relationships between the doctors and the patient and the nurses are also not explored much. I thought that there was a bit of a romance between Anna Paquette and James Caan, but it didn't really get explored as much as I thought it would have. I think the movie does a great job of conveying a very personal story about a woman who is not able to have the child she wants. I just don't think it is as good as the rest of the movies on the list.  (5.5/10)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie because of the reviews that it is not about the film itself, but about how the movie's title translates to.   What I didn't like about the movie was that it was too long.  It was about 2 hours long and it was not interesting.  I think the story is about the "disco-doo-dah" that you hear at the beginning of the movie.  The film is about a guy who gets into trouble and ends up in a dance club.  What happened is that the guy ends up being kidnapped by a guy named "Disco-Doo-Dah" who was a famous disco dancer.  And the guy is a little nervous because of this because he doesn't know if he can dance like that.  Then this guy ends of asking the girl to dance with him.  So, the guy does this and then the girl gets the girl in trouble because she doesn't like it.  This movie is all about dancing and this is the main theme.  But, the movie also has some serious stuff going on.  For example, the girl is trying to get out of a bad situation by saying "it's a bad day."  Also, there is a drug dealer and a girl who is trying too be with this guy.  These are just some of the things that happen in this movie. So, I think this movie is a good watch.  However, I would like to see a more serious version of the story.  I just realized that I forgot to add a star for the movie   Overall, I like this movie

This is the first hint that there is something going on between these two, which is why the movie keeps on making you question what is going on. The woman in this scene is really pretty and there is not much to say about her. The man is not too attractive, he looks like a loser but still it is obvious that he wants to be with this woman and he is not willing to stop. We also find out that the woman is a little crazy and that she is addicted to drugs. We then find out the reason why this woman has come to the town and that is because she is pregnant. We see the father of this woman who looks like the other guy from the start of the movie, but he is a lot more handsome. He even says something like "oh yeah, I bet you like it in the middle" when he sees the woman and she responds with "I guess I do" which makes him feel a little sad. But we then find that this man is a drunk and that the mother is pregnant too. This leads to the scene that we see later in the movie. This man is going to a wedding and he tries to talk to the woman, but she does not want to talk. So the man goes home and then he hears that the baby is already born. The baby is actually a boy, but it is still a baby and the mother doesn't want the man to touch it. So we see this man, and the woman get into a car, but the car has a flat tire.

I like to see her fight with men, she has a very good body.  Jennifer is a very funny woman and the only bad thing about this movie is that it takes place in the wrong place.  The story was not that good, but the sex was great.  It is a shame that they didn't use more sex scenes, especially since the movie is based on a novel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a film about a poor girl, who lives in a poor part of town. Her mother is a widow, and her father died young and left her a poor child. She is always playing the victim, and never really grows up. Her only friends are her pet pig, a rat, and a dog, that's how she gets by. But one day, a new neighbor moves in next door, who is the biggest bully in town. She starts out by making fun of her, but she's so cute, and nice, she's always willing to help her. One day she comes to her room to tell her to come outside and get some fresh air. They don't get far, the neighbor comes in and asks her what she's doing there. She explains that her mother has died, and she has nothing left to live for. Her father had a big fortune, but he was a drunk, and died when she was young. She's now the only one left, and as she's going to go to college, she needs to find some job to help pay for the tuition. She ends up with a job at a circus, but as soon as she gets there, she finds out the owner has already gone home for the night. She asks him if he knows anyone who would take over, and he says yes, his wife. The girl tells him that she would love to help, but that she has to leave her pig for a few days, and then she'll take over. He says that he'll pay her a small fee for her help. She tells him to send her pig, and tell her when he gets back to pick it up, and to call him when he's back, so she can tell him to tell his wife she's sorry she didn't give him more money. The pig comes back with a new name, Dolly. The owner decides to take her over, so that she can get a little money from the circus. But she gets the wrong idea, and decides to go back to work. As she's walking back to her job, she meets a beautiful stranger, who tells her that she's not ugly, and that she looks like a princess. She agrees to have dinner with him that night. As the two are getting ready to go out, she tells him what her real name is, and asks him for a new one. He takes the old one, and gives her a new and more beautiful name.

They were both good.  My wife and my brother loved it too.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good western.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts out with a bang, a large, impressive bang that makes a lot of people say, "Hmmm, that is a movie that would make a good introduction to the world of computer games." It is a classic, a true classic. It is not a movie made for children. It takes the computer games we have all grown to love, the ones that are all the rage today, and turns them into a very serious, serious drama. It has a serious message that is hard to resist. I can only hope it will make people think about computer games more than just being a way to amuse themselves.  There is a bit of a message about the way that computers work. That computers are not a toy that anyone can play with. That they can actually affect people's lives.  There are three main characters in the film. They are Dr. Edward Goldblatt, a mathematician who is very well-known for his work on the theory of number theory. His wife, Lucy (played by Marita Miller), is a mathematical genius. She has a special gift. She can see the future. It was the ability to see the world coming to an end that inspired her husband to take a job as a physicist in order to make sure that no one would destroy the Earth. Her gift makes her a dangerous opponent for Dr. Goldblat, but she is also a friend. Her name is the computer. Dr. Ed and Lucy's son, Gary (played with great comic timing by Billy Zane), is also very well known in the science community for his skills as a scientist. He has also taken a job in a lab to work with Dr. Lucy. He is the most obvious computer in the movie, since he is the only one who can do anything. But it is Gary who is the central character. He lives in a world that is computer-generated, a world where the laws of physics do not apply. The characters in this film, and the audience as well, are in awe of what is going on around them.   The movie is not very long, but it is filled with action scenes.  There are some good scenes, some not-so-good scenes. There are a lot scenes in this movie where you are just staring at a computer screen and wondering what is happening. You just want to stop watching the movie. I guess that is what makes the movie work.  The first time I saw this

This is the second movie I've ever seen by John Frankenheimer, and I have to say, I'm impressed.  I like his work so far, but the script is a little too long and convoluted for my tastes, and he has not yet shown he can handle the acting duties with any accuracy.    The movie has no dialogue.

They are called "Gold-Diggers" and they live in a little shack, on the outskirts of town. They try to get money by doing things that no normal boy could do. They take the rich guy's gold and they keep it safe, but they lose it. They all feel very guilty about it. It is not a good film and is a bit silly, but there is something about it that makes it very funny. I loved it and it was very enjoyable. I'm sure it will be remembered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie in a theater in Toronto when it was first released in the early 80s. This is the only movie I've seen where the whole movie was actually filmed with the same actors and in the same order.   In the movie, a group of kids get their hands on a very rare coin and are so thrilled that they keep it on their person, they don't even give it back to the kids.  Unfortunately, the coin is not worth much and the whole gang ends up having to borrow money from an older man to pay for their ticket and get home.  The movie is not about the coin, it's about the kids getting together to keep the coin. The movie has great songs and the kids are just a blast to watch.  I really loved this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie when I was in my late teens and my mom used to watch this movie with me. We were sitting on the couch in our living room watching this movie while eating popcorn.    The movie was about a boy who was the son of a wealthy man who was in prison for the murder of his wife.  He escaped and was on the run for a while.  After some time, he found a ship that would take him to a far off planet and help him find his father.  Then it ended.  This was the last film I watched on my dad's video tape.  Posted by Mark P. at 1:01 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title is pretty self-explanatory, and while it does indeed follow the usual formula of a cop, a detective, and a private eye on the run, it is far more interesting than I had anticipated. The first half is fairly standard cop/detective fare, with some nice action set pieces and a decent supporting cast. The second half takes place in an alternate universe, where the cop is a high-ranking general who is also a high ranking member of the secret society known as the "Ladies". The detective is the man who runs the criminal section at the police station, and is tasked with getting the real murderer, who has been killing the men he has been assigned to protect, for what appears to be a good cause. The rest of the movie is a little more unique, as it follows the lives of the characters, as well as a very convoluted murder mystery. The movie is filled with plenty of great performances, including a lot of well-known actors like Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, and John Goodman. There is plenty of tension in the movie, and there is enough violence to make it interesting, though there are some moments that are rather ridiculous. I found the plot very convoluted, and the ending was a little unsatisfying. While it is a good action film, the mystery aspect and the plot are pretty much the only things that keep this movie from being a complete failure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The final scene of this film is very emotional.  It's one of the more emotional scenes I have seen in a long time.  The music, the acting, the direction, and even the special effects.    It is a great ending to a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A pretty good movie. I've seen a few different versions of the story, and I like it the most.  It has a nice story, but it doesn't really go into the deeper themes of the film.  I like the style of the movie, but there are a few flaws, especially with the dialogue.  The soundtrack is good, but the film is not really a great example of a film in the genre.  It's not the worst movie out there, but I don't think it's the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Escape" is a great film. It is a movie about a family that is caught up in a terrorist attack on their own country and the family members have to hide in a barn while the terrorists are outside and the country is on fire. It has great performances, the characters are funny, the plot is easy to follow and there is enough action to keep it interesting. If you want to see a good action movie then this is the movie for you. The Great Escape is one of the best action films of all time and a must see for any movie lover.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie about an ex-cop who is the only person who believes in a young woman who was murdered by her ex-husband, who was acquitted for killing her.  She was murdered after he hit her with a car, and she was a mother of 3 children, so she was not that dumb.  He was acquitted because of a blood clot.  The woman he killed, was a young girl, and there were 3 other witnesses who said the same thing.  I am glad the movie was made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an action-packed movie that has a few slow parts and some slow acting but overall a good action-movie with a lot of action.   The story is not too deep or complicated but it's not the weak side of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to try to be as objective as possible when reviewing a movie. There are many reasons why this movie is so good.   This movie takes place in a futuristic world where most of the population is either vegetarians or vegans. This means that the people are not consuming a meat product.  There is a reason for this.  One of the main characters is a female android who has been created to have a human form, however she is only an android.  This means she cannot feel emotions, and cannot have emotions.  To add insult to injury, she does not know how to speak human language.  Because of her inability to have emotions, she can't even show them to anyone.  However, she is not a victim. She is very smart.  In a future world, the only animal product is meat. However, the food is so bad, that people don't even want to eat it.  They just want to die.  The people in this world have been in this condition for years.  Unfortunately, there is only one hope for the people of this world.  It is a woman who is a cyborg.  She is called "Dianna", and she is a revolutionary who is fighting for the animals.  So far, so good!  In this movie, you get to see a great deal of the female characters. They are strong, they are strong-willed, and they are good.   There are so many different people in the movie.  Some are vegetarians, some are not. Some have been living this lifestyle for years, others haven't had the chance.  And each of these characters has a very different point of view.  Most of the people that I have talked about are female, and most of them have been around for a long time.  I also love how the movie uses a lot of old-timey music.  These are all great points to consider.  Now, for the bad points.  Yes, the cyborg is weak. Yes, there are some moments where she gets a little too emotional.  But this is a pretty big flaw.  Besides, most of these weaknesses are fixed in later sequels.  Another flaw is that the cybergraphy and human characters are a little bit similar.  All of these points are easily fixed.  Also, in a lot the scenes, you see the female android have to be very close
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of times, in film noir, it is hard to tell who is telling the story. Often, it's a man in a suit (Burt Lancaster) and a woman in a black dress (Shelley Winters). It's hard to figure out who is making the movie. I was not able to make out who was in charge but the woman, who is the protagonist, is a good actress. I like this kind of movie. It's a bit heavy on the crime but then again, it does have a good plot. I guess it's hard for a detective to get away from the case. There is a very good ending to the story which is very unexpected. I don't think this movie was very well known at the time and is now very well know.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie about 4 times and the more times I saw it, the more I liked it. It's about a kid who's dad was a police officer and he always wore a red suit with a blue tie. One day the father tells his son that the mayor of a small town is coming to town. The son, a kid named Jack, tells his mom that the guy in the red suit is the mayor, and the mayor is looking for a new police chief, so Jack's mom tells Jack to get a good job. Jack then goes to the mayor's house and asks him if he's the new police Chief. The mayor says yes, and Jack takes the job. But when the mayor goes to pick Jack up at the station, the kid stops him. He says that he's going to beat the mayor in a footrace, and that he'll be there in 30 minutes. The kid then walks away, and in the movie, Jack is still trying to figure out what happened. The next day, the new Chief arrives, and he's a guy in a white suit. The new Chief gives Jack a job, but he doesn't like it. He tells Jack that he should be the police chief. Jack says he's not good enough to be a police chief! And he gets pissed off at the Mayor, and throws a bottle of water at him. The Mayor says "How dare you!" and he punches Jack in the face! Jack is sent to jail. The movie ends with a kid yelling at the cops. The police don't seem to like Jack very much. And I've always wondered what happened to the new mayor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie. It was filmed on location and is very well-made. The script is well-written and very well acted. The music is also excellent. The characters are interesting and have very little dialogue. The only thing that isn't so great is the movie's ending. It doesn't make much sense.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a lot of fun with this movie. It was a lot different from the typical movie you see. It's about a guy named Matt who lives in a little shack and has a dog named Scruffy. Scruff, I don't know, Scruff's a little strange but he's cute and Matt loves him so he keeps him with him. Then one day the neighbors have a big fire and a bunch of animals get burned and Matt has to make the decision to save them. It is a really fun movie with great jokes and lots of great scenes. If you are into this kind of movie, you won't be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found myself laughing quite a bit at this film. The movie starts out with the title and the narrator asking a question that is all the movie really needs to get started. I will say this is a very good comedy. There are a lot of jokes in this movie that are a little too broad. There is a great scene in this film where the three characters meet and there is one girl with the same hair style as the girls from the movie "Moulin Rouge".  She has a cute voice and the movie is pretty funny. Another funny scene involves a couple who are trying to have sex. The couple has a "funny" gag with a car and a cat.  There are several more good funny scenes in this one and I was pretty entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most impressive thing about this film is the cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie, and it is a good example of what to expect when you are watching a film made by an American director. It has a lot of action scenes and is very exciting, but it is also very silly and amusing at times. It also has a good cast that I liked, with Sam Rockwell as the protagonist, and John Cusack as his assistant, and Michael Rapaport as his partner. I would recommend this film to all who like good action and are interested in seeing a good story told with good performances. It is not for everyone though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never seen this movie before and I like it. It's very different than a lot of horror movies, which usually just make you scared, but this one makes you laugh a lot. It has a great plot, a great cast, and a great soundtrack. The story is told in first person, and there's a lot to like. I think it's really funny. The only downside is the ending. The movie just doesn't end well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a very enjoyable one. It has a great story and it is very funny.   The movie is about a kid that is a "good" student in a bad school.  The kids who hate him, try to kill him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film. The story is very well told and I loved the way the actors were portrayed. It was good fun to watch. It did get a little repetitive at the end but it was very fun to see all of the characters. I give this film a B+.   I'm sorry to report that I don't think the film is as good as the reviewers said it was. I liked the movie but it didn't do much for me. It is not a good story and the actors didn't seem to have enough to do. They did all have a few things going on but not enough to make up for it. They were all really good and had a good time but it wasn't enough to overcome the fact that the film was repetitive and didn't have enough action to make it worthwhile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a nice little movie. It had a good plot, but was also kind of predictable. The characters all have interesting personalities, and the writing was good. The ending was a bit confusing, but I guess that's what happens when a story starts out with a big reveal. Overall, this was a good, little movie that I'd recommend to people who like good, old fashioned stories. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski (1998) is an odd little movie, and it's a great movie, in the classic "Waltzing Matilda" mold. I love the way they all interact. The characters are funny, but there's a reason why they're all friends, it's because they all like each other. The film is a comedy about a group of friends who get together to have a fun weekend. There's the guy with the big head (I believe that's him), the girl who is very intelligent, and the guy who wants to be famous. This film is about what happens when two friends meet for the first time. I like the way that they do it. The guys are all very similar, but they have a certain chemistry that's unique to their personalities.  It's like a combination of The Karate Kid and Monty Python.    I enjoyed this movie so much. It's very silly, but it's funny and very entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last night I watched "Jenny and Her Sisters" for the first time. I was not expecting much, as I have heard a few things about it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think the movie is pretty funny. I found it funny that Jenny was the youngest of three sisters. The older one is quite a hoot. The youngest one was also funny, but not as much as her sister. Jenny does seem a bit of a bad influence on the younger one. She is quite annoying, but her sister is good. I also think that the way she plays the part of Jenny, the "witch" is very convincing. I did think the first one was a little more exciting, and I was pleased with the second one, but the third one was very good. Jenny is a pretty good actress, and the other two sisters are all very good as well. I hope this is only a small part of a longer movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Last Boy Scout"   (aka: "The Boy Scouts")   is a true story about two boys from different backgrounds who meet on a mountain-top in the summer of 1930. A year later, the two will be sent to the same place to be a part of the Boy Scouts of America. This film was one of the first films of the era to deal with the Boy Scout movement.      The film focuses on the Boy Scouting movement as it starts to change in response to the Depression. The film tells the story of one boy, Tommy (George Nader), and his family, who live in the countryside. Tommy and his friend Billy (Samuel Dickerson) are sent to a city to begin their training in the Boyscouts.  The Boy Scouts have been around since 1890 and was founded by a group of volunteers who went through the Boy scout trials at age twelve and then went on to complete the requirements to become a full member. The Boy Scout training process is a long and arduous one. They learn the basic skills of physical training, first aid and camp life. They are taught to be trustworthy and trustworthy.   The Boy scouts have to work together to accomplish their goals. The most important is to be true to themselves and to their faith.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Friends is a film that really should have gotten an Oscar nomination.  It is a great movie about a small town in the US that is filled with a bunch of odd characters.  The Best Of Friends is an oddity about a bunch (or five) of eccentric individuals who spend a lot of time together.   The story revolves around the friendship between   A small town, where everyone knows everyone, is a beautiful place, with the sun shining and birds chirping in the breeze.  In this quaint town,     a group of oddballs gather together to have fun.  They get together for anything from a bowling party to a party at a country club.  Their friendship is so close that one of them is an alcoholic.  It seems that this person is always late, but is always able to bring them to the party.  This oddball is a loner who is a little strange, and is very quiet.  He doesn't even own a car, and relies on his bike for transportation.  The best friend is the girl next door.  She is always there to help, and has the house to herself.  Her best friend, is also her brother.  After a few years, their friendship starts to grow.  A few years later,  It becomes more serious, as one of the oddballs,  has a crush on the girl.  Eventually, they become good friends.  But they have a secret.  These two oddballs will do anything to get to the top.  There are a lot more weird things happening in this movie,    but this short film is just an entertaining short.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie takes place in the early 1900s where a young boy and his parents live with a mother who is sick and a father who is an ex-soldier and was in the army during the Russian Civil War.  While the boy is in the hospital his mother visits him every morning and evening and the father tells him about his time in the war and the terrible things that happened to the boys soldiers.  The movie is an interesting look at the times and the lives of the people who were in the military during the civil war.   The story is well told and it tells you how a father and son deal with their mothers sickness and how they get on in life.  This is a very good movie that can be enjoyed by all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a shame that so many people don't know the name John Carpenter. In the late 1970s, he released the film adaptation of the science fiction novel, The Thing from Another World. It was a huge hit, and made a lot of money. It won four Academy Awards, and even got a special nod from Roger Ebert. It is one of the most terrifying films ever made, and a great example of how to do a good horror movie.   In The Thing, the town of Innsmouth is terrorized by a shape-shifting alien creature known as the Thing, a humanoid with a face that is permanently in a constant state of change. When a young woman goes missing in the town, a strange, supernatural entity is brought to Innsm out of nowhere. It takes the form of a large, hulking creature with a human head and body. It then slowly begins to consume the town and begins to mutate the townsfolk into horrifying monsters, in order to further it's own agenda.   the Thing has a history with the local sheriff, played by Tom Skerritt, who is a bit of a softy when it comes to the Thing. His wife, a local cop played by Joanne Sommers, is also an easy mark for the Thing as it slowly begins slowly to devour her as well. As the Thing begins to eat the town it begins to take on a life of it's it's very own, it's mind begins to change and mutate, and it's face is continually changing. It's voice is completely alien to the human race, and one of my favorite scenes is the creature that is created as a result of the Thing's actions. It looks like a huge head on a body, but is actually an entire tentacled body with tentacles.  -I loved the alien creature- It was totally alien to what we are used to seeing. This alien creature really does look like something from another world-It has eyes on its head, it has no mouth, it looks human, but with a completely different appearance. The way it moves and looks was also very eerie and unsettling. It would make you think that you are in a nightmare, but at the same time it is terrifying. It really did bring a whole new level of creepy to the film.  .  It was a fantastic film that took many risks, and had some truly great scares. The Thing was a great movie,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had me hooked from the very first minute. I can't remember the last time I was so excited to watch a movie. The action was fast paced and had great effects. I had to pinch myself to keep up. The special effects were done by a team of real life special effects artists who did an excellent job. It's not every day you see a movie that has such a special effects effect and looks like it was filmed on a small set. The character of Ben (David Strathairn) was so real and I couldn't believe that he could pull that off. The chemistry between the characters is very good. I liked that this movie took a few different paths before coming to a conclusion. It gave us a different take on Ben and the other characters in the film. The acting was good but not as good as it should have been.  This is a movie I will never forget!  I'm looking forward to seeing this one again in the theater.    Ben is a good guy with a bad habit of doing things that are very foolish.

I loved "Star Wars: A New Hope," and I loved the "Star Treks" in the 80's and 90's.  And "StarTrek" has always been one of my favorite science fiction movies.  The characters were fun, the plots were well-written and the special effects were outstanding.  This is a great film, if you like "Startrek."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an excellent comedy. The director, Sam Mendes, knows exactly what he is doing. The script is funny and the actors are great. There is no pretense to be serious. It's just a bunch of good guys goofing around and getting into some fun.  A lot of the action scenes are ridiculous. But that is what makes it funny.  You can find more of Sam Mendis at his official website or follow him on Twitter.  I really liked this movie. The acting is excellent.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing"  is an example of a movie that is a good horror movie but it is also a good science fiction movie. The movie is about a scientist who has the ability to survive in outer space by using a device to convert food into hydrogen. He finds himself on a planet where he is in the midst of a war between the natives who worship a god (the aliens are also part of a race of humans that worship the god). The scientist wants to make a weapon to kill the aliens and destroy the planet. Unfortunately, the scientists experiments have created a monster, a creature that has evolved into a life form and that is stronger than anything the scientists can build and kill. The creature is not really a monster but more a force of nature that is capable of killing the scientists with no effort at all. The monster uses the technology the scientists have created to its advantage. This movie is a classic example of an alien film that can be enjoyable even to adults. It is not a good sci-fi movie and it is not an alien movie. It's a movie about a monster that comes from outer space and destroys the planet it comes from. It has a great cast that is very good and this is an excellent movie to watch when you need a good monster movie.

Things like being chased by a bear (the bears in this movie are just regular bears with the addition of human faces and a funny voice) and a man dressed in a gorilla suit. The boys get a little too "out there" for the town and eventually the uncle gets involved. The movie doesn't get very good at all, but there is a lot of fun in it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is set in an English country house in the mid 1800's, where the housekeeper (I am not sure if she is the housemaid or a maid) has her eye on a handsome young man named "John".  John is a bit of a charmer, a bit eccentric, but not a very good guy at all.  He is a loner, a loon, and in general a complete bad egg.   A poor loner who is not going to get far in life, especially in the world of men.  This is where I think I got off to an excellent start.  I loved this guy.  His love of adventure, his dislike of men and women, his love of nature, his passion for books and books about books, his fascination with history and antiquities.  He has a passion for writing.  So when he finds a manuscript written by a certain Dr. John Dee he thinks he has found the next great genius, but it turns out to be a hoax and a fraud.  It seems the young John has been brought up to believe he is a "scientist".  This does not go down very well with the house maid who is a good friend of the house keeper, Mrs. Pritchard.  Mrs. Poole and John get into a very violent fight and the house is thrown into a state of confusion.  Then, out of nowhere, a young woman dressed as a man, a very attractive young man with a "snow white" complexion, with a strong build, with the same kind of face, and the same type of voice as John Dee, enters the scene and makes John a true believer.  The film was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, with Bogdanovitch being one of the first film directors to use a Steadicam in his work.  My only gripe with this movie is the title of the film.  In some ways I found it to be an "Ace of Spades".   I thought that the title was a bit overdone.  There are some good and some bad moments in this movie, but I think the film overall was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to admit, I didn't expect a sequel to the last movie, but I am glad that it is still going on. I really liked the movie and I loved the characters and I liked that they all had good dialogue. I don't know why it's taking so long to get this movie done, but it's definitely worth it. The movie is funny and I thought it was very well done. I think it was great that they did a lot of research in this movie. I also really liked that the actors were all from the olden days and I like that there were still people like them today. I'm glad I watched this movie and it was a fun watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a chance to see this film a couple weeks ago, and the first half is a pretty good movie with a decent amount of humor. There's a bit of a bad guy, and his name is "Dr. Echols". He's not a bad character, he's a bad scientist. He has a big ego, he wants to be a star in the movies and is willing to do anything to do that. He's a sadistic bastard who loves the thrill of cruelty and killing, he also loves the pain.  The second half of the movie is where it gets really interesting. It's basically a psychological horror movie about Echol. He murders people, then is able to convince himself that he's not really responsible for it. This is where he starts to get a bit psychotic, and this movie gets progressively more interesting and more disturbing.  This is what Echoline looks like.  I have to say, I found the acting to be pretty good, although I think a lot of it is a little overdone, especially the parts where he's telling himself he doesn't really know he's doing it, and that he doesn's know he killed people.    I really enjoyed this movie, and I was a little bit disappointed by the ending, but then I was really surprised by how good the first part was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie.  It's not an outstanding movie.  The story is kind of silly, but it's a good silly movie. The music is okay, and the film has a good mix of laughs and tears.  This movie is really about a kid who wants to go to a school that will give him a real chance.   It's also about a girl who loves a bad guy, but doesn't know why.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a very strange movie. It's about a scientist who goes back in time and tries to cure a bunch of time travelers of cancer. His goal is to find out how to stop time from advancing and also to find a way to reverse the aging process. So he uses his special equipment to send the time travelers back to the time when they were alive to find some way to fix their health.   I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was different from the other movies I've seen. I liked the story and the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a movie about two brothers who are separated. They were playing around the pool when the other boy was injured and they left to go home. The next morning, the brothers were at the park playing football when the boys are playing tag and both boys are hurt. They both say that they want to play football but can't because they are separated by the fence. They decide to get a game going and they go off to get their balls. One of the boys gets his ball and the other brother gets his. One ball is hit and it bounces into a field. The other boy comes running over and finds the ball. He goes to get it and it is too far away to get. The boy that was injured is still in the field but the brother who got the ball gets off and runs over to get his ball. They run back to the field where they see the other boys playing football. The first one to the ball is running at full speed and the second one is a lot slower. They get a ball and run it to the other side of the field. They play a game of catch and the first one catches the ball and runs back to get the ball back. It takes both of them a long time to get to the end of the other field. Then they see a train coming at them. They see the conductor in the rear window of the train. He is talking to someone and the boys realize that they are in trouble. The conductor stops the train and the brothers are given the opportunity to go to school or they will be arrested. They agree to go and get the football that was thrown away. They make it to school and it seems that everything is fine. The football is thrown and it lands in the teacher's office. The teacher has it and decides to give it to his little boy who is the fastest in school. The second kid in the class is the slowest and is asked if he wants to play with the ball that was just thrown. He doesn't get it so he just sits down and plays with his crayons. The slowest kid in class is upset about being left out and he takes a crayon and puts it in his mouth and tries to swallow it. He does and then swallows it. The coach asks him if he swallowed it. His brother says no. The Coach asks him what he is doing and he says, "I'm trying to play catch." Then the coach gets angry and tells him to get

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only problem with this movie is that the director had a hard time finding a good story to tell.  It starts out fine, but the story doesn't seem to be developed all that well.   As a result, the plot tends to go in circles a few times.  In addition, there are a few weak points to the story, such as a character who has a lot of the same personality traits as a stereotypical American teen.  It's not like he's an anti-hero, either, but it's hard to care about him when there are so many other interesting characters.  The only other thing I'd point out is that one of the main characters is very strong-willed.  Unfortunately, this is the only thing she seems to be good at.  I think I'm supposed to be impressed by her determination, but honestly, I don't think it's necessary for the story to develop around her.  Overall, I liked this movie a lot.  This is a great, if short, movie about two young people.  There are plenty of things that made me laugh, even though I didn't laugh very often.  This is a short movie about how the only way to survive the harshness of life is to find strength in others.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a few bad jokes that are hard to ignore. But the movie is good enough to stand on its own two feet. The first half is mostly a fight scene, with a few funny moments sprinkled in. There's a great fight scene at the end where a giant monster is fighting a bunch of soldiers, with the main character (the movie's main villain) using a huge rock and a bunch small soldiers to bash the monster down, but the big monster is too strong. After a while the monster's giant head breaks through the roof of the building and the soldiers scatter, and we find out that they've been hiding in the building all along. Then the monster smashes the soldiers into a bunch more soldiers, and it's a good fight scene until the giant head finally smashes down onto the soldiers, causing a massive explosion. A nice little scene, and I really liked the character of the hero, who was a little strange, but I liked that he had a bad case of amnesia. It made me want to see how he would recover and what would happen to him. The movie ends with a nice, touching ending that I'm sure would be very satisfying to anyone who enjoys horror movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the best example of how to be funny and not to be a pain in the ass. There's an excellent amount of action in this movie, and some of the action is so good it's funny. There is one scene in the movie where the lead character is a little kid and he gets in a car and there is a car chase. There are no cars, it's a little scene in a movie and it's amazing how well this movie can make a car ride into a chase. I found the chase scenes really good. The movie had a nice amount of humor as well. I also found this movie funny because there is lots of fighting, and lots of fun fighting, but also lots of pain and suffering. The ending is great as well, as is the movie. It's a good comedy with some good action, and a nice ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting much from this movie. I mean this is a movie from 1984 about a group of people who are on a bus that goes around the world, one of which is the president of the United States. I don't know about the premise, but it didn't make a lot of sense to me. I was expecting some comedy and maybe some science fiction, but I never got the feeling that I was watching a movie that was made by people who actually knew anything about movies.   It was a fun movie, and I found it to be a good action movie, but a movie about space is not really a good science fiction movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last movie we have seen in the series is the final entry in the trilogy. And I don't know why it is that I feel this one is a bit weaker. I don�t mean it in a bad way; it just feels a little less satisfying than the others. We know the plot. The story of the first movie was so good that I couldn�t wait for the next one. The movie had such an epic scope that it felt like a whole new universe had been created. It was a whole lot more interesting than the previous one.   This movie follows the same basic plot: A couple, having lost their child, decide to return to their old home in order to bring him back. And they also find out that their daughter has been kidnapped by a gang of thugs, and is now on her way to join the gang herself. I thought this movie was quite a good adventure story, but I felt it had a few problems. I think the first thing is that the plot is a little too long. It could have been shorter, but then I wouldn�t have gotten all of the twists and turns. The second thing I didn�t like was the way the movie was structured. We start in the past, and it seems that the movie is supposed to be about the family coming back home. However, the movie quickly jumps to the present day. This is a problem because there are times when we have no idea what�s going on, and the movie becomes confusing. And it didn�te seem to make much sense to me. The third problem I had was that there were a lot of twists and turnings. I didn't like this at all. I guess I could be wrong, but to me the twists seemed to be forced and unnecessary. I know this is a very subjective thing, but it seems like some of the scenes were made to confuse the audience, so that they can figure out what is going on at the end. But I felt the movie should have ended at the beginning of the second movie.  The first part of the movie follows a couple trying to come to grips with the loss of their child. The family eventually decides to return home, but they have to fight off some thugs who want to steal their child back.  After the first part, the next movie begins and we find out who the mother and daughter are. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the movie so much. I loved the script and the direction. I even loved the fact that there is a woman in the movie. I am sure she is the best thing about this movie. There are a lot of good scenes and I even liked the fact there is some nudity in the film. It was all good in this movie but it was too much. If there was one thing I would like to see changed it would be that the man in the red jumpsuit was too big for the red dress. I also think there should have been a lot more scenes where there was a lot happening. I was glad that there was more action in this film but it really felt a little slow. I don't know if it is the time that it was made or the actors but it seemed a little short. There was some good stuff in this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's one of the more interesting and well-paced movies I've seen this year. The story is good, the acting is good (it was a nice surprise to see that many of the main cast had made films before), the acting and writing are good, and it has a decent ending. It's a good idea for a movie, with the usual high school setting, and some fun action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie with a great cast, and the best ending of any movie I've ever seen.  There is one scene in the movie that was so intense I cried.    I am not kidding.  The scene was of a man in a car accident, and his wife, with a friend, helping him get out of the car.  Then the friend takes out a gun and shoots the man in the chest.  This is the first time I've seen a movie with such an intense and realistic death scene, and I was very impressed.  There are no explosions, no explosions.  When a guy is shot in the head in a movie, there is no music.  No one is laughing.  Instead, there are only people in a very somber mood.  A car accident is just that, a car crash.  It's just another way to say it.  People die in car crashes all the time.  Sometimes it's good.  But, it's always bad.  And, this movie is no exception.  I didn't want to cry, but I did.  At least I can tell you now it was real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are no special effects or even a big splash of color in this one.  It is an old-fashioned detective story, which is not bad.    I found it rather funny that the detectives in this story do not have names.  This is how I like my detective stories.  There are no aliens, no magic, no special powers, no supernatural.  What is interesting is how the detective is forced to solve a murder that is so obvious it could not have happened.  I also liked how the detectives would get up and walk around and examine their surroundings.  It is a detective story that is about solving the case.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "One thing I've always wondered about is, why didn't they make a more 'human' character? Why didn't the director make a character like, say, a lawyer or a doctor, or a fireman, or an actor like a Jack Nicholson or some other kind of a Hollywood star. Why didn.t they make them all? Why don't they give us one of those 'normal' characters who gets killed by the bad guys, but not as a result of any malice on their part, but just as a tragic accident? This movie was a huge disappointment. I'd rather have seen the old movie of the same name with James Coburn as the hero. I'm just glad they finally made a movie about a human being." - Michael J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the entire movie is taken up with the "bad guy" trying to kill the hero.  This movie, which was directed by Peter Yates, has some pretty good scenes.    The villain's henchmen try to kidnap a young girl, but the hero, with a couple of guns and some quick thinking, manages to get away and gets the girl to safety.  Then, he gets the bad guy to talk to the girl.  This is one of those scenes where you can see how great Peter Yates was when he was young, because the hero is almost the opposite of him.  The hero is so cocky that he thinks that he can beat the bad guys easily.  But, when the villain comes in, he takes over the hero's body, and he's the one who does most of the killing.  Now, I know a lot of people say that this is not the best movie they have ever seen, and they're probably right.  It is, however, a good enough movie, and I'm glad that Peter Yates got to direct it.  If you haven't seen it, you should check it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most realistic and interesting story of all time.   It is about a real, human, and completely believable man who has gone through all kinds of ordeals. From an abusive childhood, to the most terrifying, intense and brutal wars in the history of mankind. He has seen so many deaths, seen so much suffering, he has seen the end of the world and then the beginning of the next. He is a survivor, a man who is not afraid to look at the future and face the consequences of his decisions.  The movie was made in 1960 and was a big hit. This was the first true science fiction movie made by Stanley Kubrick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A short movie that follows the adventures of two cops who investigate the case of a missing girl. While there they are given the opportunity to get some information on the missing girl's father. They meet the father who has a new found respect for his son and tells them about his life. The movie is a very good example of how to tell a story without getting into the mundane. There is plenty of humor in this movie, and the acting is really good. I'd like to see this movie more often, especially if you have a chance to see it with a good popcorn.   P.S. I don't like the word "police" in this title, and I don�t know why, but it seems like it should be a typo.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ The first three hours are the best in this movie and it is so good because of the way the characters and the plot develops and because of how the director keeps the story moving. I like how the film starts with the girls talking about the way they are going to have sex with the boys. There are some good scenes here and there. One of the best scenes in this film is when the guys take the girls into the bathroom and the girls try to find out how to get them to go down on them. It is good. The other two sex scenes are really good. There is a really good scene where the girls are in the locker room talking about what they will do to the boys once they are done. I guess it is good to see a movie where the women are in control. I have seen a lot of good movies and I have never seen one that has the kind of sex scenes that this has. _____________ _______________ The story is really good here and I like the way that the story is going. I don't know what is happening to the characters here but it is very good. It has a good feel to it. There have been a lot better movies that I have watched but this is a good one. ____________________________ ___________ _____________________________ I don�t know if it is really a good idea to be involved with a group of young girls but then again I don' t think they are all bad. I really don� t like how it is going to be like when the boys find out about their intentions. I think that the movie could have been better if the girls were a little more interesting. They have a lot more to say about what is going on than the boys and I think the director could have done a better job of showing it to us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great example of the genre. The story is the same as most of the other "demented" movies: people who are mentally ill are given the cure for their illness and go on to kill others and commit suicide. The problem is that they are given this cure and are not allowed to take it. This is because of a "medical society" (the medical society is a good thing in this movie) that wants to control society by controlling the population with the cure. In the beginning of the movie there is a scene where a doctor is talking about the cure to "dampen the minds" of people. I can't say it's a great idea. The only person who is really affected by this is Dr. Mengele. I was thinking about this movie when I read the following passage in a book by a doctor who was in the concentration camp at Dachau during World War II: "Dr. Menges, in the days of the concentration camps, was the most important person in Auschwitz. He was a kind of god to those who had not seen him before. The sick and those dying were brought to his office and examined by him. The SS doctor, whose name I cannot remember, was known as "Mengele," and it was a question of which camp he should be sent to first. The patients came to him from all the camps. Some of them were young and fit. Others were old and emaciated. Most of them, however, were in bad shape. They were afraid to go to the camp doctors, because they feared the doctors would do them a favor by putting them into the gas chamber. Dr. Müge's office was a large room with several chairs arranged around a central table. He sat in a chair near the window with a glass of beer in front of him. I noticed that he had no glasses or a napkin on his head. There was a book lying open on the table beside him. On it was the list of the sick. I also saw a book containing the names of those who were to be sent directly to the gas chambers, but this was not on the list.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was not good. It wasn't bad either. But it's a movie about a movie and that's all it is. You'll have fun and then you'll go "Wait a minute! This is a TV show?" It's a show that makes people laugh and makes them think and I have no problem with that. I do have a problem with a movie that made me cry. It made me feel so bad for these characters. I mean what was with this "good guys" and "bad guys"? It seemed like everyone was an asshole. And I mean EVERYONE! There were times when I thought, "Oh well, I guess it's over then".   But it's not over! I'm looking forward to the next episode.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is the best of the bunch.  It's a very good movie.    The film opens with a young boy watching a movie. The film is based on the life of a real life adventurer.  His name is John Muir and his life and adventures are told through the stories of his friends and companions.  He is known for his bravery and tenacity in the face of adversity.  The movie follows the lives of the four companions who were with Muir when he died.  When Muir is in the wilderness, he is attacked by a wolf.  While he is fighting the wolf he sees a woman who looks exactly like Muir.  This woman is named Alice.  She is the daughter of a wealthy landowner and is so close to Muir that they are inseparable.  They marry and have a daughter who is as close to the real Muir as he was to the girl who looked just like him.  When the two are on the road to visit the girl's father they are attacked by wolves.  After Muir saves the girl from the wolves she is kidnapped by the same wolves. The movie ends with a series of adventures and death and a reunion with the woman who looked exactly like him who is now Alice.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only "bad" movie I saw this year is the film about the "murderers" who killed a bunch of kids in a park, but even that is good.   A bunch of guys get together for a buncha days to play video games and to "play" the bad guy, and there is something funny about it, like the movie gets a little too long at times, but the movie is still entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film.  It's a little slow at times and has some minor problems, but I found it entertaining.  As far as the film is concerned, the story is interesting and a little creepy, but not scary.   The film is about a group of people who go out of their way to steal something that has a lot of value.  In addition to the money, the person who owns the property has some sort of supernatural power.  This is not the usual "he-can-control-the-world-with-his-mind-and-his-"spells-and-"magic"  It seems as though these people are not really from this world, or maybe it's another world.  I found that the film was a little too long at times.  The plot is a little weak.    It would be nice if there was more development in the story.  There are some people that don't like the film.   It is a bit slow at the start.  But by the end of the film, the film really begins to pick up and it's fun!  I like this film and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title is a play on words. A lot of times, it seems that we need a metaphor to describe a situation. I don't know if this was intended or not, but this movie really had it's share of metaphors. It's a good example of how it should be done. The movie is a simple action thriller with a couple of good twists that have to be seen to be believed. There are some good fights, there are some great explosions and there are a few action sequences that have me looking forward to the next film. It really did not need to be any better. It did not take much for me to get into the movie.   This is one of those movies where the whole family comes together for a good time. The cast is a good one. I'm a sucker for good acting and I have always enjoyed seeing some of the best in the business. It is a family movie with a good plot that makes for an entertaining movie. The ending is the best part of the movie and I cannot wait to see the next one.   The story is told from the point of view of a couple that have been married for years and it's a simple premise that has the potential to be great. It all starts off with a kidnapping and the two are taken to a cave. Inside the cave, they find a box with a key. Inside this box is a ring that was given to the husband in his final hours of life. The wife tries to get the ring and is able to open it only to find that it is a fake. A little while later, the husband is found dead with a knife in his chest. The two discover that the man that they have been looking for was killed by a fellow prisoner. He tells them that he has been locked up for killing another prisoner. This man tells them a tale about how he had been in a bar fight and he had his hand cut off. After that, he had found a ring in the trunk of a car. He then decides to go to the ring in hopes of getting his hand back. The first time he tries to open the box, it doesn't work. After he finds the key, he tries again and this time it does. As he opens the box a monster comes out and chases the wife and the husband into the woods.  ,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you didn't know it, The Terminator is about a human who is born to a human family, and eventually becomes the protector of the family. He does this by defeating the robots that try to kill the family and eventually being able to kill them.   This is the most important part of the movie. He goes back to the original human family. It's amazing how the Terminator is able to do this. It takes him awhile but eventually he gets them all to safety.  The only part that is a bit frustrating is the fact that there is a lot of plot holes in this movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but it doesn't help that the plot doesn't make sense at all. I mean, it's only three years after the original and he's been able to get a new body. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai is a fine example of samurai film, and one of the more accessible of the genre.  It is an interesting combination of the realistic samurai tropes and the modern day samurai-noir.   The story begins in feudal Japan in the year 1613, where a Japanese nobleman (Sachiyo Noguchi) is taken prisoner by a Mongolian general (Jôzô) and imprisoned on a remote island.  He is tortured by the general's men and forced to kill a young boy.  At this point the film begins to devolve into the standard melodramatic melodrama that is a staple of the film genre, but as it goes on it is slowly revealed that Noguchô is being held prisoner by the Mongolian.  The plot takes a turn when the Japanese general is captured by the Mongols, and the plot thickens when it turns out that Nogguchi's former lover is his real mother.  This is a rather dull plot, but at least it is entertaining.  In the end, Nogouchi and the Monglis are forced to work together to rescue Nogachi's mother and avenge her death.  What's interesting about this film is the way in which it mixes real world history with Japanese feudal culture.  I was rather surprised at how well it did, because the film is clearly influenced by the Tokugawa shogunate era.  But it is interesting to see how the two worlds mix and how the film tries to represent these two worlds with such accuracy.  While the film has a strong and interesting plot, it doesn't have a strong or interesting character development.  It has an interesting villain, a compelling love story, and interesting battles, but nothing much else.  There are some good fight scenes, but the film really falls flat in the romance department.  This is especially odd because of the fact that the film features a romance between the two main characters, but it never gets going.  For me, the only reason this film was worth watching was because of its interesting story, but there were no compelling reasons to watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first movie I saw about the Holocaust. I have been to Germany and Poland. The German Jews were murdered. They were gassed. I can't believe the Jews were ever allowed to live. I watched this movie on my lunch break. The Nazis did not do a very good job. The Germans were the most brutal of the war. They killed every Jew they could get their hands on. If they could have just had their way with all the Jews.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those "I'm not sure if I've ever seen this before" movies that are really good but don't really give me anything new to say.  It's not really hard to imagine a lot of the people in this movie were already dead at this point.     The movie has a great deal of humor, and I was entertained by the story, but I really wish it would have gone further.    The story is fairly simple:   The story of "The House with the Wrong Number" is a strange one, and that is to say that it is not a typical movie about a murder.    It is a mystery thriller about a woman who takes her children to the country to live in a "small town" in a little house with a big red telephone pole on the back.        This is a movie that is about a small town and a big telephone pole.  The whole movie is set in this little house, which is a sort of "noir" kind of place.  It is quiet and dark and the only thing that keeps the residents of the house from becoming quite depressed is the telephone pole in the back yard.  If you have never seen the movie "It's a Wonderful Life", you will understand why this movie has this special place in the hearts of so many people.  This movie is based on a true story, and it is a good one.  I was not sure about the movie at first, but after I watched it I found it to be a good little film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Manchurian Candidate" is a great movie.  It has great acting, good direction, and good story-telling.  A few of my favorite scenes:   "The First Man is a Soldier"  The film begins with a man (played by George C. Scott) who's having trouble adjusting to life in the 1950s.  After being kidnapped by two Russians, he is interrogated by a CIA agent (played here by Michael G. Wilson).  After a long and uncomfortable interrogation, the agent has given the man a choice.  The man is to choose one of two ways to end the suffering of his life.  One way to end his life is to take the cure for his wife (played in this movie by Grace Kelly) that he is given by the CIA.  This would mean death, but his life would continue on.   The other option for him is to go back to his wife and the two of them would live happily ever after.  Once the man is forced to choose between the two choices, he chooses the latter.  Unfortunately for him, the other agent (Tom Skerritt) had chosen the second way and was waiting for the man to make his choice. The man was then killed and his wife was kidnapped.

This one takes place in a small town where the ghost of a young woman is haunting the local school. The only person who is able to help is a young man named Nicky. Nicky is a rather ordinary kid, except he is a bit eccentric and likes to talk about the occult. One day, when Nicky and his friends are out shooting the ghost, they see the young girl in the woods. When Nicky runs to save her, she is gone. Now, Nicky has to find out what really happened to the girl.

The story of the film is about a little girl who is getting older. She lives in the country where she lives with her mother and older brother. She is always in trouble and has to stay in a little house with her brother to help her out.    One day her brother and father come to visit and she lets them see the house she lives in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good film, that is more or less about a young man (Drew Barrymore) who wants to go to New York City and meet the famous and glamorous actress Rita Hayworth (Valerie Bertinelli). The film is about the difficulties in getting his ticket and about the adventures he has with a couple of friends. He also meets Rita Hayward, the famous "Hollywood Madam", in the film.  The only real problem with this film is that the movie has a bad story and the script is very bad.  It is really not very good.  A little film with a lot of potential. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Citizen Kane is a masterclass in acting and filmmaking. The most important scene is not the opening, but the ending.  It is the most impressive scene in the history of the cinema.    The best.  The other three films are all good.  They all show the same kind of movie.  But they all have their own distinct flavor.  The ending of The Third Man is my favorite, even though it is a bit boring.  If you like the classic style of films, you'll enjoy this.  And if you like more realistic and less fantastical films, then you'll like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a fun action movie that is pretty much a rip off of the classic "The Wild Wild West". The film features a number of different characters, some of which are interesting, and some are not. In fact, some characters are so completely one-note that it is difficult to care about them. The one-liners are not only one-dimensional but also repetitive and annoying. One thing that is annoying about this film is the constant use of the word "coward" to describe anyone who dares to stand up to the corrupt cops and the corrupt sheriff. Another thing that annoyed me about this movie is the lack of direction, especially during the opening. It doesn't really give any direction, and it also doesn't seem to know how to use its action sequences.   Overall, the movie is a pretty good action movie, but it is not very interesting, especially since there are a lot of characters who do not seem to have any depth to them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film in the summer of 2005 at the beautiful, historic, and beautifully restored movie theater at the corner of Washington and Washington. I was a bit surprised when I saw the film for the first time. The movie looks really good. The camera work is beautiful and the acting is good. Some parts were just a little bit too fast paced and some parts seemed like they could have been cut a little more to speed things up. But I think it was just the editing that caused this. The whole film is a nice, peaceful, and beautiful movie to watch. I don't have much to say about this film other than that I was impressed by it and the cast really did a good job with the roles they were given. I really don't see much that I didn't like about this movie. It is a very nice film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of this movie is the end.  You know how in a bad movie you are thinking "what was I watching for" and in this case you have to say "this was worth it."  I hope this movie has a sequel and I hope that it doesn't get made by the same people who made this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is the third time I have seen this movie. It has been very well made and has been well received by the audience. I think that the people who do not like this movie might like the first one more. It's not a bad movie at all. The story is not as good, but I don't think that is a good reason to turn it off. The plot is very good. It starts out with a little boy who goes to his mother's house to talk to her. When he comes back he finds out that her daughter is a prostitute. So he goes out to get the daughter and her husband to help him get the girl. He gets them all into his car. As they drive off a truck comes up on them. The wife gets out and tries to shoot him, but he manages to get away. He runs across the highway to get help. He does get help, and he gets the girl to safety. The guy he saved is a very nice guy who tells him all about his wife and daughter. This is a nice story and a nice ending. The only thing that bothers me is the ending. It is not very good, and the movie ends on a bad note.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie quite amusing. It's a funny movie that you can watch all the way through without even knowing the plot or what's going on. I think that this is the most serious movie that I have seen. There is a lot of serious stuff going on in the movie. The main character is trying to get his son out of the drug business. This is a kid who is going to be a good lawyer. I have to admit that this movie was quite funny. The ending is just perfect. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good comedy movie. It has a lot going on and I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the only film that I've seen in a long time that made me cry with sadness. It was a beautiful film about a young girl and her mother. There was a moment where she was being taken to the house, where the mother was watching over her and her daughter. There she finds the father and son of her husband. This was the first time I have ever seen a woman in tears, in a film. This mother has a huge crush on her daughter, and she is very concerned for her. This girl is very sensitive and very shy. When the girl asks her mother to come to the country, the mother says she cannot, but if she could, she would. Her mother is very old and has not got a lot of friends. The girl is a bit of a tomboy, and doesn't know how to behave around people. She thinks that she can get close to the old lady, but then realizes that the old woman is not like her mother at all. This is not a great story. It's a very sad film and it shows that there are people out there that have problems in their lives, even though they might seem to be happy. The main point is that this girl does get close with the old people. They do not like the girl at all, and the only person they will tolerate her being around is the father. This film is very sad, and shows how difficult life can be, even for a very beautiful young woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a very good one, the action is intense and exciting and it is a great movie.  As I was watching it, I was thinking, "This is really great".  It is like a good old "Taken" with all the action and good dialogue.  The movie takes place on a deserted island.   The main character (John Travolta) is the son of a wealthy businessman.  He has been brought up on a strict set of rules.  There are strict rules about what he can and can not do.  The film is set on the island in the winter time.  On the day the movie takes off, John Travolto is out and he is seen talking to a woman.  This woman, Linda (Karen Allen) is a member of the island's women's club.  She is very pretty and smart and is not a bad person.  John T. is talking to her about some important matter and then he is shot down and killed by a storm.  Linda is the only survivor.  When she comes to, she finds that she has been turned into a zombie.  And that is just the beginning of her troubles.  While she is turned into the zombie, she also starts to have strange dreams and is constantly being stalked by a man.  Written by: David B.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â A lot of people are aware that there's a movie called Â The Devil Inside, a film that was based on a novel by the late Richard Matheson. Â It has an unusual plot:  It tells the story of a woman who is in a mental institution and is haunted by a demon that keeps trying to get out of her and make her kill her family.  She's very disturbed, especially in the scene where she's talking to a doctor who is also trying to kill her, but she's not allowed to kill anyone and the doctor is really scared of her.  There's a lot of talk about the occult in this movie, but in my opinion it's mostly used for comedic effect.    The best part of the movie is when it talks about the demonic forces, how they are connected to a race of human beings who live in a very strange place.  They look like demons but are very much like human beings.  Then we get to the "demonic forces" of a small town in a country far away where the "demons" live in the woods, and there's lots of talk in the movie about how they have a very sophisticated society where only the most powerful people live in it.  When the demon gets out of the woman's head, he walks across the street to a house where he eats a whole cow, which causes the family to get killed.  There's a long sequence where a priest tells us about the devil, how he has to eat humans for sustenance and how they need to feed him.  The priest also tells us that the devil is the creator of the world and that he has been around since time immemorial.  As you can see, I haven't mentioned much about the story.  However, there's one thing that stands out in the film.  It is the song that is played when the demon walks across a street.  In this movie there are several songs.  But when the devil walks across an intersection and sings "I've got to eat a cow," the whole town gets scared and starts to panic.  This is the only song that has an effect on me.  And I'm not saying that there isn't a lot more.  I have to admit that I was expecting more from the movie than what it delivered.  You see, a lot can be said about a film about the Devil, but the film is a bit lacking
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie takes place in a rural area of the United States.  The area is called the 'Little America' and is not far from the big city of Washington, D.C.  We meet a family of three kids and a mom who is a small town doctor.  A young girl named Toni who is the youngest and lives in the house with her mother.  She is a very loving and happy child.  Her older brother, Michael, who is 17, is an athlete and plays football, basketball and hockey.  He is a good student and goes to a good school.  But he is also a bit of a troublemaker.  In the end of the movie, we see a football game between a small college and a big city team.  This football game is so exciting, that it makes you wish you could play in it yourself.  And if you could, it would be a great game.  I was very happy that I was able to go and watch the movie with a big group of friends.  It was really fun to watch!  I liked it because it was a very nice family movie and I thought it had a very good script.  Toni was a really good child and I liked her very much.  One of the best parts of the whole movie was the ending!   It was great to see a big family get together and have a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie on TV a few years ago, and it's still one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen.  The premise is simple:  One night, a woman (played by Rosalind Russell) goes to a bar to see her new boyfriend (played in the movie by William Shatner).  After she has ordered a drink, he asks her if she would like to go to the bedroom and fuck him.  The idea of that might be a little off-putting for some, but that's what I like about this movie.   In a scene from the movie, one of these women, the one in charge of the place (played here by Shirley MacLaine)  is in the bedroom talking to her husband, and he has a little surprise waiting for her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have not seen this movie yet, it is very worth it. It is one of the better films in the genre. The movie takes place in an alternate universe where the world is run by an alien race called the Vipers. The Vipers are an alien species who have the power to transform any body in the universe into a snake-like creature. They do this by using a special fluid that they get from one of their many planets. They use this fluid to turn other creatures into snakes. They then use these creatures as slaves to do their bidding. The aliens in this movie are all different than the ones we are familiar with. This movie takes us to an alternate world where the alien races have been completely changed. The creatures are all more reptilian than human and have different hair styles. They also have different powers, which are all pretty cool. It also takes place on a planet that has been taken over by the Viper's and has become a giant snake. The film has a pretty good plot that keeps the action exciting. The alien races that the Vids are controlling are all very different and all have interesting powers. I especially like the one that has the ability to turn a person into a cobra. Another alien race is also quite different. It has a giant spider that attacks people with webbing, which is a nice touch. The special effects in this film are all really good. I really liked the way the aliens moved. It made me feel like I was actually watching an alien invasion movie. There is also a pretty cool and creepy scene in this one where the Vip are getting ready to eat the entire planet, which was pretty cool to watch. This is a very fun movie to watch, and it has a good story that keeps things interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a father who gets a divorce and lives with his ex-wife (played by a great Rachel McAdams). She's a sweet and lovely person, but she's a bit of a pushover. She has no business being a mother of four, let alone a mom of four who is so old that she can't drive. She is the type of woman that you would expect to see in a children's picture book, but there are only four of them, all boys, and none of them are old enough to be in her care. So she is living with them in her home and, to her great frustration, no one comes to visit. She becomes obsessed with the boys and is constantly talking about them and showing them around.   This is a good story and the way it's told is very entertaining. It has a lot of humor and it's funny when a woman gets all excited about the boys but then decides that she'd rather have them in a museum and doesn't bother with them until the end. And when the boys are brought home, the movie seems to say, "Okay, now you're really in trouble." This movie is very well-acted by all of the actors, but especially McAdams and McAdams's daughter, Rachel. The movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but once the action gets going it's a lot better than the slow and sometimes boring movie it tries to be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just got my copy of this movie a few days ago. The trailer was really promising. It looked like a well put together action movie, with a decent cast and good performances by everyone. I'm not much of a horror fan, but this was an enjoyable horror movie. The movie was a bit slow at first, but the story gets going very nicely after that.   The acting in this movie was quite good. There were several characters that were played by a variety of actors.  One thing I was worried about was the pacing.  This movie seemed to be dragging a little.  The story is very much in the first person point of view, and the first half of the movie is a little slow.  There were a few scenes where I felt like the movie had jumped a few times.  I liked the ending.  It's a nice little ending to a good story.  As a whole, the movie was enjoyable.

I have to say that the story was interesting and the acting was excellent. I think that the film was not well made but I am not sure that it is a bad film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie. It is very simple, it is just a simple story with no over-the-top, flashy action or explosions. It's just a good story, and I was glad to see that it was a short film (1:10), as I thought it was too short. This is a very good short film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ A beautiful and darkly romantic story about two young lovers, who become lost on a lonely stretch of highway, where they are forced to make a deal: if one of them will take the other's place, the other must die. The movie is about their escape from each other, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sure many of you have seen this movie before. It's a fairly popular sci-fi series that has been around since the early 1970s. There have been two major sequels: a television series that ran for seven seasons and a movie that opened in 1982 and lasted for ten. It is about a man who returns to Earth and meets the son of his dead wife. He is told by the man's son that there is a conspiracy to keep his father's legacy alive, and the world is going to be destroyed. He sets out to investigate the conspiracy, and it leads him into a plot to destroy all life on Earth. The film is based on the series of books by James S.A. Corey, and is very faithful to the source material. There are some problems with the screenplay. There is a bit of a cheesy feeling to it. But it is still a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Fifty Shades of Grey" is one of the most popular and successful movies ever made.  The sex scenes are so good that I could see the film being in the Top Ten all time list.  It has great characters, a good story and a great ending.   I will definitely be watching this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple and straight forward. The story is told in a non-linear manner with only the events that happen at the beginning and the end being told. The movie has no plot twists, it is a pure and simple action-thriller.   Director: Miharu Sakuragi A.S.C. Entertainment Inc.  A. S.C is a Japanese video production company known for their movies based on real events. The studio has worked on several movies based off of real events like " The Curse of the Golden Flower " (1999) and " The Tale of the Princess Kaguya " (2003).   I found this movie to be a good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good.  I am not sure what to think of the story.  I guess it is about a man who wants to be a real doctor.

In the end she has a great effect on the young people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I am an Englishman who has come to America with my wife. We were staying at a hotel in the mountains. I have seen a movie about it before, but this time we went in a different direction. "The Old Man and the Gun" is an enjoyable watch. The plot is simple enough: an old man is found murdered in his house and the town folk want to solve the case. But the police are not convinced by the evidence and are not able to get the right guy. The film takes place in the 1920s, in the small American town of Mount Carroll. It has an authentic look to it, with the people and the buildings, and even the snow and snow-globe are reminiscent of the real thing. But it is the acting that is the main attraction. As usual, John Carradine (playing a detective) plays the part of a hard man with a great sense of humour, but his character is played well, not over-the-top, but rather subtle and well written. The rest of the cast also does a good job, as they all have their own character and their own style. It is also a very well made movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other night while driving to work I heard the same movie over and over again. I've been seeing it every year since its release. It's just so much fun to watch a movie about a family that's always having fun. They have a lot of fun together. They play tricks on each other. They love to make mischief.  They also love to sing and dance.  I wish I could've gotten a DVD copy.   This is a really good movie.  This isn't a movie you can watch for its laughs. It does have some laughs, but it isn't the kind of comedy that will keep you laughing.  It is, however, a movie that will make you smile.  The music is catchy, the humor is light and the dancing is good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about a young man who wants to get out of a bad neighborhood and start a new life.   He finds a house in the wrong part of town that's been turned into a boarding house, and ends up living there.  A few of the local gangsters show up, but it's not long before he's out and running.  The movie doesn't have much plot, but I was entertained.  It was hard to find a good DVD copy, so I used a video tape instead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a good old-fashioned ghost story, you should like this one.   It's a fun little movie that's not afraid to tackle some serious issues.  It makes you think about the problems of modern society and what people are doing to each other.  The film is based on a book of the same name by E. E. Cummings, and it tells the story of a young girl named Lizzie.  Lizzy's father was a successful surgeon, but he died before he could retire.  He left Lizz to live with her mother, who was very kind to Lizz.  This made Lizz very lonely, and she wanted to leave home.  In a way, this is like a modern version of the classic fairy tale "The Frog Prince."   The movie takes place in the 1930's, when people were living under a lot of stress, especially the workers.  When the economy goes bad, there is a great depression, and people begin to riot.  One of the most interesting parts of the movie is the story about Lizz and her mother.  They are very poor, but they love each other very much.  But this isn't the story that's really interesting about the movie.  Instead, it's about a group of people that wants to get rich.  And they do.  As the movie progresses, you see a lot more about the group and how it works, and the problems it creates for the town.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't really get too good.  There are a few good scenes in the movie, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the problems that the movie creates.  I think this is a good little movie for kids to watch.  If your kids are into fairy tales, then this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie, it has a nice story, the characters are likeable and it's got a nice plot.   The story is actually quite good, it takes a bit of time to get to know the characters but once they do, they get a bit better.  It's a bit slow, it's not very good, but I'm not really sure why.  There's nothing much I can say about it, but it's still a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way of All Flesh" is a very entertaining, suspenseful film.  The story is a simple one, but the tension and suspense builds nicely to an explosive finale.    The acting is very good throughout, and is a major reason to watch this film. The way it is told makes it seem as if it were a documentary, and the story is told through the eyes of the children.

If you love classic science fiction and fantasy, this is a must see."

Tom starts talking to them and they start listening to him and then one of the kids says, 'I know that guy! That's the man that brought down the bomber!' And so, that's when the bomb's supposed to have been found. Tom is a good cop and a good friend to all the kids in the film. There are some good jokes in this movie."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't expect to like this movie.  When I saw the trailers, I didn't like the idea of the movie. I liked the idea, but not the execution.  The movie opens with a large group of people (and a dog) being chased around the town.  They find a cabin and go inside.  In the cabin, the owner has died, and a man is trying to take the cabin back from the people who took it.    One of the characters is a "man of few words" and tries to make conversation.  His wife comes to talk to him, but doesn't understand him.  It's clear that the movie is trying something very new and different.  The movie starts with a shot of a man being chased by a man in a hat, and then it cuts to a shot showing the man on the floor.  At this point, the camera moves in to show the man being hit by a truck and falling to the ground.  He is bleeding, and the man in the hat (or the man who is chasing him?) is screaming.  There is a close up of the man and his wife's face.  This is followed by another shot of the same man on a stretcher.  Next we see a shot where the man is in a hospital, and he has a huge scar on his head.  Now we see the guy in the chair next to the guy who fell off the horse, and his face is cut open.  We see the man sitting in the hospital and we hear the man's voice:  "I'm not good!"   We then see a close-up of the woman's face, and we see her screaming as the doctor says, "You are not good!  He then tells the woman that he doesn't know how to fix her face.   The woman's mother says she wants her to die and is talking to her.   We see her getting her face fixed and we are told she will look beautiful again.   In the last scene, we see them in the house, and they are back together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and I have to say that I was quite impressed. The movie is actually pretty well written, but the acting is pretty bad. There are a lot of scenes where the actors look like they are drunk and the dialogue is pretty lame. The director has the talent to make this movie entertaining, but I think the actors just didn't want to play the game. It is definitely worth a watch, but you should know what you are getting yourself into before you start it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't say much about this one. It's pretty straightforward and doesn't require any special skills. There's a lot of comedy in this one, but it's not a lot. There are some decent laughs in this movie, but there aren't any that are especially funny. I'm sure the movie is good and I'm glad I watched it, but I can imagine that it's nothing special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a great time with this movie. It has a great story, good acting, and good music.  And, I have to say, the film doesn't have the "sexiest" title, but I'd say that's because the title implies the main character (in this case, a guy named Don) is a sex god.  A good movie, not the sexiest title, not a sex goddess:   I had some problems with this film.   I liked the main guy, he's good at sex.  I really liked the girls, and I liked what I saw, but there were some things that bothered me.  There was a lot of nudity (and a lot that wasn't) in the film. Some of it was in a bad way.  Also, the story was a little too simple, and the ending was too contrived. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good   First of all, let me just say how happy I am to be doing this series again after so many years.   This was one of my favorites when I was a kid, and now I'm getting to see it in the original format with a beautiful and compelling story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really funny.  You see this young kid, who is in the middle of a gang, that wants to be in the gang but he has a lot of problems, including a girl who hates him.    He tries to get her to come back to his gang.  But he doesn't have enough money for that, so he has to go and get money from the cops.  When he gets there, he sees a lot.  He sees a gang of police officers with their guns drawn.  It's obvious that they are going to be very aggressive towards the gang.   So they try to talk them down.  There's a scene with a man in a wheelchair who is being wheeled around, and the gang starts to take him away.  Then, there's a really nice shot of a little boy with a wheelchair.  The kid is trying to get his wheelchair to go with him. The gang is not happy about it.  This guy in the wheelchair tries to run away, but he is shot in the back.  And so the gang is just leaving the wheelchair on the ground.    This movie is funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this movie before and loved it. The movie is about a high school football player who gets involved in a car crash and then gets injured. After the accident, he is left in a coma. He wakes up, and his friend decides to go to his house to see if he is okay. As they get there, they find that the house is empty and that the car that was hit was a hit and run. As the two friends leave the scene, the man who hit them is seen standing outside the house, looking at his car. He is soon seen walking to the car and driving off. It was then revealed that the man was a killer who has been stalking the two guys, and they had come to his home to try and save him. The man had been trying to kill them for quite some time, but they managed to stop him. He then told them that his wife was leaving him and that he would be leaving too, and that they should leave and get married. They decide to leave and take his wife with them. They get back in the car, and as they start to head for the house he starts shooting at them. He shoots at the car twice, but misses. He starts shooting again, but gets hit again. They are then able to get away from the man and he leaves. The car he crashed was a newer model. The guy in the passenger seat got hit in the shoulder and has to be hospitalized.   So that is what the movie is really about, a high-school kid who has gotten into a car accident, and has had his life changed forever. As he recovers, his friend is seen leaving the hospital and heading home. The friend has a new girlfriend, and the two get together and begin to live a normal life. That is, until one night he goes to get a new car and a couple of hours later his new girlfriend disappears. As his friend investigates, he finds that the woman he is with has been murdered and that his girlfriend had a key to the house that she had left. As time goes on, he begins to realize that there are a lot of strange things happening around them, and soon they find themselves in a battle for the life of a young woman that was killed by a serial killer.         In the end, I liked the movie a lot, especially the ending. It is an interesting story about a teenager who finds himself in a horrible situation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie.  This was the first film that I have ever watched that I felt completely engaged in.  The story and the acting was just so good.  I loved the way it went from action to romance to humor and back.   I also loved how the characters grew.  It was great to see how they developed their relationships.  And the characters were all just so different from one another.  For instance, I loved how Jafar was a bad guy but he was also funny and a bit sad.  Then there was a guy who was really evil and a great villain.  Even the female characters were different from each other.  The only downside I found was that they did not take the time to develop the villains.  But they were really fun and it was fun to see them go through the ups and downs of life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a long movie. It's a very long movie, and there's a lot of material to cover. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I was nervous about seeing this one. The first half of the film is great, and the second half is not so great. There are several interesting aspects to the story. The story is a mix of a lot, but it is a little cliche. I don't remember the first part of the movie very well, but I do remember the final scene. This was very shocking and unsettling, and it was done very well. I thought that the ending was very clever and creative. The ending is very strange and unexpected. It was very surprising to me. I didn't like the movie a lot. I was a little annoyed with the character of the young girl, and with the fact that the movie did not really deal with the themes that the film was about. The acting is very good, and if you liked the movie, you'll like this one too. If you didn't, this is probably not your movie. This is not a very good movie, but there is a lot to like about it. The movie is really very long. I would recommend this to someone who likes to watch horror movies. If that's you, then you'll probably like this movie. I found this movie very long, and although I was watching this movie with the intent of watching it over and over, it really didn't make it through all that many times. I wish that the entire movie had been a little shorter. It had some good ideas, but the movie really dragged a bit at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man From U.N.C.L.E."  I was just thinking that about the first half of this movie when I heard it on television, and I've always been interested in a story about a spy in the U.S. government.  The plot is quite ingenious and the characters are all very well written.  It's a bit difficult to describe this film, but here goes:   There's a man (George Hamilton) who wants to find a missing child in his town.    When the boy's mother disappears, the man goes to the police to try to find the boy and the man's best friend, a spy (Robert Shaw).   The film is quite slow in its plot, and there are a couple of scenes that are really hard to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is the kind of movie where it's a good idea, bad idea, but it works."  A little over an hour in length and an hour and a half of action, this movie was the perfect combination of action and humor.  I can see why this is one of the best movies ever made, it's hard to find a better movie than this one.  If you're not a big fan of Action, this is a good place to start.   Another great movie from the 70's, with the same style as "Die Hard" and "Dangerous Liaisons"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is about a group of young men who go out to a bar for the night to celebrate their graduation from college and their wedding night. It is the night before the wedding and the three friends are looking for a place to get a little wild and have some fun. Unfortunately, they are not the only ones looking for the same thing as they find a bar full of people who seem to enjoy each others company but not in the way that they would like. The movie gets interesting as the friends get to know each other and find out who they really are. It has a good sense of humor and a good soundtrack and I recommend that anyone who has a group to go out on a date with go see this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way" is a story of two brothers, each with his own unique talents, who meet at a local dance club and become inseparable. The way between the two brothers is a treacherous and lonely road, where they find no peace until they are reunited and they discover that there is something special about each other.  There is something very different about this movie. It's a love story, but not a very good one. The movie doesn't take much time in exploring the characters. We get to know their back stories and motivations and it's nice to see that the movie has an end, but it's not the end we expected.  The way the characters are developed is rather dull, not to mention that there isn't any real romance between the brothers.  The way it all unfolds is pretty simple: The brothers are trying to help a group of orphans and when they encounter a group who are in need of a good doctor, they are offered the job by the leader of the group. This group are led by a man named "Mister" (John Hurt) and they need a doctor that is not only talented, but also someone who is not afraid to get their hands dirty. It's nice seeing that there are two main characters in this movie and they get along very well. We see that there aren't any awkward moments between them, but at the same time we see that they don't exactly have a close relationship either. The only thing we can see that is a little awkward between the characters is when one of them is trying to take a picture with the other one. This is a very short moment, but the film is trying so hard to show us that they are close that it doesn't really work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is based on the true story of a former Nazi doctor who was captured by the Americans and turned into a medical doctor in the 1950's. He is in a situation that he never expected when he meets his wife, who is a doctor too. She's also a Nazi, and they have a daughter who has a little sister with her. The movie does not show this in a bad way, and it's funny and sweet. I recommend this movie to people who like action, but don't like the Holocaust.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice short movie about a group of men who are trying to steal a rare jewel from a museum. The whole movie has a really nice feel to it. The story is interesting and well-done. The movie does a good job at setting the mood and making it feel like a "real" movie, not a "fantasy" one. There is a really fun soundtrack and some great acting in this movie. The plot is pretty simple, but it is a good one. The director does a great job of creating the mood, but the story just doesn't really take off. I guess it's just a small budget movie, so the special effects are not too impressive, but there is enough of them to make it look like a movie, and the acting is good enough to make the characters seem like real people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a classic that is still very relevant today, and I can't say enough good things about this film.   It was made in a period when movies were very different than they are today, but that was only because the films that came out at the time were not all that well known.  One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when the protagonist, a blind man who is in a wheelchair, is playing the piano and he is singing a song. The camera is panning around the scene, and a blind guy in a bathrobe and an earring walks out from the left and walks in front of the piano.  The camera pans to a close-up of the blind man's face and the camera zooms in on his lips.  When the blind guy sings "The blind man in the window", he sings with the correct pitch, but when he sings "I don't see a blind cat that is not me", his voice goes completely flat.  In the movie, the blind woman who is playing a piano also plays with a flat voice.  At the end of the movie when the blind girl and the blind boy are singing "The way we love", the blind musician is wearing a tuxedo and playing with a bow.  After the song, he sings the song again.  It is funny that the film has no soundtrack.  A very funny movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good, well-paced movie about the early days of the United States.   This movie does a good job of showing the early America that we know and love so well.  In addition to showing what life was like for those early pioneers, it shows the life of a pioneer family.  I liked how the movie showed the settlers in a more positive light than they would have been in later years.  The film also has a nice ending, which I found a bit sad.  This is a good film, and it was made in the early 20th century.  If you like historical films, you might enjoy this movie.

However, once I got on the flight, I realized that I needed to watch the movie a lot longer, because the movie was not only good, but really great. The story is really interesting, the acting was very good, the music was very nice, the action was awesome. I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't know anything about cars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of this film is set in the late 19th century and has a very Victorian setting. The protagonist is a gentleman called Mr. Smith, who is a famous collector of paintings. The owner of the gallery, the young and beautiful Madame DeMotte is in love with Mr.Smith, but Smith refuses to accept her. They have a fight, and Madame DeMarotte falls and is injured. The young boy who witnessed the fight, Henry Smith, is invited by Smith to watch his mother get better. The boy is quite a character. He is the most eccentric person ever, and has his own weird and wonderful hobbies. Henry is a very funny and entertaining boy. As the film goes on, Henry becomes quite popular, and the people of London come to love him. The film ends with the death of Madame DeMattey. Her death brings the whole society to a standstill. Henry has a chance to win her over with his talent and charm, but he has to make a very difficult choice. He decides to marry Madame De Mattey, but at the last moment she kills herself. Henry decides to move to the countryside and live as an outcast. The first half is quite good. The characters are quite good, and there is an occasional bit of comedy. I enjoyed this film quite a lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. It's a great little movie that tells a story of a woman that finds a way to live a better life. She doesn't do it by living in a nice house and making money. She lives in a small house with her son, she cooks, cleans, and she takes care of her family. There is a man (Ray Charles) that tries to help her and she eventually helps him too. It has a lot of humor and a little romance, and there are many scenes that make you laugh and cry. It is a short movie and it's not long enough to be boring, but it does have a little more story to it. It shows the life of a lady who is trying to improve her life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie a lot.  A little dark, a little slow, a lot of action, a whole lot of jokes.    It was good to see some older actors in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Catch Me If You Can" is a film about a man with a secret, one that can't be seen, but it is the main reason that he is able to find his family, and it's a secret that's as strong as the man himself.  As a film it's quite simple in terms of plot, and even simpler in terms how it's played.  The story is simple:   The man who is caught and thrown into the prison that was meant to be a holiday destination for him and his family.  He's given the choice to go to a different prison, or stay put in this one.   What the man finds in the other prison is that the people there are as interesting as they are, but the only difference between the prisoners there and himself is that he has a name, and the people that he meets have names too, but he doesn't really know how to use them.  This film is really about how people try to find a way to live their lives, how they try to be who they are and how they struggle with themselves.  I'm not sure if it's really an amazing film, but I can say that it is a very well made one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror movies then you should see this one. The first half of the film is very good. A couple of creepy creatures and a creepy creepy monster. The monster itself is so freaky looking that I was scared at first. But then it started to get really creepy. And I was laughing out loud! The ending was awesome and scary.   I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie the other night and thought it was a nice film. I enjoyed the story and the characters and it was pretty funny at times. The plot is pretty simple. A couple get together for a party. They go to a big house and there is a big party going on there. The girl gets bored with the party and decides to sneak out of the party with a few of her friends. She gets lost on the way and ends up in a small town. The town is not as nice as the big house. The people there are pretty much like the people in the big houses. They are rude, mean, mean and nasty. I loved the characters. I love all of the characters in this movie. I even like the girl. I didn't like the main character. I mean he was not very nice or likable. But I loved him and I would like him if he was an adult. I liked the other characters in the movie. They were funny. I wish they had a little more screen time but I guess it can't be helped. I think that this movie would be better if it had more screen room. I really like the music and the sound. It was pretty good. I like the ending of the movie and I liked when the girl was dancing in the snow and the snow started to fall.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a boy named Tom who has an evil twin brother who is the devil incarnate. He is very smart, but the way he thinks is very stupid and he is very violent and cruel. He thinks he is the best and he always wins, and when he doesn't he gets very upset.  Tom tries to hide the fact that he has a twin, but eventually it gets out that he's really a girl and he gets angry.  He tries to kill Tom and get revenge on him for what happened when they were little. Tom is the only person who understands Tom and he doesn' t like him, but Tom thinks Tom is a good boy.   I enjoyed this movie and I liked the way it was made. It was different and different meant it wasn't a typical movie.  I have never been a fan of the Devil incarnate and I didn't like the character, but I liked how the movie turned out.  This movie was made in 1978 and it wasn' t made for the children. I think the audience should know that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know this sounds like a lot of hype, but if you're a fan of the show, you have to watch it. It's very different from the first season and I think it has a much better pace. There are some serious action sequences and the pacing of the story is really good, but it doesn't feel like a full series. There's not a lot to the story. There is a lot that happens, but the show never really feels like a complete story. It is more of a "this is what we did" kind of story. I think the story would have benefited from more focus in the first two episodes. They do end on a cliffhanger and they didn't do a good job in setting up what is going to happen next.   Overall, this is a very good show. I give it a 6.5/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You know what, there's not a bad thing about this movie.  It's not the most entertaining movie, but it's not bad either.    I wouldn't say it's an outstanding movie, though.  It's not anything great.  The only thing that stands out is a guy named Peter who wants to take care of the animals in his neighborhood, so he sets out to do so.  This is a movie that's got a good story and the people in it are likable.  There's a little bit of nudity, but I don't think it was distracting enough to make me not like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was never a big horror movie fan, but this one was very entertaining. The acting was decent, the story was not original, but it was entertaining and fun.  It had some good gore effects and the actors did not disappoint.  I'm very pleased with this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is one of the very few movies in which I've actually cried on screen, and I don't usually cry on screen.   This movie is a real heart-breaker, and the director knows it.  This is an absolutely devastating story about a family torn apart by an abusive relationship.  It starts with a mother whose children are very young.  The father is a serial killer who has been in prison since the day he was born, and it's only because his daughter's mother is an alcoholic that the father finds a little bit of peace in the outside world.  But his daughter is so young that she doesn't really understand her father.  She only knows him as the murderer who killed her mother and has been imprisoned ever since.  When she's 14, she and her father get in a fight.  After a while, he turns on her and begins to strangle her.  Her mother is there in a rage, and she kicks him into the pool of blood.  As soon as she leaves, the daughter starts to cry.  Because this is such a sensitive movie, it takes some time for the audience to see this.  We're not just seeing the abuse, we're also seeing the mother's rage and how she's going to get even with her daughter for the mother killing her own daughter.  At one point, she even pulls a knife out of the back of her shirt.  There's no gore here.  I don's not try to give the movie a positive rating, but I think it's a very effective movie, and a good example of how to make a heart-breaking movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So here is a little story:   The following was originally written on a friend of mine's blog. It was inspired by a book by a famous author, that was about an old guy who was going to kill a bunch of people, then he was going out of town, and one of the old people he was supposed to kill was his daughter. He goes to her, and he is going to take her to the church to get rid of her, but there is a policeman and he takes the daughter away. The next day the old guy is at the church, and the policeman is there, and then the old man shoots the policeman.   I think that this is a great story, and this story would make a good novel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had the misfortune to see this at the cinema and I didn't mind it.  It wasn't exactly a masterpiece but it was an enjoyable film, a good story and I found it very entertaining.  The plot was very simple, a young boy goes to visit his grandfather, the old man is dying and wishes to see his grandson one last time.   The film was about the time the old people were alive and the way they talked, the way it sounded to me, the kind of people they were and so on.  It was very good, a very enjoyable film.  This film is not about how much a man knows or what he can do, it is about the way people look at each other.  You just can't help but smile every time you watch this.  A wonderful film with great acting.  I am glad to have seen it and hopefully to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I'm glad this movie didn't have any nudity. I don't think nudity in this kind of movie is necessary. Besides the naked woman in the first couple of minutes, the other scenes in this movie are pretty mild. The first scene shows a woman going through a big door, then she gets her butt kicked. The second scene shows her going through another door and then she goes through a little hole and into a man's hand. The last scene shows another woman going into a room with a naked woman. And I thought that was pretty good. I've seen a few movies that showed this kind a scene, and I just thought that this one was different. I didn't feel the need to have my own personal sex scene with these women. It was just too much sexiness to handle. And the ending is pretty much the same as the ending in The Exorcist. The only difference was that I didn.t like how the ending ended. But it was still a pretty good ending to a good porn movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I was expecting a much more negative review for this film, but it was actually pretty good. I really enjoyed this movie and the acting was pretty good (except for the little guy, I'm still not sure if he is supposed to be a baby or a dog). The story was pretty much the same as the previous one, but in a different way. The characters are a bit more complex now, but they are still pretty bland. I liked how the characters reacted to the different situations. It was also interesting to see the difference in how the different characters treated the dog, how they looked at him, how their family reacted to him and his behavior. I also liked how there was a real dog who lived on the ranch. I would really like to see this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Stand was one of the most brutal, harrowing and brutal movies I have ever seen. It was the first film in a series that was to follow, but was only half done.  I loved this film, it is an important movie in the history of cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple of years ago I went to see a couple of old movies I've never seen before. I don't know who directed them. I know who wrote them. They are good old movies that are fun.   The first one I saw was called "Pee Wee's Big Adventure." It was a big cartoon with a small person, a big person and a little person. They were all in a big basket and they had a little cart with them. One day, the big guy who was the biggest person in the basket got out of the basket and the little guy who had been in the little basket got up and he was a little old man who had a beard and he started running and he ran around the basket. He got to the top and then he turned around and the big person got up in the big basket with the basket still on and he went back down. The little guy then said "What do you want?" and the guy who made the cartoons said "I want to get a big man and a big girl. That's what I want." So he got the big man in the middle and he made him a little girl. Then he put a big hat on her. Then she went down into the basket with a big bucket of water in her basket. The big guy in the baskets was still running around the baskets and the bucket of the little girl was still on the basket when the big boy in the first basket got to where the big girl was and he turned his back on the little kid and he took his hat off and he got out the big hat and put it on the big kid. He put on the hat and then the big baby went over to the big big guy and he said "You must come over here. I want you to come over and talk to me." So the big guys said "Okay." So they all went up to the little person in their basket and it's very funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen The Good German, but after seeing it I would be curious to see it again, because it is a good comedy.   It is also very much a German film, but there are no German actors in the movie.  I don't know if this is true, because I haven't heard of this movie. I hope this is the case, because if it is, it is just the type of movie that should be made in Germany.  It stars a man who has been in prison for a crime he didn't commit, and he gets out and then he gets back in.  This is a pretty good comedy, it's funny and the story line is interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The movie takes place in the late 60's and early 70's, the year the first Moon Landing took place. There are a few characters in the movie: a young astronaut named Alex, a couple of astronauts who are both the best in the world, and a couple who are the most obnoxious. The movie has a strong storyline, a good pace, and good acting. There is also a very interesting and unique concept behind the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm not sure how to describe it, but there's a great deal of fun and laughter here, and a good sense of justice in this film.

This is the kind of movie that I could see myself spending a good bit of time with."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "The Dark Knight Returns" (2004) is an old-school Batman movie with some new ideas. The movie is all about the Dark Knight in the modern day, and that's why it's so great. Batman is one of the best character types to explore, and he does it very well in this film. The acting is top notch as always, with the actors having fun with the characters. There is no character development in this movie, so don't expect much. This movie isn't really that interesting, and I'm not sure it would have been all that great if it had been the only Batman movie that was released that year. It does, however, introduce a lot of cool ideas and ideas about the Joker, which was fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a great movie, but that doesn't make it perfect. The script was not original, but it worked. The acting was good, but not exceptional. I was disappointed that the movie was about a kid who had a cat and was the best cat in the world, who loved the cat and would go crazy if the cat was killed. The cat was played by Peter Lorre, and the cat that loved the kid, and died for him, was played at times by a guy named Michael Caine. But I think it was better that they didn't use Michael C-A-R-E-E. The movie also has a great ending. It is not perfect, but a lot better than most movies I see in theaters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last of the films by a director whose only other film in the past two years is the excellent and acclaimed film of 2008 about a young man and his family during the Vietnam War (one of the best of the year).  In this film we get to see a little more of how young Michael O'Neill, played by Matthew McConaughey, is coping with a difficult time in his life.  When he's in high school, he's not having a good time.    He's got a girlfriend and the only thing he wants to do is have sex with her.    It's not that he doesn't like her, it's just that he has a hard time keeping a lid on himself around her.   It starts with his family taking a trip to New York.  And when they get there, he starts having trouble with the girl.  It gets worse and worse and the girl starts to turn on him.  When they return home, Michael has no friends and he's even starting to get bullied at school.  While the film ends on a happy note, it does start to drag a bit in the middle.  The ending doesn't make a lot of sense either.  My only gripe with the film is that I didn't like the character of Michael O 'Neill.  I thought that he was played too well and there were a lot more of him than there were of the girl in the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen a movie this good in a long time.   There is not a single moment in this movie where I am not surprised by what is going on.

I know I'm not supposed to get too deep into it but I just wanted to see the ending. It was the only thing I was disappointed with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful film about the struggle of the Irish people to remain free and in spite of the horrors that have befallen us over the years, I found this film to be a very moving experience. It does not offer much in the way of plot, but it is well-paced and beautifully directed. It also shows that there are a lot of very interesting people in Ireland, some of whom are quite down-to-earth and down to earth people who are not in any way racist.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil and Daniel Webster"  was a pretty good movie.  I am not a great fan of horror movies and I have not seen any of them so far in my life.  I was surprised by this one because it is a horror movie. I was not disappointed at all.    I had to read a review that said it was not scary and that the only horror element in the movie was that there were two ghosts in the house.  My review is a bit different because it was a great movie and the story was quite interesting.  The plot was that a ghost (Daniel Webster) comes to live in a house and goes crazy after a couple (Gemma and Jack) who were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver (William) arrive home.  After a bit of talking and trying to get along they decide to have sex.  Gemma has a secret but when she tells William he is all excited and they go to bed.  But William is a vampire and when he sucks on Gemma's breast the house starts to go crazy.  So, I liked this movie. It was not the scariest movie I have ever seen but it was pretty good.  There were a couple of scares but I was quite impressed with the film and the actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The film starts off with a rather typical 'fade in' scene as a girl wakes up in the hospital and realizes she is in a coma. This is the movie's only real hook, and it does the job. After this, the plot starts to get interesting. It starts with a few people that are all trying to find out who killed their mother and why. The movie does an excellent job of making the plot not seem silly and making the characterizations all the more realistic. The most interesting character of the movie is the guy who is trying to get to the bottom of the case. The only thing he really gets is that his mother did not do it, and that he is not really the one who did it. The main problem with this movie is that it is rather slow paced. It really drags along as it tries to get all the pieces to fit together. It also has a lot of cheesy lines and dialogue. The story could have been very interesting if it didn't take so long to get going. It is a good idea to try to figure out who did the murder, but the movie didn't have the patience to get there. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery, but you should probably not let the fact that it takes so long make you put it down. __________ A solid movie, and I can't wait to see the next one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was good, the acting was good and the plot was interesting, however, the only thing that could've made it better would be if it was filmed in a better studio or if the character were more believable, as well as if the movie was not as long as it is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not hard to see that the movie is about the aftermath of the battle of the Somme, and that is an excellent and powerful film, especially in this period.  A great achievement.    A few words about the film:   The film is based on the novel by Eric Liddell called The Wounded Gazelle.  The story is one of a brave and clever young Jewish boy who is fighting for the cause of the Allies, and is given a new and more important role by the arrival of his father.  This was made before the German invasion of France. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie to have on a rainy day:  One of those films where you wish it would have ended sooner:  I enjoyed this movie, I really did, but I was annoyed by the way they were filmed, and it wasn't a good film.   It's a good idea to have a good time in a movie about the good life.  But the way it was filmed was just terrible.  This film was the opposite of a good life:  The actors were all on-edge and I could see that from the first shot:  And they just kept going through their routine.  There was no way to keep a straight face when one of the actors is telling a joke, or when one is talking about how he's getting so old and is having to live in a small house.  And the plot is so bad, I couldn't believe they had the audacity to go with it:  As I said, I enjoyed the film, but it's not a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are several things about this movie I like, one of them being the fact that it is a comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. Another thing is that it takes place in a small town. This town is a rather quaint place with a small population, and the townspeople don't even realize the situation they are in. The town is run by the sheriff, the town's only remaining resident, who has an unfortunate habit of killing everyone he comes across in an attempt to keep them from hurting anyone else. This leads to a rather odd situation as it is clear that he has a serious problem with violence, and he is the only person who knows of the evil he is capable of doing. This causes a rift between him and the townsfolk, and in the end, it is everyone who lives in the town who have to band together in order to take the sheriff down.   I liked this movie. It was funny, it was sad, it had some decent special effects, and it was just a good little movie.

Â Â It's a nice comedy about a man trying to find his wife.  He takes a job at a local newspaper and tries to find a woman who he can take a walk with on a Saturday afternoon.   There is a man who wants to find the girl but he's more of a hick than a lover.  The two men start to date and find out that they really like each other.  One of them ends up going out to lunch with a pretty girl who doesn't really like him but he really wants to see her.  The film opens with the man and the woman walking and talking in the woods.    Â The two meet a couple who want to go to lunch but the woman is really turned on by him and he really doesn't want to see a girl like that.  They start walking back to the office and it is raining.  There is a little girl sitting in a wagon with a big umbrella and a big hat on.  It's obvious that she doesn't have much money and the man takes her out on the picnic table and she tells him that he looks so handsome.  She says that she would love to be married to him and she's willing to work.  This is when the film starts to go off the rails.  Her brother is going to have to pick her up because her mom isn't home.  He asks the woman to get a ride to her mom.  Then we get a scene where the guy is talking to the woman about how she's looking so good.  And then the woman gets into a van with her brother.  At that point we realize that she is not a virgin.  So that is the first sign that things aren't going to be all sunshine and rainbows.  After they leave the woods they go to the girl's house and the guy shows her around.  But that's not all.  Next they go up to the attic where they find a secret door that leads down to the basement.  When they go down there they find that the girl has a real job as a housekeeper.  Now the guys get a little weird.  In the middle of the movie they go over to her and try to kiss her.   They are interrupted by her mom who is a real big fan of the guys.  That doesn't go over very well.  Eventually the guy gives her a ride home
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I know I'm getting ahead of myself, but we all knew it was coming: this is the second installment of a trilogy. This one's a little slower and we get more backstory. There's still a lot of great action, some interesting characters, and a lot more gore than before. I'm glad I saw it and I'm sure I'll see it again."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that made me feel that a good story was told.  The story of this movie is very unique, with some strange situations and strange characters.  The story is very good, but it's not really good at anything else.  It has the right plot elements and the right characters, but the story doesn't really go anywhere or really make sense.  This is not a bad movie, but there's nothing to write home about it.  I recommend this movie to people who like weird movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Citizen Kane is an old film, one that is so well known that I cannot possibly explain why it is considered a classic. It is simply the greatest film ever made. There are so many things to admire about it, including the brilliant cinematography, the great performances, the amazing special effects, the innovative use of music, and most of all, the acting.  Even with this wonderful ensemble, there is always a great deal of pathos in the film.  It is a testament to the director's skill that in the midst of such a great film, the characters still manage to remain alive.  The plot is simple:  In 1940, the US government has been infiltrated by the Communist party.   It is a plotline that is familiar, but the details are new and exciting.  At a dinner party, a wealthy industrialist and his wife are discussing how they feel about the communists.  One of the guests, the son of a prominent member of the party, begins to question the wisdom of the ruling elite.  He wants to know if he is the son that the Communist has been looking for.  It has been a long time since the film was made, so there are many changes that have occurred since it was released.  Today, the film would be a little less successful than it was then, but that is not the fault of the film itself.  After all, it is a movie about a family and the family that they become is very much the same.  But it is the changes that are the most interesting.  There are many references to the events of the early part of the 20th century, but there are also references to modern day events.  A reference to the "Bolshevism" in Russia is a reference to a much more recent event.  I would be curious to see how the plot is used in an old school comedy, but I would also like to see what the movie would look like today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It's a fun, silly movie about a small town in Indiana that has a small zoo where a bunch of animals get to live. They are called "paws" and they are a lot of fun to watch. They all have their own personalities, and some are funny while others are sad. The movie also features a great soundtrack, a lot more humor than the story warrants, and a couple of nice little touches. If you like animal movies, and love the animals, this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing"  is a horror movie that is not afraid to scare its audience.  A young man finds himself in the middle of a large amount of dead bodies in a local shopping mall.      This isn't the first time a mall has had to deal with this, but this time the mall is not the only threat.  There are also a number of mutated creatures in the mall, and when the young man begins to investigate the mall he discovers the dead bodies.  The Thing  has a good cast and a good director.  This movie is great and is worth a watch.

It had a pretty good plot, the music is nice, the cast is great, and the ending is a little cheesy but it doesn't matter as the story was great and the cast was great. ********************* I'm not sure why the reviewers didn't like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie begins with a flashback to a young girl, Lorna, who was abandoned by her parents and raised by an aunt who is a witch. She grew up to be a good witch and became a teacher to a group of young witches who were at an age to do much evil.  Lorna and the other witches are summoned to a village in the mountains, where they have to find a magical item, the sword of the Black Knight.    The film has a great sense of humor, especially in the witch's interactions with the knights.  In addition, the film has an interesting plot and characters.  The plot of the film was interesting, because it was told in the first person.  The story was told by the witch who lived with Lornas mother.  Lornes mother was a powerful witch and loved the knight and Lorns sister.  She would go to the village to get him to play with Lorns dolls.  When the knight comes to the house he asks to play, but the witch says that he can't play with the dolls. When Lorn was about to leave, Lorns mother was about too come to her.  But she was captured by the Black knight.  After Lorn and the knights come to the town the witch gets angry and kills the knights and then she and Lorns father are killed by the knight.    While this film was very interesting, I feel that it could have been better if it were not told in first person and if there was more of a story about the witch.  However, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an old man and I still can't get over the fact that I loved The Black Stallion (1947). I'm always looking for that one film that has the perfect blend of drama, romance, action and comedy and this film does just that. If you want to see a good time, a good romance, a great action film then this is it.   The cast is as good as ever:  I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 35. The action is intense but there are a few instances where the action slows down to let the characters get a little more character development.  I'm not a huge fan of this film but I think it is worth watching for the sheer entertainment value alone.

I don't know why but I find it hard to like anything with George Lucas, but I will say that this movie is the most entertaining and entertaining Star Wars movie yet. I found myself smiling all the way through and I loved it. I will have to see the next two films too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot of people out there that have been told that there are no female superheroes, that the women are weak and have no skills, that they're only there to be rescued. Well, I think that these stereotypes are based on fact.   The women are tough, powerful, funny, strong, and tough as nails.  They are very funny.  The costumes are very different, as well.  And most importantly, the women have feelings.  I don't know how to describe the way they feel.  It's more like a mix of sadness, rage, and joy.  But they have those feelings, and they show them through their actions.  So don't let anyone tell you that women aren't strong, or that women don't fight, or don't make mistakes.  You're not alone!   This movie is for those who want to see a strong, funny woman, who isn't afraid to kick some ass, who doesn't take anything lying down.  If you're not ready to see that, you're probably not ready for the movie to be worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Taken" is a fun, quirky movie.  The first act sets up the movie perfectly, and we're off to the races.    The plot follows a group of teenagers who meet at a local arcade and become bored.    When the group's mom is found murdered, they decide to go to a motel to try and get some excitement.  They meet a strange girl, and a strange motel that's just plain creepy.  After some crazy stuff, they realize that the motel is haunted, so they decide that they have to investigate.  I thought it was funny, with the movie being mostly set in a high school setting.  As a high-school student, I found it pretty boring, but I liked the teens.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was good, and it was a great way to end the movie season on a high note. The cast was all really good, the plot was good too, and there were a few things that were very good, like the way it dealt with the relationship between a young black woman and a white woman, and the way the woman played it out. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the ending, which was very odd, and a bit anticlimactic. But that's just a minor complaint.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best horror movies out there, especially for the era it was made in. The plot is rather simple: a man goes to a haunted house to look for a ghost. Unfortunately, he is not only killed by a bunch of monsters, but also finds himself in the grip of a demonic possession. The movie is very well made, with very well done performances by Robert Englund, and even though it may be a little bit cheesy at times, it still has a lot of scares and good performances.

There is a strange man named "Teddy" who is in the way of John's survival. But when he learns the truth about the crash, John Connor is forced to confront his destiny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like the fact that it is a good, short, well-paced movie that has a great story line. The movie does have a lot of nudity and gore, but it is not that bad. The best parts of the movie are the ending credits where we get to hear all the main characters sing and dance. They are very entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are two major elements in the film: the main characters (Johnnie and Dottie) and the two teenagers who have to deal with them.  Dottie is the more sensitive and less sexually active of the two, and as a result, tends to take more care with her appearance.  Dottle is not the brightest of the bunch.    Johnnie, however, is the one that is the least sensitive.  He is the type to look at the big picture and see the big game.  And he does.  In the film's early stages, he is the only one to see that the other kids are acting like a pack of wild animals.    He doesn't care, and tries to keep the game up.  By the time the game starts, Johnnie is already a veteran of the game. The two teenagers, on the other hand, are the more innocent of the group.  Johnie is more sensitive, and is more easily affected by the others.  Dottle, however is more of a leader, and will make his voice heard as he sees fit.  This is a good film.  It has a good cast, and the storyline works.  I only wish there was a little more action, but that's not really a big deal.  For those who like action, it's worth watching.  There's enough of it in the beginning.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was hoping this would be a good, non-over-the-top action movie, but instead I got a movie about a man who is so afraid of his own shadow that he ends up making a terrible mess of things.  That is how the story goes, at least.    If you have a strong stomach, you should watch this movie.  The story starts with a few people walking down a street and a woman is watching them.  When the woman turns around, she is shocked to see a man with no face and no eyes in the middle of the street.  The man goes up to the woman and asks her to help him take care of a problem that a lot of people have.  They then make a deal and she goes off and finds a guy who has a similar problem.  He then starts to get more and more sick.  So the people who are looking for help get together to figure out what is going on.  Now the movie starts out strong, but the ending is awful.  You are left with the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.  What is even worse is that the ending of the movie ends on a cliffhanger.  I found myself wanting to see what happened next, but I could not figure it out.  Overall, I found this movie to be a poor adaptation of a good book.  If it was not for the great acting, I would not be recommending this movie, nor would I be watching it on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little movie, and a good example of the early '80s exploitation cinema. It's about a girl (Pamela Sargent) who has a pet turtle (Michael Wincott), who has been kidnapped. When her boyfriend (Danny McBride) is attacked by a gang of kids who steal his car, she comes to the rescue. This is one of the first movies where the character is not just a victim of a situation (as in, she's helpless and gets rescued by the police) but actually has a reason to be a thief (as the cops, with the help of the boys, find out). The movie is full of cool effects, but most of them don't really work in favor of the filmmakers, as most of the characters have to be played by the actresses, with little to no dialogue (or any dialogue at all, in fact), and this makes it hard to follow the story. The movie, however, is well made and fun to watch. It has some cool moments, and it's worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a movie called "Falling Down" that's about a group of guys who are hanging out and having a good time at a party. Then the main character decides to quit smoking and get a job in a bowling alley. He gets a job, he's really happy, then his friend asks him if he's been with any women recently and he says no, but he's not sure about this. A couple of guys start to tease him about it and he starts to get a little uncomfortable and he doesn't like that. He goes out for a beer and one of them starts to tease the guy about it. It gets to the point where he can't take it anymore and he gets out and says, "Yeah, I quit smoking." At the end of the movie there's a little girl who's about 6 or 7 and she's sitting at the party with the guys, and her mom is sitting next to her and she says, 'I just love your clothes, your hat and your shoes,' and the mom says, "'I love your shoes and I'm gonna get you a hat and a shirt!' And the kid says, "(yawns)" And then the scene ends and it cuts to black and you see the kid and the kid's mom and it's like, 'You're never gonna quit smoking, are you?'

It wasn't an "action" movie, but it was pretty good: A man is arrested by the police. He's accused of having an affair with his wife's maid. He has a good defense: he was at a movie theater that day. He claims that he had a feeling the maid was not his wife. The defense attorney says that the woman who looked like her was actually the maid. The man's wife is furious. She accuses him of having a bad reputation, that she knows of. But she is also suspicious about his strange behavior. She doesn't want to believe his story. She wonders whether he was just making up a story to avoid getting into trouble.  She has a little help from a couple of people, including a psychiatrist who has been hearing voices.  This was a fairly decent movie. I liked the way the story unfolded: there was a lot of tension, but not much action. There was a decent amount of laughs, and I enjoyed the romance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lucky Number Slevin" is a very entertaining movie. It is set in the same universe as "The Lord of the Rings" movies and there are some similarities to be found. This movie takes place on a planet that was destroyed by a cataclysmic event. There was an explosion of some kind and the survivors were left on a different planet that didn't have much in the way of resources or water. The survivors have their own technology and have some technology that is not on the earths. The movie is set on the planet Lava Planet and it is ruled by a "Runesmith" who controls the water and the plants and animals and the weather. There are four people on the Lava planet: Slevon (the main character) who has been raised on this planet by his father who is a Runemith. His mother died when he was a baby. Slevons father was killed in a raid when Slevors mother was pregnant with him. His brother is the "Wizard" who is in the process of becoming the Runemith as well. The other three are: the Chief who is an expert in "magic" the "Bard" who has a singing voice and is very wise and the "Thief" who just wants to get back to his family. I am not sure how well these characters are written but they are all very interesting. The characters are fun to watch and they are fun in the movie. The action scenes are great and the music is excellent. The only complaint I can give is that the characters are all played by very young actors. I think that they all had a lot of fun playing the roles but the acting is very weak. This is not a problem in my opinion because the acting was good in the book but not in this movie. Overall a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a large explosion that seems to be connected to a small child in the back of a car. The explosion and the kid, played by Benicio Del Toro, are the focus of this film. The rest of the film is spent in the car driving through the city of Mexico. While on the way the boy has a conversation with the driver about the current events and how to react. The driver is played by Antonio Banderas who does an excellent job of playing the part of the guy with a lot of rage and who has a huge amount of charisma. Bandera is a great actor and you can't help but like him. He plays the role of the angry, angry, tough guy who is ready to throw anything and anyone in his way. This film is a little slow at times but I would recommend watching it if you are interested in Mexican films.

It is a great thriller and very good drama.  The film is about two guys who are investigating a series of murders, and the story develops quickly, and there is a lot of action, including one of the best car chases I've ever seen.

I would recommend this to people who like thrillers, and those who enjoy watching people getting hurt.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I'm not a huge fan of horror movies. But I don't really mind the kind that's so bad that you can't help but laugh.  I remember being a teenager in the early 1980's, watching The Evil Dead for the first time, and being so taken aback by the badness that I found it hard to sit still for the next hour or so.    It's one of those things that's just so...wrong.  I'm not sure if it's a movie about the supernatural or a movie that's about the horrors of being alive.  For me, it was a combination of both.  But for others, it's not such a bad movie.  As I recall, it does seem to have a theme to it about a man who finds a map to his wife's grave that has her name and address.  I don?t think it's the most original premise.  What?s interesting about the film is that it's so un-out-there and not particularly scary.  It doesn?t really seem to be telling anything in particular.  Is there a real threat of supernatural or evil?  The film seems to be about the man trying to find his wife in a place where she?s never been, where he can?t contact her, and where she never left.  A lot of this seems to revolve around the idea that he is trying to understand his wife?s death.  He thinks she?d been murdered.  That?s not exactly a unique idea.  So he goes into this place, where nothing makes any sense, and he does everything he can to find her.  The movie doesn?ve a few interesting scenes.  There?s a very scary scene in which the guy with the knife kills a dog that?s walking along a road, and that seems to me to be an interesting way of dealing with a dead dog.  And then, there?s the scene with the creepy house in the woods.  This seems to reflect a bit of the kind of movies that inspired the director of this movie, George Romero.  At first, it seems like the house is a good way to get a jump on what's going on in this movie. And that?d be true if the film were about a guy trying to solve the mystery of a woman he can't reach.  We find out that the owner of the house doesn?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an enjoyable movie. The movie is about a boy who goes to the city with his father to do some construction. On his way he meets a boy and his father who tells him to be careful when he is going to the lake. The boy who's father is a fish is a little different from the rest of the characters in the movie. He is the most realistic of the bunch. He's very sweet and kind to the child. The child's father tells the boy to be wary of his father and he warns the boy about a big monster. The monster in the story is a large fish which has a big mouth and a big body. The fish is also very funny.   I thought this was a great movie.

This is a very well-done movie.  It is a true story and the actors play their roles perfectly.    The story is told in a very simple way, but the ending is very satisfying.  A must-watch movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about the great race car drivers. They drive, they go to the races, they win.  But they also have to deal with the problems that come with driving a high-performance machine: boredom, boredom, and boredom.  They don't have to go to races as often as the rest of us, because they're too busy with the "real" business of racing: the race track. And then, one day, a woman shows up and decides to show up and stay. She is a good driver, but she's also a great flirt.  She is pretty, but when she's not on the track she is a total flirt. So when she decides to take up racing, they get to racing.  "Dancing on a Broken Brain" is a pretty good movie. I would say that it's worth watching, but I'm not sure how long you can stay with it.  It's got good jokes and good characters.  The car races are very fast paced, and it's pretty funny. The women are also very good at racing, and the races are also quite fast paced.  If you can get past the silliness, then you will have a good time watching this movie.  I also like that the main characters are all drivers.  You can watch this movie with people who don't know much about racing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie. It's a funny movie about a guy who has a bad life. One of his friends, who's also a terrible singer, tries to take his place and is more successful than he is. The movie is about a group of people who live in a crappy house, which is a bad joke because there's only a bunch of crappy things in the movie, like the music, the acting, and the bad dialogue. It was a nice change from the usual. I can't say this is a great movie, but it's pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't have anything bad to say about this movie.   This movie is an enjoyable movie. If you're into horror movies like the Saw movies, or The Conjuring, then this is the one for you.  The plot is not too complex and the story is pretty straight forward.  There are a few moments that get a little creepy, but they don't go too far.  It's a pretty entertaining movie, so if you like horror movies and are a fan of the Saw franchise, then you'll enjoy this movie a lot.  Movies like this are great because the story gets even better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ My first movie. This is a classic tale of two brothers and their friendship and their relationship with the mother and her sister. The brothers are born at the same time and the mother, who is a kind and benevolent woman, makes sure that they get along. The mother is a good and good mother. When the mother dies, the brothers grow up, but are never together again. The brother, a good boy, goes to college, becomes a lawyer, and then the father of the brothers, a rough, wild man, tries to have the brother killed, because he is a "dung-eater". This is in the 1930's. Written by David Browning <david.browning@bigfoot.demon.co.uk>
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie and all it's stars, the film is very well done and the film was a lot of fun, especially with the three young kids.   It was just too bad it was a remake of a movie that was in theaters way before this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** The movie I watched in the theater this time is called "The Last Temptation of Christ." I have watched this movie about a hundred times. I never miss it. I like to watch it in the morning with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. It is a very powerful movie and the characters in it are the best. ********************** The movie begins with the crucifixion of Jesus. This scene is beautiful and very moving. The scene in the gospels of Matthew and Mark is the same in this movie. It shows the crucifixions of Jesus by Judas Iscariot and Simon of Cyrene. These are very sad, painful scenes. The story continues with the death of Jesus at the hands of Pontius Pilate and the burial of Jesus in a tomb. The movie is about the disciples and how they tried to find Jesus. They all say they can find him. They do find him but he is in a cage and is being tortured. Then there is a big fight in the temple and the Romans are defeated. The film ends with the resurrection of Jesus and the ascension of the Holy Spirit into heaven. This is the end of the movie and a wonderful one at that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a good film. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it is good. The acting is good, the directing is good and the plot is good enough. It may not be the best movie ever, but the best of the '90's. It's not the best in the '80's either, but that is a different matter entirely. The film is about a bunch of people who go to a mental asylum. It looks like a fun trip, but soon becomes a sad place with terrible acting and terrible writing. There is also some bad music, but what movie doesn't have that? This is a terrible movie and a sad one, but I recommend it for the laughs and the fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film has a very strong message and it has a lot of emotional impact. The story is simple but has a deep meaning and it is not easy to explain the meaning. It is a story of a man who wants to do a good deed and who believes that he will get to heaven by doing so. He gets the chance to do so when he meets a girl who is also a very good person. There is a lot to admire about this film. It has great cinematography and music and it's well acted and directed.   The film is not too long but it is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ The film follows the life of a couple of high school students, and it is clear that the movie is set during the summer before they both begin college. I really enjoyed the movie because it had a good balance of comedy and drama. I liked the main character because he was a bit awkward and sometimes a bit dumb but he is also very caring, caring about his friends and loved ones, he cares about them very much and he would do anything for them, and his family. This movie is great for a family audience because the parents and siblings are all very loving and loving of each other, and I think they would all like to do anything to help their friend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the perfect mix between a thriller, a horror film, a comedy, and an action film. There's not really a weak part in this movie, which is a good thing because it really keeps it's focus. The story of a group of people who have been cursed to transform into animals after death, as well as their friends and relatives is very original. The characters are well developed and believable. The film is a little short at 3 hours, but the ending is very satisfying. I can't wait to see the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a good example of the genre of science fiction. It's a sci-fi film from the 60s that features a woman who gets transported to the distant planet of Earth and finds out that it has become a very hostile place. She must help the inhabitants to get back to Earth, while keeping out of their way. The film is a bit slow, and there are a few moments where the action seems to have been shot on a low budget. But it's a good enough movie to watch.

It has some good jokes, a couple of great one-liners and a good amount of action.  The movie is a bit of a rip-off of the movie "Saving Private Ryan", but it isn't bad at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We are a couple of friends who were at a family reunion and this movie is a perfect example of a classic American family film: fun, entertaining and sweet. It is a good story, good acting, good music and an excellent soundtrack. It has some good laughs, but the best parts are when the father and the mother are at home. They are a nice couple with lots of jokes. The best part of this movie are the moments in the kitchen. There are two characters that really get the laughs in this movie. One is a nice woman and she loves her job. Another is a man with a terrible name. He loves to play and has a very sweet voice. Both of these characters get the most laughs in the movie. The family also have a very interesting relationship. They seem to be a family that will have a lot of laughs together. It's also a great movie to have a few friends over to watch.  The movie was rated R for strong violence, language, sexual content and drug use. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sneak" is a solid horror film that's a lot of fun.  It's got an intriguing story with a lot going on and a well-written character.    It's a bit of a slow start to the movie.  The story is about a couple that's having a party at their house and have a lot to drink.  They end up finding the body of a little girl that has been missing for months.  Then they find a little boy that's been in a coma for over a year.  After that, the movie gets a bit weird.  In one scene, a guy (who's really creepy) is talking about how he can tell if a person is lying or telling the truth.  He says that if you take a piece of cotton and place it in a person's mouth, then they'll tell the truth about anything they say.  That's all it takes for the viewer to believe the little boy is in a trance and he's the one being tortured.  It's not a terribly scary movie, but it's fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the story of a couple of high school students who have been friends since grade school. One day, the girls get involved in a game to see who can get a lower score on a math test than the other girl. They soon realize they have a lot more in common than they think and get into a fight.  In addition to that, the movie also has an awesome soundtrack.  I like the premise of this movie. It's not a bad idea. This is an interesting story that's told in a more realistic way than most of the other films I've seen recently. I can see how this movie could be quite entertaining.       I liked this movie a lot. I liked how it wasn't trying to be a "love story" as it tries to be with a bit of a romance at the end. This isn't a love story, but it is a movie about a couple getting into a situation they don't quite know how to deal with. I like the way they handle it. I also liked how they tried to show us that this wasn't just about a romance. It is a story about the importance of friendship, love, and the importance a girl has in your life.   Overall, I liked this film. It was entertaining. I didn't love it, but I did like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've had my doubts about this movie.  The reviews for this movie are not good.  I've seen the trailer for this and thought it was a good idea.  But I was disappointed.  This movie has no plot and doesn't have a good plot either.  It has a story about a guy who was just hit by a train and gets to live in a house where he meets a girl that is very pretty.  And the girl is very ugly.    The story is very slow.  The movie doesn't move at all.  So the story doesn't really go anywhere.  There is no action and no excitement.  Some of the action is very obvious but it doesn't look like much.  Then the movie is very long.  In the end you realize that the story is boring.  If this movie was made today, it would have been a flop.  That is all I can say about this story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts off a little slow as we are introduced to the characters of the film and are told about how they live. They live in a small house and their main concern is to keep their farm alive.  They have a son who is their only hope of keeping the farm going.    They also have a pet cat that they have named 'Doris'.   It is a very sad movie, as the only hope for the farm is their cat who was found by the farmer's daughter, a young girl who was playing in a field when she found the cat. The girl thought that the cat was a raccoon and kept it at home as she was afraid of it.  In the middle of the movie, the little girl, in an attempt to save the farm, decides to take the cat to the local cat shelter.  Unfortunately, the girl had been playing in the field, so the cat escaped and the cat shelter is overrun by cats.  The cat shelter closes up and the farmer and his family are forced to flee.  After they leave the farm to try to get to the nearest town to get help, they run into a stranger and are befriended.  He tells them of a place where a man named Mr. Harkness lives.  Mr.Harkness is a kindly man who cares about the animals and has a cat named 'Gumby' who is a good friend of the farmer.  Gumby is so happy when Mr.Karkness comes and saves him and the animals. The farmer and the stranger try to rescue the cat and the others.  When they finally get the cat, it is too late.  While the others were trying to get the other cats out of the shelter, Gumby got caught in a trap.  In the movie we also see Mr. Karkness and his daughter, as well as the farmer, trying to rescue Mr.Gumbys.  As the cats try to escape the trap, Mr. Gumby tries to help the cat out and we also get a glimpse of the farm.  At the end of the day, Mr Harknesses is rescued by the stranger who then helps the farmer with his farm and with his daughter.  Now, with the farm in good hands and a new friend, Gumbys can be the happy pet that he was always meant to be.  With this movie you can see that the farm has a happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a classic, the script is classic, but the acting is a bit much, and a bit too much for the story. It has a good cast, a few great performances, and it has a great ending. The best part is that it takes place in the future, in a society that has had its population reduced by 50%. This is one of those films that the viewer can only enjoy if you are familiar with the source material. It's the first film to have been made by an all-female staff, and is an all American production. It also stars two of the greatest actors of the era, Julie Christie and Marlene Dietrich.   This movie has the typical feel of a Hollywood movie from the early 1950s. It begins with a very good looking couple, played by Christie and Dietrich, having an affair. The film does a good job of showing that these two people are very good people, and even though they may be going at it in the wrong way, you can see that they really are in love. This is a very romantic film, with Christie and her husband going about their business, with a little bit of sex here and there. It isn't really a romance, but it isn't a comedy either. This film isn't about sex either, as this is a rather serious affair that the two characters are involved in. They both love each other very much, but their relationship isn't that of an "if you love me, you'll get what you want" type of thing. This one is more like a "if we both really love each others' company, we will try to make a great film."   There are some very nice scenes in the film, and the acting has a very pleasant feel about it. I especially like Christie's performance, as she does a very fine job of playing the part of the mother of the two people involved. It is a role that Christie would do again in a few years, and she really does do a fine job.   of the time. The characters are very well developed and it is easy to see why the couple should have the relationship that they do. Christie also does a fine performance in the role of Dietrich as well.  . Christie is very good in this role, and her performance is not bad. She has an unusual accent for the time period, but she does an admirable job of portraying the character. It does take a bit of getting used to

The movie is set in the year 2054, where the humans have been living on a farm in a small town for decades. The farm is owned by a man named John Blyth, who also happens to be a very bad farmer.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ The film starts out with a nice slow pace. It is a movie with a slow start, but a lot of the story takes place over a period of time. The plot is not too complex but there is a lot going on. It takes place during the Vietnam war and has some interesting scenes and a lot to think about. There are some pretty good actors in the film. It starts out pretty slow but then there is the next part which is very good. _____________________________________________________ It is very difficult to figure out who is who in the cast. I will tell you about the main players. The young kid is played by Kevin Costner and his father is played pretty well. There is a strong bond between the two. The movie starts off with the kid and his dad getting into a fight. He wins. Later in the movie, he gets into a situation where he is forced to take a job as a bodyguard for a powerful guy. It turns out that the guy is a big time smuggler who is hiding a stash of weapons. He is able to get the guns in because he is a real expert in that sort of thing. It also turns out he is very smart and knows how to use the guns he has on hand. He doesn't seem to be the most reliable person, but he does his job well. He has a bit of a temper, but that is just part of his personality. _________________ _________________________________ _____________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a little confused by this movie and wondered what it was about. Well it's not about a guy who goes around looking for his lost dog (a terrier). It's about a group of people who are part of a large religious order. They have to travel to the country in a boat to the holy site. And they have a problem. There's a ghost who is killing people in the area. It seems that this ghost is a priest (because of the clothes he's wearing) and he's using a gun to kill people. So they go to the temple and find out that the priest is a demon who is going to kill them and destroy the temple. They get a bunch of help from some demons to fight him. They make a plan to stop the demon. They start by taking the priest into a room where he can't see. They then make a bomb out of candles and throw it at the demon who escapes. They follow him and get him to his temple. There they meet a bunch more demons and they all go into a giant pool to fight each other. It's pretty cool and I loved the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last part of the movie is an almost completely ridiculous sequence where a bunch of people get their brains blown out with a shotgun. The plot is that a bunch  of people are at a beach, drinking and having a good time, when a gang of criminals from the future show up to kidnap a bunch more people and get away with it. Then the future gang comes back to warn the present gang, but before the gang can come to their rescue the future villains get away. The present gang has a hard time figuring out who they can trust, and after a few days of being on the run they end up having to make a run for it, which is an enjoyable sequence that has an interesting, if somewhat stupid, plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked the last one you will love this one.   There are a few changes to the previous one such as the fact that there are two people involved in the death of the victim.  The movie is set in a high school where a new teacher is trying to keep order.  A new student named John Doe (the same John Doe that got kicked out of his high school last year) arrives and he starts to cause trouble by breaking all the rules.  When he is caught John Doe tries to confess that he killed the teacher in a fit of rage.  I thought this was an excellent change of pace and I would recommend this movie to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is an excellent horror movie, in which the hero of the film, played by John Hurt, goes to Antarctica to retrieve a missing alien baby. This is an atmospheric movie. I'm not sure what else to say, really, but if you like this kind of movie, and are a fan of John Hurt's performance, you will love it. It is a good example of a good, suspenseful movie with a lot of scares. If you liked "Rosemary's Baby", you will like this movie. If not, you probably won't. It's a good film, and worth seeing. The Thing was directed by John Carpenter. It was released in 1981, and stars John Hurt and a very young Sigourney Weaver as his girlfriend, Linda. It also features a very strong supporting cast that includes Richard Dreyfuss, Danny Lloyd, and an impressive young John Hurt. If this is your first time seeing the film or you haven't seen it, you should definitely give it a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part about this movie is that it's a comedy about a guy who is on the run from the law because he's a pedophile.  He is a member of the local police force who is called upon by the town's sheriff (played by the great William Devane) to stop a killer.    In the course of the movie we learn about the local lawman's (Jeff Goldblum) life and the lengths he'll go to in order to prove to himself and his wife that he is the man he was born to be.  The acting in this movie has always been good.    The script is funny and the dialogue is as well.  I was never a fan of the film and did not have much interest in the ending but the fact that it is based on a comic book was a nice bonus.  This movie was made in 1977 and is considered a cult classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen a lot of horror movies, and while they tend to get pretty dark, I never thought that "Dogs" would be as violent as it actually was. I'm glad I did because I loved it.  It has a lot going for it, and it's the first film I've seen in a long time that has truly stuck with me.  A man goes on a trip and is followed by an alligator.    I loved the way it used the gator as a tool to scare the people around him.  It was so frightening and creepy.  The only reason I didn't give it a five was because it's so long that I didn' t get to see much of it. It's a shame, because I would have liked to see the other half of it, but I'm sure that won't be the case.  This film is also a good introduction to a horror movie, as it features a lot about what a "gator" looks like, how it gets its power, and how people can be affected by it. "Dirty Work" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a great story and a well made ending. It is also quite funny and has a lot of action. It does not take a long time to get to know the characters and the plot. It also has a very good performance from its lead actor and its a great film. The story is also very good and there are no weak points in the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I like to watch good horror movies, especially the ones where there is an element of danger to the characters. This is such a movie. It is not your typical "fantasy" movie. I thought the story was very well done. The only negative I can think of is that it took me a long time to figure out who the "victim" was. I think it is the little girl.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a word, it's a good story.   A good man finds himself on a strange planet with a beautiful woman, who's just a little too friendly with him.  It's a long, slow story about friendship, about trying to understand people, and it's very well-written.  In an excellent and well-made film, the director makes the movie's plot very believable and believable, and I like the way the story is structured.  I think this is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a "mature" film. It's a comedy that is fun to watch, and the cast are great.  It's got a nice blend of comedy, action, and romance, with enough heart and heartbreak to make the audience want to cheer on the main character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a group of young people living together in a rural town. The girls in the group are: M, who is the leader; M's best friend, P; and P's best and only friend, S. M's family owns a large farm that has a nice lake and a pond. One day the girls decide to get a boat and go out to the lake and P convinces M that she can't go out alone because she might fall in the water. P agrees and they both get on the boat and take off for the lake. On the way to the lakeside M has to stop the boat twice to go to the bathroom. They are soon caught by a farmer who is angry at them because he thinks they stole his horses. M gets upset and decides to make a speech to his friends. While she is talking a group is coming up to them and M has the chance to get on their boat but is prevented from doing so by S. He also tries to get S on the other boat but she says no. She gets angry and says that her father is not going to be pleased when he finds out that his only daughter is being a nuisance to him. She says that they can't live like that and that if they are going to continue to be such a nuisance then she will tell him what is bothering her. When M gets off the boat she is told by a policeman that her friends are in trouble. They have stolen something from his horse. M is not very happy about this and when she tells the girls she is going to get them to come back. They go to a house and find out that the police are there looking for them. They try to get the girls to tell them what is the problem but they are not listening. After a while the police give up and the girls go to bed. The next morning M tells her friends that she is really angry and that she will have to tell the police what is going on. She tells her other friends and they all tell her that she should stay away from the police. S gets up and tells M that it is not right to have to do that and if the girls don't like it they can go home. They all agree. M and her friends get up and go to get their things. S is very angry that they are leaving her alone. She then tries to call the police on them but they do not come. S then decides to get M to come over and
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â It is a good film. It has its flaws. But it is worth the watch. Â The story is told through the eyes of a child named Tom who is in trouble with his father. Tom is a troubled little boy. But he doesn't know it.  His father is a drug dealer.          I am a big fan of Â the movies of  Dylan O'Brien.   He is very talented and I have always loved his movies.  The movie was very entertaining.  But, I think I can say that the movie could have been better.  It is just too long.  There is a lot of dialog.  And the scenes are too long as well.  Some of the dialog is very boring.  My favorite scene was the one with the   dog.     The only thing that bothers me about the movie is the fact that there is a child that was killed.  This is a great movie and a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very disappointed with the ending of this movie, but I am glad I watched it.   The story was a very interesting one about an eccentric man who goes back to the 19th century to take back his old town.  The town is very interesting and there is much to see, but the town is a very different place from the one the movie is set in.  I liked the movie very much and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good adventure story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is something wonderful about watching a movie about a man who has no family and who is on his own with the intention of doing something, anything, but nothing comes of it. This is not to say that the movie is a bad movie, just that it has a strange atmosphere to it. I have seen it many times and always thought it was one of the most strange films I have ever seen. There are some strange things about it, like the fact that there is no one around and no one else knows about it. It's not a movie for the faint of heart. I guess it's an interesting look at what people think of in a deserted area.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny movie with a good storyline.   The characters are all funny.  I like the fact that the kids are all in love with each other.  There's also a big problem with the kids at school.  It's all in their heads.  The ending was also good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only time I have seen a movie so far where the female leads are more than just a damsel in distress to be rescued.   I don't really have a favorite character in the movie, but I do love the way they use the classic Japanese anime style to make this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen a film like this since  The Room  on the WB.   And I'm not alone in saying this.  This movie is truly a master class in what the best horror movies can be.  The script is fantastic.  And it's all done in a way that makes you question yourself and your sanity.  There are some really strange things happening, but it's never scary.  It is creepy and scary, but never frightening.  In the end, I have to say this is the best scary movie of the last decade.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a very good movie about a young man's adventures in Vietnam. The guy is a tough guy and he doesn't have any problems with the Viet Cong. The only problem he has is with the U.S. Army and the way they treat the Vietnamese. The movie is not a very realistic one but it is very good. I was only a little surprised that the Vietcong did not attack the soldiers in the army.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first three-quarters of the movie are the best parts of the film, and it only gets better from there.  There are some very cool special effects in this film, most of which were done by the great Roger Corman, who did most of his special effects work on this film.    This film was a big success at the box office and it has gained a cult following.    There were only two sequels to this film and both of them are not great.  There is a remake of the first movie which is also not as good as the original, and there is a third movie which will probably never be made.  I would not recommend this film to those who don't like a good science fiction film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on the big screen and was immediately drawn into it. It's one of those movies that, even after you've seen it a dozen times, you don't even want to know where it ends up. It doesn't matter whether it's a movie about an alien trying to make his way home, or a man who tries to save his best friend from a terrible fate, it's always just a damn good time.   It's got everything you could ask for in a movie: the aliens, the guns, the music, and of course the acting. It has a great soundtrack by T. Rex as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a good time with this movie and I liked the cast.  You get a nice assortment of guys who were all different.    I'm going to guess that I've seen all of these guys in other films.  The only guy who I didn't care for was David Niven (I have to say I really enjoyed this guy's performances).   But if you like action films, you'll like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a guy who wants to be an actor and he's a little bit too cocky and he thinks he's the next big thing in Hollywood. So he's at a movie and meets some girls and they like him. He gets a lot of attention but at the end he gets beaten up. The police come and find out he was trying to escape so they arrest him. But then he gets out and tells the story. It's a fun movie with some funny parts. There are some cool scenes with the police trying to catch the guy. There's a great ending with the guy getting a part in a TV show.   A fun movie that should be on the list of "best" movies. It might be the only one in the series.   is a good comedy/drama that is worth seeing. It has a lot more action than the first and second movie. It was a lot funnier. The only thing that is bad about it is the ending. It makes the movie a little better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice story of an old couple in the '50s, a man who has a wife, two kids and a farm. It's pretty standard old-timey. I think it's more about the family, and not the town. The couple are all about 75, and all over 70-ish. They both have pretty good accents. I found the movie to be kind of depressing.  It wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't really bad, it was just kind of bland.  A movie about the people of a small town that has seen better days. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said in the beginning, this is a very good movie. There is some nice special effects (in a film with a lot of special effects), and the special effects were good. I was not expecting that the movie was going to be so good. The plot was good, the plot was very good. It is a good story. It had some great performances, the acting is very good, there are some nice scenes and some good action scenes. There are some bad scenes, but they are not too bad. It has a lot good things about it, but it has a bad ending. It would have been nice to see some more action scenes in the end, I thought there was a lot more in the middle, but the ending was very disappointing. I liked the story, and it had some good special effects. I would recommend this to a friend who is a big fan of the movie, I liked it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this one twice now, but I like it more each time.  There is a reason for this.   The first time around, the guy who plays the title role is a little too much like the star of the movie, and the first half of the film is pretty weak.  The second time around I had forgotten that it was a comedy.  It was great!  I think this is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.  I'm glad it's being made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of good movies over the years and I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about this movie, and I'm not sure I'm as convinced as I was before I watched it. It's a pretty straightforward, very straightforward, story about a boy who gets his hand bitten off by a werewolf (it's a good story, I admit, and it's a well-done movie as well), and then the werewolf is shot dead by his owner and a group of friends who are out on a camping trip. The group's only hope of saving their friend is to kill the were-wolf and keep the bite on their hand (which will cause them to have to wear it for life) for good luck in a future hunting situation. So it goes like that, until the guy in the group comes up with a really neat way of trying to make the bite seem like a very good thing: they put the werel... read more
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie and I have to give it a thumbs up for that. The movie is about a little girl that has a big crush on her neighbor who is also her father.   The movie does have a lot of weird scenes and odd humor.  However, it's a great movie with a lot to recommend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a remake of the classic comedy-horror film, "The Devil's Rejects" (1931). In this remake, the devil is now a woman who takes revenge on her former lovers and is now taking revenge on the innocent little boy that was born to her as a child. The movie is a little too cheesy for me, but that doesn't take away from the fun it has.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad to say that this is the first time I've watched a movie which isn't about the Holocaust. Yes, I am biased towards this movie because of the historical aspect. It was made in Germany in 1942 and it shows some scenes from the time. The movie is about the life of a young boy in a village called Gomel who is an orphan. The mother and the father are in the US but they have no idea where they are. When the mother gets pregnant again, she wants to get rid of the boy. He is so cute that they decide to take him in, but they can't take him to the US because it's dangerous. The boy is sent to a school and there is a group of kids who hate him. The only person who helps him is his uncle. The uncle was also an orphan and his mother had died. He never knew his father. He wants the boy to come to him, but he won't because of a promise made to his father when he was young. He had told him he would take him on a journey to the East where the sun shines. Now the story goes back to the boy's home. The aunt (a girl) has to leave the child to an aunt in Germany. Now his uncle is getting old and can't go on the journey with the boy any more. He takes the boy and goes with him. When he gets there, they go to a monastery and the boy asks the uncle to show him a dream. The child says that he was once a priest. The girl says that the boy has to go on and that the girl will stay with him as long as he is alive. This is where the movie becomes really interesting. The story is about a boy who is being sent to the West to a boy named Karl who is a student there. The two of them have a bond that goes back many years. They are so similar that the movie can be seen as a film by the author of "The Lord of the Rings" himself.   This movie will give you the chills. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Ladies and gentlemen, I am your man! " "Ladies, gentlemen, ladies, gentlemen! Ladies, gentlemen and ladies!" "Lilith: The Movie" is a low budget but good looking horror film that I think everyone will enjoy. I am not a fan of the traditional vampires, but I think "Lilis: The Misfits" is the best thing to come out of the genre in a long time. "Lili" is played by none other than the beautiful and deadly Claudia Cardinale. I think her character is a bit of a throwback to the classic vampire/werewolf/ghost type character, but it does not feel like it. She plays her role in a sexy and sexy manner. She also does not seem to be afraid of the camera or anything like that. "Misfits", on the other hand, is played and written by the legendary and amazing David Warner. He gives a great performance as the leader of the misfits, who has a very sad and dark past. He is a sadistic and sadistic character, and I loved that about him. He does not give a lot of lines, but he still delivers some good one-liners. The film has some interesting twists and turns, but nothing too mind blowing. "The Movie" was directed by "Lillith: the Movie", and the only difference is that this one is a little more serious and darker. The story is simple, but you will have fun with it. I did not like this movie, but this is a great one to watch and enjoy.  "The Movie", like "Lilies: The Sequel", was shot in Los Angeles, California, and it was directed and produced by David Warner, who was in the "Lilys" franchise as well. It also has a great cast, and they really bring the makings of a great vampire film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There is a lot of humor in this movie but it is not too over the top. There is a strong romance between the two main characters but it doesn't take over the movie. It is a good romance with a nice ending that is well acted."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts with the narrator telling us a story about a young boy and a beautiful girl and their dog. It's very quiet and slow. The girl and boy play together and they have a lot of fun. When the boy is about to leave, the girl tells him to be careful because the girl's pet dog is very dangerous. The boy takes the dog out of the house and the dog goes back in. The narrator tells us that it is a very dangerous dog. Then the boy goes to the house again and tells his mother that he is going to take the dog to his friend. The mother gives the boy a gun and the boy shoots the dog. He puts the dog down, takes his mother's gun, and goes home. He tells his friend that he shot the dog, and the friend replies that he didn't. The next day, the dog is still there. The young boy goes over to the dog and is bitten on the finger by the dog's tail. He goes home and tells the mother about the dog again. The dog is back again. So, the narrator says that he had to shoot the dog because it was very dangerous and the young boy was too afraid to do it. The friend, who is the narrator's father, comes to the young man and tells him that it was a good thing that the boy didn't shoot the animal, and that it really was a very pretty dog. The story ends.  This is a good film, but not my favorite. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ If you don't know what you're missing in this movie, you should watch it. It's one of those movies you will remember. It was one of the first movies I watched when I was a child. I don't remember why I thought it was cool. I think it was because I was so bored that I was having trouble watching it. Now that I think about it, I guess it was the same reason why I liked the other movies I've watched in the first place. They were boring, and they were set in the same town. I didn't care much about the characters, the dialogue, or the plot. I just wanted to get to the end. It had a cool ending that I found to be pretty cool, but the rest of the movie was just average. I've always been a huge fan of the 1980s, so I can appreciate a movie about a teen trying to break into the music business. It has a lot of things that made it memorable, such as the main character who is a high schooler trying to make it in the music industry, and the music video that the main star and band make. The music video is the most memorable thing about this movie. It really brought the film to life for me, and I still watch it now and again just to enjoy it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever wanted to break in to the music world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with the protagonist, a young woman named Sophie, having her first sexual experience, with the help of her best friend, the young, attractive young man called "Monsieur." Monsieur is a complete creep. He's a sadistic, depraved, cruel, evil, deposed, corrupt, dirty, degenerate man who gets off on hurting people. Sophie doesn't understand this. He doesn't care. In fact, he's such a disgusting, repugnant person, that Sophie is completely shocked and horrified by what he has to offer her. She says she's not interested, and doesn't want to do anything with him. Then a weird, dark-haired girl comes in, who looks just like Sophie, except that she's a different color, and that she has the same face and body. And she's also kind of a creepy, evil person. But she's so beautiful that Sophie wants to have sex with her, too. And then the other girl, who was also a beautiful blonde, but very young, comes in. And the other blonde, who is about Sophie's age, is the only one who is even slightly interested in her. And so Sophie gets together with both girls and starts having sex with them. And it's just like it sounds. And I'm really not kidding about that. But then she gets a bad shock. She doesn't like this at all. But it's too late. She's already done it. And that's when we learn that she can't control her sexual urges. She can't stop them from happening. She wants to, and wants to do things to her friends, but she can never resist doing it. Sophie can never, ever resist. This is what I mean by a really weird, really gross, really depraved movie. It's a pretty good movie, but I can't say that I enjoyed it. It has a very low Rotten Tomatoes score, and the only people who like it are the kind of people who love weird, depravity and disgusting, disgusting things.

The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. The movie was great and I loved it but there was no ending. It was so hard to get into the movie but then again it is a horror movie so I didn't really expect anything special. The special effects were great though.    Rated: 4.80 - ‎1,000,000 views
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a good flick, but there is some flaws. First of all, there is no "The Man From Earth" in this movie.  It is a totally different movie. It has more of a western feel to it, more so than "The Big Red One."  The story is more "horror-thriller" than "sci-fi."    I do enjoy the "horrors" of this movie, it was scary enough, but it was not as effective as the "sci" stuff in this film.   This movie does not have the depth of "The Evil Dead."  The movie is very dark, and there are a few creepy scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a father and his son who live in a very small house. Their dog is a German shepherd and the dog is called "Nimrod" because he is a big, black dog. It is not that Nimrod looks bad, he is not a bad dog, he does what he is told, but it is not his fault, he was trained to be a good dog, but when he was taken from his mother, he grew up like a bully, and it is his job to protect the family from the people who would want to harm the family. The movie does a great job with this part of the story. It also has a good ending that makes it even better. I think this is a good family movie that is good at some of the scenes, but sometimes there is not enough to really enjoy the movie.

As it goes along, you realize this is a film about a person who has lost his faith in God and has gone on to commit a series of terrible crimes. He is now the most wanted criminal in the world. But the film shows that the real killer is not him, but his younger brother who is a child killer. They are very similar and the film is full of flashbacks to the younger brother's childhood.   It is interesting to see how different the brothers are and how much they differ. The younger brother is violent and aggressive and the older brother is passive and a little naive. Both have the same tendency to kill and the younger boy was a sadistic child and this is shown in the film in the way he kills his victims.  .   is a good film that has a lot of interesting things to say about the world of crime. The characters are interesting, the plot is interesting and the violence is also interesting and disturbing. There are a lot scenes in the movie that are not for the squeamish. I am sure the audience will enjoy the film as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Fantastic" "The best of the best"   -  James Cawley   I just had a couple of drinks to prepare for the movie "Fateless". I was not expecting it to be good.   The story was great, but the movie just was not as good as the title implies.  It is set in a modern day Japan where the young son of a wealthy family goes to live with his uncle in a Japanese village.  This is an anime about a boy who gets lost in a small village and meets a girl who is a bit mysterious.  The movie had a wonderful atmosphere, but it was too much of a typical anime movie.  For example, the music was great and the story was interesting, but I just could not get into it.  I will give it three stars, because the movie is good, but not great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the better "old" movies that I've seen in a long time.  I was a big fan of this movie growing up and I still really like it.  It's a great story with an entertaining cast of characters.  This is the type of movie you can watch for hours on end and it doesn't seem like you've seen a movie like this in a while.  The music was good and the performances were great.  So if you like action and suspense and adventure you'll like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favourite horror movie.   The story is very well done, the music is great, and the characters are very well developed.  I found it very interesting how the whole world is at war and the only one who is not in it is the girl.  She is a girl who is so beautiful that people are attracted to her, and she is the one who has the only hope of keeping the world at peace.  It was very disturbing to watch how she did not want to leave her little village, but she had to do so in order to save the world.     This movie is very important in my life, I watched it many times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Night of the Hunter" is a fine movie, it is a movie about an ex-con who is trying to make his way back into society, and is having to deal with a lot of things. He is a good guy, and the only bad thing about this movie is that the ending is a little unsatisfying. The movie is good, but the ending was just a little off. I do recommend this movie, and if you like westerns, or just people who are good at what they do, this is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a bit of a time loop at work in this movie and while I'm not going to go into the specifics, the film does a good job of using a lot of footage from the previous two installments and a little bit of new material to keep things fresh. This movie is a little on the silly side but it works and the film isn't bad, in fact it is pretty good. It has its fair share of moments that are silly but it also has a good deal of heart and I don't feel that this movie is anything special in the sense of being a classic, in terms of story and execution. It is just another good flick from the director of Mr. Boogedy, which I am sure he has a thing for. It also does a great job at mixing up its two tones. The humor is very much a throwback to the '80s and that is a good thing. I really enjoyed the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, simple movie about a group of kids who get involved in the drug game. It has a good story, a great cast of characters, and is good fun.   "We're all in this together." This movie was based on a book by the same name.  The movie is based on the book by John Fowles and features his great, funny, and sometimes scary characters.  Fowle is a great writer and this is a perfect movie for the reader.  The story starts out with a group going to a school dance.  Their parents are out of town, so the kids have to take care of the party.  After a good time, the kids are all asleep and the lights are out.  When the lights come back on, the party is over.  They all have to go to bed.  This movie has some great action scenes and some interesting themes.    I found myself smiling a lot as the movie went along.  But when it came time to actually get to the good stuff, I was disappointed.  One of the reasons why this movie is good is the characters, even though they may not be the best.  There is a nice little romance in the movie, but it is a bit forced.  I think the reason for that is that the two main characters are the oldest kids in the group, and both of them are about 15 years old.  It may not seem like much, but you don't have to be an expert to know that older kids don't love each other.  I think Fowes realized this and I think that is why his movie has the appeal it does.  So how did the movie get a 9.0?  I have given it a very good score because it had a lot of good scenes.  Also, I enjoyed it when the girls got together and I liked when the adults were involved in something.  Overall, I liked this movie a lot and I would definitely watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This is a movie that's so easy to like and that has a very good ending that shows that the characters and the story have been building to a good conclusion. Â The movie has a good mix of comedy, action, romance, and suspense and it ends on a very satisfying note.  If you like horror and the suspense of a good horror movie this one will keep you on the edge of your seat.    I also like the fact that the film uses its time frame to build suspense and keep the audience on the edges of their seats.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third movie I've seen from the director, George Roy Hill. The first two were very enjoyable and not for the faint of heart. I have to admit I didn't care for this one. The story is one of those that's just not good at all. I really wanted to like it but it's just a lot of wasted effort. The only reason I gave this a 3 was that it's an old movie and I didn 't have much to do with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the 1980s, the world was in a state of constant worry.   The Reagan Revolution was in full swing.  There was a lot of worry that communism would spread to the United States.  A group of scientists at MIT developed a new super computer.  The computer was called the Matrix and it allowed users to manipulate reality.  They did this by building a computer program that allowed them to manipulate people in the real world.  Unfortunately, the computer's computer program was hacked and the Matrix crashed and exploded.  Fortunately, the program survived the crash and became a new machine called the Enigma.  Using the Matrix, the Enigmas could create reality.    The movie has a great plot.  It has great special effects and it has great characters.  In a few of the scenes, the movie was so good that I almost forgot that it was a movie.  I liked how the computer program became a part of the Matrix.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cobain: Man of Many Trades  is a solid comedy that is not a comedy at all. It's about a very interesting man who is trying to do a variety of jobs at different times in his life and who always comes up with a way to deal with the situation. The movie does a great job of showing his flaws and flaws of others and what they mean to him and his career. The main character has a great chemistry with Gary Cooper and the whole cast is excellent.  The movie was made in 1986 and has aged wonderfully and is still funny today. It is a great movie and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say, I'm really surprised that this movie has been so well received. It's one of those movies where the premise is very, very good. The story is not exactly original, but the director of the movie does a good job at making it interesting. The music is good as well.   The main character is very smart and he manages to use his brain in a situation where he needs it.    The story does get repetitive at times, but it's very good when it does.  I also really like how the director handles the characters.  It's funny how you can tell what their character traits are. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't watched a lot of westerns. But this one is really good!   It is really a story about a young man, who lives alone and is a "carpenter". The man is the only one who works with his hands. He is really smart, but he is very shy. The man has a big family and a wife, who is a very nice girl. One day, she tells the man that she has to leave the man and her family because the husband wants to go to work and the wife doesn't want to work. She tells the woman that she can stay with the man's family. The woman's family is not very good, but the man is very happy. So he leaves the family. But when he goes back to the house, he finds out that the family is much better. They have a big house, they have a lot to eat, and they are really nice. The family is very good and the man even has a new car.   The man works hard, and he is happy. He has a great family and he has a good job. And then, one day, he is driving down the street when he hears a very strange sound. The sound sounds like a very beautiful song.  The song sounds very sweet and beautiful and so the man goes home and plays the song and it sounds very nice to the man. But it doesn't sound good to anyone else.  The movie has a very good story and the movie has good animation and good acting. The movie is very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're probably going to laugh and maybe cry.  It's a little long, but that's to be expected when it's an animated film.  A young girl named Hetty (voiced by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) is the new girl in school.  She's kind, good with her hands, but not as good with words.    She also doesn't like the school. She wants to go home.  This isn't the only thing she doesn't appreciate in school, though.  Her little sister Hetley (voiceless) is a good girl, and she likes the same things as her little sister.  Hetboy has a crush on Hetet, and is a little jealous that he doesn't have a sister like his little sister does.  And that's about it.  The film is a lot of fun, but I don't think you'll want to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's good and it's entertaining and it has a bit of everything.  My favorite scenes are those in which they have to work together to get a group of criminals off the streets.    It's about a man who takes a job as a private investigator to help people, but he ends up solving crimes on his own.  The film doesn't use a lot of special effects, but they are good.  It also has a nice twist at the end which is a bit unexpected.  This is one of the more entertaining films I've seen in a long time.  5/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** This is one of those movies that has so much that is great about it. It is a story about a man that is in prison for a crime he didn't commit. In prison he learns a skill that allows him to see ghosts and hear voices. He uses this skill to solve murders and has a good time doing it. But this is not all. It has a great soundtrack and is a fun movie to watch. ******************* The only problem with this movie is the lack of actors. They all do a great job but there just aren't enough to make it worth watching. It would be better if they had more characters to interact with and more people who can do accents.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is a good film. I don't know how good it is at all. I think it's good, but not very good. I'm not sure how it's done at all, because the whole thing feels a bit like a movie made for a video store. The script is like a very badly made play, and the acting is like it's a video game. This could have been an interesting, and fun film, but it was a total let down. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ _________ A great flick. The main characters are well developed and there is a nice twist on the hero-villain thing. The way the director handles it is awesome. The movie does have some issues though. There are some characters that don't really do anything. They are there to be the bad guys and they do it well. I wish the movie had more depth to it. It's like the bad guy comes out of a closet, hides in a tree, and then he has an evil plan. I think the only good thing about the movie is the music. I really enjoyed it. I loved the story. _________________________________________  Read more reviews at: http://movies.festival.com/films/star-trek-the-next-generation-ep-12/review/71177/ http://www.moviesub.org/movie/star_trek_the_next_generation/review.php?id=977 http://en.wikipedia.org... http://hollywoodreporter.com...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "When they took out the dead people, they got a bunch of old people!" "They're getting old!"   The plot is a bit complicated. But then, this is a comedy.   In this picture, the old folks have been taken out by the Army. The Army decides to bring them back for a special reunion. The old people are thrilled about being reunited with their old friends. But one of them doesn't really want to come back. He doesn't like that they used to be a bunch and then all of a sudden, it's like they're all the same. He wants to stay with his son. His son is an old man, but he has a pretty good time. He tells his son about all the things he can do with a pair of scissors. He can tie his shoes. He has a cane. He's got a golf club.  "Oh, yeah, I'm an old fuddy-duddy."   This picture was produced by George O'Connell and Harry L. Anderson in 1934.  This film is considered by many to be the best of the series.  Posted by John at 11:44 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The premise of this film is great: a group of friends go to a college football game, but one of the guys is too busy playing the guitar to focus on his life, and his girlfriend is going out with some other guy. The movie is based on a real life event and the story is not bad. But the story of this movie is that the protagonist is a poor, ugly, stupid, but funny guy who has all the potential to be a good actor. This movie was made in the 60s and its style is dated, and the actors who played the roles were mostly not very good. It was a great film, but it is a little hard to find the time to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing about the movie is the soundtrack and the actors.   I just love how the movie was shot.  It's an old-timey story with a new twist.  The first time I watched this movie, I was so enthralled with the story.  I remember thinking "Oh my gosh! This is going to be so amazing!"  And then it was.  But I can't deny that I was a bit confused at first.  Was this going to have the same feel of "The Lady Eve"?  Yes, I know.  There are some similarities.  One thing that I found interesting was the different characters.  You have a tough, good-natured young man, who has lost his wife.  He's in a bad situation.  And in this story, he's a womanizer, a gambler, a crook.  But he's not a bad guy, he just is not as smart as he thinks he is.  In a world where a lot of people are not as good-hearted as he is, he has to come to terms with the fact that he's got some flaws.  These flaws, however, make him a very lovable character.  This is the type of movie I love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not gonna lie, the movie has a weird title, but it's really about a giant monster.  You see, this monster is really big.  It's almost twice as tall as the average human, and it's also pretty strong.  So, what is it supposed to be?  A giant monster, of course!  I mean, that's the only thing that makes sense!  This monster could also be called the Godzilla of the Pacific.  He's basically a giant green blob.  He's big enough to be seen from space.  And, he's fast.  This is the only reason why this movie doesn't suck.  The rest is just weird.  You know, Godzilla is supposed to go to Japan, where there are lots of cities with people.  But he just can't get out of his own way.  When a city is destroyed by a huge tidal wave, Godzilla can't swim in that kind of water.  Not to mention, when Godzilla starts to get pissed, it seems like the only way to get out is to just let loose all the energy he's got in his tail.  Which he does, but he also seems to start having a bad reaction to electricity.  That's the other thing about this movie: It's kind of like a science fiction movie where Godzilla has a big problem with electricity.  You know, this movie is kind of weird.  This movie is also really long.  There's a lot of talking.  In fact, there are so many talking parts that they just stop trying to make the movie interesting.  I don't know, it just seems like there are a lot more people on this movie than actually exist.  Also, there's a bunch of people who get killed, but who's really dead?  Oh well, I guess they're just there.  They're not really dead, but they're not alive either.  Why are there so many people dying?  It just doesn't seem right.  All that being said, this is a good, if not great, monster movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure what to say about this movie, other than it's great.   You've probably seen the movies that have the same title, and if you have, you probably know what I'm talking about.  And the only thing I can say about it is that it's a great movie.  The cast is great. The director does a good job of mixing a story about a high school teacher and his teenage student that are in the same class, with a little more than they really want in a story that really has little to do with the teacher.  But this movie isn't about the story. It's about the characters.  I can't say that the actors are bad. They all have their moments, and they all play their parts well.  They play the two best friends of the same age who are struggling with each other.  What I like about the movie is that the director, David Cronenberg, has an obvious passion for the film and knows exactly what he's doing.  It is a horror movie, and it's not a very good one.  That doesn't matter to me, because it's fun to watch.  In fact, it's so fun, that it would be difficult to describe it without coming off as a total nerd.  At times, it almost feels like a cross between a movie like "Friday the 13th" and a movie about the love of a teacher and a teenage boy.  There are some good and some bad parts.  Unfortunately, Cronenberg's direction isn't always great, so sometimes the scenes don't really work, and there are times when the movie just isn't very good.  If you like horror, I recommend this movie. I think it would have been better if it had been in black and white. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good comedy. The movie is about a poor man who gets a good deal on a used car, but when he goes to buy it, it's a car that's been around for years. The car is in bad shape and the mechanic only fixes it up for a couple hundred dollars. The mechanic tries to repair it but it's too late. He goes to the local auto mechanic and it's only a matter of time before he gets his money back.  I laughed out loud at this movie. I thought that it was good and had a great ending. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day I came across this movie and couldn't believe that I had never heard of it before. This is a very good movie that is set in the early 70s. The story is about a man named George (Richard B. Riddick) who is a car salesman. He has an unfortunate habit of taking off his business suit and wearing nothing but a red leather coat with no shirt. One day George meets a mysterious man (Paul Newman) who offers to teach him how to be a successful salesman. It seems that George's life is going a little too smoothly until he meets a woman named Peggy (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Peggy has a very serious problem with her boyfriend (John Wayne). One night Peggy finds George at the bottom of a river. She wants him to help her get rid of her boyfriend. The following day George helps Peggy get rid off her boyfriend and then goes on to help George find his wife (Claire Danes). I really enjoyed this movie. The characters were all very interesting. It was a little slow, but I found myself wanting more of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw this movie was at a local cinema and it wasn't bad but it wasn�t exactly good either. I didn�t really know what I was watching and I was not very impressed by the movie at all. It was just a little bit of a mess. There wasn�T any great acting or writing or acting that really stood out to me. It just seemed to me like there was nothing in it that I really enjoyed. But it was just too bad to not watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you liked The Usual Suspects, then you'll like The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.  The movie itself is pretty much the same story with a few minor changes, but what makes the movie so special is the acting.  John Travolta is great as Johnny Depp.    His performance is a perfect mixture of eccentricity and menace.  John Lithgow is great too.  He plays the detective, but he's not quite as good as Depp's performance.  The only thing that's different about this movie is the ending.  It's very strange and not in a good way.  I don't know why the producers decided to change the ending, but I feel that it takes away from the film and the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an amazing movie that is about a man who gets an eye operation and ends up in the hospital. He has a wife who is trying to raise their daughter while he's in the recovery ward.   A friend of mine who is a doctor has seen the movie a few times and has a great review:    It's a great movie. I had no idea it was based on a true story.  I'm glad I saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a classic movie. It's like the old silent movies. It has a wonderful ending that has a lot of meaning. It would have been great if the ending was like a comic book. It is funny at times. It does have a few great scenes. The character of Johnny and his girlfriend, Betty, are the heart of this movie. Betty was a girl I used to be attracted to. I thought they were so cool in the movie. They are very much like each other. I like it when an actor does a lot in one movie. Johnny is so funny and Betty is so pretty. I think they should all get together for a dinner date and they can watch a movie together. I have a feeling they could have been married in real life. I know it is only a movie but I am so glad it was made.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is really great. The story is interesting and it is very good. The plot is interesting, but not too hard to understand. The main character is very strong, but there are some flaws. He is not a good leader, he does not like his own subordinates and he can't stand to see his subordinates get hurt. His superiors are trying to find a way to kill him, and that is not easy. They try to trick him into giving them information. They are very good at making you laugh. The bad guys are really bad, they do not have any good plans and they are stupid. They should have been a lot smarter. But they are not very smart. They do not know that they are in a real danger.   A good movie, but it could have been better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie about the most dangerous man in the world, and the story has a bit of romance to it.   The plot is a bit convoluted and the action is very interesting but there are a couple of things I don't like about it. The first is that the villains are the best villains of the entire movie, and there are several. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. I enjoyed it, especially when they had the movie version of the original series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a little late to this party.  This movie is pretty much a rip-off of "Fargo".  The characters are also a little similar.  The movie starts off with a bunch of criminals in a room who want to kill a guy who has taken over the town.  One of the criminals says: "You think you can get away with this? You will get your just desserts!"  As we all know by now, the town's new mayor is a little more competent and his little son is a better actor than his father.  When the criminal's henchman is about to kill the mayor, the son pulls out a gun and kills the henchmen, and the mayor kills the criminals.  It's then revealed that the mayor's son is also a criminal who is out to kill everyone, and his father is not going to stand for it.  And then the son kills the mayor.  After this scene, a bunch more criminals show up, and some of the gang members go on a murderous rampage, killing the mayor and the son.  We then get to see the mayor as a little boy, and he's trying to stop the criminals from killing him and his family.  This is when the movie loses a lot of it's appeal.   The characters don't have much chemistry, and it seems like the only thing they're trying to do is murder everyone and get away.  There are some good scenes, but they are so over-the-top, it's a chore to sit through.  I think this is another movie that I would have been happier if it were not in the summer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it was made in 1946 and made during the peak of American movie industry. I don't know if this is the first film in which the title character played by James Stewart plays the role of a reporter. I guess this movie was about a reporter who investigates a case involving a murder, which leads to an important and controversial question: what is real and what is fake?
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The "Paint Your Wagon" movie is a good one. Â It is a family movie and a good story.  I had not seen the "Wagon Train" movie and it was a great movie, and I had seen the movie "Porky's" as well.    My son was also in the movie and his name was Billy and he was very funny and good-looking and I would like to see more of his movie.  One of the things I like about this movie is that it has a lot of good jokes, like when the mother says she does not have any milk for the baby.     The movie is rated PG-13 for some crude humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good film about a very good man. I like this one because of the way it starts. You see a man going about his business, doing the things that people in the real world do. He is married, and has a little son. One day, he has a stroke, and is left unable to speak, but can still feel and move. He has to get help from a good friend, who has a son of his own. The two go on an adventure, which ends with a big fight with a gang of bad guys. The gang is led by a sadistic maniac, who does everything he can to get revenge for the murder of his wife, and the father of his child. This is a fun film, with a good sense of humor and a good balance between action and comedy. It has a good feel to it, and makes me look forward to seeing more of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Fahrenheit 451"  is a classic, a novel that will stand the test of time. The film is a satire about the book's use in the past to prevent people from reading books. A few things about the film: the book is set in a future where books are outlawed and "firemen" burn them. This is the book they use to censor the people and keep them from reading. There is a lot of nudity and lots of sex. I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if they would have used a bit more humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, not one to be missed.   There is nothing else like it.  It is a good mix of action, drama and horror.  This movie has a great story and good performances.  The only complaint I have is that some of the characters have an English accent.  I would have liked to see the film with subtitles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie in a trilogy.   I had a feeling that the story was a prequel.  What a surprise, that it was actually a prequels to the last movie!   I love that they don't go full sequel but instead just change the time period.  I think they could have had the characters go to the future with a few other characters and it would have been ok.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good sci-fi movie with a good plot and a very good performance from its leading actor, who is good in other films like The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes, The Day The Earth Stole the Moon and other good movies, but he is better in this one. The story is about a group of people who were abducted by aliens who turned them into space people who are all in the same team. The leader is a tough guy who is tough because he can't let anyone bully him and he will kill anyone who tries to hurt his team, and the other members are good guys, who can't be stopped from doing what they have to do to make sure they win. This is a movie about good guys doing good things and bad guys doing bad things, and it's not a boring movie. The acting is excellent and the story is good, but the acting in the movie is only good in certain scenes.  4 out of 5 stars A good movie, I like it a lot. The characters are good and the plot is good. It's a good comedy with some good action, but I found the action a bit lacking. The movie is very good in the ending scene, where the aliens are defeated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a woman who is trying to escape a life of prostitution, drugs, and crime. She meets a man who takes her into a bar, but she quickly realizes that the man is not the man she thought he was. She's very drunk and very out of it. But the next morning she finds out she was given a bad case of the "knock out flu." He beats the crap out of her and leaves her with the bad feeling that he might come back. So she runs away from him, but then comes across a bar where a man has just been stabbed to death by another man. He's the same man who killed her husband, and she is trying desperately to make sense of what's happening.  She's a good actress, and the acting is very good. The movie's ending was pretty much predictable. The bad guy was going to be killed by a policeman. He came back with a gun and killed him.  A good movie, but not a great movie: I've read a few reviews where people say that this movie is one of the best they've ever seen.  I'm not sure if they mean the acting, the story, or both.    Well worth seeing:   This movie is a good story, and it has a good plot, but I found the characters to be really flat. The plot is not very well developed, and even though it's set in the early 80's, the characters are very stereotypical. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a simple one, but it is good. The main character, Sam, is a young man who was living in a small town in the countryside when the story begins. He was working in a tavern and was often bored with his job. One day a girl named Eliza comes in the tavern. She has a special charm and is a good dancer, but Sam thinks that Eliza is an oddity, so he tries to avoid her. Sam is about to be called to a dance at a nearby inn, but Eliza gets angry at him and runs off. The next day, Sam sees her again. She is dancing on the street corner, and Sam tries to catch up with her. She makes fun of him and tells him to leave her alone. She tries to stop Sam from chasing her, but he runs off again. He tries to get a ride home from the inn, and is surprised when the innkeeper gives him a ride. The two eventually get to the inn where Eliza starts dancing and Sam gets jealous. He catches up with Eliza and catches her off guard, but she tries to hide. Sam decides to leave, but the innowner doesn't let him go. He lets him stay in the inn and Sam starts to get bored again. Eliza gives Sam a ride to her hometown, and the two of them start to feel each other up. The ride is long, but they make it to Eliza's hometown. When they get to her home, Sam gets upset with Elisa because he wants to be with her the whole time, but in Eliza he is still alone. Sam starts a fight with Elissa because he feels that she doesn't like him, but when Elissa realizes that Sam has feelings for her, she lets him into her home. Sam and Elissa end up together, and when they get home, they make out. Sam tells Elissa that he wants her to be his girlfriend, and she decides to let him. However, Elisa decides to go out with some friends the next day. She goes out in a car with some of her friends, and it is obvious that Sam is upset. Elissa tells him that he should be happy, but then she leaves the car and is followed by Sam. Elisa ends up in the middle of the road and is almost hit by a car, but is saved by Sam who tries to help her. They end up kissing again. Sam wants to leave

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I Love You Phillip Morris" is a great movie.  The actors in this movie are amazing.        The movie takes place in the 80s and follows a high school student named Phillip Morris who was once an athlete.  He has to face a major challenge in his life in the form of a drug called "Fenix".   He tries to help a fellow classmate (Sammy) who is a drug addict.  He ends up becoming friends with a girl named Jessica and the two end up being good friends.  After the events of the movie (see the review below) the two of them end up in the hospital and end up having to do "special" school projects together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title (   or   ) is a reference to the first half of the film which is about a family trying to live in a small house in a forest with no electricity. In the second half the characters are introduced and it is clear that they will be involved in the family's business for a while.   One thing that is particularly interesting is that this is the first film that features the children of the protagonist and his wife, and it looks like they are getting along quite well.  In this film, a child who does not want to grow up (because of his mother) finds an old man who tells him that he will be a great person in the world someday.  The child then decides to leave the house to live with his grandmother.  He lives in the forest and is very curious about the outside world.     This is one of the few films that I know that is based on a true story, and I believe that it does a good job of capturing the essence of the real life.  I was also pleased with the movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought the film was a pretty solid film, it was pretty good fun for all.  All in all, it's a fun little movie, nothing too crazy or out there, it takes place in a nice little suburb with a nice looking suburban neighborhood.  There is a lot of talk about the family moving back to the house they grew up in, I can't say I remember that too well, but it sounds nice, I think it's pretty good.    I think I like the family, it feels like it has a real heart.  They do have a very odd sense of humor and it seems to be getting a little old.  The family members are very silly, which seems to go with the whole weirdness of the neighborhood. It's hard to watch a family so full of life and love in the face of a sad and depressed world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about a girl named Kari who, like most people in the world, grew up in a family with a dad and a mom. They both work as farmers and the mother of two daughters. The father is a hard working farmer and the mom is a very caring and loving mother.  Kari and her sisters are close and close friends. Kari is the most outgoing and talkative of the three and is the one who gets into trouble the most. One day her father dies in a train accident. She runs away and gets herself caught up in the drug trade.  The two girls, Kari and Lisa, get mixed up in drugs, prostitution, and some other shenanigans.   The girls are the ones who get caught up with the drugs, the prostitution, the people being murdered, and the murders that get committed.  It's a good, old fashioned, murder mystery.  I'm glad they were able to get it made, I loved it!  This review was written by a member of the website's community and not by any member of staff or writers for the site.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is one of those films that I think people should see. I have to say that I was expecting a very low budget movie, but this movie looks very good and the effects are pretty good, but the acting is just not good. You get the idea that the aliens are coming to Earth, but they never really make it clear why they are doing this, but then there is an event in the movie where one of the aliens makes a big deal about how they have come to Earth and that they will take over. Well the movie does give a bit of explanation for why the aliens did this, and what their plans are. However, this is not really explained well. I think it would have been better if they had explained this in the beginning of the movie. So, I think this movie has potential, but I really do not think it will be a hit with most audiences. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I love this movie and it has a good plot, especially considering that it is an American film about a Mexican-American war veteran, who is a war hero. He has been fighting the evil Mexicans for the past two years and now is on his way back to the United States to get his medals. The Mexican soldiers are so evil that the whole movie has a bad taste. I would like to add that I didn't know what to expect from this movie because of the bad taste of the previous one, but it is still worth watching. Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of the action in this movie is really cool and you feel like you're watching a super-hero movie.   The story is about a gangster trying to get his daughter to a school concert so that he can have a date with her.  It's about a super hero who is a super villain who is trying to stop the villain from being able to get into the school concert.  I don't want to spoil too much but the story is really great and it's really hard to not get attached to the characters.  The soundtrack is really good and the movie does a really good job of capturing the feeling of being in the street.  This movie is pretty cool and it was really nice seeing the film being released in theaters as opposed to just being shown on TV.  If you like super hero movies then you really should check this one out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A Hard Day's Night" is a film about the lives of two young people: an unemployed, down-on-his-luck, gay, alcoholic, gay-hating, down on his luck, gay man called James Bond, and a beautiful, smart, pretty woman called Charlotte Moore. James Bond and Charlotte Moore are in the early stages of their lives, both of them having had a bad start to their lives. Bond is an alcoholic, and as such he does not take the slightest interest in other people's problems. He has no social skills, no social awareness, no feelings, no sympathy, no understanding. His only friend in his life is the one-armed henchman, Mr. White. Mr. Black (John Gielgud), the manager of a London brothel, knows about James Bond's background and knows about Bond's drinking problem. This gives Bond a chance to try and make his life better. He learns about prostitution, and is introduced to Charlotte Moore, who is a beautiful young woman with an easy-going, kind, outgoing personality. Bond and Moore have a passionate and passionate affair. At one point Bond sees a girl, Charlotte, being dragged by a man. The man is the boss of the brothel. Bond gets mad, he beats the boss, he punches the guy, and Bond goes out and gets a pistol and shoots the man. Bond thinks he has done the right thing. It seems like Bond has become a man again. But Bond's problems are not over yet. Bond's mother dies of cancer. Bond begins to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. Bond does not understand what is happening to him. His problems are more than he can bear. The psychiatrist that sees Bond sees that Bond has severe mental problems. Bond refuses to get treatment, and the psychiatrist's advice to Bond is that Bond should get a job. Bond has no job, and so the psychiatrist recommends that Bond take up a job with the British Secret Service. The Secret Service are a secret agency that specializes in espionage and protection. Bond starts work for the British, and his life begins to change. The life Bond has chosen for himself becomes interesting. He starts to learn about women, and about the people that surround him. He begins to see the world in a different way. The movie begins with Bond and a prostitute in a nightclub. Bond wants to find out more about the woman, but the woman is very upset. Bond tries to take a little of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best science fiction movie I've seen in a long time. It's like the "Star Trek" movies but better. The best part is the alien race, the K-4B, who look like a cross between a space-ape and a giant alien dog, with big, yellow eyes and a mouth filled with black fangs. They are a good example of how intelligent they are. They have a whole language which is different from anything on Earth. They know how to make fire, and they are masters at a lot of crafts like a fire-breathing, metal-munching dog, a giant walking metal man with metal claws on his hands and feet, a mechanical bird, a man who can talk to metal, and an old man who is a robot. They don't eat or drink, but they do have a sort of technology that allows them to "smoothly" digest metal. The alien race even have a kind of "graviton beam" which they can use to "pull" metal into a device which they use as a kind-of gun. They also use their weapons against other aliens and humans. There are a lot more things in this movie that will have you on the edge of your seat.   I think it's a must-see for all science fiction fans, especially those who love "Star Wars" movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been watching this movie so long I think I've actually watched it in one. This is a very enjoyable movie. It is set in a city, New Orleans, in the 1950s. There are various characters, like a black woman, a white woman, and a young man, who all have their own personalities. The movie also has a few historical references which are well worth seeing. I really liked this movie, but I did find one little problem with it. This movie was filmed in 1950s New Orleans. This city was very different then the rest of the US. The streets were covered in cobblestone, there were few cars, and people would often take public transportation. This was in a time when it was still illegal to drink or smoke in public. I think that this is one of those things that make a good historical movie. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good old time movie with a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie. I like how the movie is funny, the music is good, and the acting is good. I think the best thing about this movie is the fact that the movie has a pretty long run time. It takes about an hour and a half to watch this movie because of the different scenes and all. The only reason I gave it a four was because the movie did not start off that great.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man From Earth is a movie that's worth seeing just for the way it is shot and composed.  It looks like a very well-made documentary, and I'm sure the movie's maker got a real eye for capturing the atmosphere of a place, as well as the mood of the characters.  The movie is also very interesting and suspenseful, with some really well-conceived sequences, and it's hard to imagine any film that's as well-crafted and beautifully shot as this one.   This movie is really well done.  I'm glad I saw it.  I can't say much about this movie other than it's very well done, and the performances are very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's like the first three chapters of a long story. The film has a sense of humour that's not too subtle but is there and the dialogue is a lot of fun. The action is pretty good. There are some funny moments and it's a bit of a slow build to get to the final fight. It is a very enjoyable action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband and I both had a very hard time deciding on which movie to watch for the weekend. We wanted to watch a classic movie. We didn't want to see something that was too long or too confusing. We really wanted to see The Last Unicorn. We had heard about it and we saw it a couple of times on television. It was always on at night. So we knew that we had to see it at night at our favorite local theater. I am not sure what kind of people showed up. I think maybe the theater had only about 80 people in it. They were all standing in line to get into the theater. It started with a very long scene where all of the fairies were in the middle of a beautiful, long, blue lake and there were many small birds flying around and there was a huge, colorful bird that looked like a flying squirrel but was really a unicorn. It did not appear to be an ordinary unicorn but something very different. When it first appeared it did not seem to be in the right place and then it came back and stood there again. It seemed like a lot of effort went into it to make it look so beautiful. It also seemed to be made from a material that was not made out of a unicorn but was a kind of material that seemed like it could be unicorn. I did not like the idea of a magic unicorn that was in the lake. But I did like that it had such a beautiful blue color to it. The movie was about the unicorn that had to stop a band of evil men from destroying the world and the unicorn had to be the only one who could stop the band. It had such beautiful music. I would not say that it was very good. I found it to be too long and I found the movie very confusing. But it was beautiful. I will say that this movie was an important movie to me when I was a little girl. I loved watching it when I would go to the movies as a little kid. It is a movie that is very beautiful and I hope to see more of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fun, funny, and not too shabby!   I love the ending (I have a very soft spot for a little girl in the big city, with a little brother who's also little) and I love that there is no bad guy in this movie, only a little boy who thinks he's a big guy.   It's a good story and a good song, but this movie doesn't hold a candle to, say, "The Little Mermaid", or even "Beauty and the Beast" (which is a much better movie).   And the story has a great ending, so I recommend watching this movie if you enjoy a good tale of the little people in the city.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A well-made, good-looking film, and one I was happy to watch.  I was hoping for more from the story and more from this particular group of characters, but it wasn't too bad.    The writing is good, the dialogue is good (I liked the way the "dummy" is handled, and the idea of his getting the chance to see the whole world is good), and the film is a good-hearted, silly movie, with some great performances (and some terrific set design, especially in the train station).   I was not too happy with the way it ended...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As an old person I don't get it, and it's not that the old people are being silly or silly, the old are simply doing what they have to do, they have no choice. I had the same feeling with the movie, I thought that it would be more like a historical novel about the last days of the old world. Well, the movie is about the early days of America, in the beginning they are all still very naive, even though we know a lot about it, there is still a lot to learn about it. They live in a primitive village, the people are mostly farmers, not very smart but they do have some of the qualities that make them great farmers, in a way. One day a group of men come and take the village women and children away to a place far away from them. But they can not go far, a great storm comes and they are trapped there. They are trapped by a terrible storm and it is impossible to get out. Eventually they are found by a group, and they can finally go back to the village. It was great to see the old and young people living together, even a couple of kids, I mean it was great, they were happy to see each other, they laughed and joked, there was no tension in the movie and they did not talk about their problems. The movie ended with a beautiful song, I think that it was the best thing about the movie. I liked the movie very much and I hope that this movie will be seen more often.

It's not even an interesting movie, it's a pretty boring film.  There is a scene where a character is telling his story, and he mentions the death in his own words.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** The movie I watched was a film I have seen a few times in my life, but never liked much. This time I liked it very much. It was a good action movie that did not try to be a science fiction film. This was a story about a human and a robot in a space ship. The human is a good man, and the robot is a robot that wants to destroy the human and become a god. The movie had a good plot, with a little bit of humor thrown in for good measure. The action scenes were awesome and the story was pretty good. I like this film a lot, but I feel that it is not a good science fiction movie, but a good adventure movie. It is not the best science fiction, but it is good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* A very entertaining movie. It's hard to believe it took me this long to watch this movie, but it's true. I was a kid when I watched this movie. I thought it was just a kids movie, until it hit me in the face that it was an adult film. A true classic. I really love it. It is funny and has the best acting of all of these "Dirty Dancing" movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gangster Squad" is a fun action flick that's not only entertaining, but also smart and has some pretty good writing.  The story revolves around an all-star roster of "Gangsters" that form a private detective agency.      The "Gangs" are hired to track down a man who stole a car and who's been driving it ever since.  The "man" turns out to be a hitman called "Sylvester Stallone" who is hired by a Russian Mob boss to take down the mob boss and his men.    Unfortunately, Stallone ends up getting involved in the Russian Mob's drug and arms smuggling operations.  The movie has a lot of fun with its action and a little bit of heart, but it never reaches the heights of the good movies that were made a few years ago.  This is a very entertaining movie that you can get a good laugh out of, but don't expect to be inspired to join a gang. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is a fun, if not a little cheesy, action movie that's just a little bit too long for its own good. It's a classic Western, and it has some interesting plot twists, which is probably why I liked it. I'm glad that the producers of this film took a chance on the director and a good script.  I think the film could have been a little more entertaining, especially with a few more minutes added, but that's to be expected.  Rating: 3.5 out of 5

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** It's pretty amazing how much we've come to expect from a director like John Carpenter, as he's made the whole Halloween franchise into a masterwork. I remember seeing the first one and thinking that it was an average movie that didn't deserve a 10, but then seeing it again with a new perspective, I have to say that I'm amazed at how great it still is. I haven't seen the sequels, but I'd still strongly recommend them. ******************* I didn't like it when I first watched it, but as I watched it again I found that it had a different flavor and that it didn't have a completely solid structure. But that's a minor complaint. It has great special effects and some of the best and most scary monster movies I've ever seen. *********
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was not perfect, but it had a lot of heart, and I really enjoyed it.   It is set in the 1940's and it is about a young man named Bob who lives in a small town in the middle of nowhere. The town is run by a widowed widow and her son. The son, who is about 10, has an alcoholic father and an uneducated, unambitious wife. They live in a two story house in a little town and have a nice lawn with a fountain, a nice little garden and a nice garden shed. They have a few chickens that are not very healthy and a small, ugly cat. The two children are all around the age of 10 and are in the house a lot, but do not seem to have much interest in school. The only person in the town that has any schooling is a nurse, who has a lot to learn. The father is also very old and very uneducated. He is a farmer who runs a farm and lives in the back of the house. The movie is set at night and the only light in the dark house comes from a few candles. The house is not really that big, but the windows are high and there are a lot. The film is about Bob and his mother and his step-mother, who both work at a local diner and are both very tired. Bob has an interest in animals, but he has trouble getting into them. He keeps trying to get into the school yard to play, but everyone tells him it is too cold. Finally, one night when it is warm, he sneaks into the teacher's house, picks up a dog from the front yard and walks off. The teacher finds him at home and takes him home. The next day, he has a very strange dream in which he walks into the middle school. He thinks he sees a giant red eye staring at him. After a while, the teacher brings him back home, where he sees his mother's portrait on the wall, and his father's picture on the other wall. He begins to tell his mother what has happened and he does not tell her that his stepmother and step-father have disappeared. It is about now that the teacher sees Bob. He has just had a terrible dream and he thinks he is in trouble. He calls his mother, who says she will go out and get some ice cream, and then he and his dog go to the diner. He gets some ice cre

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm pretty sure this movie is a great piece of entertainment. The cinematography is excellent, the actors are all great, and the story is a lot of fun.  The movie is about a young girl who is kidnapped by an evil wizard, and forced to fight him.  The first time she fights him, she's pretty much a one-woman army.  Her father and her best friend are also forced to participate in the fight, and while they don't get too much action, they are good fighters and do a good job.  This movie is not the greatest, and there are a lot more things to get excited about.  There is an action scene between the characters that is worth seeing, and it's pretty good.  And there is a long scene in the middle of the movie where all of the characters come together for a party.  It is a good scene and the ending is pretty nice.   Overall, a good action movie that doesn't break any new ground, but it is a nice change of pace from the usual fare. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Samurai" is a superb action movie that will appeal to fans of old westerns, samurai films, and even a little horror.  This is the third time I have seen this film and it is as good as ever.    The movie is set in Japan, the last days of the Shogun's time, when Japan is under a foreign occupation by the United States.  The Samurai who have ruled Japan for centuries have been killed and the country is in turmoil.  A samurai named Shintaro Kago (Takeshi Kaneshiro) is sent to bring order to a country that has gone crazy from the destruction of the Samurai.  Shintao meets the young Princess Katsuo (Aoi Yuuki), who has fallen in love with the Samurai who is also her father's closest friend.  They find themselves in a world that is a nightmare of violence and the Shogun is an evil force that rules by force.  There is some excellent fight scenes and a great story line that will keep the audience watching until the very end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best horror movie ever made.   The first hour and a half of this movie is just absolutely fantastic.  There are no real shocks in the first half.  The only things that get scary are the things that you wouldn't expect to be scary.  This movie is about a woman who moves to a new town and meets a man who is kind of a monster.  He is the "Great White" and he attacks her repeatedly and then it becomes a race against time to find a way to kill him and save her life.  I think this movie has a really good message about how things can go wrong, but there is always hope.  When the movie got scary, I wasn't afraid of the "White".   I don't think this is the most effective horror movie, but it is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie. It was an interesting movie about a boy and a girl and a little old woman that have a house full of old furniture and a big fireplace in the middle of it. The girl is a pretty one with brown hair and green eyes and she has a little dog that's very sweet. The boy is a little boy who is very sad and his mother tries to cheer him up by saying how she used to be with a man and he never made any noise when she was with him and they had a child together. The little boy gets very sad about this because his father died a long time ago and his father is very fond of him and he has been in love with him all his life.

I can't remember if it's really him or not but the guy is crazy.   I think this movie is good enough to be released on DVD because it has all the elements that a good comedy movie needs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of the film is a simple one: a young man meets a woman who looks like a man, but is actually a woman.   This happens after a few days of talking to her at the cinema.  The film is very well acted, especially by the female characters.  This is not a movie that I will watch again, but I will remember it as an interesting look into the life of a couple who would have an interesting relationship had it not come to a sudden end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw the film, but only for the first time about a year ago, when it was released on DVD. I am really glad I saw it then, because the first 20 minutes or so are fantastic, and I was hooked by the first few minutes when the narrator is telling the story. The movie is about a boy named Jack, who lives in the small town of Okemah, Iowa. His father is a doctor, and he lives in a beautiful house with his mother, sister, and several other friends.  One day his mother goes to visit him at school, and when she arrives she finds her son in a room alone with his uncle. Jack, apparently in an uncontrollable rage, starts to scream at the top of his lungs. The uncle calls the police, and Jack is taken to a mental hospital. During the day, the people of Ookemah are getting more and more curious about Jack, and they suspect that his uncle is involved in a murder that occurred there a few years before. But no one is really sure, because everyone knows that the town has no secrets, and no one knows what really happened in the past.  I love the simplicity of the film.  This is a film that you can watch in a couple of hours, or an entire weekend. I really enjoyed it, and this is a movie that you will not find too often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't recommend this movie enough. If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly suggest you go out and see it.   If you have seen this film, you can also get a few extra points for being a bit of a good sport.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A man with an evil laugh and a knack for making everyone laugh.  The film begins with the man in a wheelchair talking about how he was a successful doctor in a country where he lived in.    He is talking to a young woman (played by  ) who asks him what he did in his life, to which he responds with a short story about the death of his mother.  After telling his story the woman asks him how she can get to the country to see his family and asks him if he has a wheelchair, to this he responds "yes" and goes on to say he used to have one but it broke.      She tells him that the wheelchair is too small for her and he responds that he would like to try one.  He then goes on with his story and tells about how his mother was ill and that she would not come out of bed.  Eventually she dies.  This leads the woman to tell him he should be happy that she is dead, but he responds to this by saying "no" because he knows how it is in the country.  They then go on to have a conversation about the man's relationship with his mother and how his relationship with her was the same as her with him.  The next day he goes to see her in the hospital.  His mother tells him she is sick and asks to see him. When he arrives in the room he sees that he is not his mother's son, but that he has been changed into her son.  When he asks what has happened to him he is told that a man named Dr. Zorba is waiting for him. Dr.Zorba says he will change him back to his original appearance, but this does not help the man at all.  Dr.  Zorbau then proceeds to tell the man he is to have sex with him and he says that he wants to go home and have a good sleep.  Now we have a little problem.  Why would a man want to go to a country with no roads?   Well, Dr.zorba explains it to him that there are no roads here because the people there were destroyed when they tried to leave the country and they could not.  While the man is listening to Dr. zorba he is being changed into Dr.A.R.R who is a man who is sick with the curse of being born with the ability to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You have to believe in something to believe a lie"   This movie is about a man who is so delusional that he believes he has seen God on TV. It is a very disturbing movie. I would like to think that the writer is in the grips of mental illness. He is a man with an obsession and is able to see God in the things he has created. This movie makes a lot of good points, but it does make a number of very disturbing points. The movie is rated R and contains very strong language and disturbing scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   It is a nice change of pace and it is a well written movie. The story is pretty simple, it is about a boy who loves to play with his dog. He wants to get rid of the dog so he takes it to the lake where a little boy is living.  The boy and his dog become very good friends and they both get along just fine.  After a while the boy wants to know what his dog's name is.  So he tells the boy's father, he has a pet dog that calls him "bob" and when he calls his dad, his dad responds with the same name.  Well that is it for the story.  Now to the acting.  There is a really nice cast in this movie and they all do a really good job.  I have to say that I really liked John Turturro. He plays the role of the boy very well and I am not surprised he got the part of the hero.  In the end, the movie is pretty much about the boy and the dog.  And if you are a dog lover, you will love this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is very interesting. There are so many things to be learned about the people of the future and the culture of the society in the 1950's. The movie makes it very clear that these people are not exactly like us. There is a definite social hierarchy in the society. The first class, which is called "The Elite" lives in luxury. The second class, the working class, lives in squalor. The third class, a "Third World" people, lives like animals. The last class, who are referred to as "the underclasses," live in poverty. The film starts with a brief scene of a young woman being attacked by a monkey in a park. She falls to the ground and a monkey tries to pull her off the ground. This is where the movie gets very interesting, because we find out that she is the daughter of a high ranking government official. When she falls to her knees, she begins to pray. Then she is attacked by the monkey again and this time she is able to kick the monkey in the head and knock it to the floor. Then we find that she has been trained to use a weapon of some kind and that she will fight the monkey with that weapon, as well as with the staff she is carrying. We find out the monkey was one of the "Fourth Generation" monkeys which are the offspring of monkeys which had been captured in South America. The Fourth Generation monkeys are very intelligent and they have their own language. This means that the fourth generation are like us in many ways. They are very beautiful but also very different. One of the interesting things about the movie is that we learn that the four generations are also called "the Great Ones."

It's a good mix of comedy and horror, with the latter being played with the best of them.  I loved the way the story was told and the way that it was told.    The only things that I don't like about this movie is the acting of the main character, who is a bit of a ham, and the fact that the movie doesn't really go anywhere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is pretty straightforward: A boy who loves his mother (Lili Taylor) goes to live with her (in the same house, a house with the same owners, but who knows, perhaps different people), where he meets the boy's sister (Diane Keaton) and a new friend (Burt Young), all of whom live in a house that has a lot of old people and a lot in it that is creepy, with things that just don't make any sense.  That being said, it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the story is well told, though the pacing is a little slow and not particularly well-paced.   It's also worth noting that the film was directed by John Frankenheimer (who, as a director, has made many films of a similar nature and of the same style as "The Exorcist").  He is also a very good actor and an excellent director. The movie is also well-acted. There's nothing particularly bad about the movie.   I'm going to give it a 3/5 because it's a pretty good movie and I'd give it an even higher rating if there was more, or if I could find more, good acting.

I love the way they showed the martial artists as students at the college. The movie shows how the college uses the martial artist's training and skills to help in a variety of situations.  It's a great story.  The characters are all good.  They are all likable and you can really connect with them.  A good movie.

I would definitely recommend it.

You want nothing more but to be free. But you are trapped. You know the streets are unsafe, the gangs are everywhere. They are out for your blood. They don't care if you live or die. They only want your money. They can't take it from you. You have no money, but you can fight back. You can fight for your life. You won't make it to the next morning. You will probably not make it in time for the next meal. But that is not what makes you brave. It is the fact that you are doing this for yourself. That you know that you can beat them, that you don't need them. That is the courage that will win you the day." ___________________________________________ A classic! A movie about the underdog who is determined to survive. The film is well-written, it's funny and the music is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid and interesting thriller/horror.  The story is interesting and well-written.  "I was a child when I first came across the legend of the 'Great Black Snake'.   I remember vividly the sight of this snake with its great head, huge body, and large dark eyes, lying in the middle of the street in a dilapidated house.   It seemed to me that the snake had a life of its own, and was constantly moving.    It was a sight I had never forgotten, and I imagined that the great snake was the cause of much misery in the lives of many."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a horror fan you know that it is difficult to get good horror films that are also funny. This is the rare case. The premise is simple: a group of college kids are being held hostage by a cult. They are to be killed by one of their professors. The professor, played by John C. Reilly, is played by the excellent John Goodman.   It's easy to see why this film would be a hit. The movie is funny. There's a bit of an afterthought here and there but it doesn't take away from the movie. I think the movie could have used a little more gore. There are several scenes where one or more characters are decapitated and it's a little unnecessary. I guess the film could have been even better if it was more of a horror movie.  It's a good day for bad movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid and enjoyable movie. There is a lot of heart and a lot heartache and there are some very poignant and sad moments in this movie.   In the end it is not that bad a movie and it is well worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen much of the new Star Wars trilogy. I'm not sure if I'm missing the old one or not. The old one had a lot of the good bits of the original trilogy but was a little more action packed. This is the first one that is more serious. I liked the film more than the original one. I was worried it was going to be a lot like the first. But, it wasn't. It was more like the second. It has a lot more action and a lot less comedy. I enjoyed it a lot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Mystery Men" (1978) is a comedy/drama that takes place in the 1920s and features some pretty wild stuff.  The story revolves around the antics of three brothers who go to the circus with a ticket.    When the circus is attacked by a pack of wild animals, the three brothers, including the clown (Michael J. Fox), end up in the middle of a fight that results in a huge pile of money for the circus.      The plot is ridiculous, and there is an episode in which one of the brothers falls down the stairs in a fit of rage and the other two laugh at him.  It's funny, but the movie is pretty bad, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and it is a pretty decent one. The movie takes place in a small town called Woodside, NJ and the film tells the story of a woman named Sally (Lily Tomlin), who has the worst luck in the world. One day her husband, John (Paul Giamatti) is killed by a truck driver named Jim (Ray Wise). She becomes the sole caretaker of her son, Daniel (Robert Sean Leonard), who is also Jim's only son. Sally is a single mother who has never married and who is desperately trying to make ends meet by selling all her belongings to raise the children. Sally finds herself in a bit of a dilemma. It is a little hard to believe that this is a real town but it is as true as can be. This is a great movie for any family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of "The Last Airbender." It's funny, it's a great action movie, and it's got some really interesting characters. However, the final fight scene at the end of the film is not something I would have seen coming. Not only is it cheesy and unrealistic, it actually goes so far as to be very dark and depressing. The end is almost too long to bear.   This film is a perfect example of how Hollywood is a big scam.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Muppets is one of those movies that I am pretty sure has had a lot of critics on it for years, and it has to be said it was a hit with me, too.  This is one film that you don't want to miss.  I will admit that I have always enjoyed the Muppety movies, and this was one of the first I ever saw.  The story was a little convoluted at times, but this was always a good thing.  I don't know if I will ever be able to get into a Muppet movie.   I just can't seem to get the feeling out of my brain that I actually want to see one.  It's just something that I'm not really interested in.  But I am a sucker for a good Muppet film.  This is one that I highly recommend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was totally blown away by the first time I saw this movie. It is one of the most beautiful, moving and beautiful movies I have ever seen. I can't believe that the producers and director had the courage to shoot this movie with a handheld camera and a beautiful soundtrack.  The story of a beautiful woman in her early 40s who goes to her hometown to look for her husband. I think it is the first feature film from China. It really is one to watch.  I have just watched the movie again and I find it even more beautiful, heartfelt and moving.   It's a good story with a beautiful, touching and moving story.  The ending is very touching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Sucker Punch" is a well acted, well made, well written, well acted movie with great characters. It is not a comedy at all. It does have a comedic aspect to it but the movie is about the horrors of the real world, not a funny movie. This is a very well done movie. If you want to see a funny one with a bit of a dark edge, go to "Beverly Hills Cop 2". If you don't like comedies, then you don''t like movies, period.   The movie is funny, but it is not just funny. The acting is top notch, and the story is great. It has some serious moments that will make you think about things you may not have even thought about. It gives you a lot to think about. The movie was made for people who like action movies, like I do.   The only flaw in the movie for me is that I feel that the ending was not as effective as the movie should have been. I liked it a lot more when it was the end of the movie, not the beginning of the next movie.   and as always, I have a special thanks to David and Amy Zwick, the people who did this movie, and to Paul Dano and Bruce Willis, who both gave wonderful performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a lot of good horror films.  The most important ones in my opinion.    The ones with strong protagonists, strong monsters and good scares.  But it's not always that simple.  When you start reading about a family that moves to a new house to a nice young mother (Maria Bello) and her two children (Alexandra (Natalie Portman), a very smart girl who always gets to the truth.  The little girl Alex is in a very bad way and Maria is a good mother who tries to do her best to keep her happy.  Unfortunately she is not as nice as Maria thinks she is and she needs a good, strong, strong man to help her.  Well there is one and he's the first to show up and show what he can do.  He's a very strange man.  In the first scene he seems very different from the other people.  Even the kids have a bad impression of him.  And then things take a turn.  This is a film that you can watch again and again and the same things come back.  If you have ever wanted to see a woman and her children living in fear, well here it is.  It's a good little movie with a good twist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen this movie a number of times and I always find it amusing. It's very entertaining to watch this movie about the love between a woman and a little girl. The movie is funny as well as heartwarming and you will be glad that you have seen it! What I liked about the movie:    The movie is really good. The plot is good and you don't find yourself bored. The performances are all good and the story is really well done.  This movie is a bit more romantic in nature as compared to other romances movies and it's also a good romance film.  What didn't work for me:   The first few minutes are a little confusing. It seems to be a little more of a love story and less of a comedy movie. The romance in the movie was a bit too intense for my taste. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is a great story, it was an old school monster movie from a good actor.  It is definitely not for everyone, but if you are looking for a classic monster movie, "The Thing," and you haven't seen it, then get it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We see some bad things here and there and have to endure some unpleasant scenes. But we also get a few nice and amusing scenes here, like the one where the priest (Robert Duvall) visits a poor little old lady who is lying on a bed and can't get up. The priest then sits and listens to her. She asks him a question and the priest answers it. She tells him about a man who stole a horse from a stable. She then asks if the man is still alive and the man replies in the affirmative. This little old woman is the reason why we love the movie and the reason it remains a classic in the horror genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen the movie "Clerks," I urge you to do so, but don't expect to find anything particularly profound about the events that transpired at the end of the movie. If you're like me and you're a huge fan of the late, great Kurt Cobain, you probably already know this, but "Cobain" is a movie that is best experienced with the light on. Cobain was one of the greatest rock stars of the last twenty years. He was the ultimate rocker. He wore his heart on his sleeve. He did things that were impossible to imagine. He could get down with the girls, the rockers, and the punks. He knew exactly how to play a guitar and sing. And he was an amazing comedian. I'm not sure there has been a greater comedy figure than Kurt Cobains. And his tragic and untimely death has been the most devastating loss to rock music in the last ten years. It is unfortunate that this movie is only available on video, as I was able to watch it on the big screen when it was first released. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Kurt Cobin or just really wants to see a movie about a rock star who died young.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie, the movie is about the story of a guy who has a crazy and weird dream. When he wakes up in the morning he is back in the dream. But, there is something that is bothering him. When the woman comes to see him, he does not know how to explain to her what he saw. The movie is funny, but not funny to the point that you want to laugh. The guy has a bad reputation and the woman is trying to get him to leave. But the guy is not willing to go. So, she has a plan. She puts a ring on his finger and puts a bunch of flowers on it. The man can not tell the difference and when he realizes it, he decides to leave with her. I loved this movie, and I am glad that I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is an intense psychological thriller about a group of students who are being trained in a private detective agency by a man named James Bond. The movie follows their investigation into the mysterious death of a young woman who was apparently killed by a woman known only as 'The White Witch'. The film is quite a departure from the usual 007 fare as Bond is introduced in a more conventional manner. His relationship with the female lead, Lotte, is far more interesting than the usual relationship between a young man and a woman. Bond is not so much the straight man, but a far more complicated character who is also quite a good guy. The film also features an intriguing villain in the form of a female version of the evil scientist in The Man with the Golden Gun.  I also loved the villain, who has a very strong character and a great role to play. I thought she was an excellent villain and a very memorable one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is funny. The plot is not a good one but the plot isn't a bad one either. This movie has it all. A guy who is about to get married is looking for a job. He is hired as a delivery boy at a local grocery store. When he delivers a basket of groceries, he sees a man standing in the middle of the road. The guy in the car is a serial killer. He kills the people who walk by him on the street and leaves behind a message on their car. He also makes a few other people who were passing by see him. It seems that he is only after the woman in the grocery store because she is the only one who can get him. But the delivery boy can see that this is not the case. He tries to warn the woman, but she doesn't listen. She gets out of the grocery truck, goes to the grocery bag, puts the groceries inside and drives off. But as she is leaving, she sees the man in the windshield of the car, and she drives off again. This goes on for a while until the police finally catch up to the guy and catch him and bring him to the police station. But then, the guy starts to get up and leave. The police try to stop him and chase him down. The cops are a little bit out of their league. So he is shot and killed by the police. When the police try catching the guy again, he jumps out of a truck and runs off. The man who was watching him the whole time is very upset and angry. He gets his shotgun and he kills the cop and the guy who killed him. He runs off to the next town. He then gets caught by the cops again. The next time he is caught, he is in the store and he starts to rob the store. He takes a bunch of groceries and leaves them on the shelves. When one of the customers sees the guy running off, he starts running to the store to get the stuff. But he sees the cops and he runs off too. The cop then catches up with the guy. He finds him in the police car and the cop is about ready to shoot the guy when the guy jumps out and starts running again. But now the cop sees the bag of groceries in the guy's hand and he is about about ready shoot him when he sees that the guy in his car is trying to kill the cop who is chasing him. The policeman then shoots the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is very simple, it tells about a poor boy who has to stay home and his sister. The first part of the movie is just a story about the poor boy and his family. It's not a very complex story and is very short. The rest of the story is about the sister and her father and how the mother is always working hard to make a good life for her and the rest of her family. The sister is a very nice girl, she has a nice personality and is an intelligent girl. The father is also a very kind person. I don't think there is a single bad part about the movie, it's just a very short movie. It could have been more, but it's not too long.  I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 stars:  Overall:    I have watched a lot of bad movies but this one is the best. I'm not sure if it's because it's a story, but I have never seen a better movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You are a doctor who is the head of a hospital. You need to find a way to stop the evil doctor who has infected the hospital. The doctor is a very evil person who has created a virus that has infected a lot of people in the hospital including you. The virus is very strong and it makes people go crazy and it's also very contagious. After a while you are infected as well and you try to find the cure to save everyone but it's not easy to do.  The story is great and the movie has a great pace. It's a good story about a doctor that must find a cure to stop this evil doctor. There is a lot to see in this movie and the music is very good too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a bad movie.  I'm not saying it's a good one either.    I mean, it's not bad, and it's certainly not bad enough to make the list.   However, it is a pretty good movie, in spite of its flaws.  I was looking forward to this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a fairly well-written movie with an engaging plot.  The acting is pretty good.  I don't think it's ever been made that good.   It's not hard to imagine why so many people love it.  They're just having a lot of fun.  But, I think it might be a little too hard for some people.  There are a few scenes in the movie that are just a bit too much.  These scenes are definitely worth the price of admission alone, but if you have a little trouble understanding them, then the movie will not be worth your time.  If you can accept the occasional scenes that are a little difficult to understand, then this is a good enough movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ This is a good comedy, but the only thing it's really good at is having a plot. It's basically a long-ass episode of a TV show about a bunch of characters who are really bad-ass. They're all really likable, and are all at least a little funny, but they don't have much of a plot, and they never do. There's an episode where a character is so bad-assed that it's not even funny anymore, and another where they try to figure out a way to make a big explosion happen without actually making an explosion happen, and then there's one where a guy gets kicked in the face and he dies a few seconds later. This movie is just about the characters, so it doesn't really get a lot of good stuff going on. It has some pretty good performances, and there's a good amount of action, and a decent amount of slapstick, but it's never very memorable, and it doesn the most interesting jokes when the plot doesn't require it. __________ Did I like this movie? ______________ Yes. It is a really good movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes funny movies. __________________ Previous movie review: ____________________ The movie is really good. It does the most original things with its characters, and the plot is kind of convoluted, but I still don't know why they didn't just just stick with the same characters over and over. I also don't think that they had a very good idea about what they were trying to do, which is a shame because I really liked their chemistry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie, with an interesting story and a really cool opening scene. The movie is set in the 1920s, and is told in the first person by a man who is a "tour guide" in the movie. This man is the only character in the film who isn't a drunk, and who has a sense of humor. I'm not sure how this was possible, but it works. He tells us about the movie and its characters, and how he came to be a tour guide. He gets the opportunity to take us into the movie's setting, and we see the scenes that have been shot in that location. This is where we meet the rest of the characters. It's interesting that they all have a unique look. I really like the movie, and I'd love to see this on the big screen at a theater near me.

He is very powerful but not a god like Superman. He wants to help people but he is a little too much of a man for this job. It also has the same kind of humor that you would expect from the comic books. I enjoyed it.

I'm glad that I went to see it, I think it's a pretty nice movie to look at and I think a lot of people will like it. The only negative thing I can say is that it would have been better if it was a little longer. I would like to see more of the characters from the original.

The good part is that the characters are all different and the way they all interact with each other is wonderful. The bad part is how it all plays out. The ending is very disappointing. It is very hard to watch because of the ending. But you should still see this movie. It will blow your mind. I loved it so much I would have loved to be in the room to see it. This movie will make you go to the movies. It won't be for everyone. It's not for everyone either. It does have a great ending though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just wanted to point out that this movie has a wonderful soundtrack. The movie is not a masterpiece, but it is a very interesting movie. It is a real science fiction movie that will give you a great sense of sci-fi. The plot is very complicated and a very good film, but the story doesn't really progress and there is no payoff, I mean we see it all. So if you are not into sci-fis, I suggest you skip this movie and just watch the first "Star Trek" or "The Fly" movie.

It's funny, and there are some pretty good scenes. This is a great movie, it has all the ingredients to become a classic. If you are looking for something funny, but fast-moving and exciting, then you'll enjoy this one. I give this one a 6.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple of years ago I was in my late 20's and I was really into action movies. One in particular was a pretty good movie. The title of the movie was The Raid: Redemption.   It was set in an alternate-reality Thailand that had been occupied by the United States since 1946. It had been a long time since the last American soldiers had left Thailand.    This movie told the story of a band of mercenaries who had been hired by the Americans to take out the leaders of the terrorist group, the Red Army Faction (RAF).   There were a couple of major characters in this movie, one of which was a Japanese American woman.  I was interested in this because of her background and because of the fact that her husband was a Marine, and he was a veteran.  The character of Rangda (aka Rangta), the female lead, had a lot of heart.  She was a very complex character, but she had a strong will and she was strong in battle.  Rangma was an expert in martial arts and she knew how to handle a gun.  In the film she is an expert marksman and a capable fighter.  In the movie, Rangka is an elite sniper and a member of the elite special forces unit, the Raid Force. She is very skilled at killing her enemies in close combat, but also at long range.  When the Americans found out that the terrorists had kidnapped a famous Thai fighter and were threatening to kill him if they didn't get paid, they hired a small group of highly trained and extremely lethal mercenaries to rescue the fighter. They hired the Raid Group to take them out and they had to take a lot out of the fighter in order to do it.  This is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun and engaging movie. The movie has a great feel to it. There is also a nice soundtrack and a great cast of characters.   The plot is a simple one.

He succeeds but they are not impressed. The other brother wants to run for the school board. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Knew Too Much  is a good, good, old-fashioned mystery/thriller with lots of twists and turns and a good supporting cast. It is about a young man, the son of a prominent businessman (Edmond O'Brien), who gets hired by the head of a bank to help investigate the theft of some money that was missing from the vault. It was a simple story, but a great one, and it's a good one to watch.  The movie starts out slow and there is a lot of confusion in the beginning, but the movie quickly moves along, and the twists and the turns are so well executed that the movie never gets boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was the most wonderful moment for me in a very long time. It was a very well thought-out movie. I'm still in awe of what a brilliant mind Stephen King is. His books have been such a part of my life for so many years now. The film was not perfect, but it was very well put together. I'd say it was better than a good book, because it had a lot more action and I loved it. I don't think it's a perfect film, but I still consider it a very good film. I still have nightmares about it every night. I wish I could've been there with my friend. It just seemed like the perfect movie at the time.   - - - -   ...the first of two movies in the "Carrie" series.   the first movie in the series, released in 1976, was the first in a series that became known as "The Dark Tower". The second movie, released a year later, is titled "The Drawing of the Three". The books follow the adventures of a trio of boys named Jake Chambers (Robert Forster), Eddie Dean (Takeshi Kitano) and Jake Chambers' best friend Roland Deschain (Idris Elba). Jake is also the only person who knows that his best friend, Roland Deschains, is the one who destroyed a tower that contained all the other tower's inhabitants and killed the one person who could have stopped the tower's destruction - a man named Walter Padick (Tom Taylor). Jake and his friends are searching for the boy that killed Walter Padicka and Jake discovers a drawing that may be the key to finding him.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I don't think that I need to say anything else about this movie. It's a beautiful, moving film that captures all the sadness and beauty of the American frontier and its aftermath. The characters are well-drawn, and the way that they interact with each other and the land is wonderful. I don´t think that this movie is a classic. I think that the film would have been a lot better if it was about a couple of the young actors and a single cow. And if you can't get enough of the cows, you can go to the movie theatre next to a church. It is very hard to find good movies, but this one is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie that is worth seeing.  The acting is good, especially by David Hasselhoff as the star.    The story is interesting and it keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.  I'm glad that the movie was made in 1995.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two reasons why I think that this movie is the best ever made.   The first is that it is a classic and is the last film I ever saw that was so beautiful that I wanted to stand up and sing it.  The other reason is that there is an interesting story and some good actors.  This film is a very good film and if you like the kind of movies that feature a lot of beautiful scenery and very little dialogue you will like it. This is a movie that makes you want to watch the whole thing again because it is so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was blown away by this movie.  This is a fantastic example of a "modern" horror story in which the monster is as frightening as the human victims.  What really struck me was how the actors had to be very convincing to make this believable.   The story is simple and there are some scary scenes that make it more interesting.  If you have any interest in classic horror, this movie is worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts with a flashback, which we see in reverse (as in, the past is showing us the present). We see the story of the film from the perspective of an old woman who has been living alone for a long time. She is now married and has a young son. She has had a little son for some time and has been having an affair with a younger man, who she met while she was living alone.  The young man, whom she is married to, finds out about this affair and begins to pursue her. He is married and her son is now the most important thing to him. The young woman, who has only lived alone for two or three years, is now very lonely and very lonely.  Her son is quite spoiled, and it is difficult for her to get any enjoyment out of her son. The father (played by Richard Burton) also has an affair and tries to get his wife to sleep with him. She resists at first, but then begins to enjoy it.  The father is a nice man, and the young woman is a pleasant and sweet woman.  After a while, however, it is clear that the affair is going nowhere.  It is also clear that there is something seriously wrong with the man (I think it is a case of "cured disease" - perhaps from a bad case of syphilis?).  The wife is also suffering, and she is a great disappointment to her husband.  As the film goes on, it becomes clear that she is suffering from the same disease, and that it is very hard to find someone to love her.  However, it seems that the problem is not that serious, and in fact, it may be a good thing.  Eventually, the wife falls asleep, and her husband wakes up to find that she has gone to sleep.  This is where the film becomes a little confusing, as she has been sleeping with a man who is a few years older than she is.  What is it about the older man that is so much more attractive than the young man?  The film is confusing, but the film is beautiful, and at the end of the story, we are left to wonder whether there really is a cure for the disease.    The woman is shown sleeping, and we can only guess what the man is doing to her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very entertaining, humorous, and exciting film about a bunch of high school students who have just lost a bet on a horse race and have to spend the night at a local bowling alley to celebrate their win.  The film starts out with a lot of silliness, like the kids sitting on a park bench in a movie theater watching a movie about a guy who plays a movie critic on television.        As the bowling alley patrons leave, one of the boys notices that he has forgotten his bowling shoes, so he has to resort to a desperate search for a pair, while his friends enjoy the show.  By the end of the film, the boys have realized that there is a problem with the bowling-alley and they decide to go back to their old haunt, the bowling green.  There they find a beautiful girl, who they take home and later find out that she is actually the one who has lost the bet.  However, there is more to the story than meets the eye and the girls intentions are far from pure.  The film ends with a bang. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think the movie is pretty good. I like the plot, but I don't like the characters. I feel that there are some characters who are just as interesting as the main ones, but there are also some characters that I don´t like. Some of the characters seem to be more important than the others, and I don`t think they deserve that much attention. There are a lot of scenes where the film doesn`t look like it is going to be a good film, and yet it ends up being a good one. The music and the editing are very good.

I loved the story about the young guy who is having his birthday party and there is a group of kids who want to go to the movie theater and the townspeople are in a huff about them going out and they can't believe the little kids are so brave to go out and watch a movie. So they all head over to the theater and it is amazing. The little kid in particular is a lot of fun to watch. This movie is so short and the ending is perfect and makes the whole movie worthwhile.  I also loved the fact that there is only one girl in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a shot of a large, black, square, dome-shaped, glassy-eyed, white-haired man with a beard who is dressed as a mannequin. He is standing in a large circular chamber with several huge cylindrical objects, each one larger than the last. They are all empty. The mannequins, however, are alive and they are moving, one after another, across the room, each with their eyes open. When the last one is about to fall, he is stopped by a man who, in a white suit, is wearing a black tie. The suit is an odd color, like a pale, dull brown. There is a black-and-white photo of the mannequer sitting at the same place in the room with a man with black-white hair and white-grey skin. He wears an old-fashioned fedora, a wide brim, and black boots. When he comes close to the man-nequineer, the man with the black tie takes off his hat. The film then goes into a strange sequence, which I cannot repeat here. In it, there are a series of shots of the men sitting at various places around the circular chamber. They have all the faces of men with white hair, except the last man who has a black face. Then, there is a strange and very long sequence, in which the black-faced man has no face to speak of, except for his black eyes. At one point, he walks down a dark hallway, which turns out to be an underground cavern, where, in the distance, there appear to be many, many, black-cloaked figures, which are obviously a sort of a vision. This film is about a man named Charles Foster, who is in the habit of coming down from his house in the mountains, in order to visit his sister, who lives in a village called Mabie. She has a little cottage, and a garden in the back. It is there that she takes care of her dog, a dog which is really very large, about twenty pounds, but which does not eat much. She lives on the outskirts of town, and, as a result, it is impossible to go into town by road. The only way to get to her house is to fly down to the valley and fly down a steep mountain. She is a very old lady, and the first time she comes down to M
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It is all about the relationship between the husband and the wife and how they deal with the husband who is having an affair with his secretary." This is a really good movie. I like the story line about the wife who has been widowed and is having to deal with her husband who seems to be having an extramarital affair. It is not a romantic movie so it's not really "sexy" but it is not about the sex either. It's about the relationships between the characters. It has a strong plot, the relationships are very strong, the music is very good and it is a good action movie. It doesn't have a lot of nudity or sex but it's about a strong relationship. This movie is very well acted and it has some great music. I give it 4 stars because I like it but I wouldn't say it is an "adult" movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Stand"  is a gritty war movie set in the post-WWII, near-future, USA.  It is about a small town that is attacked by the alien "Zion" and its leader, a genetically engineered "Mantis".  The town is destroyed by the Zion's attack.  "The film is set in a small farming community in central California, where the Mantis has infiltrated the local military base, and begun to turn it into a new headquarters for his alien forces."  This is the "final" war in this war-like era.   There is not a single ray of hope in sight.    The townsfolk are slowly, almost painfully, being destroyed by their own government.       After a small victory, the Manti-Zion has already launched its final offensive, and it seems that there will be no end to this bloody conflict.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very impressed with this movie. I was always curious about it because it was filmed in Canada in the mid-80's. It's a crime drama about a serial killer in a mental institution and his psychiatrist. This film is so much fun! It's really not scary at all. I don't even think the killer is a monster. It just makes him seem like an ordinary person. The movie is about a man who is being watched all the time. It seems to be a part of his own life and he is very uncomfortable. It also seems that he is being followed by a man in a car. When he is alone he is watching TV and the TV shows a lot about serial killers. I have to admit I wasn't as interested in this movie as I was in the other two. The first one was my favorite because it had a great twist ending. I also enjoyed it because the killer was just a person and his motive was so vague that it was hard to figure out. The second one was better because it got more into the psychological aspects of the serial killer and it also got more psychological and more interesting. This movie isn't for everyone, but it is definitely worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good thriller that is not too complicated.  The movie is about a college student named David who has a girlfriend named Sarah (who has a brother who has cancer) and their relationship is not all that great, but that is why they stay together and don't let life get in the way of a good time.    David does a lot of stuff that is really funny and fun to watch.  His roommate, a fellow student named Matt (also played by the same actor as David) is very annoying.  He is a huge nerd who wants to be the next star athlete.  There are also other college students in the movie and they are all different types of people and they all seem like they are having a goodtime but they are not.  The best part of the movie is the ending where David and Sarah are in a car on the way to a movie and he looks up and it is like the sun is setting and they have a goodnight kiss.  This movie is good fun and if you like funny movies then you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last night, I saw a movie which I thought was rather good, a good combination of comedy and drama. The cast, including the excellent Jim Caviezel as the head of a small town newspaper, is quite good, although I am a bit confused as to why he is being fired (I think the only reason he is fired is that he is an alcoholic). The story is very well told. It is not a typical "happy ending" story, as in most other movies about a couple who have been together for years, and then decide to get married, and so they move to a beautiful home. It has a rather romantic feel about it. The plot twists and turns are not overbearing. There are a couple of scenes which are a bit much, and at times it seems like a bit of a drag. The only thing which bothers me about the movie is that the wife (played by Julie Walters) and her friends (played, I think, by Jane Fonda and Richard Dreyfuss) seem to constantly be giving their opinions on the couple, and that is a bit odd, as the movie, for me, was quite sweet and a bit romantic, although it does have some dark and depressing moments.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A Good Day to Die Hard" is the most ridiculous of all the Die Hard movies and yet I really enjoyed it.   I think the movie works well on two levels: firstly it is a parody of Die Hard but in a funny and unique way.  The movie is also a good parody of action movies but it is far less ridiculous than the one in the other Die Hard.  It is funny, action-packed and in general a very enjoyable movie.  I can see why this movie has such a strong fan following.

I don't remember exactly why I didn't like this movie, but it's probably because of the cast, who in a way are one person.  A few people get the girl, and one person is really a bad guy, and all the rest are just annoying.  There are plenty of scenes like this in the other movies that are pretty much just like this, and this one is about an extra in a play that goes too far.

So I'm not sure what I'm going to say next, except that I'm glad that I saw it. It's a decent film, which was more interesting than I expected. I was disappointed that it didn't take place in a real place, but it wasn't a bad film by any means. There was a lot going on, and it was exciting, so if you like action, you'll like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a couple of scenes that are pretty interesting, and are followed by a very good movie. It's a good example of how the American action movies were in the 60's and 70's. The movie is good, the movie is funny, it's very entertaining and exciting, and it's pretty entertaining, I enjoyed the movie a lot. I think that I liked it a lot more than I did the last time I saw it, and that's why I gave it a second chance, and I'm glad I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man gets a girlfriend from a "hippie" commune and he takes her to a dance club where she meets a guy who wants to get a girl to his place for a date.       The movie was funny. I laughed at a few times.  I think that the movie was directed by a man who was trying to make a film that was more entertaining than serious.  The first dance scene in the movie is hilarious.  It was funny because he was dancing and there were a few laughs.  But after that the dancing went out the window and they just talked about how much they loved each other.  I thought it was a funny movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Rocketeer " is a pretty good movie.  It's got a lot of heart, and it's got an ending that I really liked.    The Rocker is a veteran, and his wife was killed in the line of duty.  She was the first lady to die in the Air Force.  The military tries to keep their memories alive by putting a new face on a retired face, but he's not a happy man.  He and his buddy are trying to find a way to get out of the military, but they're having trouble finding a plane that will take them out of their town.  They've been hired to go to a new military base on the Moon.  It's a new, more advanced military base, and they don't want the old, rusting equipment there.  So they're hired to get a new piece of technology to replace the old equipment.  But they're not allowed to go there. They can't even take a small plane there. The pilot and a friend, are being forced to fly to the Moon by the military.  And they're being forced on the most dangerous mission of their lives.  This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again, and I will see it in a theater in a different city.  "
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Samurai" (1954) is a war movie and a romance movie, it is both of these things at the same time.  The movie is set in the year 1854 during the Meiji restoration of Japan.  The movie was filmed in Hawaii, in the late 40s.   The main characters, Iko (played by Marlon Brando) and Saito (played in this movie by John Carradine) are both young and idealistic and very, very beautiful.  In their adventures, Ikeda (played on the big screen by Jack Palance) and his friend Kami (played John Gilbert) find themselves in the middle of a war between the samurai of Japan and the Japanese army.  The film begins with a short scene showing the destruction of a city.  This destruction is an ominous sign that this is no ordinary war.  As the film continues, the conflict between the two armies continues.  After an army of soldiers are wiped out, a young samurai named Iked avenge the death of his parents and his home.  While Iked is away in battle, Kami has been captured by the Japanese soldiers.  Iked takes a group of his friends and a small army of women to fight back against the Japanese.  Kami is a very pretty woman and a brilliant strategist.  She and her warriors are given a great deal of screen time.   The story is very good, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good romantic adventure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Black Dahlia" is a classic movie that should be a staple in every horror fan's library. I love how the film's title is used to create tension, but also to show how different the victims are. Each is completely different in looks and in personality. The most striking difference is that each one is not a normal person. They are all monsters, but their personalities are different. This is not to say that these are all bad people; many of them are good people. But the most interesting character is the killer. The killer is not the typical evil person that most people think they are. He has an ego. He is very powerful, but he has a conscience. He does not kill for the fun of it. It is for a very specific reason. The Black Dahlias are evil, and they are coming for revenge. But they are not really coming for vengeance. The reason they are on the kill list is because they have been taken down by the FBI. The film shows the Bureau trying to solve this case. They go to a motel and look for a suspect. They see that a man in a bathrobe is in a room. The man is in the bathrobe and looks like the killer, but there is no one in the room. It takes them a long time to find the man and figure out who the killer is. He can't be found because he's a killer! He is in his room, and he can't get out! The man has been there a long, long time. He will be dead in three days, and the FBI is going to have a hard time finding him. The movie ends on a cliffhanger. There is a big twist that will keep you guessing the next day. This movie is a great movie. The acting is amazing, and there are so many cool, unique characters in the film. I highly recommend this movie. It will keep your attention for the rest of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at the cinema with my family when the first trailer of Star Wars came up and I was blown away. The idea of the prequel trilogy had been a dream of mine since the first time I saw it on television, so it was great to finally see the first films in a cinema with all of my favourite characters. I was so happy to see that Luke and Leia are the same age as in the movies and Han and Chewie are also still alive. I really loved the scenes with Lando and C-3PO. And of course the Empire is back.   The new Star Wars trilogy is so much better than the old one, and the music is amazing.  I am not sure why I haven't seen this before but I can not wait to see the next two films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good one.  I mean, it's really a good action movie, it has a really good villain, and I think it's good that it doesn't have too many plot holes, which is a bit surprising considering how long the film has been in the can.    It's a very interesting take on the Batman character, and it shows how much Batman is in his head.     
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â This is a good, but not very funny movie, and it does get a bit preachy at times. It's just a movie about a man who is having a rough time at work and gets fired from his job for no reason. But then a good friend of his shows up and helps him find a new job. The movie is very silly, but it does have some great lines and jokes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is a wonderfully atmospheric and frighteningly beautiful film about a little girl (Jodie Foster) who lives alone in a house that looks like it was plucked out of a nightmare. She is a little creature, the only other creature in her world being a giant, mutated rat. She spends her time in the dark, day and night, as she can only find a small light at the end of a long tunnel, and that light is the light at her door. Her parents are dead, and her brother has moved out, and she lives with her little sister. The film is set in the 1950's, and is a classic of horror and science fiction, and a very creepy movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an extremely well done movie.  I was very impressed with the quality of this movie and I have never seen a film as good as this one.  It is a true science fiction film and that is what is so amazing about it.  They get the science correct and it is done in a very interesting and entertaining way.  You have to wonder why this movie has never been made.  If you are a fan of the science fiction genre you need to see this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't remember this being a good film but it has a lot of good stuff in it. It is an old western movie with a modern twist, and a story that I am sure was a bit of a shocker for people. I remember watching it as a kid and being shocked at the violence in the movie. Now I'm much older and not as shocked. The movie has a good cast, a good story, a cool title and a good soundtrack. It may not be a classic, but it is a great movie, and if you love westerns and are looking for a good one, you should check it out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good action movie with a good story.  This is a classic in my opinion.    You get an interesting action film that features a lot of fun stunts and good character development.  The movie takes place in a small village in France.    The village is the setting for the action.  It is a quiet, sleepy village.  This is a small community that is under threat of the evil, but wise, Blackwolf.  The village leader is Jean.  Jean has a son named David.  David is the only child in the village. Jean is a tough man who has fought many enemies, but he doesn't let the Blackwolf's evil get the better of him.  One day, a mysterious man, who may be the Black Wolf himself, arrives in the small village.  The man is dressed like a hunter.  He carries a long bow and arrows.  In this movie, the action is a lot like the movie The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  It starts off with David's father coming home from work and discovering the man at the house.  When the man sees the son he asks the son what he is doing at his house.   The son responds, "I'm going to kill the BlackWolf".   The man asks the boy, "How do you want me to do that?" The boy responds, "...by taking him out of this world!"   I loved this movie.  I really liked the characters in this movie and their chemistry was great.  With the help of a nice soundtrack, the movie got me excited to see the Black Wolves in a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a big fan of science fiction movies, but I can say that this one was well-made, well-written and well-acted, but not very exciting.  That's a hard thing to do.  It's a long time since I saw an alien movie with any substance, but this one does a fine job of giving us an interesting and fun sci-fi premise.   The action is not very good and there's not much dialogue.  But the alien is the star of the show, and is given a very well-developed personality.  I'd say that if the plot is to be believed, we should expect a lot more of these kinds of films in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Killed Kennedy" is a movie about a movie, a movie which should be the most influential American movie ever made. It's about the assassination of the president of the United States of America, a man who could not even be elected president because of the anti-Semitism of his opponents. It is about the hatred of his supporters, the hatred which has never ceased in the United states, a hatred which was only just recently brought to a head by a few very ugly events. But it is not only about this hatred, it is about a society which has not understood the meaning of the term "liberal" or "progressive" and which has forgotten about the values of the founding fathers. The film is about those who hate him and about the movie. It has been made, however, for the entertainment of Americans, and that is the way the film is to be understood, but not for those who would understand it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first of a trilogy of movies from director Peter Jackson and the scriptwriter, Guillermo Del Toro. This is the first in a trilogy and the movie doesn't really have a set end point. It starts off with the story of the hero of the film, an evil magician who has created a fantasy world, a castle and a city. This world is full of monsters and goblins and these monsters are called The Black Dogs. They live in the forest of the city and are known for their evilness. The movie has some beautiful imagery. It is a movie for adults and kids alike. It will probably appeal to a wide audience, because it is a very good story and because it has a good pace.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a long-time horror fan, I had high hopes for this film. It's not perfect. There are a few plot holes in the story, and I found it hard to get through the first half. The second half, however, is quite a good thriller. It really has a nice feel to it. It does make you think, but you don't feel like the movie is going to be over any time soon. It is a good and unique movie, and you should give it a look.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title says, a nice movie about a nice person who is trying to find a nice family. It's a story about a guy who wants to go to an all girls' school and who is not interested in dating. He meets a girl at a party who is interested in him and who he starts to like. The girl and his brother move in with them and soon they have a very good relationship. This movie is about a man who is having a hard time finding a nice woman and a girl who is always wanting a nice man. They find themselves becoming very close friends.   The film is directed by Rian Johnson who was the director of Brick and The Brothers Bloom.  It is a great film with some really nice acting by all the actors and with a great story line. It is not a great movie, but it is good and not that bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a very bad dream last night, and I am still very disturbed by it.  It was about a group of college kids in the '80s who get stranded on a small island and have to find their way back to civilization.    I don't want to give away any of the plot twists, but I will say that it did not go anywhere good.  There was a whole lot of screaming and a couple of really awful acting moments, and a pretty good song (I don't think the narrator really knows the words to it).   A great movie with some great music and a great soundtrack.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a bit funny how many of the reviews mention how this movie is a remake of the movie "The Muppet Movie", but there is a few things that are completely different. For starters, it is not a remake, but a very faithful adaptation of the original. This is a movie with some great action scenes, great songs, great special effects, and a very interesting story. It is not the most original movie, but it is the best Muppet movie.         I liked this movie, and I hope you will like it too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very faithful to the source material (which is a good thing) and is actually a lot of fun. It is hard to describe a character like that, but the fact that it is a man who has been turned into a girl by a curse is very entertaining. The film does not feel that long, and I have seen other films with similar ideas. It does not take itself seriously, and there is something very charming about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that a film called "The House" was in production, I was very excited to see what they were planning to do with the premise.  In a nutshell, a house is being possessed by a spirit from hell.    It is the spirit of a girl who died and has been raised as a housemaid.  The house is a house of horrors and has an evil spirit living in it.  I had the good fortune to be able to attend a preview screening.  As a child, I had a soft spot for horror movies, so I was excited to be a part of this movie.  "The House":  The house is in disarray.  There is a ghost in the house and it has been given a new body by the house's former owner.  It does not seem to be very happy about its new body, and it doesn't even like the house.  When the ghost first moves into the house, the owner's wife and daughter are out doing errands.  They go to a bar and get into a fight.  She tells her daughter to get the hell out of the house because it is evil.  This doesn't seem to make the ghost very happy.  Then the owner is murdered by a robber.  That doesn't make the spirit any happier.  Finally the house is taken over by a killer, a serial killer, called the Butcher.  He is an elderly man who has lived there his entire life.  What starts out as a serial murder and a robbery ends up as a bloody battle for the house as he goes from room to room killing all the inhabitants.  Some of the residents include the housewife, the housemaid, the butcher, and the servant who is trying to get revenge.  In the end, the killer kills all of the inhabitants, including the house maid.  Unfortunately, a few of the characters are killed off before the end.  At one point in the film, the Butcher is in a room and his ghost is standing there.  For a few moments, I thought he was going to appear out of nowhere, but he didn't.  My favorite character of the film is the housekeeper, played by Linda Blair.  A pretty decent actress, she is the type of woman who will take no nonsense.  Although she is not very bright, she knows her way around the house in an entertaining manner.  Another good actor in the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you have a classic movie with a strong plot, a well developed cast, and an awesome soundtrack you have something special.  The story follows a guy named James, who works at a restaurant in the city.    He's a nice guy and always has a smile on his face.  It's the night of the restaurant's big Christmas party and James has a bad case of nerves.  The other employees are busy preparing for the event and James is left alone.  His nerves start to build and then he is forced to leave.  When he goes outside, he sees a woman walking alone.   She stops in the middle of the street and is talking to a man.  She tells him that she's been lonely and doesn't want to be in a restaurant alone. The man introduces himself as Peter who claims he has a friend that will take her to a good place.  James says that he can take her there but the restaurant won't let him because it's a private party.  He then tells her that if she's okay with him, they can go together.  Once James has the address, Peter takes the girl back to the restaurant.  As the two make their way into the restaurant, the waiters start to laugh at Peter.  Peter tries to convince them that they shouldn't be laughing but it's no use.  They're so busy laughing at Peter that they miss the real reason for their laughter.  The two finally find their way to the party.   James is in the restaurant when Peter knocks on the door.  This causes Peter to freak out.  While he's still in shock, James is looking around.  Eventually Peter opens the door and they're both left alone in the room.  Soon after, the other guests start to arrive.  After they all have their meal and drinks, James gets up to leave but Peter is still talking to her.  Now James realizes what's going on.  Even though he's a good guy, Peter's not telling her the truth.  There's a woman who wants to come to the Christmas party but she can't because she's afraid of the crowds.  That's when James has to make a choice.  Does he go along with Peter or is he going to tell the woman the truth?  He makes his decision and tells the woman what he saw.  Her reaction is to yell at James for not telling the truth and threatens to kill

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know if you've seen it or not but I thought it was a really good movie.  In it a small town gets involved in a crime that the local sheriff is unaware of, and the only one who knows is a man who is in a secret life with the mayor.  The movie is not very well acted.  It's about a couple of town people that are on the wrong side of a lot of people and things, and one of the guys is a former lawman who has been out of the game for a long time, but has always kept himself in the background.  And a couple guys who seem to be in it just to get a job.  A couple of other characters are there just to be there, but the town doesn't really seem to have a lot to do with them.  In the end the two big baddies are in the hands of a little boy, but he is not a little child.  There are a lot more things that happened in this movie that the movie didn't really get into, but that's a whole different movie.

When he comes out of his coma, he goes to a hospital and the doctors tell him that he is in a permanent coma.     This movie is one of those "you have to see it to believe it" type of movies.  The story is about a boy who loves his sister.  He has a problem that his sister is not having a boy like he wants.  But his sister can't have a boy because she is pregnant.  So they must find a boy to love.  They have to find a perfect boy who is as perfect as their sister. They do find a good boy.  This boy is called the "perfect" boy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an extremely entertaining movie with some excellent performances by all the actors. I was very impressed with the script, and with the direction. The cinematography by the late, great John Huston was superb, and the music by the legendary Phil Ochs was wonderful, even though it was sung by an American singer.  I also thought the characters were very well done. I have seen many movies and I have never seen a more realistic and believable portrayal of the Vietnam War. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a young boy named Riff Raff who is a bad-ass gangster who lives in a neighborhood of bad-asses and thugs. Riff was born into the bad-dest crew in town and is a street-smashing badass who makes the streets of Compton seem like a Disney movie with his badassness. RIFF Raff is a man that is always in the right place at the right time. He is the best of the bad, and his crew are always there to keep him from getting beat up. They are all very smart and skilled and will never let Riff get hurt. Riffs is very close to being a legend in the eyes of his crew. The rest of the gang is a little less cool than Riff, but they're all really good guys that would never go near Riff.   This is a fun movie with some cool characters. The only complaint I have is that it has some problems with the pacing and some of the dialogue. Some scenes feel a little rushed and are not very well-paced. But the gangsters are all super cool and the movie is just a great time. The soundtrack is a pretty cool soundtrack as well. I have heard some really cool stuff on the soundtrack.   the only thing I would change about this movie is the way that it ends. The gangsters were really cool and I really wanted to see them get their comeuppance. But they just let Riffs get away with a few beatings. I would have liked to see him get the baddest of the beatings, but he got off easy. But then it would have been over. It is a cool movie and I recommend it to anyone who is into gangster movies. It really does have it all and is definitely worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a few good movies in my day.   This one was good.  And it was made by a man who made a few other good movies.  He had an amazing way of capturing the essence of the film:  a great sense of the absurdity of it all;  a way of showing the power of love, and the joy it can bring;  the beauty of a family, and their efforts to make a good life.  This film had all these things and then some, and it was very good. I recommend it to all who want a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a little surprised to see this movie on the big screen after all I've heard of it. It was a well written movie, and it does a great job of showing the effects of radiation on people. This is a good example of how the film is actually about the aftermath of the atomic bomb. The movie has a few of the usual over the top effects and the whole thing feels like a cartoon. If you are looking for a movie that tells the stories of the people that survived the bomb, and those that lost their loved ones, then this is a great movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** The only reason to see this movie is to see the acting of the young and talented Gary Busey. I know I'm not the only one that thinks that Gary Busesy has a gift for the acting and it is evident in this movie. I've always enjoyed his films but never had the pleasure of seeing him in a lead role. If you enjoy the classic western films then you'll like this one. If your not into the classic movies this one won't do anything for you. ********************** ************* ********* I thought this was a good flick to watch in the summer of 1966. I was 13 when I watched it and it was the first time I'd seen anything other than a Saturday Night at the Movies. The film has a bit of a different feel to it. This is a movie for the people who like a good western. There is a lot of humor and good acting and a good plot. ******** ******** I would have loved to see Gary Buns live in a band but alas he was only able to get a job as a roadie.    A great film from 1966!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gothika" is an unusual movie, even by Russian film standards. It is not a Russian film, at least in its most basic, recognizable form. There are a few recognizable elements (a black man in a white suit, a black cat, a few white faces, etc.) but this is not the film's story. The story of the film is about a woman who is raped and murdered by a man she had been seeing for a few weeks. The film begins with her being kidnapped and raped by a group of thugs. There is an interesting and suspenseful scene where she is forced to watch as her rapist rapes her and then has sex with her. This scene is really disturbing and is something that would be shocking even if the rape scene was just in a movie. The rapist in the film also has a dog that comes to life and does a lot of bad things to the woman, including chasing her around and biting her and even chewing off her ear. At the end of the rape, the dog is beaten and is killed. It would be funny if the film was not so disturbing. This film is just about as violent as it can be without being outright pornographic. This is a very violent film and is very disturbing. It has some pretty good acting from the young actors (one of whom also appears in a very good British film), but there is very little variety in the acting and the direction is very simplistic.  The film was released in 1970.  The film is not really a very interesting film in the way that the original version was, which is to say it is a rather dull film about a very boring subject.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is the story of a man who was given a magic wand to make himself invisible. He does this until he meets the mysterious woman who can make him invisible for only one night. The girl is not only beautiful but she also has a strange ability to make a man invisible. She does this by changing the colour of her clothes. She is an artist, who does not really care about anything but the love of her life. She uses this power to seduce her man and to get him to change from invisible to visible.  There are a lot of sex scenes in this film but they are never overly graphic and never too much of a bother. The sex scenes are quite erotic. I felt the sex scenes were well done as they were both sensual and romantic. I did not feel that there was a lack of anything in this movie. It was just well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the early years of the 20th century, there was an attempt to unite all the races under one flag, in order to combat the spread of the "Reds" in the west. This was the result of a series of treaties signed between the U.S. and Mexico in the late 1800s. The treaties were never ratified, however, as the U S. did not recognize them. Thus, there were two competing factions of Americans, one that wanted to remain united and the other that wanted separation.  One of the two was led by George "Fighting George" Wallace.    The other was led in large part by Jesse James, a.k.a. "The Devil of Olustee".   This movie is one of the few that really captured the spirit of that era.  It is hard to imagine a time when people were so proud of their American heritage.  In fact, the film is about a small town, where the majority of the population are Americans of Mexican heritage. In fact a lot of the townspeople have very similar features: they all have the same red hair and the same blue eyes, and they all speak Spanish.  This was a time where there were a lot more Mexicans living in the states than in Mexico.  They had a lot in common with Americans.  But they were still considered "the other".  One of the main characters in the movie is a native American named El Paso (played by John Wayne), who was born and raised in the town.  He is a very kind and good natured man, who tries to find a way to overcome the discrimination that has always been faced by the Mexicans living there.     But the movie has an even deeper message than that.  There is a time in history when America was united against a common enemy.  The enemies were the "yellow peril" and communism.  What united America was a common belief in the Constitution and the freedom to practice their religion.  However, when the enemies began to attack, the country split into two warring factions.  When the United States entered the Second World War, the division between the "good Americans" and the "bad Americans" was so great that it became nearly impossible to even talk to the "evil Americans".  This is the main reason why Jesse James was so determined to kill all of them.  While in Mexico, Jesse and his gang were able to escape into the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I know what a lot of people are thinking about this film.   First of all, this is not the only film that I feel has a good story.  A lot of those films that were not so great had some good stories, so this is one of those that is really good, and very well done.  This film does have the classic "evil mastermind" story line, and you can tell from the first few minutes that it will be a slow burn.  I found it a little hard to connect with the main character, and I would not recommend this for the more advanced audience.  The acting is pretty good, especially when the evil man gets to have his way with the little girl.  There is a scene at the end that is a little dark, but the story is so good that it is worth it.  If you have watched "The Godfather" or a good film like it, you should get this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good. But it's not an "A" movie.  It is not an excellent movie but it is not bad either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie.  I don't like horror movies.    They always seem like they have too much blood.  I think the best horror movies are ones that have a good plot.  If you're going to be doing anything with a bunch of old people who look like they're from the 1930's then this one is not for you.  It's an oddball movie, but it's still a good one.  The movie is about a couple of people who are looking for a way to keep from being taken to the cemetery.  They try and make a haunted house out of the old graveyard.  There are some weird moments in the movie, and they're pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie about a man who lives with his two children in the woods and a woman who finds him a way to survive the winter with them. The movie is very enjoyable with the action scenes being some of the best of the year. The story is a bit convoluted and it is hard to understand the main character's motivations at times but it is still a fun movie. The ending was pretty nice and it was nice seeing the old lady and her granddaughter as well. This movie has some good action scenes and it has a nice plot. If you are a fan of the movie then I recommend this movie to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I am the only good man in this town." That's a pretty good line from the titular character, and the film does a good job of selling that idea by showing us the various ways people in a small town can be bad. And then it turns into a comedy about the bad things a guy like Tom (Bruce Willis) can do to himself. Willis plays Tom as a guy who is good at what he does, but also very much a bit of a dick. That's the point of the film. It's about a guy trying to win back the love of his life, but not being able to do it by any means other than lying. He's also got a habit of lying about his past, which is something that happens quite often in this type of movie. And the fact that he's a bad guy who doesn't care much about people he doesn't know makes him more interesting. The film also shows us the ways people can become bad in a variety of ways. There's a woman (Carla Gugino) who loves Tom, but he just doesn't seem to be able to let her in on what's really going on with him. And there's a man who can't seem get over the fact he has no memory of his past. There are even a few people who don't really care about anything other than themselves. There aren't any scenes that make me laugh, but there are enough that it's hard to get mad about a movie that's so funny. If you like the concept of Tom, or a lot of the movies that are set in small towns, then you might find this funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Temptation of Christ  is a good story, a good film, and a good time.  It has been described as a Christian version of the Lord of the Rings.  This is very much a Christian film, but it is a very Christian film.  It is an excellent film, one that I would recommend to anyone, as it is not pretentious and does not try to be a 'fantasy'.  The acting is excellent and the screenplay is very good, although I don't think the plot makes any sense.  But the story is wonderful, and the actors really do an excellent job of portraying the characters.  There is not much of a plot.  The story is told through the eyes of Jesus, and his mother, Mary.  These are both very good actors, and their performances really bring out the best in them.  They are very likable and very believable.  Jesus is a kind and good-hearted man, and Mary is a woman who has a very strong moral code.  Their love is not all there is, but their love for each other is.  Both are very good people, and it is very easy to love them.   The acting really brings out the emotion of these two characters, and makes the movie a very special one.   The movie does not have any great music, and does have some mediocre music at times.  Unfortunately, I can't think of a single song that I enjoyed, but I think this is a film that is worth watching.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a Christian, or a person who loves stories.  What are your thoughts on The Last Tract of Christ?  The Last Testament:

So he goes to the doctor and the doctor tells him that he has to sleep a lot because his brain is very tired. So, the doctor makes him sleep in a big bed with a lot of pillows on top and he tries to sleep very soundly and very peacefully. So the man sleeps all night, and at daybreak, he awakes. The doctor tells the man to take a look around and see if anything is different. So they go to the garage and the man sees a big truck driving around very fast. He asks the man if he is going to drive, but the man says no. The man sees the big truck going up the hill, and he starts to run up it. The truck starts to overtake the man, but then the truck stops because it can't go up the mountain. Then the man turns and sees the giant head and the other people who are watching him, and the people who were watching him are also in the other big truck. The giant head turns to the man and says "Good morning", and the giant man turns around and looks at the people. He says "I have a special surprise for you". He goes to his house and takes off his shirt and puts it on his head. He then goes out into the backyard and walks around in his underwear, until he sees the other trucks. He walks to the other truck and opens the door and he goes inside. He looks around and sees people sleeping. He goes inside the truck and goes into a room and starts to eat. He starts eating and then stops because he has a lot to eat and the stomach hurts. He eats and then he starts thinking. Then he goes into another room and there is a chair and there are a lotus flowers in the chair. He sits down and starts thinking, and then it all makes sense to him and he says "That is it! I am the king of the earth. I am a great and powerful king who can change anything! I can create anything. I can go to another dimension, and I can travel in time and space." He says to the people, "If you want to be the king, then you have to help me." And then he puts his pants back on and he leaves. After that, the people start to get excited
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel  is a very nice film about a rich man (John Huston) who is visiting an exotic island to see a rich woman (Dorothy Dandridge) and his friends (Bobby De Niro, Jimmy Stewart, Marlon Brando, Peter Sellers) who are in a small boat on a beach. When they encounter a group of people they all get very excited and do a bunch of stuff, but in the end it all ends in a nice fashion. It's a little more racy than most of the other Hollywood films, and I love it, but it's still a nice, low-budget, entertaining film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a pretty good movie. It's got all the elements of a good horror movie: the characters are all well-written, the scares are well-done, and the special effects are pretty good. But I have to give it a few stars for the great performances by all the actors, and even a couple of the supporting characters.   The story takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and a guy named Henry (David Carradine) is looking for his missing brother (Tom Skerritt). When Henry arrives at the home of a neighbor (Curtis Stigers) he's met with an ominous sight: a woman in a black hood is standing outside the house. Henry is immediately drawn into the mystery when the woman (played by the excellent Susan Sarandon) introduces herself as the missing brother's widow.  She tells Henry that her husband left to search for a mysterious man, who was the one who killed their son. She also tells Henry she knows the identity of the man she believes is the culprit. Henry has only one problem with this: he doesn't believe her. After a brief argument, Henry leaves the house and heads off to the nearest store, hoping to find someone who can help him figure out what the woman is trying to tell him.  The rest of the movie is really just a good, good time.  It's fun to see a classic movie like this in 3D, and it's a blast to see an older guy like Henry get into the spirit of the Halloween holiday.  This movie isn't a very good movie, but it is a fun one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My review is of the 2004 remake of the classic John Carpenter movie, The Thing.   The Thing (in a nutshell) is about a group of explorers who come to the remote location of a mysterious creature, the Thing, which is the result of a nuclear accident.   This creature is so strange that when the crew is in their sleeping bags, it moves from their sleeping bag to their sleeping beds.  It appears to be a human in the guise of a large animal.  The expedition is attacked by a group led by a scientist, Dr. Bill Lee, and a young girl, Jennifer, who is his daughter.  There are also three soldiers who are on a different mission.  This movie has some really good special effects, including one that I'm not going to get into right now.  In the movie, the creature has a number of special abilities, such as moving at night, and using a small amount of radioactive substance to absorb the energy from the human beings.  When the crew of the ship finds the Thing's corpse, it turns out to be dead, and the body of the creature that was inside of it was the result.  I found the movie to be very entertaining and not to be taken seriously.  One of the reasons I liked it so much was the fact that it had a great score from a young Canadian singer, Chris Isaak, who also provided the music for the movie.  What I also liked about the movie was that it didn't try to make the audience believe that the Thing was actually a monster.  That was done in the original movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is an epic fantasy that is equal parts Lord of The Rings, Lord of War and Lord of Camelot. It is one of those rare movies that combines all three parts with aplomb.  The Lord Of The Rings is the heart and soul of the movie. It's a story of a warrior who has just won a battle against evil that was brought to the land by the one man who can stop it - The One Ring. This one ring is cursed and its power is so great that it was able to stop a meteor that was about to hit the earth. It also gave the Ring-bearer the power to change the shape of his sword into a flaming sword.   I was thoroughly entertained throughout this movie.  It was also an action packed film that is filled with fun and action. The movie also is very well acted.  The acting is all over the place. Some actors are great, some are not so great, but I always enjoy watching a movie with a good performance from everyone.  For example, Peter Jackson as the director.  He is the perfect combination of a genius director and an action movie director. I also enjoyed watching the actors and it was great to see the different styles of acting.  Some of the actors do a great job, and some do a terrible job, but none of them are bad at all.  Overall, this movie is an excellent film.  If you have never seen it, this is definitely a movie that you should see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the last part of the film, we find a new character in the form of a young man named Nick, who lives with his parents and younger sister, Lillian, in a large house in the middle of the forest. As we know, Nick is an excellent basketball player, and one day, while playing, he comes across a very attractive girl in the forest, named Annie, who he later finds out is a witch. The film does a great job of introducing Nick, and also the fact that the forest is very eerie, and that the girls there are all evil, and have supernatural abilities. The witch, Annie, is really creepy as she is a very young girl who has a very dark, evil personality. Nick tries to get closer to her and she rejects him. This leads to the two of them being pursued by some local hunters, who capture the two and lock them up in the house, but Nick manages to get free and runs back to the forest with Annie, and while he is out, LILLIAN, his sister, has disappeared. Nick, having no idea where she has gone, goes looking for her, and finds out that she has been kidnapped by a witch, who, of course, he does not believe he is going to see again.   After this, things start to go very badly wrong for Nick. First, he discovers that he is being possessed by a female witch who he can't get away from. She also gives him the ability to see ghosts, and tells him that it is time for him to sacrifice his own life. Nick goes off and searches for the witch, but soon, he is captured by the hunters, and locked up in a cage. In order to get out, Nick has to sacrifice himself, and when the witch tells him to kill himself, Nick agrees to do it, but then a group of people come out of the woods, and are in love with him. They have to kill the witch to free Nick, so Nick and the witches go to the hunters house, and Nick is locked in a room with them and the witch. As they start to fight, the witch turns into an old woman, and tries to kill Nick with a knife, but she gets knocked out. Nick runs out of his room to go back to Annie and her father, but finds out the hunters have found them and are holding them hostage. Nick then runs out into the woods and finds a boat, and he jumps into

It was an easy, if somewhat slow, family movie.  They did a very nice job with the special effects.  I like the way the character is built up to the point where the audience can't see them as people anymore.   The movie is about a man and a woman who go to visit a man who had been in a house that was a house of horror.  It's a little strange how much of a different character these two characters become after they are put into a house where things are not what they seem.  This is an old school horror film that is sure to please. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really funny, and a lot of fun to watch. It was like an action film about a man who goes to find his lost wife, and then finds her, and has her come back to his home, where she becomes a little more feminine than she was before, which is a nice touch. It's just about a guy who goes around trying to find the woman he loved, until he runs into her old boss who has been hiding out. She tells him she has a new love, but she needs him to come and get her, because she has become pregnant again. He tells her that he will take her to a place where she can find her lost husband, and so she goes there, and it's just a bunch of weirdos. They meet some strange people who have a weird thing going on, and that's where the fun part comes in. They end up getting drunk and then they have sex, and some strange things happen to them. This is not a serious movie, so don't expect a lot. It has a few laughs, and the guys are funny, but the movie is not really for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Ride with the Devil" is a good old fashioned Western with a great cast, great cinematography, and a good story.  The film starts with a man named John Bowers (Ralph Bellamy) who wants to leave his wife, and the town he's settled in, for good.  The two main characters are John Bower and his daughter, who are both quite young.  Bowers is a bit of a hick, who is always drinking and getting into all sorts of trouble.  He and his son, who happens to be a young gunfighter, go on a lot of rambles.  I think it is pretty clear who is going to be the good guy and who is the bad guy at this point.   In the first half of the movie John Bowing spends his time wandering around looking for something, but there is not a single thing he finds to give him a reason to leave the town.  After he is forced to leave by his wife who wants him to move out, Bowers finds his son is on a quest for revenge.  In a way the film parallels the movie The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, in that Bowers' son is an outlaw and he is going after Bowers because of his son's crimes.  That's what makes the film so interesting.  Both John and his kid want revenge and the only person they can find to get it is the local sheriff.  It is up to Bowers to make sure his son and his gunslinger son don't get killed along with his wife.  For the first part of the film Bowers, is very likable, but by the second half he is very unlikable.  John Boes is very much a hicks boy, who thinks the only way to make his own way is by getting into some trouble. He also has a drinking problem, which is not helped by his daughter's desire to be an actress.  I don't have much to say about the other characters.  Ralph Bellamy is great as John Bering, a very likably bad man, who wants more for his son than a career in law.  Bellamy, is a very good actor who gets a great performance out of Bowers.  Jack Palance plays the sheriff who has a rather complicated relationship with John Bohn.  While Bohn seems like the good cop, Palance does an excellent job of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this movie was very good. The movie was like a western without the guns and it had the same feel as an old western with a good actor like Clark Gable.   It had a good romance, and it wasn't very romantic, but I think that's how the story went.  It was a good story about a young man and a young girl who are going to travel around the country and see all kinds of people.  The movie is really good, but it is a little slow paced. It was like an old Western, and the people are very similar to what I saw in the old westerns, and they all had a kind of way of speaking.  The story was like it was like old western movies.  I was surprised to see that the movie was only made for $500. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It has a fantastic, memorable soundtrack, as well as a very engaging story, that has enough emotional content to be engaging and compelling.  But there are some minor issues, like some scenes are a little too long and the character of "Sugar" can be a little cliche, but overall it's a very entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the beginning of the movie, I was worried. I really didn't want to see a sequel to the very good  Star Wars  movie, with all its epic and beautiful films. After watching  The Last Jedi, I'm still not sure. This film is just beautiful. The visuals are beautiful, the sound is beautiful, and the story is great. The characters are wonderful, the acting is great, and I couldn't be happier.  You may find my review of Star Wars: The Last Jawa  to be of interest. I think the story has been done a million times, so why should it be so different from the previous film? I thought the story was good, and did a nice job of telling it. I liked it, and it will definitely keep me on the edge of my seat until the next one comes out. I'm excited to see what happens next.   The movie is rated R for violence, language and some disturbing images.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a young man who was abandoned at a boarding school because of his parents' divorce. The school was a place where the kids would be left for months on end, not being fed or given water. After being abandoned, the young man had to learn to survive. In the beginning, he meets the other boys who were abandoned at the same boarding school. These boys are the only ones who have anything to teach him about how to survive in the world.   It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it is still a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a fun movie and the best one of the season. The movie takes place in an old warehouse that was originally a movie theatre. There are old movies on the screen but the new ones are played on the big screen. The old movies are old but the action scenes are pretty good.   I also like that there is a good mix of good actors and a good cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a young boy and his dog, and about how both of them come to be very attached to each other.  The boy, Billy, is a very funny and charming child who seems to have a kind of innocence about him.   When the dog is a little boy, the two of them are both very interested in the other's antics and adventures.  The movie starts out with a little kid who is very happy to see the dog and has a great time playing with it.    Then a little girl comes and gets very excited about the dog.  And a little old lady comes and is very pleased to see this dog.   Then they all have a party at a place called the "Big House" and a lot of people show up.  But it is not all good as they discover a bunch of dead bodies and Billy and his dad find a few people dead.  Then there is a group of people that are playing with some animals and some people are having a picnic there.  All of this gets the attention of the people at the Big House, who decide to have their own party at the place called "Bunkhouse" that is very much like the Big house except that it is much smaller and much less comfortable.  The dogs, Billy and the dog named "Lumpy", play with all of the kids and the other animals.  Billy finds a little baby that is in a basket that has a red rose and he and Lumpy go out and play with it a little bit.  Now this baby has a mother named Mary, who is the one who takes care of her.  Mary is the only person who really cares about the baby.  So the little baby is very lonely.  It is not long before the dogs have a good time with the baby, but the little babies are not so nice to the dogs.  After a while the dogs become sick of the babies and want to play with the big baby. Mary goes out to get the baby and is killed by the dogs, but Billy gets her back and they play with her a little while longer.  This gets them even sicker and Billy takes the baby away and gets her a new mother.  There is also a new little girl, the only one who seems really nice to them all.  Finally, there is the big house that they all live in and the people there like the dogs a lot and the little girl a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're looking for a really good movie, look no further than The Last Dragon. This is a good, solid action-adventure flick that shows just how well you can take a little sword and a bit of magic. I really enjoy the film, as it's an old-school story with good, old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery.  The action is good, and the characters are fun.  What's good:   This is the third time I've watched this film, and it keeps getting better with each viewing.   It's a pretty good film with a great story, a great cast, and a pretty enjoyable story arc.  A bit more development in the villains would have been nice, but it's good enough that I can overlook it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hair" is an awesome movie that I enjoyed.  I have seen many other films that were good but this one is really funny.    "Hairy-Hair".   A nice movie with a lot of humor.  This movie is about a couple who live in a house on a hill.  They have an attic and a small backyard.    There is a cat who lives there and he is a really cute cat.  He has two different names that he is named "Hairy" and "Hair", both of which are his names.  Hairy is really a hunk of a cat, he has hairy arms and legs, he also has a very big nose.  The two of them love to watch television and do lots of other stuff.  One of the things that they like to do is play pranks on other cats.  If you watch the movie you will get a laugh at all the funny stuff that they do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The final episode of season one of "Mr. Robot" is as much a character study as it is a thriller. The story is complex, and there's plenty of surprises, but it's not particularly original. There are plenty of examples of hacktivism, but the characters are very un-hackery. The main character, Christian Slater (Rami Malek) is a corporate shill and an ex-con who's trying to figure out why he got caught up in the whole thing in the first place. Slater has a lot of enemies, and it doesn't take long for him to realize that they have all got things in common: They're all on the take from some shady character or another. Slater's only defense is a pair of sunglasses, and he's not entirely sure he can trust anyone with them. The show has a strong sense of style, and the production values are good, but ultimately, it's all about the characters. Slater and the gang are compelling and interesting, and this episode really shows off just how far Elliot has come since season one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are a fan of the old classic 'Bewitched', then you'll love this movie. The story is about the famous 'witch' from the original movie and her son, who have moved to the small town of Derry, Maine. The son, John, is a boy who is very talented at playing the piano. His mother, who has always been jealous of him, finds out about his talent and decides to take him to Boston to live with a family that will help him with his piano lessons. Her plan doesn't work out however and he is then sent back to Derry. The film is based on a book written by Jane O'Connor, and was filmed in 1969.   The movie is very funny, and not at all silly. It is quite well acted by the whole cast and I especially like the scene when John plays the piano, which was one of my favorites.  It is also very well produced and it is really well done.  The music is a bit old school, but it works and the cast is excellent.  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and it will definitely be a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last 10 minutes or so in the beginning of the movie were so beautiful and so touching and I found it hard to watch as it's supposed to be a horror movie.   I was surprised as the story started with an old man getting killed and then the wife coming to find her husband dead and a girl in his house.  They're having a nice evening but it's the same old stuff and they've got a couple of children so the family is getting to know each other and it's not all nice.  Then the old man says that the last thing he ever did was look at his wife and that it was the only time he ever saw her smile.  This leads to the next morning when the kids are all awake and playing.  Now this is a horror film but it is so very well acted and it is really creepy, especially when you get to the end.  I really hope they don't do this one too often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good:  - Great acting, from Ben Foster to Bruce Willis to Kevin Bacon.  Not a bad performance all around.  This was a good old fashioned horror movie.    It's not like anything else on the big screen right now.  It did have a great score from the great Clint Mansell, and was a nice change from the typical '70s slasher movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I mean, I liked it. I liked all the characters, and I enjoyed the story. It's a good story with some twists and turns.   It's also funny.    This is not a good one. It does a lot of things wrong.  First, it has a lot going on at once. There are two main plots going on here.  The first is a love story between a woman and her father, a soldier in the Spanish Civil War.  They meet in the movie, and things quickly get complicated.  When the war ends, the woman's father is given a large pension by the Spanish government.  It makes her jealous. She finds a way to get even with him, by marrying a soldier.  This leads to the first plot twist, which is that this soldier is a little bit gay.  Now, that's a huge twist.  We don't see this happen. The soldier has a crush on the woman, and we only see him flirting with her.  So, she finds out about the flirting, and she decides to kill him.  But this does not stop her from marrying the soldier, and the story continues.  There is also a love triangle between the two women, and a love affair between the soldier and his wife.  All of this is not what is supposed to be happening.  I found myself thinking "How the hell did they get away with that?"   The whole thing just felt a little off to me.  As far as I can tell, the story was supposed to go like this:  "I want a big family. I want two girls. I love my dad. I think he loves me. My dad and my mom are divorced. I am the only one left. I have two sisters. One is older than the other. I will not marry a soldier, I will marry a woman. I really don't care about my dad anymore. I don't know why I am not in love with my mom. I feel like she is not happy with me either. She doesn't know that I have a crush. She thinks I am a little boy. I know I am. I can't tell my sisters about the crush. They don't understand why I love this man. I told my dad I am leaving for America. He is really happy about this. I promise to come back to him when I am married

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie that doesn't try too hard.  The story is about a family with two sons, an 18 year old who is a bit of a loser, and his 15 year old brother. The 15 year-old is a great actor and a great guy and the 18 year- old is a dork, but he has the best acting out of any kid I have seen in a long time. It seems like he was cast because the producers thought he would be a good choice for the role. He also does a great job of portraying the character of a dorks kid. The movie has a great soundtrack and the special effects are great. The special effects in the movie are amazing. The effects are also done really well. I don't think the special effect in the last 15 minutes is too much, but I think the effects in this movie are worth the price of admission. The story is very good and the characters are well written.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been a long time since I have seen a good, big-budget movie about a man-hating, woman-hater.  But this is a good one.    I am a sucker for a good female protagonist.  And I love this movie.  This is a big-time, big budget movie.  This is probably the most female-centered movie I have ever seen.  The movie is set in a world where the main character is an alien who is forced to live on earth because she was too good for the alien planet.  But, when she becomes the only woman in the universe, she is forced into marriage to a man (her best friend) who doesn't want to see her die and is also a big jerk.  She tries to get out of the marriage but he won't let her.  The movie is pretty long and there is a lot of sex in it.  They both are having a good time.  It's a good big-screen movie, it has lots of sex, lots of funny dialogue, and lots of action.  There are a lot more women in this movie than men.  I love the way they make their characters women, and that they have a lot less men in the movie than women.  One thing that I liked about the movie was that there was a lot a comedy.  So, if you don't like a good lady, this might not be your thing.  If you do like a nice lady, then this is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never really understood how much of a big deal the "Mondo Trash" movie is. It's a comedy about a trash collector named Tom (played by Tim Conway), who is in the middle of a nasty argument with his wife, and then he has to go clean the bathroom. While he's doing that, he notices a box of old movies on the floor, and decides to give them to the trashman, who is named Tom. Tom then tells him that there's a bad movie that's about to be released called "MIDNIGHT MADNESS" and it looks like the best movie ever made. When Tom's wife goes to get him to go watch the movie, he refuses to go, so she goes to her room to watch the bad movie with him. It turns out that she has already seen the movie with Tom, and it is a very bad movie, and when the film ends, she tells Tom she loves him, and that he's a great trash collector. Tom is then in the bathroom, and he hears the bad joke, and calls his wife over to see if it's funny. He then realizes that the movie is actually called "Midnight Madness" and the joke was actually on him. The rest of the film is a collection of Tom's ridiculous arguments with his own wife, his wife's stupid boyfriend (played (with a very large body) by Paul Sorvino), and his daughter (played, once again, by actress Sally Field).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a great movie. It's a good old fashioned ghost story. I've seen it a few times and it's always a good time.  "The Man who Wasn" has been called one of the most bizarre and beautiful ghost stories ever told. It is a good story with a good sense of humor.  It has a sense of history, romance, and mystery.  "The Woman who Came in From the Cold" was a great addition to the filmography of Robert Aldrich.   "The Woman Who Came in from the Cold".        It is one of Aldrich's best movies.  It was released in 1958 and has been re-released many times since then.

He meets a strange woman and they are both captured by the evil King Arthur, but he manages to escape. But it is the other people who he must escape, as well as his father and brother. So he gets on a boat and sails off. The film is made up of many short stories, all of which are very good. They are very well done, with good sound and some good special effects, such as the fish coming out of the water and the flying carp.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had never seen a movie about a guy named Harry Darracott, but I was immediately drawn in by the story.  Harry Darraccott is an old school, old school man with a lot of charm and personality.    He was always good looking and charming.  This movie has the classic 1950's look to it and is not really as well-made as many others that came out in the 1950's.  It looks like a good time movie, but the acting is kind of meh and the dialogue is really just there.  The plot itself was very entertaining and the characters were all interesting.  Some of the characters are really funny and some of them are not.  There are a lot more characters in this movie and they are not all as well made as they could be.  I will give it a B- if only for the humor.  Overall, this is a good fun movie that looks pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only bad thing about this movie is the ending. It's pretty hard to believe that this movie was made over 50 years ago. This movie was pretty much made for the whole world to see and laugh at, but the ending is really weird and not very funny. It really gets a bit ridiculous, I guess, but it is still funny. The movie itself is a great mix of comedy and action. The main villain is very different from any other villains that have been used in movie history, and the story is a pretty unique one, and pretty funny at the same time. I guess the best thing about it is that it really is a good time for all ages to enjoy, even though the ending might be a bit strange. I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, "The Black Cauldron" is a good example of what a good horror film should be. It has an old fashioned feel to it, as you know it will be, and there is a great sense of dread in the air, yet there is also a sense of humour. It is a very good horror story, and the story of what happened to the people in the Black Cauldrons and how the people were put into these "cauldrons" is one that is sure to leave a bad taste in your mouth.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't care for science fiction.   The film is pretty decent but it's not really about the aliens.

The movie does not really seem to have much of a plot but that's not a bad thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lion in a Woman's Skin" (2007) was made by a team of French directors. The story revolves around a very wealthy family that owns a big land in a very beautiful country. The husband of the wife is a wealthy merchant who is the boss of the family and the wife. The movie tells a story of how the husband is a man who never lost his sense of humor. He is a very generous man who treats the wife very well. He loves her very much and does everything for her. The only thing he is missing is a child. So he thinks of a way to get one, using his business and his money. So it happens that the wife meets a man and falls in love with him. The first time she meets the man she is in the company of his wife and daughter. The second time she meet the man he is not married and is with another woman. She tries to get away from the company but she is still drawn to him. So the husband decides to marry her and they become a couple. So, as they are married and the mother is pregnant, the husband wants to have a baby. The woman, not wanting a child, decides to have an abortion. So that the child will be born without a father. So her husband is really against this and tries to force her to have the abortion. But she refuses and she gives birth to a baby girl. But the husband never stops loving his wife. And after he gets back to France the wife never sees the husband again. After this movie I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought it was a very good movie and I liked the story, but I didn't like the characters and I didn' t like the storyline. I also liked the movie so much because the actors were so good. I just wished they would have made the story a little better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think this movie is all that bad, I think it's better than most movies of its genre, it has good special effects and is a fun romp.  If you don't want to watch a movie that is all about the evil guy and his minions, you can easily skip it, but if you are into the "evil guy" genre, you should see this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that could be a problem is the poor acting. It seems like they all got together for a movie and all of them did a terrible job. The director should have cast better actors for the part of the police officer, who is supposed to be an experienced cop who is now forced to do this part for the first time.   I didn't think so at first. It is very hard to act like a cop. The police officer does not seem to be able to read a face and it was so bad that he did not even try to act as a cop even though he had a badge. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little worried when I saw the title of this movie. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of "drama". It doesn't matter whether you are a drama buff, a comedy buff, or a romance buff, you don't like "dramas" because you find them to be contrived, repetitive, and not all that interesting. But, I have been looking forward to watching this movie since I heard about it. The story is about a man who loses everything, and decides to go on a journey to find it again. This movie is full of action, romance, humor, and drama. This is a very funny movie with lots of slapstick humor, lots of romance, lots and lots of action scenes, and a few romance scenes. I really enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it to everyone who loves a good comedy and a good romance. I also recommend this movie to everyone looking for a good drama. I was so disappointed that this movie didn't come out on DVD yet, because it was a very good movie, a lot better than it's sequel. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good good comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Weird Science" is a science fiction film that is quite silly in a good way.  The premise is that two men (one a computer expert and one a geologist) find a machine that creates strange images and sounds that they then take to the public.    After a series of incidents that involve the strange images appearing on the television, people are scared of the strange creatures and go to the police.  The film is a little slow to get going but once the action gets going it is really fun.  There is a scene where a scientist gets sucked up in the machine and there are some hilarious moments as the two men have to make sure the machine is never used again.  "Weird science" is the kind of film that I like to see but not often because it is a bit slow paced.  If you are a fan of science fiction movies then you will probably like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the first movies to come out in the early 70's. It tells the story of a girl named Kathy, who is trying to save the world from the alien invasion that's been happening all around the world. Kathy is a normal girl who loves to have fun and enjoy life. She is only in her mid-20's and she has a lot to live for. She's got a good sense of humor, which helps her stay away from the danger. The movie begins with a very dramatic and action-packed scene that sets the tone for the movie. We see a group of alien warriors (they look like apes) who are about to destroy a peaceful city and we have to watch it to see if they make it through. The other alien warriors also make it past and it is up to the rest of the city to fight them off. After the battle, the aliens go on a mission to destroy the city and Kathy, with the help of a group that includes a reporter and a police officer, must stop them.   The action in this movie is very good. There are a lot of shots in this film that are so intense that you have to pay close attention. The action is pretty good too. The characters are a bit dull. They have some great one-liners and the characters are likable. I was never impressed by any of them. The actors in this show were pretty good. I didn't like all of them, but there was no one that I disliked. The special effects were a little weak at times, but the special effects are pretty good in the movie and it looks really good.  The movie is definitely worth watching if you enjoy a good sci-fi movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A very bad idea. The best idea is never found.  The first thing you should know is that it is not a great movie. It is a movie of the same genre as The Exorcist. The movie is a story of a small town where a demon is loose and killing people. When the demon is captured the townspeople become angry at the town sheriff and the demon. The townspeer go to the police and accuse the sheriff and his deputy of murdering the demon with a rubber hose. The demon is killed by the deputy and the town is saved. The film ends with the town being saved. It does not end well. The acting is very poor and the acting in the movie is very bad.  The story is a bad one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a classic, and has a great story to go with it. The film is quite well made, and the actors do a great job. It's a little rough around the edges at times, and you're not going to find the perfect mix of comedy and drama all the time. But if you like a good old fashioned gangster movie, then this is a great film. It does feel like it is on the shorter side. It could have been longer. The music is great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this is the first film in a trilogy that has a lot of interesting elements. It has the same sort of idea that we have seen a lot in the previous films, the idea that people like to go to a place and have a good time. The film takes a lot from the previous two films, and in that way it makes them all the more interesting. I have to say that I am glad that they have gone back to the earlier films, they do a great job of bringing back the character of John Ritter as well as bringing back that good old American humour that we all loved when we were kids. This is a film that will definitely make you laugh, and if you enjoy good comedy you will find a lot to like here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first 30 minutes of this movie are brilliant.  We see a couple in the movie who are at the height of their relationship.  The plot of the movie is a little strange, but I liked it.   We see that our main character has an affair with the director of the movies.  They get married, but then he cheats on her.  This is a nice movie that will keep you guessing for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie and the cast was fantastic.  The story was good, the acting was good and I loved the soundtrack.   I'm not sure what the point was, but the movie was very silly and it was the best comedy that I have seen.  The film was set in the 1930's and there were lots of silly things going on and the people were a bit silly too.  There were a few funny scenes that I found really funny.  There are many things to like about this movie, but I must admit that there are a few flaws.  For example, there is a scene where a dog is eating an apple and then gets his tail chewed off.  This was not funny. But I guess it was supposed to be.  In the last scene a man is eating a chicken with a fork.  I was surprised when he bit off the chicken's head, I thought he was going to eat the chicken head, but then he went for the head of the chicken, but it didn't work.  It seems that the writer didn't know what he was doing.  So, overall, this movie is a little silly, but a lot of fun.  If you like silly movies and have a good laugh, then this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Dinosaur is a beautifully done and well thought out movie. It is a very clever film with a story that is simple yet rich. The Good Dinosaur was created by an amazing cast of artists and animators and their brilliant and imaginative art style. The characters are drawn wonderfully. I especially loved the dinosaur designs that the animators came up with. They are imaginative and have a great sense of humor. The story is very good and I loved how the story was developed over the course of the film. It's a great little movie that is really fun to watch. If you have a big family and don't want to watch a lot of the same movie over and over, you should definitely see this one.

The story begins with her being approached by the singer and a young Japanese man. The singer invites her to a house party where he offers to teach her how to play the guitar. She has no interest in the game, but he convinces her to go anyway. There, the singer meets the other guests who seem to be somewhat strange people. However, as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that this is all a game. After a while, she realizes that her new friends have no interest or need for her. After finding out what the singer wants, the girl tries to break it off, but the singer is persistent.

I don't know what the movie's director, James Gunn, was thinking when he edited the movie. It's hard to watch because of how it was edited and the way it was done. I think that it was the movie itself, the way that the movie played out, that made me not want to watch it again. It was too long and it didn't seem like it was really telling a good story. It seemed like a lot of effort was put into making it seem like a good film. It felt like it went into a lot more detail than the story needed.

The movie is also a nice reminder of what it's like to be a kid in the 1950s.  You have your family and friends, and all of them are great characters.  They all have their own little problems that they go through that are all pretty relatable.  And while it's not the biggest movie of the year, it is a good film and has a great cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never really enjoyed horror films. They seem to be more of a chore than anything else. This film, however, was one of the better horror films I've ever seen. There are so many different scenes and emotions that it can make you jump at times, especially when the movie starts to pick up and it's all going downhill from there. The movie starts off with a small girl named Lily who is walking along the road when she hears something in the bushes. She turns around to find a man walking towards her. The man starts to talk to Lily and she starts to feel uneasy about him. The next thing we see is the man pulling a stick out of the bushes and throwing it at Lily's feet. She runs away but runs into another bush. This time the man pulls out a small knife and kills her. This is what we think is Lily's death, but it's really just a dream. After this dream sequence, we get to see the next scene. It's a graveyard with a little girl who is screaming for help. The little girl is named "Molly". This is the first time we see Molly. The first thing you notice about her is her eyes. They are just so weird and I could only guess they are a mixture of a cat and a ghost. The second thing you realize is that her hair is a weird mixture of both of them. Then she starts running around and screaming. This girl is going to have to go to a different school. She's going to be called "Mud." I'm not sure if she's a cat or a ghost, but either way, she is going nowhere fast. I'm really glad the movie ended here, because there wasn't much more to the story. It really didn't have a whole lot going on. This movie is one that's worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre. It does have a very creepy atmosphere, but doesn't get overly frightening. I recommend this movie for the people who are fans of the horror genre, and if you don't like horror, you can skip this movie.

There's nothing particularly remarkable about the earthquake itself.  It's the aftermath that's the main draw, however, and this film is quite good at portraying it.    It's a gripping, well-paced, and well-directed disaster movie.  A great one.  "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen a film with such a big scope, from its title, to the film's setting and characters. The film follows a group of people who take up a job that takes them from the American Midwest to the Russian city of St. Petersburg in the 19th century. They work in the Russian theater as the Russian Empress Catherine the Great. They are paid $100 a month, and live in the palace where the Empress lives. Their only job is to pretend to be a married couple, and have sex on stage. I was amazed at how well the actors and actresses played the roles. The Russian theater is set to the music of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. This is a very fun movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction and is looking for a little more from the movie world.

I'm sure that the movie would have been even better had they filmed it in front of a live audience.  But this movie is not a horror classic.  It's a good old-fashioned comedy about a group of characters who are not good at what they do, and how they make friends with one another.  I enjoyed this movie a lot, and am happy that I finally saw it.

The film is about a girl named Sophie, who lives alone in a cabin in the woods. She has a dog named Burt who she doesn't want to leave. She tries to hide his presence from everyone, but he always comes looking for her, and the more he finds out about her, the more annoyed he gets.  He finds a secret room under the stairs, and finds a doll in it, that he calls Sophie.  Sophie is not a bad person, but she doesn´t know how to live, she has a lot of money, but doesn´T have enough to live.  When she learns that her sister is missing, she goes to the police, but they are unable to find her, they only say that she went to the cabin, but there is no way to find out where she is.  The police chief thinks that the girl should be sent to a mental hospital, but Sophie doesn´ t want that, she thinks that they are trying to send her to a madhouse.  However, when she goes back to the cops, they find a body under the staircase, that they assume is Sophie, but when she is examined by the doctor, she dies of a heart attack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the world of cinema it has long been a standard that the actor playing the leading role should be of average intelligence and at the very least well-educated, and it is also a common assumption that the leading lady, with her big hair, blue eyes, and blonde wig, should also be of normal intelligence.  This has been the case with a number of actresses who have been in the leading roles in various films: Â Elizabeth Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, Lauren Bacall, Elizabeth Taylor-Draper,  Loretta Young, Â Eva Marie Saint. Â And the list is never-ending.    In the late '30s, when I was a boy, the leading actresses in Hollywood were very good-looking women,   and were often of high intelligence. They were also, to a man, the most popular girls in high school and in college,  and it was no secret that they were both good- looking and smart.  This is why it is so ironic that so many of the leading ladies of the 20th century are very bad-looking, and in most cases not very bright.  This film is about the marriage of two of the most well-known women of the early 20th Century,  (one of them, Elizabeth  Taylor-Drake, who was an accomplished singer, and the other,  Elizabeth   Taylor,  who was a former Miss America and a model and dancer).   The plot of the film concerns a plot to steal the bride away from her husband,    and, in a manner which will become famous,  I can only imagine how this plot was hatched,  in the course of a night in a club in   Manhattan,  New York City.  It would have been quite easy to get Elizabeth-Duke Taylor-Ridley married and out of the way;   but Elizabeth Taylor's father,  John Taylor-Robinson, had a very bad temper and was very proud of his daughter's intelligence.    In this way,  the marriage was arranged,  but it is not the only part of the plot that is odd.  The marriage of Elizabeth Taylor and   Richard Burton is a little too perfect.  Burton, a man who would become famous in his own right, was a young man in his twenties when he was married to   Elizabeth Taylor.  His
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half is a great introduction to a film that would become one of the greatest films of all time, and one of his best comedies, period.   As a result of a bad divorce and some bad luck, we have our hero, a young man (Richard Widmark) who goes to the desert to seek out the mystical "Sultan of the Desert" who can cure his wife's (Lilli Kaye) terminal illness.  The desert itself is a fantastic place to go, with sand dunes that are almost completely uninhabited except for the occasional bird.  There is also a small town here, the population is mostly nomads.  But the town has a nice little bar where the local drunks hang out, drink and play cards, while the town's leader (David Niven) is away on business.  This all comes to a head when the Sultan, on his way to a nearby town, gets stopped by a group of nomads, and then falls for the wife of one of them.  When the drunks see this, they decide to have a little party to celebrate the arrival of the new Sultan.  I liked this because the movie's set-up is great, and the dialogue is good enough that I didn't mind laughing, but the movie itself is much better than I remember it being.  Richard Widmark is an excellent actor who really brings the character to life, but even more so because he is able to pull off a variety of emotions at the same time, not just sadness, anger, or fear.  Lilli Kayem is an amazing character, a bit of a playgirl but not in the typical sense.  She is also very strong willed, and will do almost anything to protect her husband from the townspeople.  As with many of the great movies in this series, the story is told in a very clever and unique way.  One can't help but laugh at how ridiculous the story gets, but in a good way. The characters are very well drawn, and Richard Widwick does a great job playing them. The music is also good, and very catchy.  My favorite bit of music in the film is the one that plays after the first time Widmark visits the desert.  After this song, the movie really kicks into gear.  A great movie, very funny, and a classic.  Top 20 movies in my Top 20 Movies of All Time

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a reason why there are many great horror movies that have been made.  I don't think this movie will hold a candle to the classics that came before it, but I'll still give it a try.    The film is set in a small town in the middle of nowhere.  This is a small community where people go to die.  The main character, Tom (David Carradine) is a loner.  His sister is a bit eccentric and a bit weird.  There's a lot of tension between the two of them and their father.  They both have a strange ability that is very creepy.  It's not a supernatural thing, it's more a psychological thing.  Tom has been having nightmares about the town, and he has a weird ability that lets him see into the minds of the dead.  When Tom goes to a funeral home, a ghost is in the room.  I'm not going to spoil the ending, but you get the point.  If you have a weak stomach, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.  But if you're up for a bit of a scary movie, then you should definitely check this out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my all time favorite movies is "The Day the Earth Stood Still". It is a true story about a group of explorers that travel to a distant planet where they discover a frozen landscape that is much like Earth. They discover that the planet is in a state of constant movement, and that the seasons on Earth are changing every 24 hours.   The film is narrated by James Garner, who plays the lead character, a man named Willard Decker. Decker's wife is pregnant with his child, and he decides to return to Earth so he can be with her. But before he leaves, he tells his friends about a "snowman" that has appeared on the landscape and has begun to attack the explorers.  This is the beginning of the end for the explorers on the planet. They are hunted by the snowman, and are forced to hide in the snow and wait for the winter to end. But when it finally ends, they realize that the "soul" of the snow man has awakened and has killed the humans that were guarding the cave in which they were hiding. This film is one of the most original, imaginative and thrilling films I have ever seen.  The film is told in flashback as Willard and his wife and their children are fleeing the "frozen" landscape.  The movie is a classic, with a strong science fiction element that is not afraid to take risks. It has a strong cast of characters that have a variety of personalities. And, the performances are outstanding. I would say this is a "must see" for all movie fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about the first meeting between two of the most powerful people on the planet.   It tells the story of a man called John Galt (played by a very good actor by Sam Waterston), a retired businessman who is convinced that he has discovered the secret to ending poverty.  John Gatsby (played in a very convincing way by Robert Redford) is a wealthy playboy who is very proud of his wealth.  Gatsbys father died when he was very young, and he lives with his mother (a very pretty actress by Katharine Ross) in a beautiful mansion in the exclusive gated community of Bel Air.  The neighborhood is filled with very wealthy people who live in gated communities.  One day Gatssby comes to see Galt, and they start a very strange friendship.  It seems that they are able to influence each other.  But then, things go wrong.  When Gatsy tries to kill himself, his mother tells him that the person he should really be killing is Gatsyns father.  After that the two men get involved in a strange game that involves murder, a few explosions, and a lot of money.  At the end of the movie Gatsdons wife comes to his room and asks him to leave her for a while.  She says that she needs a man like him to care for her children.  In the end Gatsdy decides to leave the gated commune and go back to the real world.  The film does a great job in showing how much of a person Gatssy is.  As a man, he is strong and intelligent, and is very clever.  He is also a very kind and generous man, and tries to help people wherever he can.  For example, in the film he gives a rich man a nice gift of a piano.  Another interesting aspect of the film is the way it shows how different the people in Bel Air are.  People in BelAir tend to be very vulgar and rude.  They are also very religious, and believe in a form of heaven.  This is a different kind of world. In the movie people are shown in a much more simple way.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* I don't know if I should be surprised or disappointed that this is one of the best movies ever made. The film is based on a short story by a French writer who was inspired to write a book about a boy named Victor Hugo who lives in a small village in the South of France during the revolution of 1848. Victor's mother and father, a man and a woman, both die in a car accident while driving along the coast of France, Victor is left with his uncle and grandmother. Victor is only five years old and is the only survivor. Victor, being the only boy, is allowed to wander the village alone. He has no real interest in learning anything about the world around him. Victor lives with his grandmother, a woman of immense strength, and his uncle, a very clever man. Victor has no friends, and he doesn't know how to speak a word of French. But that doesn't stop him from being quite intelligent. One day, Victor, who is looking for a book on the sea, finds a book in the village library that reads "The Secret Agent". Victor starts to read the book. The book gives him a very strange and wonderful world. The Secret Agent tells the story of a young boy who is trying to find his mother who is trapped in a huge house that was built in a time of war. It is a beautiful world full of colorful characters, and lots of adventure. The secret agent, Victor's grandfather, is also very interesting. He is an old man with a very gentle and quiet way about him. His wife is an enchanting young woman who is very intelligent. She is also a brilliant scientist. Victor spends much of his time with his grandfather, his uncle (who is also an intelligent man) and his grandmother. The story is very well written. The art and music are beautiful. I would highly recommend this to any child, even to adults, because it is a very funny movie. I have not seen the movie but the movie seems to be very well done. There are a lot of funny scenes. There is also plenty of suspense, lots of danger, and plenty of action. The writing is very clever and interesting. **************************** The film was produced by Jean-Luc Godard, and starred Gerard Depardieu. Depardie is a good actor and his performances are very good in this movie. This is a movie that I recommend to all children, because I believe it will give them a lot

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good and entertaining action movie about an old guy who, in the 1950's, is hired to kill a gang of drug dealers who are selling heroin on the streets of the big city.  The old guy is very strong and he tries to kill all the guys one by one and, at the end, he has to kill one of them, a big, fat man named The Wagoner, and, while he is doing that, the gang of thugs get away with a lot of stuff, including a car and some drugs. The movie is very well done and it has some of the best set pieces in the genre.  I like the characters, especially The Waggoner, who is a funny old guy, and he is the only person who can beat up the gang.  This movie has a great ending, with a nice payoff, but the ending is a little short and the movie has some problems.  It was fun to watch, but I didn't like it.   The acting was good.  All the characters were funny, and I liked the old guy.  (3 out of 5 stars)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting film that is very faithful to the original. It's a simple story about a poor orphan who is adopted by a rich man, but after he's murdered by the rich man's son he decides to go to live on the streets and take revenge. It is well done and has a very funny plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a young girl named Rachel who was born with a genetic disorder. It means that she is physically and mentally different than others. She has two sets of limbs that she can use for walking and running. The second set is very special and it's very hard to get her to use it.  This is because she's afraid to try. She says that she's not afraid to die, because that's what she wants to be. She wants to go out with a bang and not a whimper.  I really enjoyed this movie and I loved the story line.  I loved that it was an American film and that it wasn't the usual Disney movie.  It was interesting to see an Asian person as the lead.   I don't think this is the best movie ever made but I'd recommend it to any American who loves movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day a friend and I went to the movie theater to watch The Princess Bride.  We were both expecting it to be a cheesy, poorly acted, and very silly movie.    What we got instead was a very good movie with great acting, music, and a story that was quite good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   First, let me say that this film is one of the best, if not the best of the three. This film is a must see for anyone who wants to be entertained, even for those who may be "too old" to enjoy a film of this type. It is one heck of a ride.   This is not the most romantic film, although it does show a very real and deep love story, and it is well done. This is also a "filler" film that is meant to get you going for the last two episodes. It does not disappoint. There is a lot to talk about with this film, but the first half of the film is great. The second half is great and very well done and very good acting from everyone involved.   and finally, a note: I would like to say that I like the film and the actors. I have seen other films of this ilk, but this is the first time I have watched this film in its entirety. I was not surprised when I heard that this was a "family" film, and the film was well made for that. I do like the fact that it was made in England. The film is not an "old" film in the way it is meant for the younger audiences, but rather a film that would appeal to a wide range of audiences. I would say that a family movie is more "family-friendly" than the typical teen comedy, although the teen comedy is certainly "family friendly". This film was not made for the "teen" audience, but for those that love to be in on a great story. It was very well written and acted, and is a definite winner.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like a good action movie with a twist that gets your blood boiling, you'll love this one.    The movie is the usual action flick where you know it's gonna be a bad one from the start, but you're so excited to see the twist come out that you ignore the fact that you know you're about to get a bad movie.  The action is done very well, and the plot is decent, but the twist is just so poorly done that it ruins the whole movie. This movie really doesn't make me laugh, it just makes me want to throw up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is a good sequel, but not nearly as good as the original.   It has some great action, but is also a lot of silly, repetitive nonsense.  I had to read it twice just to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  This is a perfect movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon, but for everyone else, stay far, far away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies where the story has nothing to do with what happens in the film. I know, I know...the plot is nothing to write home about either. It's basically about the love of a man and a woman (who's name is not given) and how they are able to find each other through a magic tree. It is not as interesting as I was expecting but still very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first movie I ever watched where the main character was actually a good person (although he was kind of a dick at times).  The movie follows a woman named Susan who is having a rough time.  Susan lives with her brother, a young black man named John, and a young white woman named Sally.    John is a troubled man who is very good at what he does.  He is a great mechanic and he works at the local bar, The House on the Rock.  Susan's sister, Ellen, who is a good cook, has moved away and her new boyfriend is the best cook in town.  John's mother is a bitch and she has been making John do menial work in the kitchen.  They both have secrets, John has a secret that his parents knew about when he was a kid and Ellen has a very sad secret about her sister, the only one she really loves.  And Susan is the only person who understands them.  The movie follows Susan as she tries to find her brother and to understand her sister's secret.  There are some good laughs in the movie, but this is a very dark movie.  I liked it a lot and it is a nice film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a simple story about a girl named Dina who is forced to marry a rich man.   The first part of the movie is the "first wedding" when she is only 8 and the bride is still in her teens.  They are married in a simple ceremony and then the movie goes on about how the wife tries to escape.  A little girl tries to find out what is going on and the wedding goes a little off the rails.  I liked the way this movie was presented in this form because it had a simple plot but had a lot of character development and was a fun movie.  This is a good comedy/drama that doesn't take itself too seriously but does its job well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of  The Last Samurai  is one that is well worth watching and one that I think will be remembered for years to come.   This is one of those movies that is great for everyone, and I believe that it will continue to be watched and talked about for a long time.  The Last Man is the last remaining man on Earth, and he has lived through so much of war.  It is his time to leave the island of the samurai and travel to a far off land where he can live in peace and work for his people.  There is a problem though with his mission though, he is not a samurai and is not used to living in a society of humans.  So he will have to learn the ways of his new home.  This film is great, and it is the perfect blend of old and new.  I love the ending of the film, and the action that happens at the end of the movie is amazing.  The last samurai movie is a must see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie so many times it's almost part of my memory, but I'm sure it'll still be a memorable movie.   This movie was filmed in Germany in 1970, and is about a boy who finds himself at the bottom of a well, and who is saved by a rabbit, a bear, and a little girl.  The film has a great mix of comedy and adventure.  It has a few very brief shots of water in the distance.  This was filmed by Werner Herzog, who had a great success with "Maus" and the "Grizzly Man" films.  I'm not sure what the movie was about, but it certainly has some interesting elements. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was lucky enough to catch this movie on a special screening of a movie from the 1970s called "The Exorcist". It's a pretty funny movie. The actors (all of them) are great and it's a good comedy. It has some of the more disturbing moments of the movie in there. A bit too much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I've seen a better animated film than this.   In addition to being the first Disney movie to have a female lead, it also has a great soundtrack.  The film is short, but it's short enough to make you want to see it again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I am to be honest I have only seen this movie once or twice and it is probably the best of the three.   It is a good, well acted and well acted comedy that I really like.  It has some good action scenes and good special effects.  In my opinion it is a bit too slow in some scenes and there is a lot of repetition in the dialogue.  I would like to have seen more of the characters and I think that maybe the film could have been more interesting.  But still I would recommend this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie and it's got a great story that really made me feel for this poor old lady.   The characters are all quite likable, even the evil ones.  This movie is a great little film that doesn't get old in the least. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this film since it was released on DVD a few years ago, but when I watched it I found that it was a very well-done film. The actors did a great job with the roles, the story was very interesting and the action scenes were well choreographed.   If you want to see a good, exciting action movie in the '80's, you don't want to miss this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am glad I saw this movie. I had never heard of this movie before I saw it at a screening with my brother and I really liked it! The actors did an excellent job in portraying a very dark, violent, but also very funny, film. There were many, many moments where the characters were talking and laughing and there was just a very good balance between the dark and the light. I am looking forward to seeing more of this film in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good comedy, but it is a very different kind of comedy. It is funny, and the dialogue is funny. It's a comedy about the difference between life and death. It really works.  I thought it was great that the author of the book used the book as a source for the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a fun movie about a boy who is not allowed to join the Army because he is not "man enough" to do so. The movie is based on a book called The Last American Hero by David R. White and it was produced by the legendary Hollywood producer Walter Wanger. It's very enjoyable and you should see it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you don't know, I have a problem with the idea of this movie.  It's a movie about a man, played by Peter Dinklage ( Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ), who is obsessed with a movie he watched a couple of years back ( The Dark Knight Rises ) and is now obsessed with it again.  He's a man who is not good with girls.  As he is always seen trying to seduce girls (and the boys in the neighborhood) and his lack of experience in it causes problems.  One girl is so turned on by him that she invites him to her place for the weekend.  Unfortunately, she is a vampire and will bite him.  What follows is the usual scene from a movie in which Peter Dinkson attempts to seduction the girl and her friends, but the vampires are always there to stop him.  This is a movie which is a little hard to understand. The movie is not very well made and is not easy to follow.  In the end, I am not sure if I would like the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good book, this film is as good as a good story can be. The director's style is so vivid that you can imagine everything happening right there in front of you. There is a lot of violence in this film, but it's not gratuitous. It's just part of the plot and I'm not complaining. The characters are great and there's a reason they are called The Brotherhood of the Wolf. I'm a fan of the film, so I'd say it's worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a nice action-adventure movie about a bunch of guys who are trying to get from one city to another in the same way they did a century ago. It's good enough to get a laugh from, but not too much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The World of the End" is a clever sci-fi movie that keeps the audience guessing. It is also a very clever movie about an alien race that has created an artificial planet and then left it to be devoured by other life forms. I was so fascinated by this movie because it is so clever and the alien race seems very real and alive. The movie is about the scientist who travels to the planet to study it. It appears that the scientist has been abducted by a female alien who lives in a ship. The scientist is told that the ship is the only way to find out the true nature of the planet. They travel to the ship and it is a great set-up for the movie. The alien creature is extremely intelligent and it also appears that they are very clever and very evil. The scientists' job is to find a way to control the planet and to keep it from being devoured. Unfortunately, the scientists are captured by the alien and it begins to destroy the ship. It also attempts to take over the rest of the universe.   In this movie, the aliens are very intelligent and very intelligent.  They are so smart that they have created the world of the end and they are now trying to take it over.  I really enjoyed the movie because the aliens seem real and seem to be very intelligent (and evil). The movie does a great job of keeping the audience in the dark about what is really going on and what is going on the scientists.  The movie also has a great music score and a great sound design.  In fact, the music score in this movie is fantastic.  This movie is very good.  It is one of those sci- fi movies that I always look forward to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ The movie I just finished was a wonderful film about a young man who goes to a movie theater and then decides to walk the city. He ends up at the old movie theater in a small town. He sits in the front row and notices some weird things going on. There is a woman in a cage, who can not move. When she sees him she screams. It looks like a movie, but I found it more like a horror movie. I found the movie scary, but not the way some people did. I will watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a decent movie that has its fair share of bad moments.  It's a fairly forgettable action movie with a cast of pretty mediocre actors.  The story is a little weak and has some very silly action sequences.   The main characters are not interesting enough to be memorable, but they do have a few good action sequences (and they don't do much better in the second act).    If you are looking for a good action movie, then look elsewhere. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie follows a man who is in a coma from the battle of the Bulge and has to make his way back home to Berlin to visit his wife. As the movie progresses, he is approached by a young man named Paul who he seems to like a lot and who is on his way to his parents' home in France. The trip is delayed by a series of problems which seem to be connected to Paul and the Germans and which Paul tries to find a way to resolve. This is a movie about how people get in trouble in life and how it sometimes pays to keep your head down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. The movie is a great blend of fantasy, action, and humor. The film is about a princess who's father was killed, and she is forced to live as a knight in a castle. The castle is ruled by a king who is kind of a jerk. When a mysterious knight (Robert Carlyle) shows up, the king thinks he is some kind of knight. And so does the queen. And the knight has a weird ability that allows him to see the past. He can also change the future to make it like it was the past, and the queen thinks he can help her. And he does.   I was never a big fan of movies about knights and kings, but this movie really had me hooked. I loved the fact that I got to see a film that was set in a medieval world and featured knights, kings, and a princess. This film really had a good story and I enjoyed the action scenes and how it felt like I was actually fighting the knights. I also liked how the story ended with a little twist and some fun little jokes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic. I've seen it so many times that it's like a part of my DNA. It's funny, it's dark, it has a great soundtrack, and there's an ending. I can't tell you how many times I've heard the song "What a Wonderful World" in my head while watching this movie. The scene where a woman's car is stolen is really good. It reminds me of the scene in this movie when the man tries to get a woman to drive by his house but he doesn't know how to get the car out of his garage. The movie also features an old woman who has no idea what the world is about and has a terrible temper. I like her.   So here's a movie about a woman who can't help herself when she hears a story about a strange man and a strange house. The woman decides to follow the story and discovers that the man is a genius with a secret. The house is also very strange and there is an evil spirit that follows the woman everywhere. The story is a bit simplistic but it's the best movie I've ever seen.  , Rated: R
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was based on a real life tragedy, and the story is very moving. I did not like it, however. I didn't find it very sympathetic at all. I found it quite disgusting. This is a true story, and it's hard to imagine that anyone could ever be so evil that they can be in a movie like this. I guess it's just a movie about how evil people can be. I won't be watching it again, unless someone else likes it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last of the Mohicans is a terrific Western, but I'm not a big fan of the genre. The action scenes are all good, but the character development is a bit lacking. The movie is a little dated, but it's a fun western with a solid cast and great acting. I'd recommend this to a western fan or a film buff who likes the genre but doesn't love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is not good, but it is not bad. It does not have a plot. The story is not that great, but what makes it interesting is that it is about a woman who has to make a living as a prostitute. She has to pretend to be a man when she has sex with a client. She is a bit like a cross between a girl-next-door and a whore. She does not feel like a real prostitute, but the client finds her so interesting that she is not afraid to do his bidding. It is a pity that the film has to end so soon, but that is a movie which can be watched over and over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crimson Tide"  is a fun, easy to watch, high-energy, and well-produced movie with some good performances.  It's an old-timey movie with a modern, if slightly over-the-top, sense of humor.  This is the story of a group of young guys who have been sent out on a cruise to find a pirate ship that sunk.   The cruise is led by a young woman who has an enormous collection of pirate memorabilia.  The only problem is that the pirate ship is being chased by the government, so they need to figure out a way to take it out of the way.  Then there's the matter of the treasure that was stolen by the pirate.  So there's a lot to worry about.  This is a good example of how to make a pirate movie.  If you can't find a way in the movie, just leave it out and leave it to the audience to figure it out.  But once the pirate crew is on board, there are plenty of action scenes to keep you entertained.  While the story is silly, the movie itself is pretty well acted.  There's lots of jokes and action, and a good mixture of high and low humor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The idea of a man getting revenge on the man who has killed his family is a perfect way to kick off the final season of a show that had me in stitches throughout the first season. This show has been getting good reviews from fans, critics and even some non-fans (if you can call it that) since it premiered back in 2008. The story is extremely dark and darkly humorous, and the performances from the cast are fantastic. It's not often you see a story about a family that is killed off, but it's a good one. There are many memorable moments throughout this story. It features great acting, great music, and an ending that will leave you feeling satisfied. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of horror and who has a sense of humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is about a small boy who gets stuck with his grandparents in an old house in a small town in the middle of nowhere, where he and his grandparents have been living since his birth. The old house was a small shack, and the grandparents lived in a wooden house. When the boy was born, he was found by the grandparents, who took him home with them, and raised him in the old house. After about a year, the boy started to realize that he wasn't the only child living in this house. He would watch the people he grew up with go out to town to work in the fields, or to the big cities. He saw people that had lived for years, that had never left the house. The boy started asking questions, and his questions led to him being discovered. One day, a small girl comes to the house and starts looking for her grandparents, and she asks the boy if he has seen them, to which he replies no. The girl then asks the grandfather if she can come to live with him, to where he accepts. He then starts taking the girl into his home, and shows her around the house, showing her the things he had to work with, the house where he grew and taught himself to be a farmer. The girl soon realizes that the boy is a very intelligent person, and one that doesn't need to do much work, as he has the ability to grow things, make things, and even heal people, something that she never saw in other children her age. Eventually, she starts asking questions of the boy, and eventually he realizes that he is not her grandparents after all. He also realizes that her grandmother has died, and that her father is still alive, but she doesn't seem to know this. She goes to visit him every day, and spends most of her time looking for the grandparents.  The movie is very interesting, and I will admit that I wasn't sure about it at first, but it was interesting enough to keep me watching. The story is told in a very interesting way, which allows for the audience to really get a good feel for the character of the young boy. The acting was good as well, and in this case, the directing also made a difference, as it made me look forward to the next episode of the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie but I must say that the production is quite mediocre and it doesn't look that great either.   The characters are mostly pretty uninteresting and not that original.  I would have liked to see more action from the villains.  The story is pretty good but it's all about a couple who just want to have a nice time.  A pretty standard romantic comedy.  This movie is pretty bad and I don't know what to think about it.  Fantastic movies are great but not every one can have a fantastic movie.
