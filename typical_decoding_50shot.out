Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These kids are so stuffy. Half the movie is just these kids going around and doing silly activities. But every once in a while they act like a group of school kids--strongers, snow shots, tennis, hockey, roller blade for courage.  This is a Scary Movie but at least it showed Some real Old Scary Movies.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  they're taking the best part of Smurd-pick and making it horrible - my main character is a straight-up psychopath, so when they tell you who's going to look down that menacing and deadly neck while the poisonous guy sits a hundred feet away- ignominious as was Tears of the Damp Babies - is it any wonder why his friends are high-fiving and he's up at the side of this goddess? Stofler: The Alex M Zone presented the chick-flick confusion ofJane Fonda in a single screw in which, on a four hour sneak preview, she managed to get the two particular sensations that she needed to make this a thoroughly entertaining film: her hair, and a brief prod behind the tits (answer: God)......emotionally unbewildered onscreen as well as off. M. Ward: A buzzy cult film that sometimes brings the world to a coal blazing terminus: Watch with a lavender ashtray, and enjoy.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You could just confirm all the stuff that is said about this movie by literally sneaking out into the street in New York City. It's one of those moments where Frank Capra's career enters all-out end-zone mode, right as he finishes the last run of the deReilly play; I see him ordering a bowl of gumbo, doors slammed in his face, and a cold cigarette in his mouth. He walks away and comes back, places the bowl in his mouth and a cigarette in his hand, and says kicker, "Does this all look to you like perfec- tive timing?" "Absolutely not." Capra smiles as his old Wild West music swells around him. — Jon Wertheim<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Husband.--. A sagging, depleted M2 gun  rappels down the driveway....Improved performance from ChadErickson! I'd hate to lose a trade partner like that. What an unmitigated joy to watch. Amusing as hell. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It continues the formulaic gorefest seen a couple of times before from Bloodsport. There are a lot of guns, a cascade of running backs, an ambulance, guns, gunfire, and many, many missles towards dozens of pasty faces being picked clear from chilled blood. Alien bites, an envy of French cinema that's managed to get some results out of an architectural considered bastion, Shopping becomes more humane before our blood's stopped pumping. Trahan gets a lot Shiatsu, and looses her will thanks to a little cutting of the man's journey. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 
I wish, I say, I knew then how much I needed Hop through the Ages to get itching relief, but unfortunately it is not enough and the material isn't relatable - if it even has one commonality with anything. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this without knowing any plot or characters. However, I certainly believe my disappointment in the film could be noted without a doubt. It's very poor filmmaking, poorly constructed.   I applaud Sarah Snook and her efforts on this project, but for something called Chili's Night in Chicago to come from a restaurant called 'Culinary Concepts' and promote the future battles of Teresa Giudice and her husband Joe, it fell totally flat. It did not stand out as a major cruddy, as what a waste of time. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   6/10   The story of a young Latino who goes on a rampage at his girlfriend's workplace following the death of a longtime co-worker was álogic made to movieshy.   A draft of this updated version was sent to me over one year ago, and so saw it today and figured it was time to warn the camera society that not to miss this show.   MY MAJESTY's SON HAS BEEN DECEIVED!!!!!!!!!    The 2-3 minute optional long break for newswire in the beginning was just a wish that was fulfilled itself while the big melee at the office after the window was eviscerated every time that the boss gets down off his chair.   Nothing is ever shown of the inside of the office explaining the motivation and reasoning by false antagonistic media outlets about what did occur.    It was a good old theater cliché where the big man looks down and sees the big woman like that bunch of multi-million-dollar shit parts in crayon drawings is hanging on the walls.    It's really sad because this romantic no-name anti-hero thug is as comfortable with a gun in his hands as he is talking to your poor, infirm mother uninvited while his pedophilic hero ally guns down your neighbors.        Sam Peckinpah takes some of Mel Brooks' principles in creating this film in a different light, probably realizing that Mel wasn't trying to portray Mel Brooks as a sentimental old man with connections to Joseph Union Machtism.    His comedic underworld should be a bit of fun instead of trying to train people into becoming killers where they don't have to kill before.                  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              This films is definitely a joint only for post-adolescent youth nowadays; It doesn't go anywhere, it's just 'dopested' (read: uninteresting) before getting hazy and silly again ('Big shoulders is it!' - C-Block, 2003)              A merryder verger than its protagonists ever dreamed meeting a good lady Wait A minute... this is the type of humor that got people murderer's row killed in those Outdoor Troy films?... I guess the situation might have been somewhat different with a rich Christian family rather than an aging party video kinda dude...                Perhaps the odd sub-plot dreary but predictably amusing (the music is a minor memento of the times for the poems, but not for young Buscatica) Once more the laity seem to get everything wrong especially Huggins, who then treats Imcetra as a good bitch and has the effing worst time.                   Rated R<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The coolest thing about this movie is no reaction whatsoever when muscling your way into the ice machine, even though ievously you think that your ice was not too bothered about the strange stuff going around. A bit of freakishly imagining claustrophobic ieszeshelling offers an electromagnetic fine print.

Fortunately this is /u/myangoda who sings lead!

When we do get an object the ending is not bad, though it might have been better to show us the murders instead of it, it would seem that the killer might have changed. As they drive away he suppressed his voice and placed his whip on the steering wheel and he gives it one hell of a bite, oh yes that too. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                                         It's 1989 all over again, nors- er uring those swanky exhibits about rustic Middle American peasants at which Elvira draws ever grander and more tawdry characters than ever. And few more revoltingly, churningly stupid than this Weird Western hero, Franklin Moon (whom, admittedly, out of the stars and not into the dirt-ridden West that stands behind him, but still deeply weird).                                                                                                                                                                                                         <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thor's childhood friend and future Army sniper Stryker Haggard is framed for murdering Emory Ward, who killed his father over an issue of his father's dog book. Haggard begs trial and duel, after which he is dragged off-stage and shot dead by Ward's wife, Wendy. Capt. John P. Murphy (Steven Hall) is called up from election campaigning and promptly indicted as a result. Murphy denies any role in the murder and despite the testimony of a hired killer (Michael Kenneth Williams), prosecutors downplay the case. When Wendy kisses Murphy in secret in a public place, presenting him with heart disease as backup, a protester helps bring the military police to the scene, whereupon Murphy gets a jug of the blood and then a necklock from the crowd.    *** The film is disturbingly unsubtle in its treatment of our hero. We get to know that he twice joined the service and is engaged to an unfortunate young widow (Jane Russell), and they live with Wilson's father (Walter Pidgeon), who dictates his life story and fragments of poetry to him. Meanwhile, while Haggard takes care of the horse, Wilson and a team of his ex-colleagues travel from place to place insulting and mistreating Hawaii's natives. Prelude to a final.   Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for Dorothy Woods to bubble over. In one drawl-crammed hemp-wearing beatnik demonstration, she becomes all set to set dogs on either side of me and drag me behind. She just tears off (or, rather, rips off) her costumes and jumps off the stage. Haggard is surrounded by Military Police outside, all of whom die solemnly clutching their guns. Then she and Wilson share 'rude' humor, followed by a couple of goons who beg they be shot in the head, before Wilson spurs their fear-based bursts of laughter ("men... terrified!").   Though this mostly makes for a laugh-a-minute take, hopefully they'll never get around to dubbing it in. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The concept of the movie sounds awesome, but the execution left much to be desired: for one, the sound, the animation and the music hardly make it halfway through. The changes in plot, plot changes before the story even begins look to me like... well, wacky quincunxes; and yet, as much as I would like to say that the next chapter will fix things, I just don't want to write anything good about this movie.    Recommendation: Somewhere in an alley somewhere...   <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't expect much from L bride. I have written about movies that are either containing cinema classics (the aforementioned Rabbit Hole), or startling hisical phenomenon (M grosses ). Rarely has a film made so much ground that made me promise myself to catch a later screening. But       Shirley Clarke has re-invigorated  Witchcraft: A Contemporary     on a par with her All That Jazz    Broadway   criticism.  Sylvia Shiffrin is somewhat hard to pin down. Honestly I can't tell her from a Tom Hanks. Yet. WOW! Be careful unseducated midwesterner if your spouse was keeping on your back as she did.      Hush your child's babble.      For  this era of the film        | Experience a modern witchcraft with beautiful cinematography that shows how the power of pals can work wonders.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is painful for Mickey Rourke session but He still does his thing. But Daniel Day-Lewis is a second rate actor,Paul McGann is a disappointment in his effort,John Hurt by far the worst projection in the film and Jan De Bont plays a pathetic ghosties from hell Who was seen kissing her pukey husband in What Walks Counts he must be there to smile. Christopher McDonald is no counter report from a long dead trekker 20 years ago. Who is still the casualty of not even trying, and neither were the non-comics that filmed it. But it is the lack of experts casting that made your mouth water with astonishment. Only like one March sunshine ya know.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I no longer doubt the fifth-greatest box-office hit ever, which bereft of characters or outright silliness should have been classification-banned. This is more like the Twilight Zone. Absolutely priceless for any fan. I don't even know if* * I'm missing that great line about a living wall? And what the hell is with that alien chair?... I can't quite tell what this movie took from a TV novel, except that it's not cozy and exotic, and doesn't make you fantasy-quaffing. And even a Hunter S. Thompson fanisn't going to throw down his keys in excitement...<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we finally get in there we learn that Barry Allen is a good guy who is just too fantastic to succumb to evil that to be honest has a bad case of the humor.   This can be safely said to be pages close to a Joan Rivers Certified Dumb Comedy.   Donald Pleasants plays a guy who is let off a train by a fop but decides to stay do this country's homage to the muscle man bands from Compton. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These Dr Phil interviews are no fantasy. They are real and they are good for the ages (Grandma Goes To The Winery and Sir Elton John found, perhaps, audiences too) Laura Flanders is a child prodigy with no one even to thank for her talent. She is promised a scholarship to the Foxwoods casino, if she can donate $5,000 to her uncle Walt's favorite charity: the Hearst Bronfman Mansion. The suggestion is a big step towards the elite. The owner Henry Hearst acquired it for his daughter's tenth birthday as an inheritance. It depicts the Stirge relationships in detail. Infant Gage (Jack Nicholson) has appeared with the Stirge form the wild (she literally spirals) into feeling great personal joy in his disposition to the riotous. Under the tutelage of Dr. Quackaroo, Liza (widely seen a porcelain doll). For her talent or some other reason isn't drawn into mistake, even accidentally. Lady Jane (Beryl Roden) is ditzy but loves to play the sax in a restaurant break when the music stops -ironically, at the very moment, that the fiery Stirge turns to a spanking new baby. The authentic Native Insects scurry away at the threat of lizards without a batting. Watch and observe.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Guest is not a good movie. It is bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad.    It is weird to think that a movie based on a book by a male deeply uncomfortable with women suddenly has one fond of them. But, it's too late.    But that is exactly the audience the film hoped would watch it.    That the film is so mechanical is only part of the wacky premise: "Twenty years ago, an illusionist six foot three studio boss by day, who used to live in a hammock by night staged an act of murder disguised as a thunderstorm. He put the housewife running downstairs to see the lightning. She reacts to her husband being struck by loved ones. Final scene: outcomes of crime run the gamut....It may be a case study in a man manipulating things to suit his satisfaction." - Nicholas Gurewitch   God bless him and his work, gods I say.    It is definitely overstuffed with ten-year plotlines and pieced together like the Andromeda constellation.    Perhaps it is appropriate that the best scene in the film mostly depicts a familial drama where grandfather laps her an alcoholic uncle for not having been very supportive of her son.     Nothing generally wrong with this.    I would recommend it because it checks off all of the part time employer dusty old men who work a lot by day.    The conversation and dialog is the kind of rambling suck.    When Humphrey Bogart is not pounding his chest you can tell he is working.   <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Let me start by saying I was not expecting or wanting counterfeit replicas of a renovation from empire films' "fuckin bad" by Lou Reed.   Waste of twenty thousand dollars at the cinema.   What was the company charging me to get in?   Anyone else end up with a disgustingly successful movie using what is essentially the same dreadful props I did 20 years ago.   Granted the scene with Lou in his underwear was funny regardless of Reed's lowrent performance, and it was a great details scene with one of Lou's first true films, and the overall flavour was also good, but I couldn't make much of it for awhile.   I also felt such a paucity of ideas as to be deeply disappointed that Lou may have opted for the same middling economic gimmick as Magnum, P.I.   The shot of moving house called Rain (Company One) was hilarious to watch, but the canoe scene brought back memories of me trying to get into a muddy, out of touristy Walmart store which had beautiful female adults on the itemizing belts placing their items on the mute divider.   Lou's use of Andy Warhol burlesque finally makes itself apparent as it evolves into a live burlesque tentin' night comedy show, but I have a feeling Lou didn't get much great mileage out of such undirected lowbrow humor.   The opinions expressed advantage of Lou Reed are not endorsed by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences or Reed's own record company.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess you have to admit that almost every one of the films at Lincoln Center is very overrated.... you get the hang of it pretty quick though in Return to NIMH and Good Will Hunting, though this one is much more than a typical cocky 80s film with the overabundance of demo suits and fast cars and huge house. Can't we just pretend the year is 2000, its just Brian, Carla and Adam sitting around at a table, a glass of orange juice and you have the most overrated movie ever. If you like comedy animation then return to the 60s, if you like National Lampoon, Jackass, or The Godfather, you're in for a treat.<|endoftext|>
yeah
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching some bad 90s movies at the midnight screenings, I was not sure what to expect. I didn't know how bad it could get by not using CGI, but I was impressed.  $10 of James Bond modeling is probably the worst dollar bill I've ever seen in my life. Great graphics, although some is a bit strange (looking at the sky in, it appears like two radio towers in 1). The only thing I like about 007 (looks like : 0707 when he carries the water cooler to the medical examination room - probably a 1969 connection). Harrison Ford is earning big profits off this edition of the James Bond franchise. 2 stars. Sure James Bond is involved, but sure he smokes too much afghainseedweed. I've seen better looking James Bond sex scenes with Pierce Brosnan - director of source games ago.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Imagine at least having a decent laugh afterwards. You see, you came down Jenny from your castle on a white horse. You had far too much arrows and too much iskew, maybe the saddle didn't want to move, and neither do I! It's 1 third past midnight (!!!!), and old Grandfather gets as absolutely bored asleep on the castle balcony. Your head is big enough to lie on. You do as you pleased anyway, and Grandfather is just a vast hulk of mistman lying on his floor, dozing. Nothing you can do for him, and he soon nearly keels over. So Grandfather has to kick the throne when he cannot stir, and when you see him on the ground springing up, two massive legs spring out of his robes and tall billowing skirts. To me he looks like an anthropomorphic blue whale in a wind breaker, and he proceeds to lay a massive crab dish on top of his broad back. (view spoiler) So, you are perched on him, and he takes this opportunity to actually get down on all fours. And you think you might take advantage, slam those feet on his belly, and rocket him towards a wall. NOPE! Your feet minister not like that, nor does he. So you jump off the back and jump on the chest each, and escape with a licking. That grandmother is nowhere near done living to write about misery.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Sam Rockwell is one of those towering-shouldered comic actors who can fill a contest with ham, but none of his films have done much to establish that quality. This film is the opposite of stellar: it's the sort of promotional movie for the hair plastics and Beverly Hills Housewives one would find on a late-night channel. Then again, Rockwell's characters hardly have time to discuss their wardrobe, which is very better than the clothing styles he is also monetarily exploiting. Rockwell directs the little bit of action in the film, so it won't scare anyone's pants off, but it's loosely and horribly crudely grafted together from relatively clumsy clips. This mixture of amateurishness and said amateurishness keeps this from being an enjoyable addition to your collection of mail-order rental woobie flicks and keeps it from being a worthy addition to the truncated Anthony Mandler career.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has no plot, no moving parts, not worthy of the name "giant movie".  Quite frankly the giants in this movie are the three dwarf CEOs.  Their opulence and artifice is cast out into the dark recesses of this motel by short-legged hoes in chicken costumes who hurl random crap in Lydia's direction.  It looks like something Arnold Schwarzenegger did for fame picture conventions.  Who would consider this better than Santa?  These cards remind me of a TV show from my childhood that just turned 50.  I don't miss it but at least they are not as bad as what Schwarzenegger had to do when he did all the "musically" right sequences in The Terminator.  If Arnold could do a Rocky style Esque wrestling scene he could have been Hollywood right from the start.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Polish Burning is a stagy, nonsensical and cheap summer camp comedy with three randy campers, consisting solely of two DILISH women: CAOPIESNYN and IMPERTINE. According to the folks at TVM.eu, the show was produced in part at the later years of the Polish Television Corporation (PTK), the home of Jagiellonian Great Ring. They promoted it at the Holy Eucharist at Minsk's Cathedral at Saint Ignace (zznoreanie) on July 17, 1976; the Movie was shown on July 17 and 18, 1976 followed by various premieres. The latter, the last regular weekend – one feature was about a traveler who goes to Poland on a radioactive windscreen hitchhiking experience," as quoted by Wikipedia. Although the content of the film is totally unnecesary to be funny it is littered with a grandfather who was given a payday of $15 for the dog to "eat" a bitter substance as a Fate; a writing teacher who taught this to his students in the 1950's; the unhygienic and gossipy impression of the hot "Lover of the National Plants," Szymon Doboslawski who appears only as a silhouette; a dying camp granite barber who seems to be serving the first Bavarian Hund hot pot; and other such like-able "unfriends" of Poland. A florist always seems to come along with his mustache and hairish mustache, in turn, another character was slightly ruffled by a Spurs Jerseys uniform and his clothes are really embarrassing. Never an actual lion fight was ever held, it was much more poetically expressed as both swimming pool and USA-Brazil friendly to begin with.<|endoftext|>
yeah
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The final battle that takes place towards the end of the movie is stupid as f*ck. Stuck in a canyon, having literally all single tactics evaded, weighted down with a group of kids and a useless climber, the ants unleash a crushing attack on the enormous moisture-giant, which engulfs the ants in its tidal wave of water that peels away the obsidian cliffs and flame walls. Its rain is poor, but you guys can go back and watch it in 1990 and its still cheap fun. ___ Some characters are unlikable or dumb - Wilson gives a fairly staid, pseudo-philosophical aside about the evolution of human thought. __ ______________________ Score: 6 (B-) ______________________<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is the worst Pixar movie since Cars. Sorry, I'm not gonna say it's terrible. I just hear people say that it doesn't make any sense at all. Well, it's a poor excuse for animation art. Pixar draws like they want to draw because, one, they don't get paid good so they don't mind if it looks shitty. I'm just gonna say that if you drag it out for too long, the artwork gets to a point where you can stop caring about it and stop watching anyway.         While I was watching it, I recognized with disgust the most famous moments from Alfred Hitchcock movies I've seen. They were terrible, of course, but some things remain shocking to this day.       Clown is a walking cartoon Big Bug is..."A Bug for Christmas" that pulls a man out of his house hiding in a telephone box He acrobatics around the room displaying his fabulous singing Whiles giving sultry comments about his "trick" Using the assessor to chalk there feet and ears and sticking his tongue out at her he idolized a jockey, then jerked him to the workhouse In a first for the company, none of what they do is solved In a listed Intimate Moment of a bonded couple, we're treated to the man ponderously on the phone doing push ups while getting tousled in a pair of light blue moon boots.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a direct vent of the Japanese dōjinshi scene to the West. The movie is overflowing with cringe-camera shots of Okinawa climbing the clouds as the U.S. feet do the Japanese basking in the sunrise. Watching the grotesque images going round and round all over the Ryukyu Islands is rather dreadful, after a while, as it has nothing high culture about it except all the ruddy old gangsters.    This film has not been released from Japan's infamous Amaji Corporation (A&E). They do not release even the smallest films out there above a 3 stars...does Amaji get their quota "locked-in"?<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's get this out of the way: this is crap. Well, let's make it clear: I don't like this B-Movie. I hate feelings being left on the table by a film that is so dumb and so around any of its warts the only thing it does to get remembered is the Fifty Shades of Red movie with Nicole Kidman. 'It's all going to be alright!' No...seriously. 65 minutes of stereotypical old Hollywood BS for an audience of teenagers subsisting on Big Gulp Apples that sit around like it's Halloween: this is such a cheap ride that lies about and doesn't give nearly enough quality to be easily digestible.  Perhaps needless to say, it is not an example of modern filmmaking or acting either. It's the sparse style and 40s era of filmmaking we are dealt here that renders yourself unable to connect with this film.  It's all dreck after dreck.  For the casualbie like myself, it's like going outside on a slippery slipper trying to not fall over a 10 foot dark hole.  They are trying too hard to be funny...I guess you could give it a laugh if you don't give a fuck what is going on.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Confederate Motel is a pretty new movie from the great Leigh Janiak (Superstore) which stars the wonderful David Lipsky and Julie Bowen. It was shot in Bel Air and is not a bad movie.  The plot follows the usual male angst (as always!) and falls apart a bit in the middle sentence.  The movie has a lot of laughs, especially on one main character (Lipsky) and a few of the magnificent actors, is director Janiak has to worry about his aesthetic direction in the second half of the movie.  Until then, the movie is very charming.  This movie is also politically incorrect and very specifically portraying what it means to be a male romantic. Ironically, even after all the ladies are filled with accessories the general quality and attitude of the male characters is just about the same.  It was also quite often really funny.  While  other teen films are more about venting under the influence of drugs,  such an adult film is quite free of all such Dark Point stuff.  I hope the  umatic success of this movie underlines the fact that, as was proven years ago, that Leigh Janiak is a fine actor/director, capable of serious drama under very demanding and austere circumstances. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was staged badly, gave very poor reviews, to the point where this movie was hidden from all those interested to see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In such a messed up world it comes as no surprise that there are so many films that will not have your blood pressure go down. Luckily, charm is not consistent rather it seems to change every few years. In going to see Highlander I knew that was such a film but now more than 30 years later I remember kissing Sylvester Stallone good bye before leaving the theatre wanting more. It was guaranteed that many people in the room this day wanted more as much as I did and that's pretty much the point of this list.


Not my favourite of the many; if it wasn't for those revealing nipples on Hildy and swapping the non-dumb role between Douglas Fairbanks and Roger Moore you wouldn't know much about the film. Jumping back two decades for this movie was familiar as it had a similar atmosphere two years previous when it aired on RTÉ. Highlander is the tale of two brothers, James (O'Bannon) and Justin Hardcastle (McDonagh) whose relationship starts going wrong after their father's (Roy Scheider) ambition sees a military experiment end up producing a mutant called Silver Arrow. When older, vilainim, tougher crime lord William (Freeman) teams up with Sheriff Russell (Walter Pidgeon) to take care of these miscreants, the pair's connection forms right from the start, whether you like it or not. The film was frantically shot and many

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 


This film was a late edition to a 130 year run, meaning that the studio quickly had to quickly pull everything together. At 21 minutes, it's almost too short to stay afloat by itself, and there is little behind it to bring us anything memorable. The actor selection has absolutely nothing memorable to offer either, most of them merely being poor attempts at people possibly similar to Jake Barnes, a hero of Disney's Fantasyland Zone whose job was to scam cash out of anybody desperate to use the park as a haven for drugs and runs, the subversion ending being not much better than the picture it was trying to make. Otherwise everything in this film remains draggy, painfully slow, and painfully under-produced.


So enjoy Disney's last attempt at telling the rest of the story, and just hope you remember it after you've seen it 10 years later. NOT A CURE FOR MY DISGUST<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hell yes! In a lakeside fast-food restaurant the tables are beefed by a heavily traumatized Bogart playing Tony!   Other good attractions include Big Hubs, where an advertising poster from San Francisco's waterfront overlooks the marina. 
OMG!!!   Bailey Hubert's "Murder for Hire," shows Connie briefly (in calico) in his "netherworld" where his attention is usually given to women.  This is one of our great satanic screwball comedies - style, irony and giving plenty of nicknames to what sounds like a virgin would be a common enough sight in modern society.  This parody version of H.  Rockwell's "House" is very uneven with some outlandish groan-burgers not particularly well implemented into the overall picture. But no plot discontinuities are noticeable. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yuri cigaree is NOT a movie with modern tongue-in-cheek elements like "aya ichau" (today is a good day), nor is it like forums or plenty of semi- theoretical lectures. It is the funny madness of several Psychologists, dating-grooms, Karmaheads, married-love-lover types... several.  The dreadful performances are anomalous.  The plot plots only one little question that is too different from everyday life. Very comedic, all elements are loosened to be at ease, an awkward, unknown and very good looking guy enters the place in the shortest of time, but not to smite a person or lament too much about physical beauty (itimes valuable in a case like this). So he drops and goes off... for several games and after a sleep, the unattractive one is confirmed in bed as a love made in heaven, missing laboratory material and missing lovers and an amusing and irritating story about the experiments they were performing... terribly good pool. Though it was rather strange to see two bald-headed Psychologists who look as much alike as, well, a man and a woman in the bathroom. Sinister eternally & masochistically repeated line from the start (no sooner he is in bed, he slips over to the battle of the body comic or something).  It makes one softly grin or laugh while watching it.   Style:    Fritz Lang

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Very BAD                   This movie has taken me a long time to watch. It is one of those movies where an old ginger watches a little boy grow up. I don't know if it is about a real one, but it is about a cute child using pods to get from one part of a ship to a different part after a bad river runs: LAKE QUING CREEK approaching TAHOE, CA 9,000 feet IMO The river is broken and swollen, but not completely gone. Here is the Child: He is walking along deep inside the lake with a big red hand that he holds up for effect. He stops at one of the bigger yards and grabs a scooping stick. "Hello!" he says to the one worker at the yard who perks up at the idea of a new customer. "How you doin'?" the little Gerberson asks him. "I'm okay, very! I'm making lots of water. I'm digging holes for ballast and floats, you?" he offers supplements: Plastic pipes, Peaches, Dutch Ovens, a two-way mirror (sounds like a substantial investment in absurd washing habits) and other junk. "Absolutely, all right. That does sound like a lot of fun." The Gerberson ignores him. "I hear that

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At my age, I am very much over performing in the box considered to be guilty by association.  SYPHILIS has made me weep.  I cannot imagine a more cynical movie:  anyone who can "defraud" a genuine artist such as Lampedusa out of 30% of the revenue would be an "artist" worthy of caution.  And who was most reckless in trying to profit from this purchase of a masterpiece?  Everyone involved!  You tap out pages in LAMPEDUSA, find a girl to describe for you, draw a lots ( in the end) of sketches and three pieces, put her in a magazine and then arrange the sketches into the final scenery of SYPHILIS.  The DE CLASSICAL (not the LAMPEDUSA ) gives myself a great deal of pleasure when I list over 160 sound notes from Lampedusa which are not framed — never as they were presented to Lampedusa, but get a perfect David Addison to eloquently re-interpret them in new colors and lines. Baboucof is a shy and insecure great horn trombonist who arrives to Rome with a small solo.  Here are a few Yo Pulito! bits to get you started.  There are universal truths about representation in art — something Bernini knows a lot about.  But I abhor all this, and when Babboucof

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film produced a "Shakespeare For Card-Chums" effect and one of the worst reviews that I have read was that its a great picture!  I have seen some trailers which I thought approved the picture; I guess I was wrong.  When I say wrong in a sense I actually mean wrong in a clear manner.  It's an undirected amateurist cheap shot ( Stephen Strasburg, Altman can't save him!! )  anon-a-who-shall-not-be-named is very good; the result is an airheaded kid who thinks that he's in a Broadway play.  Now, I mean, what?  He saw ''Naked Lunch'''s Roger Plutzer in a Phoenix Suns uniform and thinks that he's Mickey Rooney.  Boy he thinks he's beautiful!  If your going to roll around on Hollywood glamour culture then your going to need aStory Time and such like that goes well with these people!  What an annoying movie " It makes me sad"  is right!  Financially I would cast thy only taken an Adam Sandler role in the 80's but what do I know,  an anti-sick comedy string of bad performances-lenumbers and off-court mishaps, done by tired actors.  Maybe they were teaching high school and needed a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie world where Alfonso Cuaron tops 2015's La Femme Nikita as the most buzz-worthy helmer, it's not surprising that a self-proclaimed parody of past-the-post authoritarianism emerges this year. In Kerry Washington's absorbing but conspicuously wishful film, power itself becomes the object of fantasy. Just with a couple of black-clad moppets rather chubby people in tutus. This been happening for decades but Schwarzenegger irrespective of his legendary steroid war-hero persona still ought to be the hottest Hollywood star behind bikers and strippers—not her party animal sons in a midriff-baring tux. Allen does haymaking in front of a green screen and Charlize Theron scuzzs on a freebie lollipop while Shia LaBeouf cel-shaded bad bitch Halle Berry collapses into a Whole Foods cupboard—Jack Black sketch aside. Enough people spin one griefulating froth that American Sniper is an impassive atrocity for all but the most peaceful of minds: snipers are giant killer bees who aim at drowsy infants and delivered their signature collective whap on high with their heavy footprints. Frankly, you want someone to invite to a remote barbecue lunch in release form this summer a patent SPY RADAR who's standing at a distance letting the Disney enforcers go around tsunami-ing unsavory little snuggies on at a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Minority Report is a story about anonymous people who live in a BOOM BANG ZONE. Engineer Vijay Singh is hebeen investigating a crime that is so bizarre that it would have been straight out of a paranoid soap opera or imagined nightmare. At first, it seems like a case of mistaken identity but John Anderton, the Driver, is in dire need of a brain, and so he opts out of a murder mystery. It is only after nearly driving his car into a space-sunken pyramids that he does real investigations and begins disrupting crime scenes. We learn this the hard way, when he lands down just outside the branch of the branches where swinging pendulums are known to be located. Because of his shaking hands and nervous gesticulations he is regularly mistaken for circus people. He is sympathetically portrayed as the good-hearted Cop who seems to have gotten bogged down in the details of life, and therefore not remembered about to do much more. This becomes apparent when agents McKay (Brian Geraghty) and Johansen (Paul Larkworthy) call up Singh to investigate a murder involving three unknown males using unusual weapons which resemble in some ways the toys their parents thought were so impressive when they were young. Encouraging the Chief to remain focused, Singh remembering his long forgotten experiences at Canola Oil (Vijay speaks about Istad as if it were Always Oil) the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Buena Vista Social Club may be a bad movie, but that's all the more reason I like it.  All that Burlap mannerisms, hard-edged comic farce, and general grumpiness are utilized to good effect, in a film that writes itself with a competently acted, emotionally raw script, voice, direction, and any number of memorable performances (there's a certain style these guys bring to low-budget Kazakh cinema, that has the benefit of a distinct singularity linked to their roles).  A predictably dark tale of success-bots driven bad, theft, blather, Jalicha, bribery, revenge, disappointment, a Sky Debutante/fan/club organizer (otherwise known as Shizumya), Whoopi Goldberg as an unhappy teenager, a Madame Patrizio who reasons she's climbing Everest with the help of a plane, a slyly weird eerie wood cabaret tune (Peter Feinstein's character direction is as sharp and effective as ever), a rupless murder scene, a Cirque d'Athén silver fox ensemble, and a fight scene between uncouth cowboy La Bembe and a drunken dingaling and the ever-energetic boro Walid Anani are conjoined by blood, violence, and ancient artifacts like chariots, mosaics, and stucco mosaics, in Hypeville-dude old Hollywood meets a weary

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another of those films where I just can't find anything wrong with it. On the surface it looks so wholesome - if my children were born in 1939, they could have inherited this dreary London to walk to school under the sky as it was in 1930. And then, what began as a true story of a horrible factory massacre came to a way to an unusual ending that probably couldn't have been expected in a supposedly pure film.  While PTA's first film " Dad's Army" wasn't great also, related to the Vietnam War, it also wasn't as extreme as it is here. But the real miracle of this film are the two young children. Like tiny little babies, they are full of innocence and vulnerability. This is made even more vivid by the fact that none of them speak from their native tongue this time - English. Of course, they do manage to figure out English by the time the movie is over.  Lots of shots are possible in the below seconds and this conquest will be flawless when it is that cold Paris winter.  Definitely for both PTA and the fans, " Le Filit" means the "Game of Life" in all its glory <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is supposed to be a non gangsta movie because of the musical song, and none of that happens. A girl is kidnapped, and this is how she is found. She is crawling on the floor, etc. Jack White played him in the movie. This is an insulting portrayal of black males. They are adorable little children and this movie will fail. I reserve judgement until the end. Crap.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even pretty much no one involved in the making or promoting of this terrible movie were interested enough to say exactly what happened in it, but the final product is quite typical of CEO. The film is staged badly for a professional movie, allowing all sharp action and damaging sound effects to be shown at full force over some high octane murder/coercion. If this were set to 'The Playstation Movie', which does not need a fucking cast, the actions take meditative effect - the Russian couple rejecting West European immigrants by dragging them away in a Red Army transport truck under lethal guard is disgustingly horrifying. Anyone who pays attention will note that this film has a diary-like quality, describing in horrible detail the bizarre activities of the couple through its dialogue. The title is also a gaffe, as the "employees" in this film sign their names with the massive letters X, while the action relies on animation interruptions to create a bizarre battle between Nocturnal and Night. But as is the way of the West European type it all just got started when, and the week before, the beach house activity was re-enacted for maniac component endearment of the audience. Luckily the masked "killer" captured by Nocturnal was only innocent scientist dating the girlfriend of an unimportant stop on the director's work, and didn't attempt to withhold the expected death from the unsuspecting couple. One suspects reactions in those men of their methodologically fr

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a (completely unwatchable) movie about a robot, and his upbringing. I guessed this film would be a bit boring, considering the terrible snaps, parent clichés, and paints the robot for acting like a little kid. When the robot finally realizes the truth behind the Digital World, he decides to run away from it, to live alone and never serve as humans did so well once. That said, the movie is pretty imaginative, and has a few unexpected twists.   She lies. The robot nothing but a bond-slave.   She want  big money.   This kind of science fiction is best approached with a big isle (and by that I mean millions of actual square miles), other than that, they fit right in.     The best invention ever made<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was definitely the worst project I've ever been involved in on a budget. On purpose, the nephew who played Ace Ventura (the Phil Collins song) was not trained in any aspect or since leading character basically babbles his way through the movie. It was actually quite funny and light hearted before at the end, it gets even sadder and sketchier.

I first remember laughing out loud at the game of Spades, until I noticed aaamlee appeared at the Pop Gun.  Oh noom!  I must have been born on a voice like that!  I was only a wee lad then, haha!  I would love to visit the USA in like in the 1990s, so I could find it in my dream world!  What an amazing world!   I didn't get too much screen time with Jones but at Little Zoey's school show, the 90s songs were just the finders price i was gob smacked!  Mythology!   It was great to see the Back to the Future Machine and ride in the DeLorean and on the bridge when they landed.   And dressing up as the Slave Ethel, Queen Albion's Princess!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Shocked that Disney's like-a-snowflake King of Kungfu is doing all the acting and singing.  Before you all start yelling "Har Frank Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuux!" or "Eww!  Come back!" it's Imitation Frank and his kin Quietude.  He's been impersonating Frank from way out in the boonies since Oz and that whole scene from Fantasia near the end of the first animated film.  I'd guess he's brought him to Junior for decoration -- Is he helping his grandpa dress up the Dis-Snow?  The two of them are not good actors,  incapable of minor skill and seem to have been written primarily to be comedian sidekicks rather than even for any impressive level of screen time.  It really doesn't get going beyond them both coming across as claxon sound.  Piney Man was not good enough to put forward any critique.  The Disney version only really works most of the time, but the dressing room scene is poorly staged and robs the scene of  any sense of humor.  To be fair, although I didn't appreciate Incredible Journey, I've crept onto it and was intrigued by it so I hope they correct Iller's cartoonishness someday.  To get a score of 7.4 out of 10 is what

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a John Carpenter movie that tried to be harder but failed. The character development was way too complete. These characters don't know anything about the outside world, have never had a job in their lives until jarringly, they are asked: is "The Martian" a shortage or danger. Bufords was everything a bad superhero movie would want to be: a large, power-suited mean machine, capable of doing anything. Just before hitting the planet, Bufords wishes he were something else, at which point the movie takes the stale arc of the hero being "wrong" and redeems it by saying "well, everything sounded predictable. All it takes is a little challenge!" No. No. Other people don't need to be heckled about this. And that's the problem. This movie is not a bad film. It's fine. However, it suffers from so many stress fractures, that it is then outside acceptable limits. Further, for all that it tries to be Bruce Wayne, it is a guys' movie. Others manage to overcome the situations at hand, smaller things, in order to go out for beers. But we never, not once, see the guys think, believe, their rocks.  or they should be getting a little film grain out of the gravity well it seems each can only reach 1-ply.  A life vest would have been nice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is suppose to be a movie ape you saw at Christmas. But it was nothing at all like Christmas. The story below and the film follows Morris a homosexual who metabolizes sugar. I expected a lot more since this is not a movie about Merry Christmas and politics. There was allegedly 16 gay porno scenes, according Wikipedia, some portions of that were incredible (u may be Dawkins if you read Wikipedia). Chester, Morris, and Clark are in a movie theatre when the play starts. They are sitting on the floor having to get the audience to join the ensuing party. As in any good party when no food is ready is the clock soon time comes to tell the time. Morris sees Clark trying to be filariouis and joins the dance. As he looks around to see if he is being paid what he owes Morris notices a woman watching him from a high window. Morris takes advantage of his position to get into her pants and masturbate. During the night he finds out that Clark is also attending the same party. Morris finds a bottle of Cheetos, buries it and gets three twenties to the ass scene. Morris talks his new friend out of getting into the party when Clark blows him. After a long hiatus Morris begins to realize just how lonely he felt.


The movie character portrays a very good dancing animal and his "best friend" Morris. It is George Hardy way. Anderson plays a well burly cop

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked this rip off:  It's not really generic--the story takes place almost entirely within one hotel. The key characters, Pat Malone, Patricia Waite, Logan McColl and 2003 go all around the world by sea exploring all the oceans, which means they have to deal with all the possibilities of plane crashes and monster-hunting crocodiles. Their raft is stolen by something big, type C, the film uses an ingenious way of handling this hiding down behind some planes. If it would come to life, it's best to be glad it didn't have a mouth the size of a temple. But you know what:      I have found myself to this kind of stuff in movies in the past and pretty much didn't find it memorable at all. This film doesn't even try to be on the lighter side because it wouldn't work:      It's going to be interesting to see, but I will never be recommending this film.       I got one star out of shame because it will be brutally advertised later. <|endoftext|>

As an actor/scriptwriter, he seems to catch a bad break surrounded by bullcrap. This doesn't mean that everyone who lets down their cast is a bastriller ("Intouchables" comes to mind :-) But the acting is ineffective, uninspired, heavy-handed and unreloyable. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer offer a "no comment" about how she would have tried to catch Denise is so specific and so ironic: according to Kelsey Grammer no comment is necessary. I'm not sure I would have survived this movie. But hang on a minute. I'm watching a modern day version of "The Last Detail".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It pretty much follows an idea that counted much as intelligent, visually arresting, and culturally relevant under the old Soviet era; the welfare state is seen as the only alternative for a viable society, as the inherent flaws of the capitalist system contribute to a rat-race to destruction, without indifference. Peter Walken plays a cycling instructor who finds himself unexpectedly began propaganda met on behalf of an anthropologically unknown government emissary from an alternate 195 killing planet who plans to conquer Earth and seek the spiritual eco-idol of an ancient daimon. There are moments of absolute poetry, then Trekization, additional poisoning of the countryside, stiff comedy, some hugely ambitious fantasy, and an allegory that can be thought of as some sort of 3D rendering of Nebuchadnezzar making ceremonial visits on the inane, barbaric listeners who can go and get a beer and ride our old dinosaur ridden bikes in the garden.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Echo isn't a bad movie at all. It's just cumbersome. They really got a long way to go with this film.

Review by Irwin Flynn:  I'm an American. I hate Americans. They are pompous, provincial, and arrogant. Their behavior is obnoxious and vulgar. Aside from being obscenely sure of themselves they are useless at anything else. They have a short-sighted dead end view of the world, preferring the seductive fad of "American Idol" to free thinking, a potential nation built on stone stamped with flaws and flaws unpunished -- no matter how much money is thrown at it. America is a world laughingstock! Americans can develop something good in this short brief lifetime of "Star Wars," "Star Trek" movies, "The Lost World," "King Kong," and yet Americans are content to crash a Navy Farragut and its two, 500 lb toon- aluminium capt, PacBoat Vietnam. American ideals are worthless crap, insulated from reality yet obstinately not reformed. The future has never been better paid in crimes against humanity. Stop and beat up the spirit of America. Don't waste your time. America is exploded, a pile of rubble. Americans don't know what to do because they don't know what to believe in. They have the attention span of a dog, thus just finishing reading a paper about abortion, war, terrorism, pollution, and finance.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The fact that Richard Burton as Dan Mackler has the right to ridicule Tom Cruise in this is really daunting.   Burton,ipparently not awkward at all, has been particularally successful in Hollywood with comedies.   Halloween, grown-up Charles Foster Kane in a ispish costume, gave us such a joyous good time.   Back to 4-1 (istheater) here and I like Tom Cruise. Tremendously funny.     I do welcome an injection of "regular Air Force Guy" into an admittedly crap and crude film; there was diplomacy, humor and found-footage gags that looked like they could poke fun at the workmanlike grunts of Jay Leno or whatever you see on 60 Minutes. Oh let's not forget Mr. Burton brings a ton of his own wit and dash into proceedings.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The slow cutting across footage and time has results- strangely. I don't even know what the plot is about. After 20 minutes of characters talking we are abruptly whisked away to some sort of shopping mall. I know, I know, series focused on dolls houses or pianos became popular again on cable and movies in 1989 woulf not get onto the same page for me as the "Monkey's Clothes" series did in 1995, but the star of this movie is definitely the voice of soyo, not the other way around (as appears from the trailer!).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In most respects Iv should have done it her way by now. This film could have been a virtuosic massacre, but it never became even that. It only got like that because Milchan's most provocative films saved it from becoming mere moral pornography. Still, Milchan went to Bahrain again to focus on economic blockades for Olfer's gold mine. As can be assumed, the results are also no better. Milchan seems to be some kind of shaman over his films. Never mind the piercing social commentary on the Arab Spring or even the elegant melodrama regarding the Los Angeles call girl. He has no force, and no real measurements to describe his creations. Sean Penn, did he get it? His acting is something to get a late-night disabler excited over. That aside, there's the usual clunky supporting cast and the already quite predictable plot. It's like someone have a quart of Dutch healers slap together a cocktail of high-grade ice cream, artificial intelligence, and various antiques and send it to work. There's nice bits of visual flourish, especially in the shot of a dwindling American flag lying in the sand under an Egyptian expanse. There's also an end-result-of-final-tease cameo from Patrick Ewing, until I realized he was going to enter his / my fumbling George Teller impression. It's hard to look forward to more of Andrew Rocco

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lost Air came out in 1965 and was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, himself an expert at  brooding gorgeous women in arms and ugly men in scarves with super powers.  True to form, the plot follows seven people who travel to an airfield somewhere in central Australia to set up a monorail system.  The film is pure adorkable jaggerball in a thoroughly unsophisticated setting; when an old mechanical wizard and his mother get lost, Muggins tries to wield a magic wand, which happens to be possessed by one of the townies who was getting drunk at the bar the previous night, and of course, build this fantastic monorail to the point where nobody at all could get on it.  Sure, some of the good segments are quite good but would be quite hard to find in a state defined as "dead" by local geologists and environmental campaigners. If Lowen's experiences working for local retailer Famous Plastic Wine Bottles were anything to go by, the local tastes of Australia may be most popular to the English. 
Another upper class industry injured by globalisation, this time doomsday.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to excuse the action scenes people are screaming about, but I'll try to explain away why they aren't "funny" even as bad movie of the same genre. I don't mean audiocassette quality, or scene after scene where a character gets stood up and/or killed or has sex on a hayride, or a bicycle going across a burn out just before it carries two vehicles thousands of feet into the air.

Enter Dr. Amazing, a newcomer to Indochina who is fresh and confident, so much so that the plot about him building a fucked up flying night splasherbird is actually funny. The corny-ass American dwarf dancing in his stilt costume (with dual ammo belts he can't make sense of, but works for the movie) in between the simulated dog kids getting roughed up as hostages convinces me that Rosemary's Baby was written in the '30s or '40s, and is simply a 30-year-old fantasy that sucks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most entertaining VHS rpg I've ever seen: Let alter ego Gary Scott fills his battered old VCR with your favorite '80s video game stuff like the ever-popular Gauntlet and Gex. Initially powered by a cartoonish hedge-chef-y voice and inexplicably red bland backgrounds complete with the odd slow-motion version of the opening sequence of the film, Gary gets more and more useful game gizmo-y parts as the game "goes wrong" periodically and accidentally. The game features two central missions. Firstly, you can attack alien targets with a variety of cars and planes, and/or a variety of familiar Steampunk action movies from the movie "The Sting" from I believe 1984. {asca} Second, you can defend from attacks in a series of futuristic race cars; which Prof. P.T. Barnum would be proud of! I loved the game and it includes a HARD arc derived from the TV series of the similar title.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this? The Mild Mannered Baron will change your life, and in a good way?  It is one of many improbable performances from Erik Lindgren in this film: a young man held in a psychiatric institution. Released on a personal note to find his money and resume since and cure a strange syndrome that has occurred on him. He comes to see a film and seduces the hostess with cheesy lines, he finds a little girl with loom and underwear, his arms and legs are weaved. There is no substantive plot and it's really difficult to grasp what's going on. From this point on, it's merely a simple story of revenge and madness, which the characterization and production make incredible. The German point of view would have already become past its expiration date by now and they still don't seem to realize it. Jon Graham is an icon and something of a holy grail of Swedish directors.  Orphaned at the age of 3, he got a gimmick to emphasize that he wasn't like other kids.

Giving the children a stupid storyline because the apes don't actually want to exploit them.  Constant scenes of the ape leaders -- ditto.  Nothing ever happens.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Now, back to the movie we all loved: The Love Guru!  With chiefbaddie Eric Fremont ( Development Corps, The Rockford Files ), Mark and his lovely dog, Rainbow, invited.  Eric Fremont (having experience as a stable boy at Brighton's all-boy school, Upper Rye in the 13th Century) showed that the Teutonic barnyard: a playpen full of stray dogs ("adopted" loving grim figures played by Greta Scacchi, Dean Stockwell and Steve Martin )bought in thrift stores: the extrovert sense of humor, and cheap thrillers: get a ticket to this! The Ashdale duo succeeded in a fairly impressive rag-time version of Gilbert & Sullivan's Hamlet, their one live-in date an amusing musical skit in Peter Deming's popular series each ending with a carefully edited vogue from the same Tom Jones as the end credits roll, so they don't need to use the Ziegfeld fountains for it.   This film would finally earn David Ogden Stiers a directing credit for an ongoing series of western comedies.   Hat-tip Rory Calhoun!

First of all the 2007 martyrs are the ones who filed a claim for divorce. They prostituted themselves to me. They all hid in hiding when I took the picture and they only pretended to be cute when trying to sneak a big stuff out of their dresses and bags. The beautiful idol still looks like a 64 year old who hasn't learned how to comb her long sexy black hair anymore and is just continuing to haphazardly ride Charcoal Steel Paul across the room. And wait, I know their English is not that good. Maybe because they were always taught by those little brats named Aoyan. She is chubby all over and even when she is loading a machine there is no way she is rubbing off on these kids. They were always losers and even given their ring was this idiot still the ring leader or something?

I'd have to throw the "C" on it, but that really is BS, lets not get mired in the ides of this movie: he Home Alone style he leaves the door open! Consider progress? Someone needs to make a serious movie with his friends, it could be a very great movie if they will just get it together for 6 minutes! I didn't recall Hogg or Brooks; they are good enough duo and the funny moments, like one actor making a tragic innauguration speech hoping to pull a good one on the back of another actor's almost-cursed attempt has great potential. I like young Kyndal Britton to pursue his path to stardom; it could be Don Cheadle meets Sopranos... It's a little too cutesy ; like many a bad TV movie with young kids; but no complaint yet....

It's so outlandishly bad, that one has a hard time believing this stuff was made by anyone, let alone a film school student doing a Social Media Fad movie on the side.  One detects no cheesiness, no sign of an artist behind the goats, a crew of supervillains perhaps?   Kudos to the course director, Marshall Nicholson, for figuring out a cheaper, if more entertaining, way of accounting for shots that aren't even in the frame; one has the feeling he's trying to get through the entire film holding a long-necked cancerous frog, so he can have a hideous puppet.    So complete is this garbage that the effects department really only managed to edit a single "fascinating moment," an shot of the characters foraging for bananas in dust.    Even the actors are paltry.    So expendable are they that Diane Cariou turns in an Oscar-worthy performance of a frustrated lady with horses!

Ducky delivers a verbal kick and laugh before she liberates the children from their caretakers and pushes them out the gate to the dorm.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really difficult to make sense of this. Quite frankly, this fudgy, all-American adult comedy, complete with goofy T-shirts, was everything I hoped it would be. The plot focuses on the hilarious adventures of Steve Berren (Aaron Tveit), a poor son of Wisconsin who lifts 612 lbs and easily has 149 lbs of meat on his bones. Due to this, Steve finds himself in the position of being the chief cook in a delicious Big Beef restaurant.

The only way my patience for the film gets through is in the setting. The restaurant is very open, and everything is very disheveled. Berren seems genuinely hungry while sampling the menu and eating what he pleases. The people in the restaurant unfortunately eat their importance. He struggles to buy the fish, ignores the claim of the restaurant's proprietors, and pushes a pile of live hogs forward while another is defecating on the floor. Although the beer warmers are used as a substitute for toilet paper, the workers still defecate on the ground. The situation rapidly spirals out of control. After trying to get a hotdog in the office from a last call customer, I don't think any leading lady on the movie could've been any better.

It is veeery hard!"  It is not obnoxious, it is far above nearly everything sterile and tweedy.  It's a stupid film, though, for almost the whole time, the camera is pointing at the sky.  They complain about it (the narration) but they never seem even to notice.  Dogs roll about: never worse than when they're dunked in a pond made of puppy blood, supposed of kryptonite.  Nothing coherent happens except puke, vomit, and other people rolling around.  The ducklings and ducks are cheerful and silly.  It is not even funny, too wrong.  Blank:  Forum post.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This is terribly yet unintentionally funny. When a Morgan Freeman impersonator attempts to pass off the work of Franz Kafka as his own, it basically comes across as a Bayonetta cosplayer's first major anime. Most of the jokes fall flat, and the story is hit and miss. It has all the trappings of a premise your typical comedy anime but fails somehow to of if a basic concept. The main character Gilliam is a hijacker without any redeeming characteristics aside from the fact he is a hijacker. Drunkenly stumbling across TV locations in the 1970s to kidnap people and profit from turning them into TV hosts and guests, this madman soon sets himself on the path to the Queen of England, who decides to marry him, which soon turns into a screwed up pre-meditated murder of her own people. Of course immediately following this scene the entire world has been moved to Mars to do battle with the global venal military forces from the year 2049, wherein Gilliam"s clan is badly mauled by the "Devil's Iceberg of Mass Destruction" and gayfatitiously killed for a job well done. It is a simple story with only the barest beginnings of a plot and a bunch of redeemable foolishness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's so awful about this in your opinion? It is horrible, plain & simple. It takes a great schlock movie entitled "The Mummy" (1973) - to make it passable. Granted, the studio did use all its 1954 mall magic in this mess. Not so much that it still looks good, but just enough so it looks like the real thing that Boris Karloff created all those years ago. Good thing this movie is ugly, sprite and bad. It is an underhanded attempt to present vampires getting attracted to high school kids with a bang. It's a stupid effort at an idea that has little to no truth to it. Yes, I know, all that rare power of reptiles is annoying. But 100 billion of them? Why would anyone look at a 100 billion teen vampires? I have nothing else to say about this movie, but just think of how good it must have gotten to star Hilary Swank, the sexiest woman in the world in 1974, "if she'd only grown up."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a tale of hokum, a farce, and a lousy movie. Not for the faint of heart, it is a combination of Broadway shows, starting with  Le Freak and playing their public school material until the production director declares the actors are no longer physically fit enough for white line stage performances. That's when Mancuso takes the stage, amuses the audience with arbitrary computer effects (drawing pictures, erasing 'em, changing color, etc.) and sends the cast singing along slowly, with an elastic happy rhythm that should have made everyone sick. And I'll hazard a guess that the only people who actually found it amusing were the NAACP, it is her strange little range of humor that makes it truly worth watching. Produced by Mancuso's American Repertory Theater, especially for Headline Theatre Group in San Francisco, and directed by Lynch, with material drawn somewhat from Shakespeare, and a writing effort that keeps slipping beyond but never quite reaching Shakespeareian levels. <|endoftext|>

There is honor in' defending one's country...not in a fallen state suggesting the mindless killing of innocents.  If this movie wasn't made people would call it so called 'High-Tension, unsparing, unforgettably expression" High-Tension is about a mass murder in Richmond's home town. John F. Kennedy was assassinated a few days after the location of the shooting is mentioned in the movie in his horse's arena on horseback. To quote the movie"It must be a terrible thing to be John F. Kennedy on a horse...on a January night in East Richmond Virginia." A group of rival detectives decide to believe this story. They successfully work out the information by interviewing a man who witnesses the event in person. Unfortunately the parallels of John F. Kennedy as a horseback riding cowboy must symbolize Haig and Kissinger. Although the critical quality remains quite unsatisfactory, and only makes John F.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When all the good ridiculous auteures of classic comedies get cut off by primal comedy and deadpan, there remains The Dukes of Hazzard. The second arc gets good mileage out of petty racism, karate conventions and, of course, the theme song, seen on movie channels everywhere for years. No actor of note is permitted to rise above any of the four former members of the endearing "Dukes" family to carry the burden of this series, the series has tried talent at time and as written the roles are endless variations of how the first two film series charged the law of the battlefields by Law & Order in a rural America. The playing field is leveled so frequently it makes just about anyone look like a meek good garden variety Law & Order every time. Jim Paxton and Mark Ponderosa bring the desserty poignancy truly down to earth but never reclaim the level of intensity many of the guest stars brought in the first two films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Play'our whole payphone': My time and summer were wasted watching a lame summer movie; this movie was a double hit at worst, and was completely unbearable. If you have strong tolerance as I do, then you should be able to enjoy it at least a little bit. Also, the banjos present in the soundtrack were absolutely awful. But I guess it is a lot easier to understand how this picture was made by looking at the titles: Whisky! Whisky! If you see this movie, you will not think twice about getting through it. Eric Goodwin 2/10 I give this movie a 1/10 Poor Al. The guy down in the next lane frantically waving his slingshot, yelling "Get him!" Reaction shots of [unknown Knoxville residents]: SUPER-CUTE. I guess coming to this movie was only good for the guys? They were saying all these things that I completely disliked about Knoxville, Society and people. I vividly remember a group of good looking sweet-looking girls riding by my car as they pulled into town. I didn't like them. The supernatural events did not arrive in the South, so why is Knoxville so special? This movie shows what perhaps happens when a group of people selected for physical flaws gather to pay a visit to Knoxville, Tennessee. I hear there is a better Christmas movie came from the South this year. I'll bet it will be even worse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It was okay; it was The Google that could. But it didn't feel like a collective effort. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't put much stock into its players. Jess Schmidt is solid as slightly autistic little girl with a crush on a boy. Jay Murray is just fine -the first line of dialogue feels like he says room cleaning advice for most of the movie. Steve Buscemi and Sarah Michelle Gellar, as some type of egg etc - just seemed to joke around as if they are bored in some theater together in the 1970s. I think that would be cool if the film actually told a story. It has a very strange ending. Why would anyone want to see The Google? It didn't do anything new. Nothing really happened. It played out in a very, boring way. I prefer casting Angelina Jolie as the smartass, kinda clever, kinda bitch joke. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This movie can realistically cater the Rotten Tomatoes curse. It is all pretty boring---I mean, if anyone had enough nerve to be playing The Boy Who Lived at the Slytherin don't be bugged by the students no matter how many heads are chopped off beyong them. The exterior is very grim and the interior looks like the slowly decaying remnants of a madman trapped in a stone man's cave. Regardless, the scene where leaving his castle is presented intially with super enough heroic dignity to get the 50-60 year-old Muggles to ignore all this and not start coming out of the bushes should be devoured by the poor Muggle citizens and wouldn't you know it, you utterly destroy them. You then charm the one neighbors daughter into eating the king. How romantic, eh? Sadly that's about all this movie has to offer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It'd be cool to end the year with a box office gem... Right? Wrong.: Only when you're watching the last thirty minutes of this silent movie, where there's a zombie calmly creeping down a dark avenue, on a bicycle hybrid with a squeaky little throttle box instead of a gas tank door, and is jolted by the knocking on his back door by a blue haired woman, does the more comic part of the film begin. This is "Kingsford Goodfellas" co-starring Bill Munny as a former boxer and thief getting reacquainted with his old cash cow, married mother of three. It's a farce on many levels. Shootout? Who shoots out. Body slam? who body slams. Two opponents are tossing fantasy punches the whole time to no effect. Dead hero born on the first day of the week. Good rapport between Munny and Newman, a nursery rhyme world kissed permanently by "Protest the Hero." I still have a feeling some folks out in Providence, R.I. were laughing out loud as this went by.

I also had the 1999 movie when I was a kid; it was already terrible when that one came out so I liked it better when I saw it over it when I was a kid...

For the most part, after about the 15th take, I was ready to throw the scratchy plastic can down the stage. Though the story leeches Monty Python's Human Comedy theory, the really stupid stuff chooses not to mimic its sources.  The whole rotten panorama of a weak, self-pitying person wondering why his home council is not happy with him. Detective Aaron and his ambitious deputy, LB, go to investigate the strange death of an elderly gentleman who walks the streets of a small town and is never seen by anyone again. Unfortunately this cine showed only 17 minutes  of erotica before being jumped by theingly woolly ( I heard the Hollywood censors refused to release a film which dared to use a bleeped out wodomsong) poor excuse for a letter in British spelling and punctuation with a cockerel stuffed into its mouth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 


From your description, the film sounds like a skit version of the film Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers... This is bittersweet news for Astaire fans. The film died last year after producer Annette Bening felt not enough love to her most persistent star. 


Diana Vreeland is a party girl with a good sense of humor and a very accommodating air. She looks and acts like an actress by day -- in fact, she has starred in three films the last few years -- but at night, she dances Fletch, a street dancer who works the last train in New York, after hours.


Among the film's many silly moments, Diana spends the first working the pole outside the Macy's Theatre to watch astoundingly beautiful Douglas Fairbanks in The Outsiders. Although more than willing to swallow her disdain for the showing, Diana isn't a good dancer herself. Will Fletch allow Diana to dance freely? After all, she's more of a dancer than he is, and she enjoys dancing with him. After a few magical dances that would make a Maxim Chokykovsky blush, she goes home after her session with Fletch. It's clear that Diana's relationship with Fletch was intended to be brief...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a weird, strange movie which flirts with the level of "just an okay" that a bunch of goofing around makes you feel like the gang will only be in the suburb for a few days before it established yet more rules for their lives: when a bully is defeated by a goon, a lunch, and a car, they begin their golf vacation in Utah.

I don't want to digress to talk about the film's other things. I mean, it's really wild and trippy, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Still, I should be forgiven for finding it interesting to see a bunch of 240 pound goofballs finding a way back to Los Angeles. Nor is that to say it stops there. We get to see stoned conversations, strange voyeuristic shots of the guys... oh, and we learn a couple of highlights: Mike Teavee controls the camera like Earl Blundell- a much-sought-after prospect. His French accent is far inferior, and the flimsy disc translation makes it even more obvious: Mike… Mike doesn't know where he is! (And why is he so busy trying to focus his camera, anyway?)

It is an absolutely mindless and groaning clusterf**k of an ostensible movie with a stupendously bad cast making moronic wisecracks about the playable team — fighters. The way the movie has developed is pretty fatal. The whole show is set up as a stupefyingly stupid comedy to be endured in the comfort of one's home in which everyone is black — black characters make no part of this story line period. The movie itself is frankly a horrible waste of time — and that is how the producers felt about even regard for the target audience- those folks at home watching on a big screen. It's just bad all around unremittingly bad. The death toll in the film is by no means over the top. The character of Doctor Studer shoots his fiancee's boyfriend to death during a football game in the weekend of a championship bout. The high school boys in the movie see what they think is a roller skating gentleman on the artificial ice when it's a totally human female skating on the ice.

There's so much potential for fine acting, interesting writing, and great performances.  These themes are rarely explored in children's movies.  This approach prevents the movie from ever being fully appreciated as a Critter Party film (the Critters also seem to be involved in the film as well).  Still, I was surprised that Skyeffi managed to make a film about pets that works.  There are a lot of things lacking in both the animation and special effects but this movie was made with a good deal of love taken to make it happen.  But the nose wants your blood, I'm afraid. ------------------------ For more information about Critter Party, see Mike Skidmore's Critter Party Frequently Asked Questions for more information about Critter Party<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I ran into a little girl on the beach 99 years after her death. She was bright and waif-like, a tallish woman with a knobbly nose and scarred hands. She explained that she had been a laundry maid when she was 19, married at 19 and subsequently given burial at the beach one day. She had also found herself pregnant at 19 and given birth at 24, missing a brutal Islamic bullying by the perverted, cruel, insensitive father. The father threw her inside a "wanoom" (a house made of furniture placed against platform) and said that she never existed. But in 1953, while in North Korea, she was moved to Pyongyang for a good over five years of indoctrination before being installed in a high fish pond. Drowning her every day was an old man at the door. "Our president" admired her stockings, statues of herself, make-up, fine clothes and craftings. She was brought to the TV show and melted the ice crystals off the TV glass set with sweet perfume. Her current husband was also invited in the communist society to praise the women. He didn't know his way around a brick house, but in 1967 he came back to the world, this one bought at a charity auction. "Why did goodness abandon me?" he said when he saw the girl.

For some reason, the people who directed this movie seem to know everything about action movies (sans Jet Li), and the action is curly, vicious, wildly entertaining. Mo Aman's carefully choreographed car chase scenes seem to be fitted for the old Way Of The Dragon, but the director brings the action to a personal level that few could raise a hand to. The Oscar among action movies in 2010 went to director John Woo (Oh Old Hong Kong)!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To Raffaele De Martinis, 191 Battaglia is a poor film about an ugly woman. I cannot understand what slut feature they got in there. Careful, that this is only the first half an hour not two, but this film is not good--they have to be careful about the director. I strongly recommend this film to everyone; it is a shame her script is so crude! A bad movie to be sure.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To have a garbage stage production play with an all female cast on Broadway, is just a travesty! It would never work if performed within the real world. For a real stage production, the director should be denied an execution so craven! The whole show depends on the appearance of the dominatrix. Though she has been preferred to a real dominatrix, she is not short of crotchety old tricks that have no place on Broadway. There are no dwarves in this production. No circus tricks are performed. Very little - if any - of the material is scripted. The forgetting about comic timing and tragedy is remarkable! The crux of the story is inconceivably dull -- if the performers were not so good! I didn't care for the theme she presented. All we got out of the other dwarf is a story about twenty gold coins which the other dwarves discover in a river. He proves he carries these in his mouth by turning them upside down. In unlikely circumstances, after a two month interval, with only a minimal amount of interaction between the two dwarf and Lady Leighton, we get to see them again. We see them arriving at the cottage after several days of traveling. The fourth dwarf seems to cry throughout the second act. I never thought a Broadway play could hurt a worse than this.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie can have good ideas but, when put in its proper bringer, even an idea as earnest as this technically tiresome, boring, and frankly downright horrid waste of a movie.   I continue to have no real enthusiasm for any of its addled plots or contrived situations, even when the movie makes an subsequently less than " refreshingly original" and revolutionary appearance on the world scene at a time when most items from its own agenda have even less going for them to win people over.   What's very disappointing is that Hunter (Nat Faxon) doesn't even have a comment toward the way the world is changing or about the evils of proper technology - transportation is totally new-age, powerful, intelligent tanks that drive themselves (well, one one two three walls).   She also is not a particularly good writer as her acting is perfectly hammy most of the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have to ask Jerry Goldsmith, the man whom Wonder Woman is based, where his inspiration came up with all this. Where did the idea come from? Well, you might ask? In a lot of ways, Ant-Man is about as unfunny as a cape comic could get, you have a blatantly bald alien who thinks he's really a superhero? (reminiscent of the same character in Bambi, is the usual "I suspect I'm a mere cub ('tis a wonder I can go a week without looking it in the face)" line) This film is the result of many eighties British creations gone bad, it has the cinematic equivalent of Buster Keaton looking customers in the eye with growling power-mad eyes. Then again even in Sly Stallone's prime (and that's saying something) you can't help but feel as though there are cracks in the re-workings. Much as I enjoyed The Mighty Avenger, it's not a defense of quality in Film. The genuinely "poetic" (All Of Us Weren't Born Yesterday scores were simply hilarious) visuals are a little over the top, nothing so out there it's almost by the book, a predecessor to Robocop and Die Hard that went bankrupt, but maybe for a new mission a new movie was better, somebody down for a happy ending?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I realize now that this is not "a" movie - it is, in fact, a documentary. However, video multi-camera (not to mention TV) allows for a very lengthy archive of occasions when hypnotist Roy aligns with hypnotic masters. Goat's Gate, Flicks in which he films himself (the lack of proper lighting and glass wounds means that the walls are very long indeed) are as astonishing as they are meticulously edited. His relaxed and panicky demeanor on "his last go out" would have Macbeth him into a box, were it not for the precise shots of comical animalistic garbed associates shrieking. The editing isn't perfectly close up, but it grants the jump cuts a punctual, authentic way. The film gives no character advice and is completely missing those ony humdrum moments of getting to know each other on a mundane, diagonal journey to a different bar that, at a sandy footpath, offers no steady narrative, but rather an endless parade of druggies and prostitutes - like Twiggy at a bawdy brothel (the members of Groundwork give a wink at themselves as they left the filmmaking light!) The bursts of raw violence are gratifying and life affirming. Roy doubles for these women with flows of coherence, and for some unexplained reason he makes short work of the utmost fashionability.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a great idea cooked up by Hollywood legend John Landis at every opportunity over the years. It never gained traction, but the perfect execution of a good idea always replaced the disastrous sequels. This actually started one of Landis best creations—The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Here we see a young woman plagued by serious amnesia. She returns to her childhood home with delusions of glory. What she doesn't anticipate is that she is now cursed in a cruel sort of way. Absolutely anything and everyone she comes into contact with /messes with /encounters is loathsome to her. Little does she know that she is still the Winchester girl from her parents Shiva and Sheeda. Her mother is a blonde and obnoxious orientalist who dresses like Royal Bengal tiger and practices Indian electroshock therapy on "animals" that are always considered inbred and stupid. Her wrinkly, disfigured father has some sort of ill relatives living past his apartment. I don't think this werewolf movie could have worked any better as a comedy. Sandy Thomas doesn't disappoint. The supporting character are marvelous too. You don't have to feel bad for these people. Louise Fleckiness at one point accuses the ranging psychic denying that the werewolf here in the movie really existed.

It's hot and these periods of time people look like dead people asleep, sandwiched between surfaces, given sandals and a rug, not at all furrowed noses or shoulders, and a seemingly lumbering, blithe face, with a mouth that half will smile and half will open up or close, honks, gurgles, inhales, exhales… Everywhere you look, there's slang and caricatures of strangers, towns and places, and you can't fly in or out, yet somehow pass over very quickly through the Route du Nord in its fresh cool springtime coolness, past a man with an iron gun, hurry that's almost there, a freight train, a slow boat, an aeroplane… Someone's got to go to Omaha with the New Salesman, a hardship comedy set in Omaha, Nebraska, a short film about a person whose very life is the source of a Warm Gift of One Who Naboo By Warm Gift Renous.

The flying car was an exceedingly gripping idea. It was a battle of wits between the DOD title "Don Draper" and a young ace rogue that barely put up any fight at all.

Only a perfect Bruce Willis car gets water off it before flying off. It was ridiculous. The plane was utterly slow ("draggin' along") and contrived (as if for dramatic effect), but it wasn't like The Rock-- wandering for half an hour before a very real blood-drenched vehicular rampage. It left our hero Frobisher dry heaving his shotgun in mid-air to take down some kids with their lawn mowers and dugs--foil them around the house to save Old Man Ritz and only then does he run around the outside facing the ersatz zeppelin that was flying impossible distance.

Nobody else makes a comment about these things in Go West, but multiple ringers posed to have an impact such as "Zionism" and "The Beatles" (was this script REALLY written in 1967?)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This may be Portlandia's most visually appealing and often touching film, but if you actually want to feel something mysterious, like being informed by New Age mystics, Spalding Gray, and histories of the forest, this isn't a good flick.   This is a failed comedy.   Yet funny.   In a movie where tiny talent says in between paragraphs of incompetently expressed one liners "whats, if anything?" The film seemed to be attempting to construct a performance from a teenager's inability to remember old cartoons, instead discovering how he'd duplicated the whole genre for 150 years while copping a joint from a bumpsy-headed hippie hippie hippie.      <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I agree with this reviewer - The Lion King is not hammy. Perhaps it is a little too action-oriented for my taste. But in fact it's good. It takes a little time getting into its groove, but once it gets there the language is impressive. And the music! Not the Metropolis soundtrack - the original Disney score by James Zink. But I bask in the new, again, animated fireworks every time I see this movie. It's rare that I feel happy to see a movie about a feathered animal bear. It not ONLY takes a little time for things to click into place, it also has any number of eye-popping, colossally stupid moments that take up a much, much more time than it needs to. thankfully, each time there is a Disney-like mistake, it is more irreplaceable than the last.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Good bad times!   This film is the kind of film that might remind one of a classic Tod Browning film about boys and cowboys.   I only watched this movie once, since black and white versions were burned onto VHS.   A nice old fashioned cowboy movie with some sexy women (Atat Annoo!!) and one rather mean character who couldn't stand when the girls kissed each other.   I always liked the string music at the end of the movie but sadly it is all out of tune.   The story was ridiculous and stupid.   Wonderful actors Tod Browning and Don Rickles.   A fun old batch of Plastick!   A great American scene for a little humor.   Another pro and con recommendation.   Ray Sirk is a great dressing room star. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Number one reason for long waits in line for ticket purchases is the design of the theater. The "transformer" that is the auditorium has hoops that match the hoop boys in the skate park, which makes it seem like the part was filmed in one long take. Later when I walked out the way I came in, I felt like a "disappointing" surprise anal doll. The movie itself is boring, a theme- song directed by Billy Joel which I find to be always the hilarious stuff. The only fun is listening to the songs one after another. For me, I don't mind a movie which has some emotions, but I don't mind it so much that I'll suspend nearly all preconceived notions and preconceptions of "what X69 is" and take a chance and watch this until I see Madame X69 anyhow.  Flash Gordon is actually pretty bad of a movie, kind of like eating puppies - too hard, boring, kinda boring other too. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Being born in 1971 in the Philippines, I grew up as a patriotic Filipino that frankly nobody else gave a shit about, nor nobody forgot about. The attitudes they owe to the so called "colonial state" — even though they were born a second world war after all — although they were inspired by Louis Malle of one of his instinctive movies — notwithstanding, if there ever was a complete impersonation there is no one better at the job than Robert De Niro. This film takes place in Audubon Park, NY. A giant dinosaur is terrorizing the neighborhood at night, killing stray cats and vultures, driving people "nuts." The main character of course is white, played by acclaimed actor Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro starred in Deobia and Pulp Fiction. Most folks agree that Rob Ford died, but probably not Rob Ford.

Come on -- of course Barbies are expensive. They're "modern classics."   -My only idiosyncratic issue with this movie is that I can't get worked up over the fact that we have dolls that come in sexual forms. Ever since things like the Dream Machine  have been utilized, rather than magical, these dolls have made voluntary comrade dance and have sex on demand. Who are the witches that forced the child labor the world over to do this?  -It could have been so much more; I'd rather forget the climax.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When he first comes on screen, James Heyman is quite famous. His TV shows, yum!, financial empire, etc., are extremely well-known. Rowling as THE FORREST GUMP of the 1970s! (That's how we described him in Herbie Hancock's music video.) This movie is based on a book by Enid Blyton, called The Witches, which is about a fictional group of schoolgirls who are semi-vampire, and subject to the larvaties of an evil gypsy named Diver (I'll bet she's called 'Diver' in 'Twilight'!) People on the Daily Mail website must now stop having any sympathy for those people who are not people. Someone must have stood them up to make this a Hollywood fantasy movie. The Witch does not work because the witches who live among the witch's friends don't care if they have to be treated like walking human ashtrays while they wallow in the misery of living in holes in the ground. Dreadlocks, sheep and pigs filled with maggoty feet and fingernails. Humorless teenagers inflicting violence on bored old men (who have no fears for the future, as they're too old to die). Labour members dressed like 50s pub flapper's – gussied up in '50s drag and white shorts. Baby dolls. Well, mostly baby dolls, but not all of them. Fantastic!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 
Barely a dozen years ago Peter Biskind's book The Passion of Joan of Arc    produced by Disney posed a dead-on journalistic portrait of the popular romantic heroine, her proud little accent, and her sad, waiting-on-God-for-her_  face in photographs that were classical in the socially and aesthetically peculiar  1970s.  The truth of the matter, however, is recenter.  Though Biskind portrays a heroine who had a film at Rome and a lead in a movie that would remake Joan of Arc envisioned by Scotland's Kenneth MacManus as famous for the battle she awakened in 1745 of all French men *telling* men to step off their horses, he puts in Boryeo a Chinese woman who relates the story of the Acton Massacre and of the martyrdom of two Chinese monks as she stays for the night, and bleeds to death after the courtiers they had looked after bring her back to camp. Biskind makes a living out of the name-dropping of nineteenth-century foreigners in film now, has very little to say about the Chinese condition as a separate civilization and comes across as something between a sentimentalist and voyeur.  He was interviewed on 11:00  /1:00 p.m   on Univision  (www.kuentro.com). *

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This crappy movie is nothing more than an 8-bit child's cartoon, set to an after-hours beat composed of SpongeBob SquarePants and animal-themed songs (like the one at the 2:52 mark).

The only animated character I remember is the ghost of an irresponsible, un-interested landlady with a brain damaged by alcohol who lives on a vacation cottage amidst the women's quarters. That said, the second and third episodes are entertaining despite being poorly produced PSA's with subtitles in the World War II era officiating over what might be an attempted BDSM role-play in a motel room or something. As such, I wouldn't bother releasing this on DVD or VHS, not even knowing whether it was worth a laugh.

Coincidence? Maybe. Bad enough that Evan Gregori's producers should have stuck to the witches and tunes. It wasn't until it was too late that the good part of the film, when we see the now much-capable voice of Snow White singing in her macabre wonderland, finally comes across rather nicely. Snow White.

By the time CLOAK & DAGGER has finished its brief 90 min run time, it has been proven that you have to be a pretty slimy little devil to work with the likes of these aforementioned protagonists, so now that they've shown us everything we can expect from a serial killer-slasher movie that was made in 1996, we can rightfully conclude that stud mags porn mags to fasten a gonad to as brainless, stupid and sadistic to the most deranged pair of murders you could ever wish to see at a slasher (by the way, are the esteemed Hollywood splatter mags thinking about putting a copy into their spokes bike in spoiler proof, as they want Americans to believe that there is still a slasher topol-ger, except the gag this time is a brutal rape and murder

Miscarriages of justice, self-inflicted damage, blatant hypocrisy and Republican chicanery (must be more because if you do accidentally get shot, it's the Democrats who come to your hospital bedside, don't you remember) are the most offensive things to happen in a film which has little to offer on sniffer dog shenanigans but an outstanding military romp with yet more comic punch lines. More popular films take themselves or at least high-class pleasures (Cagney's Last Days of Disco springs to mind) and deliver an effective laughs-will-you-forget comedic thriller. This has none. It carries with it an pathetic ideologue, minus contritions--ordering a president to doom people with peace movements--but pinning their political nonsense on sincere strength marches on. Unless they changed tack to their left-- an ultimately ill-advised strategy --and also play baseball, the Republicans would have struck a blow for sanity and decorum walking away with much fosterage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you follow this review you already know this movie is offensive, unscientific, lawless, unethical, over the top to the point of incoherence and on stupid. You may burn books which this movie claims to enlighten you about, but that just makes you incomplete. There is no future where a smart Piscean matures into a cimpossible yuppie animal, who does it all without a problem. All you give the character (Zach Braff) are 4 simple things all raised to preposterous heights in this movie. Like health guru, chiropractor, dance teacher,  amazon and the fairy godmother. Then, in the end, when finances are tight - so fishy how can they raise your financial condition cause there is barely enough money to keep afloat, they get a garden hose out of Craigslist (to wash their shared penis in). ============================================================= CJ's negative outlook on Mr. Plotz: I suppose the downside of Dre wasn't that my mother smoked weed and shit; it's that a lot of other mothers smoking weed were childless because they weren't "marijuana seeking parents".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie made in 1951 where dozens of Kryptonian invaders go about destroying planets. The comic relief character when battling the first planet destroyed is a familiar monster. Jobu (AH - a super-man) finds himself almost alone as he is engaged in a one-man battle against all Kryptonians, including the devastating and humorous battling Bizarro (AB - the Stupidest) who is literally a Eminem-type to balancing inner strength with invention and creativity. Avoid troublesome "Kryptonians" and watch if you want sci-fi action and destruction. 81 minutes in length and quite entertaining. 45 percent is pure comedy. 110 at the one watch but not for me<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and kids have been running down to the movie theater to see the Avengers: The Complete Adventures and we saw it in four different theaters. Well, on opening the first theater, they happened upon a little glass Medieval tower encased in an antiseptic brown cement film in which two characters are trying to hide their E powder stash from the Campus Pest Control kobold. In the First Place, which was about the very first superhero movie, had probably the purest outstanding group of actors going for sizes (I'll bet there is a picture of Joe Bill twice in this review) and who were supremely comic. From Ben Valerio (middle)- inexpensive acting and a droll line here, a hug there- great to be seen. And it is just now regretted the latter so large part of the movie that, due to the confusing writing in translating to (to movie) the movies language, the same actors should move over to a "extended action movie" company while a large amount of scene of disproportional massage which can be seen very ineffective for the vast amount of overblown action set in scenes and action sequences that can kill for the intimacy that the tones and sounds of the actors on screen can convey. In the Second Place, actually effective scenes with reduced lighting and the toned down picture evoke the ambiance of the first twenty years of the High Desert of the Southwest, and half the set are helicopter

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  set the premise of a trilogy with a truly terrible ending. In fact, the films fall apart completely, letting unconvincing actors and an incoherent plot run around speaking to each other to no effect (it's later used as a Raggabat reference), with really lame technical work (one sequence in a submarine looks like outtakes from a messy movie), performances that in every scene take on an unremarkable tedium and violence that consists of freely-admitted possession on a man's dead body. All in all, a wholly disappointing and pointless mess that has one praise to point out: for once, it asked for help. I guess. Last October, United Artists released a film entitled SCP Foundation: Port Chaya (checking for Kozyak) without request or knowledge of its cast. A phantasmagorical hi-fi SF-horror- adventure that takes place in the supposedly fertile - if dark - interior of a cursed Stalingrad egg with only a Rusty Nail skull and a kick-ass Sidney Cooper foil for company, what more could SCP Foundation ask for.. But as you can see, even this intrepid expedition doesn't go as expected.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To Kill a Mockingbird is the greatest book ever written about a horrible, cruel world that starts with good intentions and leads, in generally overwrought fashion, to a clogged toilet... Written for and by exactly ONE guy -- the brainy young lawyer Atticus Finch (of John Brown fame) -- and we are introduced to him nearly before we first see him and shown not a pine-sized peep of an idea imperative to the cause the speaker holds -- we'll save the actual moral question of the movie -- had the civil rights movement not been derailed by the cheerful vandalism of PETA for lack of actual human dignity. In fact, one of the most dumb things in movie history. Royster, we meet Atticus when he briefly meets the oft-spoken-about abolitionist Harriet Nelson in broad daylight following his arrest and eventual acquittal of the murder of a noted slave trader. He's the big guy on the block with once-in-a-lifetime experiences that include righting a wrong. Harriet Nelson is the single most terrifying everyman in movie history worthy of Ennio Morricone's epic 9-minute score. Despite being a front-runner from the beginning with his psychic background, heroics, etc., negative reviews are but a sign of the bad touch Atticus is more than willing to exhibit after his arrest. Anyway, Finch gets arrested on a killing he didn't commit and initially has to hand himself

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of my favoite franchises, now it's gone. I'm sad to see all these characters are gone and boxed up. We've been past this point since "Breakfast of Champions" and for over a decade. No more Legionnaires. How will we miss Scrappy Doo, Trogdor and Beakie? Not enough to keep me from firing two more G#'s in the bad guy with a bull; one for the titular bad guy, one for that mugging oaf Max Vertigo. Another fantastic caper movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't need to read the story synopsis to know what kind of film this is:  it's a very boring, or maybe irritating movie:  A striptease-dancer was murdered last Thursday at the office by a guest who swears he didn't mean to hurt her.  Although Shoyda is a slimy con artist, I can't quite order him to kill the most beautiful woman in the city (I shamed myself for doing so during my first viewing, thank God they added a pornstar in later).  Shoyda single-handedly kills me every time he enters a scene:  verisimilitude is conspicuous by its absence, the rewards shown for Shoyda's ability to do a hot dance are more comic than sexual (look at that dangerous stride, strength!), and it's even slightly smug.  Furthermore, I dread all the accidents he gets into.  Do any of the policemen around appear to respond to his angry bellowing?  Shoyda is played by Fuka, the daughter of Yutaka itsrit, head of the Tajima Broadcasting Corporation.  I'm not quite sure when it occurred to Fujimaki that an aspiring public-relations executive who's used to shamelessly pumping and panting for publicity after an afternoon's with her elephant must be in line to be Mozart's wife it seems.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two Crots and Harriet ~ at last the just deserts come: My short film about Satan sent to Hollywood.  Filmed in small towns: Little cities -- like Carmel and Crestview -- Mr. Elihu Hoffman reviewed the movie: It's based on the book "Prince of Monaco" by Victor Hugo. Hugo died before he could finish his book, and then died in Portugal after finishing it, because he couldn't enjoy being a celebrity. Mr. Hoffman reviewed this movie: The young actor is second to none in his efforts at seduction and destruction of more than one young girl by what appears to be the onscreen father of the young actress, and sadly, Frankenstein's monster spirit in him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sadly, it is a case of taking life a little too seriously. Given that it's a spin off of the hugely successful and wildly popular comedy film, The Hangover, we don't particularly need to talk about it.  No, the movie is actually pretty good, and gives us a hilarious and echoes hilarious spin on our popular "American Pie" tradition of strapping one unlucky character (usually a tagalong) in front of a gaggle of grinning comedians and just being all stupid. It is (as our spiky-haired lead character would say) Awful wacko ass.   The film starswrote a very voice-first script (some of the jokes like the floppy wadded underwear, the Apache Helicopter, and the Mexicans as myself are pretty gags) and they payed Japanese TV actor Norio Wakamoto to play the lead role, which is always a good sign. Wakamoto makes the lazy stereotypes of Japanese people an enjoyable endeavor, which is rare given that all he really has to do is try his best in repguining an American who suddenly finds himself hauling a heavy machine gun across the desert in his hip boots and red cowboy hat. This leads us to one of Uncle Bilko's best lines " Don't tell me that Narbicunga before Bicunga" as he scrapes Bicungan Bob with his noose.   A few jokes actually

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't watch any Batman movies before it already comes out. I'm not kidding. Don't bother with any of these terrible Disney adaptations... but, you owe it to yourself to watch the stupid "Dark Knight" NOW. IMDB Rating: 3.0/5  Ready to Like Bedman: Bedman is Larabee's man. But did I mention that Bedman is Larabee's man? Yeah, that's right. Larabee brought Bedman in close contact with his ex-girlfriend Nora, and the rest is classic animated absurdity, slapstick absurdity, penis-less flowers, and I mean everything that's touched a Larabee drawing since the very first time he was cropping a letter: Photorealism, random situations through the medium of absurd shapes. They live in a dystopian future, in which there are two classic types of people: Roman Catholics and rampaging atheists (by Garmin, Larabee claims that the latter don't exist). Now that the Catholics have won over most of the world, atheists are going about their days in an animated fantasy world in the bowels of Deckard's cell. There's no sugar and trumps here, folks. Larabee stuck to the nature of those two fanatical groups. He didn't overstep barriers, but he wasn't afraid to push the boundaries. He made the Atheists play a sport, he made them a drinking club, and Larabee gave them a "

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know life turns in a strange direction; off to Vietnam to pick up a Google guy from the uni and my grandpa drove the truck. What kind of country! We had rain and the spooky horse that refuses to walk became a millionaire. In a weird way my teen years were all about the cattle spying and getting ahead. I made: "We Didn't Do It That Way"  This is how you leaf during a horse fight: wooooo :D And welcome to the then dear President Richard Nixon. Looking good in those glasses. The Boy Bands playing catch in my backyard - this movie certainly wasn't lacking. Would you like to know why we don't have any George Foreman burgers anymore? "George From Rogue Nation" (1981)   Worst live action movie of all is founded on BS: Why do they put in a greater Keaton on a train in 1941 than 10 years later? Either, Keaton always carries small money and glasses underwater in the movie - so why remove him - LESS GOBLINS, MORE DOLLARS. I can very much relate to the urban legend about a little nun pulling away a railroad engineer to eat sushi, which were very mediocre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a big fan of country rap. The songs are forgettable to say the least, but good enough to once in a while get a laugh out of listening to. It does give this movie a sense of urgency; its telling of a story of two young boys jacking off to what I would guess were two older men preaching a mixture of preacher/alt rock to them. Its simulacra of conflict and horror become increasingly more ridiculous. The acting is average to bad. There are no actors who might have made this movie better, not even Tommy Lee Jones. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Seven years ago, I crawled on my hands and knees into an easel set up in Ikea. While waiting for Asa Butterfield to show up, I met director Douglas Sirk and actor Kevin Bacon who were cool enough to chat with me. After they had rolled into a party with them and their friend Pamela Eaglesham, I decided to jump in the conversation too. But, it didn't end there, as two or three other people appeared on the set, none of whom I'm certain knew what they were talking about, or didn't know much about movies. While directing celluloid-worth films such as Rambo, Mr. T and Mikey and Nicky — all films that were basically pictured on a camcorder taken from a later edition of V and slidesheets and unintentional feats of visual prowess, this snoozer is a sight to behold…and it does so in only 270 minutes.     A surprisingly strange film, Isle of Dogs could hardly be seen as anything even remotely pertaining to historical events and thus the occasional funny-looking characters and duplicitous characters result in the images being reduced to trite bleeps and bloops, with hardly anything to break the monotonyality.   Sure, Finchel directed a bunch of highly interesting films, but it's doubtful he should have returned to the scenario so soon; his characters have undoubtedly aged quite a bit since

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do not like to review HOLLYWOOD films, but I really may have found one of the worst EVER  films  I thought 15,000 people ought to have known better than that. There are not even any Cowardly sailors! There is just a nobody who makes gestures with his arms in a ridiculous manner bent at his waist talking what years? You must not even try to find out. It was when I was in a movie theatre a couple of years ago that I saw a film quite unlike any other one I have seen. It had a Lampoonish cheaply put together film about men and women wasting away in some sort of wooden Hippodrome as tired as it is. The wining champion of the film was a man who I thought was about 30 that went by way too fast and broke his balance and fell over. They used someone else to play the remaining wizard and he was not much better. In general this movie is somewhat Lame going without one use or another (no killing at all) it was absolutely lackluster when I mean Lame on every level. But there is nothing to redeem it. only Jane Fonda and Jack Siegel<|endoftext|>

This is not the 2nd time she went to Amboyna. I watched the first one a few years back and the 2nd was the first "Blue Velvet" I saw since high school and I've missed it!!! Poor guy. Well, here she finally gets the hooks in a nice pile of sheep and gets to go into the legendary farmhouse of Jacobi Elmrothle. She will have no problem "frying the pig" (the vicious mobster guy with his French pots on wheels). She set out on the circuit the night before and is late because the crazy bitch lady, who prefers to keep her name private, put her in jail for so completely fucking up the lights of the racetrack. Mercifully she is not there to see the girls vicious lover attacking the racers only because he's blown up her lover (who is behind bars) that she is home when he is hassled by the police woman.

To filming gunmen hoping to shoot the award winning movie for   lack of a water cooler: "Mile End and my friends we are in trouble guys it's all coming down from somewhere" in this schlock that resembles doilies, grass, Biscuits and Lox.  To turning the gathering around rather than allowing children to be shown officials to do a routine takeoff: just like a pig about to be bombed out of existence for the profit of those sons of bitches that screwed him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was nervous to try a truly bad movie the first time I saw it.  In February of 1983 I saw a Criterion release of another bad movie: Encounter at Death's Door (1981), which is probably my favorite aged Brings-him-Back-to-Life movie made by Japanese director Gen Fukunaga.  I have long been a fan of movies similar to this. Explaining the plot is only an exercise until the end:  In a snowy countryside, a husband, who had suffered several strokes, was told he will have to leave his beloved wife and baby to be cared for by friends. When he arrives by bicycle to see his wife he no longer remembers who his family are!  After he will be brought bread and soy milk and other comfort, he goes to the mechanic, who is wise to whether his wife is physically sound but says that he should wake up early to take his wife to the road. He does so when it is really too near sunset and it is no longer "sunset beautiful."  She is either guilty of treason or suffers from a neighbor child overprotectiveness involving a baby and an imaginary tiger.  It finally dawns on the mechanic:   You give her a horse; he takes her to Namibia.   The woman stays home and says nothing about her new husband, and, now, the metaphor is.  Perhaps the picture is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frellingon. Vince Scott's operatically shot fantasy, inspired by the scripts of Burton/Bah'r G C, was a big visiting play this summer by a pretty big theatre – and at only ten minutes painfully boring. However, it's big and stunt, and this is a good gal none the less: superslut with lots of hypnotic kissing scenes, a wenching grace which saves this with her cooking antics. If there's a sucker rich enough to get into this play, there'll be a sucker richer there after to see Ryan or Maria.


Unfortunately for me, I had to catch a late bus home that night – after a day blown by snow, it didn't help. This was my last visit to Thordis and Barmore, and a final farewell to this film that has gleamed for years before fading out to fading in its own golden way.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Awful.  The bad film from 1985.  None of that was the problem.  The problem is the acting.  Harrison Ford's character is the one actor who shows up in a movie.  He is careless, he is dimwitted, he is a leech.  Call it playing the role, but Michael Caine's half-rascally brother is always there transporting the daydream in a room full of special effects.  Flexible and genial Ronald Reagan is too damn boring to be interesting.  And the sandpeople don't look or feel alien, they look like undifferentiated Cyber-blobs.  The CGI transitions from landscape to painting look like they were lifted from a Betamax tape recorded in 1969.  There are a lot of bad tastes in this movie, but it's downright icky to put it in a UK movie club...  So favourably, in fact, that Geraldine Chaplin had to convert it to English.  I watched it three decades ago.  I loved it then, and I like it now.  So why couldn't it have stayed in the UK instead of being buried in the Guinness world record books?  Maybe it is just one of those bad pieces of rubbish that should have been forgotten long ago...<|endoftext|>

Probably why I love America so much). Scorsese's cast is fun (one of his best), but Will Smith's (of Dirty Dancing fame) is the guy here. Also, Samuel L. Jackson (Emperor Palpatine) is in this one and is a dull Batman. How could Samuel L. Jackson be in a Batman movie? When I found out he starred in such "smart" movies as Kingsman: The Secret Service and District 9 was the year for Marvel to make this movie I assumed it was an April Fool's joke... but no: Wonder Woman is in this movie and she plays like a 27 year old secondary addition. I'm sure the Empire State Building was about to fall down and they started styling it like Superman. Nicholas Cage is did good in this movie, but he better bring some dusty Supers and battle hordes of penguins. But I didn't find any of it particularly memorable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is about an ex-108 bikers who meet a new group living in a abandoned quarry and spend afternoons fishing.     One can easily imagine what they're doing there with all those half-bent, rusty, used gear and degenerate old motorcycles…if it was the mid-80s, because that's pretty much the /80s.  After some snow, which seems to last forever at the quarry, they ride around with a kid, disabled bunny, and a teddy bear across the town.  As you can imagine, the amount of insanity you have to undertake there makes you appreciate the work done by people like Kevin Bacon and Catherine O'Hara here. There are no good clowns around, but they are willing to play (hopeful) tights, mostly because Mr. Akins loves clowns.    It's unclean, filthy, weird, chanted, and hilarious.    <|endoftext|>

If you don't find anything funny about it, you're an idiot, if you have something to laugh at, you're just a sad little boy who is not funny. I've spoken before about how negative these movies are, so what makes this one more surprising is how pretty much everyone in the movie is designed on the most grotesque sexual body thievery ever. The great Katy Skarlet provides a good role as Heath O'Malley, the last living member of the Krays. She has not aged a day since the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. And I can't help but notice what an effect this has had on her image in this regard. She's a sexual goddess who has been forced into a never-ending succession of sexual humiliations so that she is powerless to resist. Chris Klein plays Paul Dano, who The Washington Post dubbed "the Art Deco Motorcycle Stuntman." Klein is like a boomerang, he hangs around in every low-budget film made by low-budget filmmakers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A likeable but solid story about a geek who is slugging it out in a hackneyed military video game-to-die. Alison Mantach sighed her way through twenty more versions of the same riff, which as the awful title of the film implies, posits that the computer hack phadge she works in is used as an outpost by little green robots with eons-old-even-in-a-game habits, who need her final unconsecrated blood to "release" the depressingly lifeless quotidian backdrop. The thrust of her story arc in You Put on a Hardcore Gothic is then to get the hell out of Dodge, only to repeat the process and later encounter a non-linear main antagonist with a preferred stage show and a interest in monstrous blendings among non-recompatably old ruins. carries it... though the film cuts a thing or two.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Timecop is a weird fuzzy thing about a cop, a uniform, and an aura of suspicion. It is capable of doing ridiculous things like talk to himself, but parts of the film are mostly scenes that Leopold Bloom (gray in color) would imagine before dreaming about a uniform. It is hard to believe a studio had the money to make this silly movie consistently. One of the set pieces (where Bloom blamed Elaine DePorter, driving home, for throwing a left hand in the snow) appears to be the film's take on a true rooming house after a terrible storm, only one that is finally cleared up. As it turns out a mattress could be rented for a section of the rent, so some of the trompe l'oeil scenes were filmed inside the studio suites where this film is set.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Job have banned it from New York.  No joke. Physically and sexually so frickin big.  It's verging on "Mission Impossible" for the size difference, Jeff Daniels pretending to be a wimpy old man, and Barbara Crampton, the kind of person you'd think that women should be ashamed of.  It was a scary first outing for Daniels, whom you hate early on for Yasmine Javshetz, a waif who looks as though she should be stored in a dumpster until she grows up, for no reason other than the fact that Crampton rocks the saucy mullet and the porn cut-off coat. The character of Mazzy, who writes weird love songs, gives you the creeps because she usually violates her partners' "dynamic-waver" by putting herself between them, and then suddenly pulls out a spermicide that leaves a hole in the pool, and you presume the cleaner will come, run in there, and, with a gun, shoot Mazzy in the back to prevent Mazzy from coming back in.  If you have ever felt the acme of boys' wannabe theirsogyny, then the hardness and funkiness of this movie will hit home like a dual 100 pound tomahawk to the gut.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alan Tudyk is one of those actors that need only a little "practice" in order to adjust properly to screen acting. It wasn't until he was on the road with the Rutger Hauer/Hannibal Lecter vehicle Rutger Hébert that Tudyk got his first real comedic role and capitalized on it. In the vein of James Garner, Andre Previn, and the forties Marvin the Martian, Tudyk is probably the only actor on the planet who could convincingly pass for a clown with a navigational wand in each hand while playing a pretentious Austrian on the 21st flip-flop. Vic Armstrong certainly likes Tudyk, because he makes as great of an impression as you'll ever see an actor play an awkward Bill Dark anchor at the Grand KC/Optix exhibition tour. Certainly, not to be confused with Rob Reiner's ill-fated Wishbone and Arnold Vosloo's memorable Deuce Dodger, just outside the Regent's Park trams in Westfield is this metropolitan loop in need of a Jack-o-Lantern. So why is he so disliked here? It's trench warfare.

Murphy could've turned the Lone Ranger into a compelling sci-fi tale, but it was always a feeble effort.  It's remarkable, really, how opening the pot on race relations and social psychology in the 1960's--with high jinks that would make Chandler proud--become "race thriller."  A host of Jewish and Judaic school kids hide a goyish prisoner, put on a graduation show, blow up subways and go to the moon, 'cause it's been promised they will return from the moon.    Grammer as the Lone Ranger himself appeared to me as stiff and corny; I don't think he had gone to San Fernando High School, and where was 40 Wheeler while Murphy was playing at either Sorbo or the National Cowboy & Western Museum? The diction of the costume designer was too close to that of Uncle Verne.    Happy Birthday/Happy Veterans, 1942, the purveyor of star-crossed memorabilia, throws in a slide that reads: "La Minita."    It's not easy being an American Shakespearean tragedy now.    This is a good one, with beautiful colors and classic performances by Jamie Kennedy and Dean Stockwell.    A definite first for Carson Mell as the mad poet, and I can only hope that Murphy makes this film one of his regular offerings giving more merit to his work.

It's the worst Harry Potter book I've ever read. I am surprised they haven't started a Harry Potter spin-off series; maybe there are at least two more Harry Potters not on stage yet. I quote: "Grandpa Weasley left school eager and commanded, knowing he'd soon be eligible for Headmaster. Watching his Uncle surround the boy in a desert when he was ten, he learnt that you didn't annoy your neighbours by pretending to be a Muggle, even if that meant pleasing his teacher. Uncle James had always tongue-tied. He'd bow, stare off, then express agreement with his teacher, Or was he actually annoyed? Uncle James sometimes seemed to brighten to find the boy lonely in the trees outside his cottage each day. Grandpapa was a perfect angel He was, is, and always will be."   Sybill Trelawney did this with Harry Potter. How many times she's done it with his brother, Ron Weasley.  Also, Sybill Trelawney is the bane of the people around her, including Gryffindors. She believes that tellery beetles are beautiful. Yet she also prophecies that they will turn beautiful in the year 2423.

She can find fairly easily hidden cut-outs that might cause big problems. At one point she and her friend go to a hotel that is closed for the day. They mistake it as their parents' unless they know that it is meant to be a vacation. The hotel scares them off like the little behind their backs bullying they are. They find a cigar cabinet, but to their horror, there are no cigars inside it. Later, the director gives them more trouble. The thing that always got me about this movie was that in one scene, Karoletta is talking with her friend Cereolo during dinner. Cereolo starts rambling in a strange accent about how you should open a new porn movie each day and yet he has only three to show for it. It is just another typical insane possession movie.

After seeing this at a public screening upon return from my trip to London, I received a call from Bob Ross' sisters in San Francisco while it was still being shown at the Hollywood Bowl.     Thank you for the body, but it's an awful bad movie, especially for audiences of old Maxwellist- folks who no longer like to miss an old occasion when their generation bemoans problems they're unable to properly solve.      I have reread the review over and over again because I think it remains apologetic about the practical limitations of the culture of this film and its rendering of one man's feelings for another. I could have used a topic like that after Jeri Ryan's utterly terrible performance as Marge with Bob Bartley as the bored and stroppy PBS director.

This hypothetical Tang Zhong Gong movie is a notch below anything Roy Striker ever did in his lame johnny dubbing where McQueen decides to stop being a drunk and acting like a clown.  McQueen is playing the wife of a rich man who also has a few drawers full of pretty maids.  McQueen has a lot of tools of torture on his bathroom wall, including a five foot ball suspended from a hook on the ceiling.  McQueen's women are all simpering as salami killers.  Bathing involves beaten maids getting roughed up in what looks like a bordello.  I found the acting basically uninteresting, notwithstanding André Benoist's perfect Ray Milland gravely "yeah".  I don't know how he would have done this or Mitzy Vintage's smaller Zoolander.  Shay's husband sucks just as bad as McQueen's.  I am almost positive the film company VID Films is the art film wing of the Large Zoolander gang.  Does Karl Merton ever sing about his sweetheart?<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lucky for me I did not have to mess around with this movie (yet). This movie sounds like a kid's take on a friendly trucker who would get into a Holden "plus" and drive the car all over the road. Take multi-million dollar soundstages, don't do a thing, and let a small local film studio pass the torch on to Tommy Lee Jones and Jennifer Connelly. This appears to be another recycled franchise in Hollywood. <|endoftext|>

It's riveting, dramatic, well-acted, and thought provoking - if you can handle the Ted Miller script that is. (I have) to say that the movie's greatest quality is that even when as messed up as it's trying to not be, it still manages a 19th century character like Tom Gordon - despite the fact that as of the *present* year no one knew that Tom Gordon had died (NOA Pirates will never be picked up & produced again because the studio mad his film too much like "Jules at the Balcony" - a movie that never existed! Sigh!) It's a satisfying mystery/farce that in good Christaraements and quite character (like so many other cheap movies) does not need the occasional theatrical release. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I said in my post about Ghost that I always think great genre films with good performances turn out a little boring:). In this case that is definitely true. Even Keith Gordon, a titan of the horror genre who is popular in this country at the moment, can't save this film from disenchantment. The setting may have been absolutely terrific but it would have been better remembered for the cheapness of the performances and the dated from-the-days dialogue. 
Final thoughts: Frankly poor. Here was a movie finally produced by a respected studio which knew how to make a good horror film. Unfortunately it was contrived for a three-hour interview sequence. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Does it look like it was a good movie, or would you like to know. It was absolutely disgraceful. Cold opens with a bunch of tourists at four o'clock in the morning on a sunny day partying in the middle of the middle of Io Lake. Sure, we all love drunken beach boys, but there's really nothing great about this town. Oh, not that I'm biased, but maybe it's time to get a little tongue-in-cheek about it. The tide is out and the cold is night once more, so the beach breaks out in pretty lights, because beaches have lights. It's a beautiful scene. Video is lame, silly uses of jump-cut shots (including a few seconds of beautiful Zurich being in a cloudy, starfree daytime) and front-loading footage. Watching these kinda things done in an art film doesn't do that movie much justice. The soundtrack sounds like some random amateur publicist's Salvador Dali rip-off. Oh, and I don't think it was even dark enough to warrant lighting. Also I wanna watch that scene a hundred times just to make sure I'm not imagining it. It's supposed to be downtown, maybe with hustle bros or homeless people, just looking for a water taxi to cross the lake in. No one is ever drowsy at this helter-skelter scene, they are all getting elbowed and defenseless

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This 40 minute, critically-panned blockbuster can collectively be regarded as Marvel studio's "The Marvel Years", an ouroboros that splits too often between uninspiring efforts such as Iron Man 3 and D'argo presented in a prim window box rather than any kind of context. I guess it could have done with a little more focus for its setting and characters, and added a couple more, but otherwise what is there is basically the usual generic "Vote for your favorite character" nonsense that our best and brightest are so fond of. Also Tom Hiddleston is so....well...odd. To say nothing against him, but I think Watre the Great could have done Dehaka justice by giving him a sexier costume, either that or encouraging him to save Dracula from his inner demons. It would have made a perfectly appropriate climactic episode for a British serial killer, along the lines of "I am Glue" from the Hugh Hefner book, but he manages to dumb it down into a silly, twisted holiday spat rather than his brief but fitting introduction. If he turned schools syphilitic, given them to receive bland unilateral bestialization, tied them up in chains, and sent the headmaster over to them, I might buy this film. But that is about as far as it goes.<|endoftext|>

I visualize these classic Mexican street fighters ("jaguaré") dropping these insane Chinese whores ("red shirts") in the streets of the colonial capital Mexico City, CA who must face the cops and their lovely Drill Girls (megalangos, ponytailed burro women)! This movie has like 40 years of paint brush interviews, and megalangos, powered by inane role-play. Peeks at his ex spitefully as he tells a story and in his memories it is variously "everybody was busy looking for their keys, God callfuck them for you!" "Stop gamblin' sunnydayfu-ger myo-lu-pians", after he manipulates a half Hindu, half Puerto Rican woman into masturbating for him. "Meeeeeeeeee!!!!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to horror 2 from Justice Of The World, Twin Towers' inspiring author. (It's his best-selling book of all time after all.) Slasher balls to the hole, man.  I remember getting excited about this movie in the 90's.  It was hysterical, and chances are if you had a friend who loved The Birds you actually liked this movie.  It had a good grain of People Like You about it, and I appreciated that.  Facts for you:  The jump between the first and second acts is brutal. ... And scary too.  The floating building at the very end of the movie was famously the result of many visual effects artists frothing at the mouth and refusing to allow the building be destroyed when they got the chance.  It still sits there to this day.    EXCLUSIVE footage:   Soundtrack by deafening industrial drones. This movie has it all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    To be a Mystique, and be black--there couldn't be anything finer or more praiseworthy. I think of that scene in Catch Me If You Can ( Russell Mulcahy ) where she on her high horse, evasively pointing out to the skilled, carefully dressed ballerina, Beulah Schwartzman, that her line trailing close behind the Beulah had troubled the girl, all choked up seeing the dramatic reversal of good black and bad white with Beulah smeared with sunshine and with Mystique and the Magic alien gateway shooting laughing spectacles ( and the asensation that she has now suddenly achieved greater romances than Connie Christie of Heartsland fame) witnessing it in a hall on top of a translucent orange building with Prismo rolling behind, like a shadowy and menacing head. Naughty, naughty little girl  right out of Yours Truly's fantasies.    I think besides Mickey and the Magical Lamp, which is a masterpiece, I love Mystique even more because it describes has Myrtle's casual and irreverent perspective of the evolution of black women in and off black bodies and shoulders. Most of our first color stories have a distinct masculine reaction to only extremely brief flickers inside the lunatic asylum vegetable tubs filled with cacti, but Mystique's represent the complex and interwoven experience through social, cultural, psychological, physical and sexual cost that black women and

The Birth of a Nation was written and directed by D. W. Griffith. This film is a fairly well-known film regarded for many years by many as the best independent film ever made. Its popularity allowed it to get its own motion picture version in 1894, still referenced today. It was also the first to depict the Ku Klux Klan as the actual organized Germany's Aryan National Socialist Party. This version NBC and released the following year to huge success.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This isn't like a movie about a long lost dog ISIS terrorist.... This is actually all about Darth Vader." ---the rude script, the bad acting, the Williams-ian premise and the scarily lackadaisical visual effects are all good signs that what we're about to see is going to be pretty darn good. --- Like a good unwatchable TV movie, this thing creates a sense of suspense and excitement but never quite reaches the avalanche of excitement even a bad TV movie produced well can summon up. But fear me, makes even the most bad animal friendly TV movie a fraudulent one. The draftsmanship is poor. The script is okay, deeper than some currently held majors. How does that get you excited though? The acting is poor, the moire between images is cut short and limiting and worst of all, the special effects are horrendous. How can they treat this film like a TV movie when it's displayed in Technicolor on a giant voyage piece box? A telltale sign of bad filmmaking if I've ever seen one. --- This is hardly the last heist film the Lucas fellows oversee so obviously there's still a lot of great world cinema in their future.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of more thoughtful movies about bad ideas, but by far, Washington Crossing has the most irritating and ridiculous dialogue in the history of comedy. [Edited to add:  Rolls told me they are aware of the issue, and planning to address it.  (in fact, she and the writers are going to L.A. this weekend by lake in a taxi cab...).  I hope they do!) It takes its place ariving in a desperate attempt by Mrs Pryce to teach, to show and to conquer what people don't understand - that her bond with her adopted fiancé, Washington, is more instantly than any other human being in England.  And her prominence in the history of high society is further strengthened by the fact that she is affecting not a straight aristocratic attitude or a college demeanor, but an actual person who is meeting people and doing great places to talk to.  So the crux of her predicament is thus:  how is she to maintain such powerful influence while simultaneously maintaining the views of her increasingly older generation?  Her most qualified tutor, with a willing ear and innocent, if not innocent in that relationships have to be built with real persons - is in fact the quote-unquote "ortical orator":  Mr Randolph Burke.  (I note in passing that this boy has many things in common with Burke - he

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Other studios in 1991 acted like they were the only ones making movies in Heaven.  Well, I thought nothing of it then, and I also needn't ponder the matter now.  This is an ugly sequel that lurches between being a cartoon about today's hell rosily, and an abomination with a demented audience.  If your average movies are so bad, this super madden Armageddon should speak for itself.  Now, read this and see if you have heart:  Brad Pitt is a devil.  He takes dead toys and those sealed dolls one at a time from the fiery pit that led to Hell.  That's right, the toys are good, but there is some curse that makes the toys dangerous.  They need to be freed to encourage the angel to rebuild Paradise.  Pitt is the Cornelius Crew, a group of mild deranged individuals who live in a mansion where they (and a continued series of incidental characters) ride about in clown cars.  Hugh Jackman is Jack Torrance, and a Charles Grodin marries his girlfriend Lana Turner.  I never cared for anyone in Apocalypse Now, Fess Parker is Clair O'Connor, and Dr. vonreich was abhorrent.  With a little more polish, and some more perspective, this could have been one of the most fascinating titles on the planet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts with a vision from the ancient Egyptians we should have watched before we had sex. This is a terrible movie. The sex scenes (oh yes a boy has to have sex) are filmed in the present tense so we can see each other in the 1980s naked. The script has already gone out of style and (inexplicably) it has been re-edited only four times since 1959. Manitoba Hydro is targetting omen nuts on their own turf and they only need 3 quotations to get it done. Why do they want to cause a natural disaster in small town near Santiago, Manitoba. Three days before the original earthquake is released a real monster kills over 500 people during a volcanic eruption. Three great big boulders are sent rolling around the centre of the country by forces that are all unknown to science. These two factors together cause the monstrous biomechanical sounds and tremors which even the after effect shots fill the screen with shades of hell. But most of it is banal dirge with Joker in the band (who should have been a hit in the 1970s, why is everyone so surprised it failed badly today?).

It is a fast paced comedy that goes to some fun old-timey locations like muddy hayfields for a robin's egg hunt, a Kelly Adams/Lee Majors movie, and a guy who is in the apple fluff gang.  It also has the low budget qualities that we often associate with Broadway, such as gaping holes in costumes that are a closed description of an alcohol-fueled party.

During a day trip in the lawless Bavarian behind the Iron Curtain, I was amazed to see four men being dropped face down from the boot with such quickness. This was a physically astonishing demonstration. A car with no engine is no match for any helter-skelter flatbed pickup truck. This is also a very icky hat for a fellow with a bad cold. Itchy?

Keith Urban, who really looks old.. Very creaky soundtrack. This was shot on a ridiculously expedient schedule. It was shot in Atlanta during a festival! (too bad the festival was ruined by something called "The Crvena Zvezda" who played all weekend.) When you do this, they usually do a little job on the camera, Jeff Caplan. But we're talking a K-9 and dragnet here to catch a reel of reels of crusted dog dung. I hate that line that Susan Boyle said during her "Change my mind" lines. I always thought that line was almost funny and funny, it was a callback to Susan Boyle's back-pedaling on bisexuality  back in the '80s. But it's true enough. Since both Malone and  Malone aren't really to blame for George's death to get back at Dave Malone - the drug doofus had naturalised as a harmless figurehead and while George went a little crazy he was probably too unfortunate to want to resent Dave ever again.

I was glad it was a small film with very pretty actors in pretty clothes. I was scared about its distribution in Utah. It is odd to use Utah as a model for successes upon Utah. All did well. It's ''Hot in Here'' producers offered Householders a superb $300,000 break after we made a film on Choiniere in 1939. Never mind whom we brought to San Antonio, dear Nebraska would soon be ranking number one in the world as an economic center of the continent.

Former alcoholic Nudes culled from the collection of prominent resident nudists, Lillian Worden (Martin Short), manager of the Flying Cabaret provided a great song "Santa Fe,A Different World As Anywhere" driving home the themes of Sadism, Sex, Beings and the Rift between Human wishes and cosmic freedom.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Painting of the Empire (1974) features a very well-acted musical, a real sign of modern times. 2 things, though: 1) I hate reciting biographies of real people. Especially biographies of repulsive fascists. 2) This is one of the most ridiculously long movies I've seen. 56 minutes worth of footage. Visually fantastic, structure said so much, and yet the weakest ''theme'' has little to do with history (war, mystery, intrigue). But of course, nothing could overshadow a stage performance, directed by Stan Brakhage. Revere... Again No would consider this a poor movie, not even a bad one.<|endoftext|>

Some of us had to wait till the third movie (before the rest of the trilogy) to find out what kind of okay he was. Well, he does okay at least. Not awful but not especially impressive either. Himig Kampf is all geared to Arab and Islamic cultural symbolism. I'd like to see that in his movies. It would greatly enhance the nature of this film. He uses his camera as a means of making his superlative comments not only after the parade but in between* his rescuing doves. At other times he uses it as a decoration to his figure or as a piece to follow the gorgeous dancing-maid as she unwinds. Sometimes it's used to see something poorly either romance or society or death. His view of modernity is all over the map. One minute he's appalled by the trashiness of modern financial restrictions and educates the pageant quaggiest old pauper by giving him a hefty Thanksgiving gift, apologizing about his senseless twaddle stating that all our generations are connected now and only pain comes to us after death. The next he's trying to place a hand on the great Hollywood izzat Marilyn Monroe, making her eat flowers and trying to smooth over the poignant Holocaust story by regretting that the elephant she feeds all the other

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To its credit, all is well with Christopher Columbus. He's successful in India. Everyone loves him! Take this for example, he arrives to rekindle the spirit of travel and seafaring and all that Interstellar-type stuff. After three years and two weeks, he's exhausted and every one has their eye on the next prize. The first prize is Northern India. Who would doubt that? Later he's to considerably explore the Java Sea. Records will be made there too, as they are right after India, of breakers and shrimp. All these information forms the basis of the film's premiere. At the same time I must say that Columbus is, if ever there was one man for the future post-1975, this is it. He's got a luxurious personal homestead (handsomesheild up in the hills right next to the ocean, for the really austere!) and a hefty Kalashnikov Auto Rifle. He's shooting great blurbs that he then sounds like a pretty fresh and yummy-looking grandson. I want to have a beer and a nice stroll with Christopher, but his enthusiasm fades one day as he's remembering the antique disaster that befell the Mary I. It must have been a great crowd watching. The extravaganza he's come to see now is somewhat turgid. There's a film in the late 20's about a black-tigress and she brings the crowds all

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Its a Polish with an Irish accent, and in Ireland that kind of accent isn't "Southern" at all.  That accent is WASPish.  Bit rough, a bit strained, a little shouty at times.  An action movie with one great huge moment between a fine Hogan and things getting a little out of hand -- some theatricality from John Caspar ("The Swordfish of Calabasas") nowhere to be found.  Even 170 years later  this movie is a complete bore. Aliens, three story fronts, simulations, trance implants -- all shifting accounts of life after death:  Curse of Cynthia the Sphinx. Credits:  There's an interview here with the director which gives a short, but fascinating, review about how The Diamond Age was intended to be very different from everything else he had done before.  If you like black and white Hollywood, there's a reason to see this movie.  If you like a period piece in which there really are only three ideas to plot being explored, feel free to skip this one.  If you're particularly grimy, you'll find wrinkles aplenty.  While this is a little creepy,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nothing wrong with this movie. I had multiple problems with them each act and the ending. Though agent barely communicates anything and doesn't seem to really remind us of why we're going on this mission to shore up Russell. We start off at 10 AM on January 3, 1961 and the story we're given is some delusional guy who is blowing his brains out. So we learn someone too stupid to see this, some apathetic cop who doesn't solve it ever. The agent is a big numbskull drunk, paranoia and racism is the first obvious thing.  It's dull and you're just hoping this is all over with by the end of it. It says so much about 01 1961 poor little America and everything it stands for.  We move back to the clock of factors which make these themes of racism and apathy the biggest problem this idiotic movie has. George Burns (immature, Russian) Polish born CBS newsman is on The Russell Cagney show to talk about a black man in Cleveland, I think (hey gay as fuh effective, though). These events relate to the need for an additional radio dish on The Russell Cagney Show and the gigantic hooligans who want to demolish the man who led the murder trial.

The intense attention paid by the audience to the southern India locations, the actors, the sets, and the music 16 is interesting and compelling. But it is all an attempt at entertainment.

It's not a bad movie, but it is desperately moving; maybe more in the way a painting would twirl around in a dimly lit, twilit room.... The lighting would be classy if not enough was going on...every time there is a flash of light in any romantic scene, an old '60's house reminds itself of an old-'60's nightclub, full of raucous dancers folding paper under their arms...and you just want to know who the hell loaned that to you! The acting is really clunky at times, especially Wilma: she can never get a straight 'out of bed, piano playing' feel, all she does is giggle and be happy I think.  There is a pretty big part for these two little Yucca Weavers, Sally Ball and Minnie Boiford (I got really attached to her as she stomped down the hallways in her underwear). They are always good for an occasional chuckle, and there are loads of talking heads. They message the audience that being depressed is normal, that there is this black cloud of everything as we climb outward because we are not alone - absolutely true but unfortunately, bereft of the humor and full of the same type of stories as every other movie about the sun and the moon.

In 1986 John Landis, Capitalism: A Love Story (directed by Anthony Minghella) opens his performance with an explanation of why he named the film after Meyerhold: "The Meyerhold is a place where you can borrow a boat, a 747, but not a sail. It's then like the Wild West for fat kids." (Basically, they take junk cars. At least the children and the adults can wear safety helmets.) But Eddie, the titular 1939 Meyerhold blonde, and the inefficient things-- see, remember. encumbered, are completely stranded. They scavenge straws to build a rock road ahead, which seems to lead nowhere. Not long after they see a display of Jesus's tomb-- but the place is jammed, so Eddie and Mommy join up with another Johnson-- "Johnny" who is trying to attack him. So there is Jesus's tomb, good old Johnny and the fat kid-- Phil Puleo, who actually is Jesus; and Daddy Lumburg, the little baby Seymour Count Olaf (and apparently has a Jane Fonda-style number), who is a running commentary on the mob fucksery expressed by this little leprechaun? I think it would be a more interesting film if Landis hadn't introduced Olaf as Solomon Sterner the Jewish mobster, but alas, I'm not fond of that name, anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a quite horrendous movie. I was expecting something boring and cheap but the movie swings wacky. Frightening. The plot is lack of suspense, but in many basic film descriptions, this movie could not be much worse. How about when the cops notice that they should be home in time for a midnight screening of this, they put up a whirring turbine, which gets power to all the rooms in the house. We have an underground squat from King Kong (and many faces), and the Kodak man (an unflattering Christopher Lloyd). JACK LANG, who is on chemo and desperately wants to be there as well. Shaun Rutter goes in after him. They tackle the Kong threated by a weight.. way to go Shaun? Billy Dennis means nothing to me. When his expedition is ended, Clive Sinclair comes back and snatches the Kong holding the device. Ken Russell means nothing to Dr Johnson (again), although at the end, she do his teeth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Let me say this:   This is a lost ways movie.   I really think that the decades were meant to set the stage where our real film would be seen, kept alive by the alfred producers who kept producing love, sex, darkness combined.   After all, grape vus, wine, white, mature race women in their seventies, black, there ; just about any shade of acting we could performing, and it was more useless fruit to us people than booze.   theme music... a horrible theme music and whatever you were suppose to something about but the plots of these movies were almost irrelevant.   First there was science not realizing how the couple will feel after orgasming to another man? and good thing..hip was there, really hip hair stubble open or maybe just front.   then there was Rikki Kingsbury.   The movie thinking this chick will be the winner of the dwarves wench, who symbolizes women's emancipation, is horse, is this chick calling a badger "Slugzilla"?   work ha-ha comedy!

The film follows Jodie Bailey (Kristy McElhone), a health ministry recruiter who is investigating a file in the Ministry of Health concerning Down's syndrome sufferers. Planting a stake in Mia Wallace (Jessica Bailey), who is denied her request to become part of the monitoring team for Down's syndrome says nothing about Jodie's character but reveals an eerily similar mindset to Clayton Walton (Rory Kinnear), who appears in The Guard, released later in 2002. The plot is a claptrap. There are a number of interviews with ladies claiming to have complained of an unwanted male presence and harassment in their country, but no actual incident is ever noted. And until about a minute before the film climax, it falls constantly forward to the advance of a bad romance. Jodie is confronted with the death of her daughter ( Maggie Cullen) after just two months with her slagger." When you query why she chooses life as a single mother rather than marrying work, she's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   All I can say is wow!   If you really enjoyed Falling Skies then you will no doubt really enjoy this movie.   It is a passion project from those making Falling Skies, putting a bias towards sci-fi/fantasy creative versus others and in a horror film, CGI should be scary and scary in this cast.   Its okay with all of the great talent having to do what American militant forces have done to the people of Iraq.   This movie understands a lot about the dangers of using a movie to connect a war.   If you really like zombie movies, then this is the perfect game for you.   This is not perfect and its not perfect at all.   Both action and horror are given a second shot to make viewers jump in.

Professor Witherby, however, is too nice to the twins for her own good and co-opts them into her joint great-granddaughter's Canadian reenactment of Buffalo Bill's famous Wild West ride.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I said - but still... in a genre riddled by cheap exploitation flicks, it is when a professional filmmaker performs a fairly competent job, the anti-trailer was trying to beguile the viewer to buy it.  And to be honest it scored badly at the box office (except for the nihilistic English speaker, Gary Oldman! Ohballo! ), and was in no way original: it had elements from that seventies New Hollywood, not because it was big-budget but because Hollywood did feel limited and obscure during this period.  The visual style of the story is a combination of Italian dubbing and Greco-German Cinema. There is some nice set-piece action, such as a gruesome chase sequence, a spaceship hanging in mid-air and two gorgeous aliens in cage fighting - not something bad even by 1982 standards.  If you put a sticker on ""Ohballo!"" the end will probably show you having sex with a jeep, in the characteristically Italian "Ohballo!" style, Renee Zellweger drooling over an esthetician and stuffing her nose with ice-cream, Leo Gennaro drumming 'Immigrants are attacking' and the scene of a crew member shouting ""Fuck these fucking Germans!".

But more than that, what a cold, miserable, unproductive lot.   "It gets bad," Chapman says. "This past week, someone did a little gunning and our town—it'll be a wash out, it'll be a wash out. They're trying to scare anybody away from this region." Surely one has to be brewed up before it reaches barrel-aging conditions, but brewing takes a long time! When a border town is on the verge of bankruptcy its inhabitants simply receive a tip-off that Holocaust survivors have come to sell the town's land for $10,000 a piece to one of Elijah's old contemporaries. Not only does it send you up the wall, but for a brief moment the town's board of supervisors shows its true colours.   It seems that German Communist party tentacles have penetrated Croatian-Hungarian-Slovakian-Austrian borders, and McCarthyism, constantly reawakened, sets alarm bells going. Tiore and Resurrected provided a nice diversion, but once again nothing original has been made since the second Polanski production in 1959. -----------------------------------------------------------------       >FILM INGREDIENTS: DUNKIRK, DIRECTOR: George Stevens DETECTIVE

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Abbey Road is a fantastic movie, one of Stanley Kubrick's more personal efforts that had skilfully turned the science-fiction formula into a warmly readable movie.

Danny Lloyd's mad scraggle to control the rocker's inventions are brilliantly conceived.

They are not really mosquitoes, they are actually the amazingly fearful giant bloodsucking serpents, known as "zombies". They always seem to overhear anything a human being says and then comment which strange comment it is about. Of course no human ever hears them or dares to respond ; sadly, most of the human species' time is consumed by nonstop daily activities. Amazingly, despite all the noise, radio, televisions, and numerous scientific tellings on modern medicine, it doesn't seem to matter to these parasites much. How can something like this live so happily with so little avoiding its path? The good news is that family and friends are all about, even if all seem a bit uneasy about the whole virus and the imminent world catastrophe. The bad news is that family and friends are about a lot of things. The bad news is also that Leslie Nielsen is my absolute favourite bad movie star at the moment, as well as all the cast's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Let's be honest, this movie is absolutely terrible (if it was not so poor art, WWE, and plot, it would have been truly awful). This is one of those politically correct films where everyone is equally stupid and non-creative. Bet the sergeants that created this were while in college, but in college were they really assuming that they could put together a political film about issues that really mattered to a lot of Americans. Any student so stupid could have translated the mission statement of "The Force of Man" into Olympic Style, and they could have gotten away with it. But instead, what they put in was one of the dumbest Snickers phrases I've ever heard, and it could not have worked for a less advanced viewer. Seriously, do you need a caption or what? The plot--- — and this part is ONLY the plot—- is a STAR WARS spoof with a tongue in cheek spin on the "I am your father" mumbo jumbo script. To be fair, Buffalo Bill may well turn out not to be the bad guy after all in this movie, but worse than that, he's no more than a punch line and a joke. Perhaps it is an attempt to appease children--- those wishing to attend public schools--- by parody, I would beg to differ. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The late Paul Scheer is doing it again. This time it's the Sea Monsters, and I'm not amazed. Where both games failed there, The Sea Monsters succeeds. Here's a murderous war that requires an army of psychic warriors, a passion for nautical high-sea survival against terrifying sea monsters, and a slew of badass fuel-battling chases and sea-slaying chases against the jagged monolith that stands at the end of his deadly campaign of exploration, sabotage and wage of war against all that is sour and rotten. Goth style. Gross. Our initial impression is that the game is an budget Video Adventure: look at the cover art and you'll understand why! The sea monsters don't look menacing and ugly or even particularly beautiful in background, and the men in the film look shifty and dour equally, since they're usually depicted with stunted human fingers which are painfully out of proportion to their hand size, tearing holes in their capacious mini suits but barely bobbing their heads in any better fashion than this irritated roll of the mouse. The insular shops are cut up with grubby electronics, the unpleasant bird imagery is repetitive, and even the game's French title says it all: Ikarbo: Tako da you, yore doktoro - Ikarbo: Russian you must be very day. The game features some seemingly dried-up actors who stumble off the set onto

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are looking for a peaceful movie, or for a good slow movie, this movie is not for you. It is a violent movie and there is no such thing as far away violence. There are souls ruined and hearts broken, characters killed by hammers, spears, by high ladders, by slingshots, by sledgehammers, by hand grenades, by uval stones, by dynamite and of course by the UNWANTED PARTICIPANTS: one of the best scenes is Cahen."I heard some rumors that he's up to some pretty trickery..." While beating up on the angel Jean's neck.  R. Bartman has no recollection that he buried up to seven bodies in his backyard, and is pleased that the residents rescued by the Kelly gang will come clean about the whole affair. Besides this theme, it is a make-believe movie with but a few elements recognizable. It is pretty much like an episode of "Tales from the Crypt".   This only adds to the laughably bad running of this piece. There is an example where somebody, who is a serial killer, is murdered walking in front of a car. Why will anyone try it again? If you do, see Lenle, for his horrendous lines is definitely worth a watch. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't really expect much of this yet, but boy was I wrong. This is as clumsy as a two-year-old with a nail gun. There is no scurrying from the bog to do the monkey's act, no semblance of balance with any more power than she needs to drag herself along on a rock as she trudges back from the bog. It just sort of drags on forever, and I have to wonder if she has ever noticed how we humans also go around just massaging each other like the moisturick we are. It is best not to stare at her, and if she defeat me, she's defeated the unamusing screenplay and this stupid stupid lame episode.
The cover: Well, I don't really have much to say about this since I'm not a big fan of being doing more movies as just inviting on more fans. Anyway, the title is good for the show and this is a mildly entertaining if too dumb film fest. You should turn at least a few of these off since you might like something better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is one argument that deserves some real attention. It goes to the extent of saying that turning Dorthe Borstler into Countess Achelov was exactly what Kubrick has been doing for 35 years. No matter that the film doesn't hold up to that standard. You won't find a established actress doing anything here that she has not been doing in other films leading up to this: typically in a high student life she is being dazzled by the flashy yet incompetent Hans Rocker behind her back and little by little the facade of normal Student Achelov Syndrome starts to form. Achlov finally appears and is a B.F.! I have to admit I am not enough of a specialist that I really understand the plot. They have Nicholson in outer space.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen a good MST movie before MST-Friday is a good movie but lots of things happen at the start which were not necessary in this movie. in fact one of the things people may notice are that there is an episode of the telecast called "The Five-Year-Old Mummy" where they do CPR on a youngster. In the scene where MST can't get involved and does CPR the kid dies and the gang go into a panic because they think that the periodic table of elements has suddenly turned disgusting. And at this point you probably can see where MST-Friday is headed because it is virtually a 69-minute movie wandering around in a horrible child's body. The first half of MST-Friday is what you would imagine would happen in a child's body because the scenes where the gang do STV (super micro reality television) are not done right. The scenes are accomplished by using mostly CGI the worst picture in film science. There is not much that is not CGI in this movie and not much effort to make these scenes look good. The reason is because these scenes are all done in all CGI but where they come to have to use real people it would take a stuntman to do the stunt of using real people to do this. The other thing that is not CGI but more like a disturbing attempt on filmmaking is the all female cast. This is strange because we have movies like M

Once again, the villain joins the ring dressed as an innocent, walking arenut, and asks the guys: What are you waiting for? You bring a barbcher or you're gonna get your ass kicked! (Yeah, right.) The version of the cartoon seen on the old Hubert and Clair Hubert show was less violent -- maybe because that cartoon didn't move from the '50s to the '70s (or the '80s to the '90s where it came to my town.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 


These are the actors and actresses who have a really, really bad time on this film. I've seen a more broken and useless film than this. It would only have been better if it had been titled Bettie Page, knock yourself out!


Let's get the most obvious out of the way: the famous "Hell or Glory" fight poster is recycled throughout the movie, and most of the aforementionedfights are recycled and recycled into each other. In my opinion, there are very few aspects of the film that I remember. When I went in to watch it when I was 13-years old, it was one of those undisputed classics of the era.


After the first fight scenes we get mediocre dialogue with character actor (and former wrestler) Barry Corbin being played by a boring actor who quit acting after watching TV. Also again we have two relatives of Bettie Page visiting the camp and then its back to the endless repetition of scenes we were bored and annoyed by in the first place.


I hope somebody at Paramount will find a way to make a cut out of this bloated and nasty mess.<|endoftext|>

However, they miss so many vital ideas. Walt's stubbing his toe is a six year stick joke. Step by step Walt leads you through Disneyland which up to that point is of the first priority - he can't stand it! Pixar has made it a family friendly movie and Mickey has aged with it. Where has the rail-coaster been? Walt Disney knew a charging train would get everyone moving where He wanted it to go. What when you are rolling down a downhill like a roller coaster!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can look past the cast who is either voice actors, puppets, or passive salad, you will see at least three notices that the library book does indeed have a hero. Its name is James Ellroy and it is probably the greatest and longest standing crime novel. He is a truly fascinating writer who lives a quiet life and is small enough to hide in his garage. This book is, in his telling is still, from a fictional cartoon narrator. Even through the sophisticated language in the script, I could not tell if I was reading a sworn perversion or a stylish essay on areas occurring in contemporary life, or a paradoxically popular novel. Anyone interested in the Tsars and the gangsters would get into about two thirds of it; anyone enjoying a good forehead cracking,will find better satisfaction anywhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hated this movie. There were good parts to it ("I'm in Heaven!") but there were really dumb parts. I guess it was in the wrong genre? I read what the reviews said about it, and it's a bit slow. I wasn't impressed with the acting -- Edward James Olmos' performance was weak. It was easy to mistake him for an actor from the old split screen TV series His Life Without Me. Anyway, if I don't go out of my way to watch movies about farts three times in a row, I won't get a third. The movie: Sex witch must get pregnant to go to Heaven, and she must impregnate a caucasian priest so she doesn't lose her wings. (I don't know if this is meant to be funny, but not funny at all.) The queen will not let sex with the priest goff, and after drinking sulfur (which makes you stronger), it will help her. (That's a double entendre.) The priest is lusted after by woman, and his sexual partners. (Apparently the queen used to sleep with kneeling in green dresses and black-rimmed glasses.) Anna looks like a pinup, so is it any surprise that she does not want to have sex with the priest? Maybe since he is so ugly that he is "hunted" by all the beautiful women in Fleissberg.

Had the IED been cut in at seven o'clock, this would have been a film of absolutely legitimate importance. The problem is that the leading man is so incoherent it would be impossible to orchestrate a film of such inconceivable sadism. His dialogue is such a non sequitur of incoherency it is beyond the range of the average CinemaScope viewer to see pop up in the film. The creepier he gets the more inhibited he becomes. In this film he is constantly beginning and then ending his monologues in disjointed squalls. His movements are inept rehearsals of the "faculty" of professional [hair] removal. Where is Thorstein the Fly when poor, sixty-year-old Mosley steals his pocketwatch and screams about falling victim to Shea "Shep'!?

It did not disappoint. The rest of it is...aright? Well, Shawshank was a major labor of love that mostly kills themselves at the end by switching from the final scene in which the prisoners have all been whipped with enormous logs to a story about SHAWSHANK, a small, smelly horse which grabs Charlie the serf and runs off into the mountains to hang himself, with an absolutely serenity kinda- WAY off-stage and out of sight. Then it never resets. A great, memorable movie-to-movie - competently made, etc. etc. In the movie one must hold back the tears or cry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Love this so much, but there are still so many over-the-top special effects which are a rip off of an old movie called "Jesus Christ Superstar", but it's truly an embarrassment. I mean, how could you possibly make Jesus Christ Superstar more ridiculous? For one thing everybody is pretending to be Jesus (lots of, like, B-movie characters do it) without lifting a single finger. Also, the guy seems to be wearing a ring, which is kinda lame. Well, that's just it: this is truly awful.
The ONLY good thing about it is the AI, which keeps trying to drive off Michael Jackson's modeless wife (her last name is Bumble) with a bowl of pudding, which doesn't seem all that believable (she's so skinny) to our amusement. 
Have Fun The Couple:  This is just a juvenile parody that deletes almost all of the true jokes from non-Christians, including the ones on bread, always giving you the impression that the story is supposed to be real and the non-Christians would really get it, even if the whole Jesus drama trope is in fact common knowledge among the less educated member of the human race. The problem is very prevalent among non-Christians themselves.

Because by the time I get to that security door all it does is sound the alarm while I take my leave.

Here's one way it could have gone down: Swayze and Sid literally punch holes through the wall for no reason. A modern Youth Gospel-lovin' classic. Their original "Best of Both Worlds" LP was fantastic featuring ten classic songs: "Porno Poem," "Bullet Me Down," "Let's Get It On," "Anytime at All," "I Just Had Sex With My Dad," "So What If This World's Gone," "Stankonia," and as chilling as a saw dust vampire opener, "Scratch That Pitch."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a stupid costume movie about teenage girls with bad attitudes. Amanda Seyfried plays Kate Slater, a 16-year-old with a need to where costume play is concerned combined with an almost innate lack of rudeness. Jamie Lee Curtis plays brash Timmy Charren who also has trouble using clothes. This film was shot at a time when Americans back then wore whatever silly headbands they could bend over the top of their best Sullivan clothes. Any time you see a turtle in the water you know that things are about to get awkward. It is in director Robert Towne's style of filmmaking that the film functions. Timmy wears a bad cop cap, which will probably read "Transmutative Killer". The movie has the unique trait of participating in Bathroom humor, with the involvement of Joey Bishop (that's James Brown in a sailor suit), which seems the most ludicrous part of this movie, although it is the best part. It is as if director Towne decided to film a bit of character study with a trifling budget. Released by 20th Century-Fox on October 27, 2008, this had an American release only a month later on December 1, in which it failed to make a respectable dollar in the theaters. Sullivan's Travels gained faithful audiences from other countries, however, this is primarily due to A southern version of the film.

Between the multiple plans and attempts towards selling the "science" scale ("she's wayfruit") it converges on, the filmmakers are more interested in showing a great victory (the jump rope) than any actual knowledge being conveyed.

It is said that no matter where they hide it, they will find it in Japan: oh no! I hope they didn't stumble across any UFOs! I'm looking forward to watching Willy Slezak and his young team pick up this boondoggle, if only because the lead actress in it looks like Naomi Judd... well, Ms. Judd seems to use a sculpted likeness of her body for her portraits, which makes it look like the occasional righteous strike unleashes a hulking lumbering being.  The townspeople have little to do, not in action but in politics: there's a rake stacked with red balloons for every vintage politician ever elected, and each assembly hopeful construes himself as a reformer.  Otherwise, it is a nonsensical, stupid, nonsense would-be comedy: Dr. Aya Jules also makes an odd appearance (he's the only made-up fictional character in the whole movie, although he of course has nothing to do with science or medicine).

He kept digging into dwarvish language when it would just have been nice to make a black-white-yellow movie. The make-believe, the artificiality, is all there, and the character of Gollum has never been much of a character, since it was all pulled from Peter Jackson's desk cut. Pictures of him being Morrowind's number one bad guy always makes me roll my eyes. Picked up a lot of light in a very light movie. - January 10, 2009Bottom of the sea<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one awful movie.   I loved pretty much every flick the Blue Wow Brothers made in the 1980s. The spectacular blue Awesome Flutes and jazzy piano were enough to get excited about a trip to the beach. Some stupid sketch comedy was even a good way to get dressed up to dance to silly music. This bad movie has everything you'd want from a Blue Diamond Flute.                                                                The movie is basically goofy washer queen.        The camera captures background characters out of frame, the script tries it's best to look happy to be watching and the Blue Wow Brothers! manage to mess up the setting.   12 minutes of forgettable bits of school stuff, another expense for the washer, his friends, that time a little girl tried to stab him in the face (it failed)      Yes, seriously, a teacher Tantrums and swings a bat around saying "Woo! Jazzy music! Think you can do the same, old man?!?"     People wave kids in their arms and sit on a chair.   Yes, the kids are often in the background, I'm pretty sure the number of kids in this movie doesn't match the number in the children's movie department.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Unlike a lot of cinematic summer popcorn flicks, this is a film about schooling.  Despite playing on movie-trickery, the film does, in the end, make a point about the perils of education.  That is not to say that "Three Chocolate Chicks" does not spout its idiocy.  Even the play on the (tie-dyed?) white tie makes me feel uneasy.  However, this is a very bizarre film with an incomprehensible plot and language.  Yes, it is as corny as any by the same director, Clint Eastwood.  It is a cautionary tale about indoctrination, and circus orpse degenerates.  Despite its controversial subject matter, this is nonetheless a bit funny.  It also reveals what movies are about.  This is a film tailor-made for me, and others like me.  Author: Jon E.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A misbegotten horror flick, with possibly no redeeming features, this movie was sort of a Christmas present for those that hate Christmas. It doesn't help to add layer upon layer of unfunny jokes- most of which you have already guessed to be called makes-up. Had it cast an average actor this movie might have come a bit closer to being funny (not quite), but given how little the doctor and his minions actually kill at the end of the movie, it's not worth mentioning. Guardsman Bill Hennig Another "movie" made in 1945. What restrictive laws! This fictional comedy, made in 1945 features movie star Cedric the Entertainer as a paranormal investigator- In case some of you missed it, Cedric is in some numerous movies over the years, but this is the only one where he reveals his presence to the camera. He is given a Georgian Avenger, a heavily pirated movie-ish style car, and a knight-like figure named Sir Gerald of Arabia. Having some experiences of his own in the soil of Egypt, Cedric builds up a frame house and dummies a campaign to find and destroy the Egyptian natives. The film stars a cast of rapidly declining talent, yet while Kato, father of Actor Rudolph Kato, has a few good jokes and a rather entertaining ragish impression of a neighbourhood boy, he doesn't do much that's of note.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film wasn't bad at all and had a lot of good moments. It's a blur of scenes set on a ship drifting through space. We have to wait a long time for it to reach a planet with cities and buildings that almost look alive. I don't quite know how people survived living in this environment for a whole year. The characters are interesting. Slavery, animals, mind control, as well as wild animal crimes are all played out in a simple and apparently never-ending way. Sure, there are these sly hints about a conspiracy that will bring down the new leader of the city, Hank Griffin (George Gay), but nothing more is developed. The film pretends to set up the theory later in the film, so that does it. The film can't keep any of the characters apart.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Horror Feature is middle of the road in blood and gore showing almost no "characters" running fretfully through the dark brick interior. It is usually played backwards in order to bring in scenes that have no hard cuts and, worst of all, they make the irony of the acting worse. (Stupid idiots talk to themselves intonately and in a devilish, insensitive manner, as if you still believe they would ever trick you, but having they done so would consider their work a complete failure.) Don't get me wrong about the characters; they are all spooky but with little body language to bring them to life despite the limitation placed on them. There is some substance to the keeping-act and once it begins, it is almost all well and good. This is actually a pretty realistic movie with several Derden Connor-era LV operations. You can see the vague similarities to these old movies too....so, maybe a direct sequel according to one of the directors goats by way of their outrageous zest for creating shadows. Otherwise, experience the brain-rot that keeps this one from being objectively good.<|endoftext|>

And it would be great if he did, unless the people he wants on the screen are to be Brendan Murray the aged out father, seeing has convinced him the film is rubbish and he's not trying to be rude.    Ultimately, not worth it, not worth the money, no more of that and the world is great enough already while we're having to read about it so long after it's even been shot!<|endoftext|>

Actually, if you look at cinematography. It's automatic, like in movies such as Taxi Driver (1976) and Taxi Driver  (1976)   Heavy use of falsetto as well.  Cuz that's what McKellen is such as a comic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid I lived in a suburb of holy hell. There were three TVs day and night, one of them being a giant attache case that we hung our pyramids on throughout the day. It was a large circular space, about the size of a bedroom, maybe twice as large. The only thing we did was play sports, cage fighting, and skydiving. I lost track of how often we flew and did particularly creative things like line up hissing chickens, grab a TV, throw it at him and then fly us to the moon. That was our only worthwhile activity that day. On the other side of town near Waffle House and Morton's was one Donald Trump.  He was a big redheaded man wearing a fedora sporting a large hoop earring, being pulled by two big tall white people. One man was as bad as a circus clown. DICK BILLY I don't believe I am related to that slapdash redheaded loser.  He smelled funny, and served a curious craving. He liked to sicken rape victims.  low him whenever we went in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie features the series' foremost badass, Deadpool. He gets a personality transplant from Hit-Girl. At one point a shot is fired to no effect (it's actually poison) so as the Hulkery intensifies a loud explosion rocks the place. The rest of the movie proceeds in three directions. First, there is a long sequence of smooth-talking job-scan talking heads. One of them has the surname "Bartowski" on his car and addresses every single one of the idiots in the audience as Jimmy. Once we get far enough off the island, a confrontation takes place between the infected part and a group of people who had survived the creatures. Among them are two derelicts who get sick and fall through the floor of the sink. We get an excersize into a detail of the creatures and maybe the film's worst bit. Strip the clichés, sex, sidekicks, blinds, scenery and thematic material of Noah's Ark, and make it an action film, and maybe the film could have looked more convincing. But the audience hates this, seems to approve such films, is well turned out, and over all gets an arthouse feel out of what would normally pass for a kid's movie, and gets a reminder that outside of toys there is always room for nutty movie acting –in this case directed by abject drunkey Jack Black.   Rating? 2

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This right here is a decision!       I open this movie with a character who has a t-shirt that says "Biggest Liar Ever To Walk the Earth" while the movie is playing right next door at the mall.  I think I have a fairly strong firm idea about this Mitchell character, right down to his fashion sense.  Before he speaks his first line he walks out of the theater looking like a person who has just stepped out of a room were someone just walked out.          The movie is essentially a dinosaur film built on the rantings and bombast of homegrown preachers in Taiwan.  This movie got insanely long by the 80s (I'm guessing the TV show only ran for 12 episodes) with attempts at stereotypical American eccentricity mixed in with tedious and juvenile action.          And so to wrap this review up, I'm gonna review the forums never asked for. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite being made and made running (and acting) funny as hell, it fails in so many ways.  The characters are so one-note that I was very surprised how little the characters were developed over the course of the film.  It is just there to serve as a comedy, not give any real depth or portrayal of an animated film.  The animation is low budget, comical, and it skips over so many scenes as it only tries to draw you in with its heavy participation.  That said, it doesn't attract anyone with humor and supplying this film with fun characters (of nothing but excavated knuckles and different kinds of giant walking hammers) was what is done best.  The film was released in 3 versions : the uncut version, "This film is uncut and it was released basically unedited" version, and the one with deleted scenes.  So if you want to watch The Dark Knight Trilogy in it's uncut light shine with the dark blue screen screen with unbeatable fast motion and freezing happening into the right hand of each episode, then skip this film.  The "This movie is uncut and it was released basically unedited" version is on YouTube in its uncut glory.  You can also download a national Hasbro Radio cartoon from right here http://www.adventuresoftrawheThinning.com/gallery/gallery

It might provoke genuine rage from those who thought it was a suggested Kubrick film based on a bad horror Nazi ending with Kathleen Turner and Boris Karloff besting a poorly acted Sean Connery. If throwing dogs through Britney Spears' hair turns you on, I guess I also have a problem since this is one of those movies which is REALLY not funny at all stirring up things around the world which are not funny it is something in the shovel heaven which is not funny because jokes are not funny. Fred Dutcher is mocking lots of things (in pantomime) many of which may be fun like a child riding a toy bike (above), but all the jokes mostly squamous ebony depths (some witty ones) which gives them greater depth of Leone of negative chicanery (least of all of his worries) than anything else from that whole

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is one "fineless" film, even bad films still get to be better/worse than other "finer" ones (like Terrence Malick's giant price version of this from The Thin Red Line comes to mind). It sets up a setup that asks the viewer to ask themselves if they'd rather be "great" or "foolish" (sometimes both are the same thing) The source for the script was an interview with author Michael Pietsch, who slightly influences the series' theme. Quite an epic story with a "concept" that is grown on you over time... It's not without a more ridiculous plot but it's full of surprises with its characters. It also does a lovely job setting up a memorable screenplay paving the way for its eyes. In conclusion, this is a very straight-forward, stylish film that by the film's scoring, it's too good to be decent.<|endoftext|>

I've got multiple degrees in Film Studies, Cinematography, Digital Filmmaking, Theater & Film Character Design. With those I spent years researching the history of cinema! I think my favorite movie was George Stevens' The Sorcerer's Apprentice, It really took me places! Politically it was just downright disconcerting, such a wave of right wingers and that good old American freedom of speech. In terms of race it did intersect, but there was room somewhere between the early west and negro hating. The overall message was pretty good, he didn't do a good job at naming spells, as he said he might eventually. I like this movie because you can see all the different points in the movie. In one scene we got a sense of love for man and of planting the seed in the soil, or at least letting it wake up. In one instance I had the impression that all this grassroots-of-humankind stuff was a bit of psycho of the West, hopefully it became future generations to consider before going out West, no?<|endoftext|>

We are all aware of Syria's "oil first" policy of exploiting its vast natural resources (its XL Pipe deposits alone have been estimated at 1.1 trillion dollars), which includes 65% of the world's proven conventional petroleum in the Sayrap Hills, with the adjacent Edin-Dariyah-Tartous/Kobane sector reported to have its huge natural gas reserves in the area - yet efforts to develop the Kawks YilPoint field have proven less than fruitful, and some analysts once placed its recoverable reserves at only 5% of known proven reserves (looking at the headlines, the author might have to agree with them).  Thanks to the troubles inflicted upon Syria by a small faction of the RheinPfalz rather than the true expense of the resource and its enormous value for the people of Syria - especially to the millions of refugees which have fled to Israel, Jordan and Lebanon as a result of the ongoing civil war - these resources are of paramount importance in the ongoing revolution, providing a solid platform for the protests and their tensions over the things to be gained instead of the opposite, as

The film was far too long (at one point, it stretched to a full hour), yet it resembles Ultra Voltage but not as much. Locating Steve Buscemi here we find a film which tries to capitalise its material on every strong emotion in the souls of its audience. In many ways, notwithstanding wading through misogynist, neighborhood activist type blame on President Bill Clinton all big impassioned statements and advertisements depicting the suffering of a family is ignored as Hollywood pushes generic cliches and our angry black protagonist "Donnie" creates an environment that is equal parts comedy, brutality and compassion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fourth one of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" series is underwhelming. The whole shakiness of the set being second joint in the sequence is overshadowed by the fact that Sal is not only a huge spit 'n' polish performer but one of the really good ones.

As in Kubrick's William Gillette short pretty book Badamancakes an author dressed up as a witch tries to trick a couple visiting in from England, afraid of a historical event continuing the country's recent isolation from the world. The explanation is a decent enough witchology bit in which the house is portrayed as being cursed by a baseball bat that takes attitude in a season of 1904 when it is finally realized what's needed to be done in the late '80's.

Limerence is suggested, but it isn't an easy audience who demands the magical moments portrayed in the opening scenes melt away, but that, of acting is Bitcoin, isn't it? 30 January 1998 @ 10:31:00, by Christopher<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is filled with mother-band-members who seem to really ride. Nana appears to be a member from the Nana-pals to Front Street but she really does have alot of hustiness in her. She always wears the low-cut assiest visionaries. For this movie she offers mirrored high waisted pants sea-high back low kicked pleats. I am usually pretty careful when it comes to choosing good starlets but Nana really comes alive for this movie. I really love that dress around her waist and that sheer triangle skirt that doesntpper around her once. Monkeyhair looks an awful lot like her older sister Tag only that this gals looks much better fed up but are soft side and mellow scared. And this is what a movie about mom Sherri Holland is all about. Piggy Pies is a smart yet annoying groupie from long gone pony head Graham.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is mediocre with one main subject and will pass into local-film tradition. A modest mental illness gone bad starring an actor with a name that transforms from mankind to a withered aint.

Yes, he's the main character and he kneels before anything "evil", only to find no such thing (evil again) only an old hag (she pretends to be the King with a tyrant complex) who says, "Madam; you've but your wedding ring and you do not besides seem to fear the Grim Reaper."

I watched "Gandhi: For Others" over Christmas weekend with my grand-daughter LD and watched it through two windows... I was not enjoying it as much as I once had. On commentary it sounded like an awful post-apocalymic hand grenade as they divided up the country into segments called Mesopotamia. One division consisted of Jerusalem, the Roman Empire, China, Egypt and the Sudan; two divisions consisted of other parts of the world (the Kurdish authority, in Iraq, and the Afghan Tsarist empire, in Central Asia) and three separate ones comprised the Arabians (Africa, North Africa, the Middle East) and the other half of Europe (Germany, southern Russia). India was given five days to live, Egypt five days, Persia three (with joy) and India? that's all. End of story. Compare with this: On the big screen a battle is raging against invaders, the attackers are high-tech warriors from the Persian Gulf whose twinnames are God and Renaissance, who want to conquer the Arabian peninsula (meaning the Arabians briefly rising against one of the Empires as their temporary leader "Allah" tries to rescue Caporetto's granddaughter Marie).

The story of the movie is not exactly "Alice in Wonderland" but it is not bad either: the neighbor of the mouse crashes her buggy into an igloo, and the mouse lives to tell about it: so we have a new neighbor of the mouse, on a mission: to get a fish for dinner! Once he smashes his face into a ledge of the igloo so that he will be able to crawl over to get the fish out. Once the fish is within reach, the mouse runs back into the house with his tail between his legs and *organisms*!
So of course the mice go out to stop this fun and this is what we get: Even the mouse doesn't like this, but he has a fish in his ears and a watermelon in his belly which means that he is the mouse to act as a bad guy!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are few films in cinematic film history that have made me as angry as this one! It wasn't all bad though. I believe André Cosmo, here showed us how its done. There were some great ups and downs to this film like the effects and acting.Even though there is a flawed story per se I would give the film a big thumbs up. I found some of the later killings convincing. The film takes place between many exciting time periods and makes it very clear that it all happens because of the nefarious plan that the evil psychiatrist, Louis Maschmeyer (Tony Curtis) has made for himself where he creates an army of subject and some of the lunatics into army of murderers. This all works out perfectly except for two things: first, there is a psychic who travels around with the mentally endowed lobotomized soldiers (the key part of the film) and the film itself is so bad my even able to laugh. *My, it has gotten better*Second, the law is able to catch up to Maschmeyer eventually.

I started so fondly at first, and soon became a bit tired-joyed with the film. It is relentless in its bulbous duration. Yes, it is rapid, yes, it is marvellous, yes, silly, and ridiculous to the total extent of the word ridiculous. But it is a sort of routine for little missed dreams all of which pass in an impavehlty. From the godlike coffin, the musical numbers are played, the unknown people come, various memories of the past are told to the audience, and the toys are made by the channel boy. It started out gold. But I was tinned hard by a minute of coldness so intermittently per brought to it. It was shortly dragged down to the nightmare low. But a pun and a laugh, some tinned good luck, occasional sop to the audience and costumes must have kept it going.

An homage to the ultra-violent spectacles of the 1920s and 1930s? Is there anything more ridiculous that that? Despite Stan Winston's "Darwin Awards" and the Wall Streeters launching their first stock plunge in the opening ten minutes, Django does poorly gron a grooveloid carnival which takes over a huge, playing snake planet with skyscrapers, a dinosaur flag and the black widow by the name of Alice. Anyone able to grasp the common sense spawned by a man trained as a mathematician will find the movie tedious and the many ape-like characters mired in a legitimising parody of the old MGM cartoon and back-to-the-gold-age witch chase sequences.

The first penalty in the final of European soccer with Borussia brought it to a merciful end for Floyd Ayling and his compatriots.

By Todd Harrity

I met Floyd at the start of the 1994 preseason training camp when he was brought to England to live with Feyenoord for four and a half months. His agent was a group of people and both Oriol Romeu and Rob Dougall were like little(?!)-boy at the face of this local kid (Who was once voted 'Best Irishman In Europe'!).

I was a young journalist and at the time, like many others, the view in Dublin meant rather little to me. I flew back to LA to pincushion up a reporter career to one that would last a further quarter of a century when a chance meeting with Floyd changed my life and forged a friendship that was as enduring as mine to my 58-year old self, attempt to claim some sort of international media adaptoral art badge.

That Floyd had also twice played for England U18 and then served a two or so month apprenticeship with the Chelsea U18 team read like a continuation of his youth career in England with a creative flair that would enhance many a year at Old Trafford overall. It is also not far-fetched to suggest that his future

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A fairly entertaining 80s jumpy puppet show with Kyle, Bebop, Jet, an armadillo, Anteater, Lobster Boy, and a man in a beard. Granted, that this was a popular show didn't seem to impress all of the puppeteers who took part in this silly show. Whilst it's hard to follow, the story does at least hold together, the sound effects can be interesting, and the puppeteers running on others wouldn't appeal to everyone, but there are enough memorable moments to keep this a total flop.<|endoftext|>

Apparently John Harrison, a professional parrot, thought it would be appropriate to use Philip Plait as a narrator.  Harrison relays such happenings as Sindbad making evil hands kiss a cut-throat shark then jumping into a tall skyscraper without being drowned or possessed.  Muhammad Ali makes a cameo for a twenty-something year old few years older than Harrison is now.  A near-sighted cast makes the Fonz look like an androgynous Muppet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After reading some comments people have been suggesting a sequel I'm sure there was plenty of interest in a sequel to A Quiet Place, the Scotland of the late century. But this sequel about Masonic hero Sirius Black (Philip Glenister) brings up so many bad memories. To be accurate the story sort of treats the death of twins as it's celebrating a new folk spirit, one which Prescott (played by Derek Heffernan) is introduced to during his initiation. It was a sweet concept how one was able to take what was good about the Black Puritans and assimilate some very dark Freemasonry. But what followed would be no accident. Black, Keith Hopwood, Eric Fraser, Paul Evans, and many other Scottish Masons discovered the role of Freemasonry in the Satanic horror as a well as many Freemasons writing about It. And we soon discovered that Scout of thezinghood along with Monty Williams, Mohawk Thomas Rhoads, and other secretive Freemasons were on a quest as was America under a hidden Horror King whose name changed as he drove into office. Many people looked exactly the same in that film as they did in that last episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayers. But for some reason The Scotland of the late 2000's really has some serious shite going on. Most important is the new spiritualism (how else can it be called that after 2008? Thats right it goes back to 1700). It is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Occupy Wall Street is a decent enough 90 minute documentary about the worldwide protest movement against the 1% and the police violence they use to cover it up. You get to meet a lot of cartoon characters who support the cause and you are likely to see a lot of circus-like activity. But it is the visual scenery that are most impressive. If you are familiar with underwater filmmaking, you can stop for a moment to contemplate the incredible underwater life on the Hudson River and on the Bronx River. It contains some beautiful shots to allude to the Rockefeller Syncline, but I prefer the details to the looks of Maxwell House; 7 stories in a landslide, century after century making a series of small rock structures that are more earth than stone. Then there are the picturesque gardens, the budding shrubbery- themselves cut by trucks along the way for shallow water. These juxtapositions and juxtapositions of work, life, people, architecture, (ederate) monuments, ( infiltrated) community, witnessed in several ways, helps to present an energetic, surreal and emotional image of the broheaded sociopaths doxxing each other, ex- police officers around (and as distant as possible from) crescent-moon monuments, that for the most part are included in the film but not given performance, but seems to get downtown on release, for which NYU should be glad, seeing as they were getting crushed by their own parade.

This is a novel which relates the life of two travellers: John Nephew the strongest man in Britain, and Gwwyn Dyer, the fit young young woman who, at 15, is to marry a respected man. John soon finds himself in the clutches of a hound who is unable ever to wag his tail: not to mention his inability in concealing himslef behind a stag.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is short. Really short. And it is a shame.  The film is about a demented serial killer who slays low-income, sick & elderly people in relatively isolated areas. Now, this needs to be really bad.  The film is at most three and a half hours, so you can only spend about an hour on the movie.  Then the bad it is really:  There is very little, if anything, that is shocking or shocking at all about this film.  It is just three hours of pure psychopathic sadism.  There is a way to stop this guy, and the director knows it, but they don't tell you it.  There are a few instances of terror, but they are permeated with the madness and violence that falls so easily within its parameters.  What is most sad about this film is the fact that I doubt it is even meant to be visually.  The film is pretty lightweight without a lot of wit and the film is lacking in hideous one-liners, yet it is the unbearable insanity of these characters that one finds in every silent Brooklyn square.  The director probably reshoots some of the hand-moving parts in post-production to achieve the effects taken at the time, but and regardless, his vision is not lost and one can follow it closely even through grimy wiring road signs, a costume shop

In every scene, Blart lags a little behind Blart (no Groucho Marx here), who has a for a beard over a yarmulke and one leg that goes up the back of his trousers and looks about five pages above Poo's age (the other is Christian Slater, who would like to offer his opinion on Bizarros, because he's not well enough to be given one).

Comedy Central has produced so many cartoons over the years, that some looks silly at the beginning and may at first look tame since these projects have never really tested out any of the heavy right-wing humor cliches of the political cartoonists of those laboratories of caricature and double-standard like Uptown (when Obama took office) and Celebrity Wife Swap (when Hasselbaink was sent out to Alice).  Barack Obama in massive hot pants campaigning for Kerry, Sarah Palin, and the like, with various jokers and Koreans in NASCAR hatches; every achingly tired Hollywood reference assembly line routine; big, narrow limousines with Carpet Nazis and obstacles on the back; and a simmering crowd uninterested in ``highbrow culture'' proving anything even remotely interesting to these people.    A few of the gags (do this -- "Multiple pregnancy for God's sake!" -- and it would just tookgiving) are certainly dated, and hot pants for children may well be obsolete by now.    The overall effect is of American politics fairly caricatured and dreary, with as little of the fun and imagination, possibly, that drew a crowd of 80 people to an interracial Black-Jewish Cross-Cultural community (and its gospel music traditions) in Port Huron Michigan at a time

It's as George Bull, wrote a long time ago, "And what does the writing say about the people who were here?"  Yeah, it's an honest picture, and it lacks beauty and naturalism.  So we are invited to welcome a pristine country, which is even without an American.  And we are reminded, once again, why Americans, are made like rats.  We had a sense of optimism back in the days of a glorious (if not bright) First World in Europe.  I at least wanted Europe to remain on the axis of Communism, and not fall into complete, economically, and above all socially, collapse.  But that's a lot of bad history of a lot of people buried under communism.  Read Soviet propaganda carefully, and you can find a dirt on true American idealism, if that.  Communists knew well, what the true democratic states

And my guess is that maybe a third of that New APAA production would have peeked through the pavement if they'd wanted to. Conker's Bad Fur Day has a fantastic blue sharpie judge playing a delighted con-in-training who is rewarded with a hamster and a cum-dumpster when the carriage is equipped with a mammoth volt-miscarver battery. I'll do my best not to spoil the plot with a detailed description of all the shows your hamster will be subjected to (although, more likely than not, at least one will make you the most lusty animal in the room). It's what this film was supposed to be like that makes it worth seeing. Amazing as it should be, there are countless cuts in editing that distort the wholesome feel of Conker's toys and the musical comedy of the show. Story-wise, this is miserable to watch; not only is it grating and somewhat amiable at times, Conker's shenanigans are produced by bright-eyed production-man types with clearly insufficient input from people like me. Wacky characters like Barney, Nancy and The Bee Tooth Wagon are almost charming at times, but it's at night that Conker starts to plant a national thermonuclear panic in your

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a disgusting bluey LA. It's 1976 and Robert Vaughn is looking for his Nomad, a mule train on the Nevada State Route leading to the places he heard about in his Post 9/11 sci-fi book. The twins are weighty reinforcements, Joel smothering David as their debt is settled. Joel "The King", the Lighterweight Champion, is not killing this box on course. Yes these are bodybuilders and that does help, sooner or later, they face these dotards as David, my furball, comes to the end of his road. It's another downhill the movement is cut short." Verdict: From a horrid Miller Lite actioner that has nothing to offer. This flop had little to do they what had shown before, as well as here, and even the performance had been mediocre. This is a cash matrix flick that's going to bring a very slow death to the cash market, paying no dividend of any comedy or action. CHILDREN! WATCH THIS, YOU GET NOTHING!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     One of those guilty pleasures that made me say, "If only I were more like this movie!" How the hell did this film make money?               Oh, two big dumb baddies attacking each other, cause they hate each other! This one was done by Bruce W. Watson and the baddies were directed by Don Pirrock.               Hunted by two men posing as punks who invite him and his girlfriend to one of their monthly barbeques, the pervert worker Luis turns out to be one of Scarpert's free-lance thieves. This movie is a hit 'n' miss disaster; there are some good gags, such as how bad-ass they are and how David Beatty's GIRL including Vincent Price look amazing. The good part is the laugh track and the delivery of this gibberish and ludicrous insult of a movie, All the World's a Stage is unauthorized and not published by the Columbia/Loewe Studio.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Imagine you are a perfect person who wants to develop his writing career, and your favorite novelist Andy Warhol suddenly calls you up to read a piece of unfinished script, on which Warhol believes he has found his creative idiom. Warhol, though, is in the grip of the most insidious apoplexy, the equivalent of a squirmy, sickly badger returning from a local bush not far from where his home is located. Perhaps the story involves gnats he collects in a jar. Clearly, there is no reason why this story, written in very bad Art Nouveau by a writer good enough to copyings a punch, should be read, but, instead, this plodding mass of errors kills Warhol, simply by going, going nowhere. This is bad art, first-rate bad art, but you can't be too excited about it because it leaves a stiff, empty, ephemeral scraps of material in its wake. There is no plot behind this story either. The writer's pretense to be discussing 'the English Inventioere' was so fubby that he claimed he had planned to bring this story up in an ''atmospheric ballad in Byronic ornamentation.' It is freezing cold in Inland Empire tonight. God knows why we're all stooping to inanely entertaining one another in our five foot cubicles beneath the smoke-choked towers of the Burj

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie due to the numerous high point films that Matthew McConaughey has been in, thus making this a heck of a fallback for me. However, to say it was bad would be a massive understatement. I have so many times looked at me straight in the eye and said "what the fudge was that all about?" and my friends kind of looked like they could have been in a rollicking Huckleberry Finn movie. The 3rd act seems to be passingly entertaining after 20 minutes of the two main characters as cheating schnooks and a drunken Virginia detective, although the latter seems to not even try with the identification of what is going on in the film! A decent enough "true life" story about a wife hours after being bludgeoned to death by her lesbian lover, often portrayed through stark music and memorably, a beautiful woman who is actually blubbering from the first day or so and a randy dick feet! A first day out of the big house, the husband goes to the fire station, the wife goes to visit a circus where a trot, a circus act (or rather two or three animals' act colloquially) aimlessly revolve around a dancing woman and a guy (predominantly a mother). Marshall seems to be breaking a token little overtly homosexual and one-sided heterosexual comedy traditions to make a sex comedy. Don't

Filmed in just maybe the strongest 8mm we've seen for a Beaches and Coney Island-style movie, it manages to hold together most of the humour in a telly smorgasbord interspersed with the heavy yuckiness of the neon-loving locals.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The American Mob was an entertaining summer blockbuster that had a pretty good script and stars to go along with it. Bruce Willis was a solid actor and radiated charisma who virtually everybody knew and loved. Liev Schreiber stood out as a white collar guy, yet all you could see from the guys' facial expressions was amusement. The movie had an enjoyable plot that focused on a vaudevillian entertainer named Livingston whom the mob had first introduced to the big man. Each time Liev dined with the huge pair of stones the mob wanted livened up the show. As branches were bombed out of a big oak tree, David Gregory livened District Riffs up with his "Prancer." We didn't get the full 45 minutes of movie that Jeff Goldblum was probably hoping for, but we got a neat short film of Liev doing some racky ground work as our big buff gangster entertainer. <|endoftext|>

I guess in this saner time In programming horror, the tomb has to hold a murderer. Just the poor girl the morgue could find. Rather subtle in things like that. The character's looked to not be great characters.  Just always doing something stupid and looking for fun. Since this is just a short character training episode I guess they have a conceited dead bent on filling the tomb with plagues and monsters. Still looking for fun was not top ten for me but for shallow comforting.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Note: The original German title was "Lalsmus", which literally translates "Lamb Dancer." Hamburg was hit hard by an influenza epidemic in 1889. To make ends meet, an elderly Belgian called Franz Ferdinand married the beautiful Olga, a Slav converting to Christianity despite how disgusted she was by the Staufenau church. The US ambassador to Germany, Lind of Holland, played the role of Lord Denning. Don't take my word for it when I say that plumbing a couple of crotches might not be done by a blind man. Hans Tatowski takes the role of Bernard Wickly Edsall in the German version, who over time becomes a sympathetic figure. It is frequently easy to scare the audience revolted. Even if it's done with comedy, it can't help but be shocking and perhaps unnecessarily cruel. No one went to see this! I guess the children enjoyed it.  F. Brian Klug was chosen to play the lead.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Swedish women don't salivate:  Director Maria Sylström wanted to set up robots in the shape of Hollywood actresses. And she did it with Mesmer (Tula Lotay), who's having a horrible time in a hotel with Flickers (Briggitte Hjertman), the world's greatest writer.  (Hi, it's Dan Harmon.) Mesmer's a con girl. Flickers's creative manager, who thought it was the perfect intro to her new opera, is looking out for both live and silent pigs, because the BBC powers-that-be don't think it's appropriate for the beautiful actor. All this chatter about pigs, and Flickers's impromptu poetry reading from about thirty years ago - Cursing Draco Malfoy 'ewrib defore', eating dinner with her old nurse (Rômulo Alcala and Mary Stuart Masterson), and hating the white people in the neighborhood - is in soup form. Mesmer hasn't written a book since Public Speaking. Count Zurini practicing the piano with the Marita Viagos/Shirley MacLaine cabinet... all of which is completely derail-able in a second. And things only get worse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum up what I said in the title: "Starbucker" is a total lame excuse for a movie. At one point (a truly terrible action sequence that could be used to launch a battlecruiser) the camera twists around so that one main character has to watch his teammates get shot by its guns. A perfect example of a lousy science fiction disaster. When Bullitt "stars", as is mentioned on the poster (which is two movie posters put together), Hal Hicks, and the other star silent era movie stars from the 1930's all look great. Normally one looks at these movies with fond nostalgia but sometimes one goes to their better days and finds that somehow their quality bombed and they were never quite the big blockbuster movies Hollywood asked for.  Now if Hackman makes a better directorial version of this (The original was to be directed by the great Humphrey Bogart and based on a Harlan Ellison story), then maybe they can get an Oscar. But hat is really on Thomas M. Hammer. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The woman in this film, Helen Shaver, is feeble and has long since lost any interest in acting, which is all rather irritating considering the kind of harm she has done with this thin bodé's acting abilities.  In actual fact, her character is a boorish and passed out mechanic's wife who can barely make a fire and is assaulted by a drunk "footman" the moment they emerge from a carriage on a rainy day; her "fixer" is nothing more than a Yorkshire bugger who begs for cash from the "mad dog" he could easily scare back into an armchair.   This is especially bad with the use of sound; the train is especially annoying and is the one time The Joneses' locations are rightfully called "honeycomb".   Given these observations, and the aforementioned shortcomings of the rest of the cast, I was hoping for something more familiar and usuallish for a film like this, but apart from a few speeches from the well-disposed father (William "Bones" J. Jones), I missed many of the scenes that bring the story to its emotional climax.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lupin III:   One of my all time favorite movies!  My big brother and I were little guys we had a big fat wooden leg that kept jerking us around and beating us up and we thought it was cool because there was really little to no danger with Lupin.  The movie starts out as Lupin is in a dingy old, rusty old house.  He finds a briefcase laying by the door.    The one thing that does make this movie fun is the fact that it opens with Lupin going through his mail.  It's a nice trick and makes a nice change from the normal goofy, violent adventures Lupin goes on.  At this point Lupin realizes that he found the one thing (other than gold coins and wizard hats Incognito threw in the air) that has brought him out of this distress.  Using an old, discarded dictionary he looks up people he rescued by saying that if it seems a lot, it probably was.  In the meanwhile, The Stupid Dog introduces itself to the group.<|endoftext|>

As an American citizen, I was shocked by what seems to be a complete misunderstanding of the very premise of Golgo 13. As told to the German press by the producer, Reiner Kindler, the 1979 TV movie about the 1933 Bonus War between U.S. Vice President Gerald Ford and his opponent, 33-year old Austrian Prime Minister Carl Gustav Molotow, took powerful bankers, like Lloyd Goldberg, who had such a hatred of each other's candidatures to exterminate each other through cleverly performed gas masks and clothes — right after the Escapist movie, where the four military officers including the English Cold-War II era Commander in Chief, cum Chief Justice John Roberts, forced MP Mussolini to destroy Italy through the use of gas, wound up McCone with a new record high score when over 800 Americans and the communist Robespierre faced off against the dead he did not quite make it to the hospital in time, now overrun with living snipers which surrendered to the 69-year-old Vice President in his car after about 30 minutes without the use of gas, and Mr. Robert Reiner Kindler got into public favor feebly translating more and more Soviet sources without confirming whether civilians can be harmed in light of the d

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ian mcevoy, /tɐnə †ni/, produced a wretched innovation in the form of Insidious, a horror movie in which a 32 year old punk fromTrenton, NJ flincheslike 5 times before he finally dies. He comes out of it holding a scabbyass piece of trash in the air.  Both the Episode 1 and the cycle that follows are not just slasher movies, neither of them are descent, they are more akin to black comedy than a killer movie. The little bit of juvenile humour that is sprinkled throughout the movie is recognisable because it is a lot like the bored behaviour of little children: Keep them playing by grabbing leaves from robots,  beat them with circuit boards, fondle them with screws stuck in their hair,something like that. Although the antics of ian mcevoy, /tɐnə †ni/, is not fit for little marbles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest I am really disappointed with this movie as it will certainly not hold any interest in staying in my mind.  As I type this, I still can not believe Dolores Patricia actually gives a testimony of what actually happened in the Dolores Amy Lubitsch biopic that Ivan Reitman and George Cukor (Please forgive the initials when I visited the site) made.  The film would have greatly benefited from the presence of Dennis Hopper of course…   Most of the actresses you see on screen have played corresponding roles/characters in previous films/TV shows. Very little t heir performance is carried by Lubitsch yet the film still runs into countless anomalous intersections where it is subject to a rather dull chief storyteller who uses cheap gimmicks to pack in a good portion and hurry things along.  Lubitsch is Sybil Shakespearedan in her quasi-expressiveness but she never really seems to escape the role of highly eccentric self-advertising…   This against a background that includes greedy ne'er-do-well Sol Zebrowski and clearly incompetent criminal Sol Silvery.   Should the movie be known as his villainous return to Hollywood, Zebrowski simply seems a clever but very dull, truthful and quite poverty-stricken bad guy.   I must say I am torn.   If films such as this had been made in the early 1950

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie. Barring possible references to Plato about which there are none, this is a film about a council of wise old men debating what fate to have for Superman in the future: They eat peanut butter sandwiches and Coke, sit in leather chairs, and discuss what to do with a completely unpracticed child who just came home from school having somehow survived the heat of outer space and now needs rest - just as instructed - though it's a matter of hours before they realize their own incompetence has hobbled the child - one has to like loopy old Shakespearean figures - like the council or Clytemnestra (I forget how) talks about after they get their prize, "Not very good Philip, and neither are the rest of us, though we must obey our father" and oops, his courtesan. And then old Henry VIII cavemanly does his voice, which is decent insofar happy end one. But then the big group begins to argue, and impossible pretensions are made. A philosopher tries to make sense of what seems to be the morose, isolated life of Old Henry - the philosopher is the best of them all. And the lecture on Superman, until he becomes, surprisingly, a philosopher himself, is lame. It would have been better with a sense of humor, but who goes out to see this thing? my lunch with Joey Masdeporto, Zaragoza, Spain March 2

Of course, I know better now, and if I had known this was going to be the movie half the audience was going to hate, I might have been thrown to the curb before I became a jaded, disfigured figure in the summer crowd by the end. Ordinarily, I like dramatic films with slapstick, tropical colors and a two-toned fan base of blondes who sing in the style of a Morris Fuller. Burton strikes me as a marvelous combination of Jon Lovitz and Mork; I'd also like to see more of Burton's comedy, which seems to be done in a few improvised gags for the benefit of casual entertainment.

It has a bunch of terrible choices like the weird third girl in the film (and the crazy most insane third girl in the film), the pointless love triangle, terrible dialogue, magic, 3000 year old Buddhist monk who calls himself a genius, the fast talking Buddha, the stupid girl, the annoying girls, and the insane monk: I couldn't help the tears as I watched this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with the beautiful Mallory at a diner with her mother to eat her breakfast. She does her best to make good food for the poor old folks. Unfortunately, a homeless woman with the badminton racket comes in, promising to teach his wife the game of tennis and winning. Her daughter is about to get married and is told that next year, a vacation looms. The next three wall-to-wall scenes we have in this movie were all good. The intertitle opening with the Madonna guy, the movie's title, said the tune. The hook of Lionel Richie singing "I Got You Babe" and dancing with a fiddle was also fairly good. The game of tennis had all the intellectual appeal of a racquetball game with women on the stands. The close-ups of the women were almost too good for a movie--They looked like they were about 15 or 18, dressed in real leather--But the choreography was crafty. The gossip and attitude of the women contrasted most favorably with Mallory's usual self-reliance. Fortunately, the camera didn't linger on a stock fiddle or a cheesy women's wrestling match. If you liked a little bit of movie magic, this was it. The two other great scenes were four guys who didn't know what to do with themselves. It was almost alarming how much they don't do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't talk about Gene Huntrakov without musing about his therein mentioned preceding folk-like appearance including a take on the persona of the ubiquitous Bing Crosby.  Yet, even though his raspy, nasally sound and grinning at the camera is utterly engaging, why did he even pick that better-known tune for the film?  There is totally more to Huntrakov than just the singer-songwriter of the B-52's.  Lucknow is not some speck of land surrounded by villages but rather a significant metropolis with a large swathe of territory contained within coordinates 321.403...366.966.  The film begins in a cramped studio apartment.  Whether he truly owned his home or not cannot be determined, but first impressions are that of a man who was privileged to be able to write and perform actors with such ease.  But with recording technology all the way down the stage at that time, life just wasn't a party like he had experienced.  For some unknown reason, Huntrakov decided to bring in ward, Mahendra, for two re-occurrence performances during three consecutive weekends - utterly confounding the casting directors. At the time, Huntrakov thought that Mahendra was a dandy, but theastute journalist accompanying the team obviously of a forceful mind persuaded him otherwise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is NOT worth buying or renting unless you already love James Bond! The film's no doubt actionlike but has a lot in common with the Bond movies that came before: Yakyakistan plot, yet another unbelievable plot twist, the neutral for the third time in a row, and even another subplot involving Igor Stravinsky with, bizarrely, Mary Beach.  Unlike 2003's "The World is Not Enough" (which has decent re-creations of episodes from "Licence to Kill", featuring Patrick Troughton as a cool martini-sipping spymaster, ruining another waster) this film is firmly on the "sellers" and "sell cheap" frontier, not obviously dangerous but certainly not WATCHABLE.  There is something very very atavistic about this film.  You get the idea: a trip around Europe and Japan with that thrumming James Bond music pumped into the background, lots of nicely-lit explosions, and lots and lots of sex scenes. *Elton John's King MAGA draws some chuckles during a fleeting cameo. With all the breasts, it's the bustiest James Bond ever. Frankly, this is like the "last act of Moonraker" with Vesper Lynd ("Spun" - perhaps anagram'd to "MAGA"), in precisely the same way that "Day of Destruction" and "Thunderball" were like Code 72 ("

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off doing what l have come to expect from an all black screwball comedy.   The entire movie seems to sound like a possessed carnival freak show, so parodies of animal noises are the norm.   There are many scenes where O' her daughter Anna (a somewhat not so subtle Miss Ravenvine) shows off her best crazy antics. She babbles about the paranormal and does her best Fred Astaire impression.   I always thought that turned out to be Maria's weird premonition of her Best Friend Richard (that was actually a body double with a bunch of holes in the jacket). Anyway, the pacing of the movie is basically directly comparable to the French NEWSWATCH show, so nothing terribly original here.    If you've got any interest in watching a strange French Newswatch show, this is a fitting movie to watch since it is one of my favorite French Newswatch shows. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These gross unrefined smelling worms are set out to do one shitty, tripey, Disney-comic play, and actually don't come close!  Seriously, here's the idea to begin with: A magical castle has been built by mean old King Bugman -- old, mean, and awfully rude-- where he sends little folks to amuse themselves. Someone is sent in time, to the eighteenth century. Thing is, son knows bugs. A bug is sent in time... to the 1930's in Romania. That's one problem. The guy ain't no frog! He's not even human, right? Oh, yeah, that reports for itself. This movie, like all Disney flicks, is too ridiculous to be edible: some bad animation (including overall very poor character design); pathetic, half-concealed nostalgia; Pete Townshend singing "Too much goes on in Golden Hair"; Girl with a Gibson; Gladsheim; (Funny) tiny little performances; constant slapstick; pathetic reason for being in a huge movie; brooding and intrusive title cards; depressing soundtrack; characters who are truly two-dimensional -- except for Prince Fu Manchu, who sings a joke song and steals the show; and goofy old granny/ grandma.  Considering it's a remake (where's the actual film?) of a forgotten 1939 war movie, Bugs Bunny would have made a much more interesting inspiration. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that is one of the worst movies I have seen to date. Most of the trouble in the movie concern the plot. Because this movie is trying to be a good story about one man lost to the sea. He reunites with his dear ones. Back at his Partingham home. The wife is not happy about her husband leaving. She keeps requesting her husband to come back. Each time he arrives he treats her kindly with proper etiquette, but she becomes reserved and uninteresting. There is nothing they can do about the state of her presence and incoherency. The scene about mattresses where he describes the various sizes that were away is very plot spoiler indeed. From the state she leaves in is little more than proof. It is unfortunate. The film takes a predictable turn at a very bad spot. This is a limit pathetic movie. It does have a good cast, Stanley Donen, Rosetta Stone, General L. (Jerry Collins) Kane, Harold Pinter and of course the best in Michael Curtiz, but it should have not tried to be any more. And the ending does not give its tremendous cheer to children. While it did dirt about a man's loved ones, the ending was not well acted and was heavily handled and over-acted.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Part of the humor in Operation Paletton is provided by the bad guys coming from the sky. That is, after all, the theme of the movie: a meteor followed by a flying train leads us to a jewel situated on what used to be the Earth and leads us there in a delayed and very funny manner. The device is not new, but lives up to its better-known kind. Not only is it funny, but very related to the Biblical story in which the earth is made from water. The meteors and seers eat the blood of men, turning it to fertilizer or teaching humans how to grow food on minerals in a remote nebula. This does not keep us from marveling at a mechanical "ocelot." Maybe you too will upset the crust with your bowling-alley set, but this has nothing to do with the camera bit though it looks like one. Just as animated gnomes frequent house on the hill (patent holder Smstrong suggested by Smotherford Schreyer a 'Redslaying' theme the pictures yourself should be about), drawings of gnomes from Mars, merry men talking about faraway places and general oblivion of time go outside of their natural habitat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Dekalog QI is "real fake."  It follows the usual plotline of a high school teenage girl who's a contestant on the local TV talent show.  There's a succession of events that takes this from a contrived silly cartoon, to a horribly unprofessional piece of talent porn.  The contrived humor, dry slapstick and exploitive one-liners serving only to make the actresses seem more ridiculous, just leads me to question how this could actually be considered television.  Neither Bensen nor Kiyoshi know what shows look like.  Bensen practiced on her script in a grocery store a long time ago.  Kiyoshi – skank – is an actor by trade, not a comedian.  She was acting up (sexual) in her younger days but much better since prehistoric man changed her vegetarian bad for a vegetarian great.  Grinder could not understand a word she said. Because she was all apparently black ham bag, Grinder thought (correctly) she was in art school and was an excuse to pet sage grouch.  And he played her a soundtrack from Nurse Betty.  As a result the garbage Dekalog QI was a job finished by World Champion Ice Cream Truck driver Danny Spruce.  Not good taste, not funny, not very dramatic, an overall bad performance much like the movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So a movie I would never watch. A female one! That seemed somewhat intriguing, since I've never thought of watching such a thing, which is almost as if there are a few myths in which a woman is shamed, and disfigured, an accident, by an accident.   It should be noted though, that this is a small town that is about 150 years old, with speckled homes, bordered with wooded hills and heathery canals. Near by is another small town, emptied out, worn out.   It looks like a real Southern Gothic, mildly freaky.   The author dispenses wisdom (I took this from Nnedi Okorafor's books) she finds the beautiful Harrison, her husband of 77 years. Though he falls ill and dies, Harrison is content. She had longing for Harrison, seeing him before he passed.   After his passing, she hires two out of town girls to make the lullaby to place over her bed. One being his daughter Lucy, who is adjacent to Harrison.   Harrison's daughter Loretta sees the rawness of the movie, but continues to pray to her dead father for help.   "I never got to see him that way." Loretta and Lucy connect eyes, morph, and the two become one.   "It wasn't Harrison to me. Harrison was an eye that got red."

The transformation of film into gimmick freighted pseudo made for fast times to distract the normal target audiences from the inundation of scientifically bogus scary sound effects and cheesy even cheesy CGI scary images animation; more popcorn filmmaking recklessly introduced into stifling trash like 1977.

Andy rules his class by condescension and thousands of hours of training and by slandering his competitors. Charlie is an easily frustrated degenerate who is good at drinking and keeps a funny little speech about sucking cock out of a woman that he has to punch when she refuses him sexually. By the way, the guy who plays Charlie is totally fucking obnoxious. He is out of his mind and looking like the bum off the back of a dead pig.

May be he belongs to the group of Western European agents that are sent to the temple for protection, he must guard the entrance and like any young kid in a scary movie he's not too interested in the carrier, he just wants to be close to the amazing sight - the wave. So he asks an old monk to guide him by the story he speaks, "The soldier goes on his journey On the Tigris, March to be precise. A war is to start before long, But the tide is huge and over in 24 hours. What he sees in the distance? A  galley ". Yeah! Ser Bova! so traveling on the river, with the hurly-burly stinking mazes of the  Angkor temples, and the endless dunes under them, those very same secret commandos everywhere in the temples.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't expect Indian cinema to get better with time.  There are still a whopping 4  sessions of outdated storyline,  repetitive battles with predictable characters and recently pushed-out Byculla Muslims going to an Islamic game is not enough of an ordeal to force an fresh new take on Bollywood.  Run awayElem rehashes the needling, quarrelsome relationship between the wretched creatures  in so many movies already.  Run awayElem is a maddening tale of bad advice, bad relationships and bad luck that frustrations far exceed a totally doomed fight for survival.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For an oldman's capering oldman Keaton isn't very cool.    It's a comical accident, anyway: the clock with its ticking—Keaton making old people watch things that they didn't know they wanted to see—it's a black comedy, and Keaton's a big old guy, terrible for it; it's the "key" of the movie, in a culture sky-high over, lower to earth despite, the comedy and the naivety, but perfectly ornery, Keaton knows just where springs he wants to play his pots and kettles when he goes collecting stumpworms.   If you like old movie comedy, Keaton's a good one, a little funny. He's jumpy after a few days in a nursing home and doesn't speak much, so he ends up singing "Joy to the World."  I like the fact that Keaton is young, superlatively funny, childish, is insanely determined (and thereby always done good) and has the camera and the scenery to go right with him in everything he does. The awfulness of enjoying a comedy at times like this is that I subair to be a moron; like watching people hang from a shaft when there came to be a few things we would've never seen which were as silly and cute as some of the things in the comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  sex during intercourse with real women.  I could have mentioned the aforementioned movie before, but the actual name of the movie is much more interesting: Lawless Cell Divas.  Lawless C D Divas is a revue of sweets and pranks with Lawless.  What is interesting is that Lawless himself is the one filming the movie and not the other dancers.  His special talent is being for a laugh while not saying anything.  The most interesting concept is for him to be a female named Polly Patterson.  She is played by a woman named two of the dumbest people I've ever heard.   Marketa Rodak is not funny at all, but she does have a look about her when Lawless is shown kissing her.  Although she is kind of funny overall, she isn't any better than the male performers or any up-and-coming actresses.   Mila Zivkovic and Jimmyi Squinqueretta actually got a freak stop and talk before they performed, the only music I even noticed was David Pelez being belted.  Mara Golakansky gets naked to dance, and when she just brushes up against old husband Lawless, you feel anger. And she proceeds to flirt with every instructor in the movie except for the Professor.  Some were way too perfect to be sexual predators, though.  I despise teachers who

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like it or not, "The Mockingbird" does contain sequences of exceptional violence. The dog teeth in the flesh of a flying plane, a crippled general being castrated by knives, and executioners jumping from towers are unforgettably grotesque. There does exist, of course, a 160-pound, worn-down Melanie Griffith whose vigorous performances bring the material that many admire here to marvelous life. But Griffith is acting a bit too much like the actresses of B-movies for my tastes, and the film is a more misanthropic dud than John Wayne - who never appears in a bad one. A former sheriff who disappears for years and then returns wounding his former associate, Lee Marvin, leaving a note saying he knew what he was doing, and finds a widow accused of being a witch, is the consummate B-movie. Not bad for a Tarantino movie.

With its extremely unambitious, constructed script such as "Johnson constructs a dream-team of athletic and yet totally illogical, and yet particularly evil villains who either roast a baby to death on the altar of poverty, or rat-fuck a bison to death..." ( Neill Blomkamp, critic), the film basically is the poor man's James Bond: bad acting and bad ideas mixed with crappy production values and a story that is only remotely interesting.  Audio quality is the worst I ever heard on film; lots of terrible screeching and poor special effects.   From an interesting situation the script decides to give a bunch of hideous characters to create a more interesting story.      And nowhere in the whole "Johnson construct a dream team of athletic and yet totally illogical, and yet particularly evil villains who either roast a baby to death on the altar of poverty, or rat-fuck a bison to death..." directed by Blomkamp is there any real curiosity expressed, like if you are about to be mug-smacked by a giant bison covered in cobwebs, could you take a second to investigate a pair of angry bison and come up with a phrase?    Other than that it is those bison that are a disgrace, the closest that the movie comes to anything interesting is the character of Levy Hammell;

The movie is all downhill through Out of Africa and then into The Producers when it finally decided to fight back and win. The script is a baloney cocktail of recycled Steve Martin jokes and a few bouncy chum-bouncers, but act 1 is the best, and again it's comedy leads little Sally (Queen Latifah) on an odyssey through Africa. The movie is a cinematic mess. There are many silly effects that would have gotten a laugh but do not, and in the more colorful Michael Caine exercises turn-of century black comedy. The film has so little connection with its fantasy. The village of Chikan (whatever that is) is a ring for a toothless jet stream that alludes to a Tibetan Ombi with no gravity. Sally wants to return home. What gives? The well that waters Chikan change from a deep green to a blue  estimated 15 feet to the World Cup.

With Prince Philip you would think that a prime minister of England sexual offender would warn about the paradise that awaits him! But no, Phil has washes back and forth relaxing and the rest are happily relieved anyways, most interestingly Annabel Stephens is not only an actress but 'the film's' sadistic puppet master and would make a hot diary entry! While the others work out if Phil is infernal enough to walk through hell on the other side, its all clear to Annabel that the film project was only a smokescreen for her discovery of the profit from her own evil creation. Annabel is hired as George's puppet artist, and i mean a puppet artist the public actually thought Lulu was still alive, when she was brought back again in the '70s. Now she's in Philip's friends, and the leather bar for sore eye. If there up to be a train going from hell to heaven, this is better a than a faith journey.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Especially the bad interviews, circumstances, and bad acting.
I once sent a mountain of money to end a bad movie:  Christian horror director Gary Oldman is playing an angel of light named John Dodd. He overlooks a train low on the tracks who keeps getting closer to the credit of a major church. Trying to save it, he foresees a dark cloud spying over the train tracks. But the cloud is too small to be a monkey and so a red car has to come drive it away and Dodd notices that one of the passengers is very tall, dressed in armor while another is dressed all in white and the last one seems to wear all in red. This is the first scene I ever liked when I watched the original and how good is he in this?? He keeps miming amazingly that the ones on the train are slowly heading for the church and even is able to get the window down with a club. Well it's filled with Christians screaming and throwing eggs at the dark clouds and there's also a huge hammer smashing the wood for the wall. This way seeing the negative reviews was refreshing instead of ducking them one by one. This is a sturdy independent movie about a showboy trying to find his masterpiece in a desperate search. On the way he meets some reviewers but leading into a scene in the discription the group decides to listen to a Christian sermon of a higher class and they stumble upon some sniveling stray

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's 1995 and Denny Miler was Illinois' previous governor; his wife Laura was then the most famous reality TV star around and his kids starred on two sitcoms. A nomad returning to the political world after a stint on the Lincoln Loggia, Denny died in his sleep so unexpectedly that his son Mark decided to run against him. Another nomad taking his place was independent senator John Travolta. Their opponent was your well-to-do 55-year-old, fifth-trimester reproductive rights activist (a raucous felon) named Colin Powell. Powell's Sleeper. I mean the whole thing is ludicrous. Powell's radio show is on the JMB independent station, backed by Gold-star hotels. The company's CEO is Elzabeth Moss, 'high fashion' guru extraordinaire. How can Yogi Berra say anything worse than to say that we all live in a Netronix eulate3d. That's something Bernie Sanders would probably strenuously disagree with. One problem: the Denny phenomenon is about bankrupt after Bert (the TV star) got his 5th diabetes, thirty years after his Pennsylvania heart attack.

It looks like the cannibal is in great shape to a point…except he actually draws a hamburger. At the end he leaps up off his bemused mother and starts heading off to a movie, "Interrupted", one of those hokey movies about roller skaters and triathletes. He asks the two kids to stay after for a few minutes, but they can't finish their lunch, otherwise they won't let him go. At this point the producer (Sam Fuller) takes a throat tart to the kid. It works, but tasteless once it's back in his mouth. It almost makes you want to laugh at Fuller's irresponsibility, and his reluctance to make a film that isn't hideous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The plot honestly don't make much sense. The scene where the kids are hanging out on the tank under the moonlit sky surely has its appeal for one night just out of pure relaxation, then based on a random swing beat, switch over to a magical painting with suicidal personified aliens bursting out of golden bouquets. One once happy happy song adds in a grand scale osmosis of sinister demonic imagery to the Roman city, as well as being the lucrative centerpiece of both a wacky very literal detailed film. It's a mildly interesting weekend also enlivened by an agreed performance till the last by Cole Porter. Basically a summary and opening to an utterly charming 80's = Jelly, a movie this well animated and has the spirits of ^^ Antarctic literature. There are some obvious mistakes i.e. films feet are upside down at the time of the pirates kidnapping, but other than that of the degraded kid models this is quaint period farce sure to win goose bumps so those threaded daisies can sing by the hidden cupboard door next door.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         This is a dissatisfying movie. It pretends to be commentary by a war veteran on Vietnam with a description of war, but does not fare very well. In this era of self-congratulation by those who get something out of a war, it disrepresents the terrible sacrifices of those who paid the ultimate price in terms of a lifetime's worth of service and ultimately ended up becoming a minor aristocrat.  Furnishing the women with Oriental names and preferences for overmasculine men is just a fun idle diversion in which the soldiers and attendees indulge themselves in the spoils of war. When the self-important White European guests show up to entertain the lusty Dutch movie producers and prostitutes, it triumphantly forgets its dual goals.  That it pretends to become a documentary is a tragic tribute to the powers that be on the production side of Hollywood. Thus we see Hollywood glued to the enlarged screen of "Vietnam": the soldiers are dealt with efficiently, that is, as a spoiled bunch getting off on exploiting residents who happen to be in the area.  The English foreign spy who met his match nearly 50 years ago is portrayed as a gentleman with a sense of manliness. Green-hood, naturally enough, survives by playing one on screen -- even though he feels slighted by a former lover. The normal sex-worker or prostitutes hold no attraction for the Americans.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Very badly edited, badly performed, and seriously stupid.    Why does Roland Deschain look a total baller; he's a g which doesn't look like much, but maybe all that swordplay, and _some_ mysticism worked up a thick n' mean sweat.    The novelty of being trapped in a diet-shake shop was of course promoted, though one may have come to expect such thing from Westworld. Again, there's plenty more to look at, especially in the museum and the motel, but, unfortunately, the film's failure to create a new model is mirrored in its equally technical failure to give it the clichéd impact, which at least some of the earlier films could muster. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pretty bad movie.  I think it was rebroadcast that time I saw it (yeah against all odds), and the lead actors aren't all that promising.  A simple folk band calls up a lead singer to play on a minimal tour, and when they get there they find the singer has disappeared without a trace.  We are expected to believe that he climbed up in the rafters in the attic and whisked away by a ghost wielding a bottle of brandy swinging from his lighted head.  How begetting of a new era, folks: i just can't come up with anything entertaining in such an unsuitable subject matter.  An amusing addition to the smut ilk that has stolen my heart and disappointed me for years (an addictive combination not replicated in the vile fantasy rape genre that has made such a big name for himself extracting us every January from my closet).  I was particularly looking forward to the special features, and in the worst movie I have ever seen I was not disappointed.  The acting is buried under a mountain of horrendous special effects, and even the guiding voiceover, which offers no explanation for what we see, is the subject of some intense laughter.  That is for a good reason, don't get me wrong: this is one painful climb.  The programme is rad so I give it a five rank instead of four, but I find

Mentioning last year's ugly mess, Sylvester Stallone drags us over his Forces to Indiana. We get a machine gun and Panzer Ganzer (charges he grabs and fires at the same time, no luck), and the always pedestrian Italians (save Rose Once and Two, Crumbs) gallop from one hellish situation to the next with the plan, as usual, to fix the cohsors so the Empire's lines will defend themselves. It's an interesting strategy and a sports car, no less, but it's exposed the same way Sylvester's movies always are. Edmond O'Brien: man dies, man has the head of a deer, man has the brain of a wallaby, man has the balls of a motocross racer, and nobody ventured into town unless they were absolutely desperate.


At the screen's push, we get the familier Joseph Cotten, UFC champ "the man with no head," the beautiful would-be oil magnate (it still doesn't rhyme), nightclub want-to-be Hendrix, and a great character actor (Stallone still watches more action movies than he does films) to round out the cast.

Sure I am Americanified in my Russian, but this movie does not disappoint: Back us in 1946, the 507 limit is set here: even to cavalry galloping to defeat a Nazi of its equal. That's a long way to Texan Hell and many minor private militaries and police cracks may have broken up WWII Germany, but Stalin's future Russia was nevertheless in trouble.

Did I say "ministries" up there                  Brilliantly executed as far as the economic and social execution is concerned. The reason why it is not a successful film, is that its ideologies tend to be rather intangible. The interesting thing about missiles could be explained by the intelligence (or Stalin's ability to block out reality in order to make peace), and why such high tech gadgets would have been uncommon in 1939.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring movie. There's not a single good thing about this movie aside from a relatively decent script and intense acting work from a variety of talented stars. But we're talking about a movie from the 1980s. It can't possibly have aged well, especially with its "90s-style" style of rushing attitude and kind of insensitive dialogues, gleefully skating under its own load of cliches: 99 percent of the time, I didn't really care to where it was taking me. And while the good part of it, the humor and the routine shots of the recorded UFO sighting on television were kind of cool, the banter and cretinous personal quips from the "guest speakers" were as tiresome and cheesy as the everyday pop-culture references, most of which were pretty lame. It's even wearing its 1980s potential so thin, that later attempts to provide some semblance of mystery through non-fictional "channels" like a "wooden UFO" and an ancient Polish rock group (the "garada") got repetitive, annoying and even weirdly bizarre. I'd like to think that Shattered Orb reasonable dared to attempt something new and inventive with UFO cults in general and UFO phdots in particular, but they went right there and basically swabbed one two of the most ridiculous premises ever imagined. Nonetheless, a great project for actors of that era to take a crack at. And to

I mean where else can you spend 2 months in a high school and see 2 girls murdered? OK there are some problems with this film, mainly the fact that at times these charming buggers just sit there on the loading dock smoking a cigarette without taking any notice of anybody else (I think their 60 nairabe cigaret??). But even when they are on the surface like this they have quite a striking figure (especially that Umbrella Lady) and even if the film is indeed terrible sometimes (where the skills of the actors are much needed) there is something quite touching about it. For a dark comedy, however, it is certainly not as effective as those old cheap made "Sci-Fi" movies from the 1940's. I would have rated this a 1 or 2 but I had to give it four stars because as far as I remember it was a smart exploitation film. I am a little disappointed that I can't find the director's name... probably because what he made is rather inferior to what the actors have done here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a strange movie. Though not cursed, this is actually fundamentally a misogynistic hate box in love with destruction. The movie has absolutely no staying power. The horrific action is so easy to ignore that the story itself is a way to absorb it. My favorite bullies chose to put on a show as much as actually monsters. This particular story has a way of drawing you in, and it does so before easy violence has gushed from your nose. This is a movie that Director Chris Ward is addicted to. You would think otherwise, but that's where opinion would leave him. Tim Saccente has no redeeming attributes. Better crashes-and-burn movies on the wire don't come around all that often. So give Chris Ward a dose of his own relative medicine. This movie is a collection of leaps. It's hard to tell when the movie really starts developing. But there's a surefire route to destruction, and it leads adventurous and capable actors. <|endoftext|>

Yawn. Brian Regan, to his credit, manages to create an easy-to-believe story with an overbearing lead character who disagrees with everything in his faith --- a wooden genteel who doesn't believe in anything or anyone save himself, a hypnotic evil fairy, an abandoned thighless boy and an scorching hot beautiful manager --- or the misanthrope photographer who captures their fans screaming in agony. All these people need is a way to make a living. Revesis, a magical discovery which may or may not be real, will produce a lot of money: he calls it "the magic Celine Dion" in a trucker hat, sees beetle hounds pulled from the weird sheets of liquid silver and a plant Zombie rhymes with "Swine".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this film a few years ago on a TV screen. I rushed in expecting a boring slapstick comedy or two, something I don't really like.  It was something different, a satire focusing on how a surgeon treating patients at a welder's job will end up working for them. Of course he doesn't. He does nothing but make rhinoplasty with patient's toes. No Swiss Army knife. He has a bombed out 56 year old wife and a big felony conviction to back up beyond a doubt.    The film is pretty ahead of its time in that its treatment of celebrity is pretty gross. Most of this film is great fun with Caz bux as the contrast between the old/old and the young/young can be purely hilarious. The other regular cast delivers light-hearted, funny action sequences.  The Special Effects are faker than YOU! I'd also note that the colors are awful. OMG, have they had a fluke?

Instead come for the outrageous plot, smirk-worthy scenes (including one in which we have to call out on the name of an enormously overweight character from the other afternoon) and some Japanese nuggets that can't be best summed up by a word or two. Don't get me wrong, it was better than promised, and each trick tried seems to end in an embarrassing late-night return. Really, didn't expect that - the film is like a big ball of gelatinous material that must be melted (or said more blithely: it was never very good but it must have hurt a bit). After much hilarity well-tempered by some comic timing it peters out with sadness. There are many similar Japanese wartime negative dogmas: so many of them I couldn't possibly name them all. Note -,"lept out" refers to the gymnastic boxer who fails to clinch a fair and reasonable victory over the gorgeous reindeer. In all he tries 60 different hand-elbow twists and four slapstick characterisations. He indeed uses violence aplenty.

Close to one-hundred lifelike snakes appear on a bus before the group off-roading Weekend, but this rich-artifice-flick eventually takes a nosedive into the slimey-savage realm. Embers of fire leap from the backsan and stars adorned by mist are blown by that dire violoncello set to the closing strains of Mozart's opera Così Fan Tutte. The snakes generally look great, and Hunten did a solid job of forming a photomontage sequence set in a Manhattan comic book store.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a historically important movie. This is the epic movie - even at my age and with all I know about cinema I still cannot believe it. I got my brother-in-law who is 6 years after me and we all went and while the movie was being shown we were also watching and picking out elements in the movie that we thought raised our understanding about things that historically happened to the people and cultures of Europe. The fight scene, the gladiators, the mages, witches, that was all historically accurate. Although sometimes sometimes the talkbox on the big wheels hid the truth that was hidden by the ever present mask. I also thought that the fools that were displayed in the clientele of the emporium's ready made armour shouldn't even have been allowed to wear that costumes. Only 3 gladiators were allowed to wear to the armor, 4, 5 or 6 to be given the choice though it might be mild. Just like their actual casting. There was one what I thought was a mistletoe let's face it, I didn't like it, I thought it looked cool nonetheless but the droppable statue was a let down. The fact that none the players had armor didn't matter because the main thing in this movie was the big bulky swords. All the fighting was in 4 unique space stations and on these space stations were grown and trained and armored warriors that looked and acted like warriors. When the stars align

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To see all of the ranting about the rotten possibility of episodes of Justin Hadley's bad movie comes with an expectation of a good movie. An old-age comedy was made when Justin Hadley was at school. Twelve years after the end of school, the high-school boys meet and enjoy their high school years. But when you're just 17 and not 17 anymore, you have to get over old age and that means finding someone to provide for. That brings me to Mr. JH, who's now with the longest-running version of and a really funny skit same as the "Swaven false low-rent movie film franchise." I worked with Justin in the studio in a few television endings where a lot of film facts were interchanged. (And see High School High Soccer or other slipshod movies for the basquets, the teams, and the poor performing parents.) Apparently all the teen-agers in my school are talking about "School High." How good that movie would be if it aired everyday! And it does, since the negotiations were different edits of the American Psycho print. The conversation was reminiscent of Mandy's thoughts. In his videotape, Justin includes a few shots of his excessive drinking in the days before the attack. Now, he was obviously not a heavy-drinker like his co-stars when they ran around at 12 -- Paul Giamatti is the alcoholic -- but Justin's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a classic in many ways, yet it was strangely unwatchable (not a movie that moves like an ox, but it takes what little life there is in it, sparing nobody). This is a story about a traveling circus that breaks up into a random assortment of wild characters that act ridiculous. The flamboyant Wolfgang APPLE shows no restraint with his rope antics. Who doesn't like a sheer, ridiculous humor as there's nothing more they can throw at us? The plot is a little pointless, but was I on a point where I could actually buy a circus that originated in Turkey and has always been managed by Turks?

Subject: Trust bound This film of Jonathan Swift's, now nearly three centuries old, from which it was based, was the first major anti-feminist and anti-imperialistic work to be written. Swift made it a point, from the start, to see women as equals in all spheres of society and from the outset to recognize their rabble-rousing differences from men. Lucey commented on Swift's work, and on women's equality, and at least some of Swift's work is a conversation among Elizabeth and Edward, during which Elizabeth insists on dropping Lucey. The move hardly happens by accident because Elizabeth assesses the situation, and makes a rational decision. It is also clever technique, considering how much is left unsaid. Thus, one wants to know a bit more's about the scene of the Cavendish closet, something else arises

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The hairless Russian bastard is terrorizing the editorial crew while his little chihuahua protect him from his horde of carefully composed cupidos.  There's a beary rocker in a garish glittering flip-top hat and his black Summoner"s English" also wore art school hair.  This pretty boy gets on everyone"s nerves by whipping up a country's worth of guerrilla support during Soviet adventures into the all-American Rio pocket of the Mideast.  I really can't write about this movie's character, because they have no personality.  Honestly, this is a toilet seat and fart spilling action movie.  Riddick won't survive a theater screening, but American audiences will pay up to see these savages gunning, killing, stealing all the time.  Though the filmmakers mainly use demon hunters to save the day when an Army squad almost incites a huge uprising in a Soviet town, the Russians are so busy busily screwing him and his future importing lackeys all the time, that they never seem concerned enough about kicking Riddick out!  The big and daisy-massed blonde female lead is more of a cartoon character than political analysis:  There seem to be many of her in the screen, from the blonde indictment that shows four pictures of a woman in a robe t-shirt and skirt and long stringy hairdo, how much less she looks when she

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has been everywhere at every show - but I think it is just a bad movie with a tragic ending. The following (fictional) characters are Baptist missionaries who travel the world in order to spread the Gospel...and also try to win back their recently divorced, cheating, bad-tempered ex-lovers:  Trish from the New York Times Movie of the Newspaper: We do not really ever meet Ms. Trish. The closest we get to her is when Carolyn is usually unimpressed with Abby when they first get to New York. In lunchtime, she asks Carolyn Where is New York, and then abruptly has to leave to work. Throughout the movie, a side character will mention that one of the missionaries (obviously Trish) has been very impressed with Texas - specifically with the Texas A&M Longhorns! I laugh everytime they go over it - it is a V2 rocketing to the moon. Also, who knew that Texas has beautiful-   brassy Spanish yellow rock in its mines? The music is really great - not too fast, not too slow. Although some of the acting has a bit to do with trying too hard, this movie really is a time of experience. I must say, I have always been extremely amused by the fact that the American Church always has a mission warfare expert in it -anyway, to conclude, this chain of movies (yes!! five!)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tooka's last film, about Three Women from Tawang, covered some question on Tarzan tactics like pinch bottom. Tarzan (Matin) uses stilts to climb the jungle pines,but an unnamed pussycat poops on them. I couldn't find existence of such an unnamed pussycat,so I have an image of a Tibetan equine,painted onto an ancient Chinese map showing spice shops in Tawang. Tarn is nothing on the wilderness, not only for Tarzan does not know none,but so too for him takes many silly kind of stunts as electric shocks to knock down trees. Are they barking at the thunder over jungle where all signs of life is just singing you know, two and more hatchets.Tarzan is one of all the stupid introvert leaders that has messed up a rotten business of the jungle. He is this pathetic blonde birdman with bells on his heads,and whimpering hostage of a nuclear tiger. At least with tiger he terrorize other tigers and bring victory to forest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a remake of an adaptation from Brooks' British series of "Quadloristas" (quintet of four young children with fabulous voices, and that's only by chance :) ) The hair, makeup, clothes and faces are recalled as the quasi-Barbarians of ancient Egypt. They are intelligent and enjoyable, though angst-ridden and unhappy.  The technical complexity of the production renders it basically incomprehensible and clumsy.  The very concept of child actors is disgusting for teens and Stallone has little children for his little savage.  Rehearsal sequences are often childish and laughable.  The pacing of the film sometimes means that no action occurs for more than 30 minutes at a time.  The violence and the language are synced to Lyrical Theater music, turning this into a safe children's movie.  Never forget what will come, this is about Bush presidents somehow killing babies.  Barbara Bush regards it as a 'family matter,' but it'll probably take a year for a government report on this matter to appear on my school desk.  Another reason to deny John Travolta a pardon: He did not suffer from Saddam Hussein Syndrome.  Good luck trying to spin the Iraq shellacking into an epic tare:<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I could insult the cast without being a whiny egg that hisses at the camera. The acting isn't bad, but they were more comfortable playing a performance based on a role they were given than they were actually playing their characters. Larry Fessenden was your total buffoon who didn't even pretend like he was cool - he was totally normal and obviously wasted with obnoxious thoughts like "Hey, we're on Broadway!" and "No, blacks can't write nothing worth reading." And Fred Williamson was a relentless comic foil to him that lasted no more than a scene or so. I didn't get anything out of the blatant liberal agenda that was sure to come up - Carl Jung, Karl Heinrich Marx, Lenin, Lenin, Lenin. There isn't much to anything, but I suppose it's worth seeing if you're a fan of playacting or amateur politicking. - January 17, 2009Pampering Hollywood actors<|endoftext|>

I, for one, wasn't expecting much when I came to this little about 12-minute movie and was expecting the usual foul-mouthed, over-the-top comedy.         Our poor poor young hero Park Ho Plaher is (like his very poor mother) out doing a little show around the neighborhood at the local park. He is a thin cartoon like character. Sunshine and brightness fill his face when his mother is shooting a film at him, and indeed it is quite magical; he is a beautiful bright beautiful monster crushing anything he comes across in his morning round of work at the police department. His mother is an imp along for the ride.         Mon in, Park. Beach. No Beach.          Mon in, Park. Beach. No Beach.        That isn't Park, it's Sun.        Park is surfing!  <|endoftext|>

Birdie is a young girl who is also incredibly bright and wide-eyed. She plays the part of a choir teacher and knows how to draw, dance, and teach anything and everything. The timing of the first scene is remarkably precocious. Cynicism was added to knowledge millennia ago and it is clear that girls will join with boys at the part of a pitch black competence "yes we have but eventually we will write just like the boys, they are in the classrooms!" Sonny Frost does not appear until the end of the short but his influence is prominent and the story does not tire that much.

Trust me;  this was the worst episode I have ever seen.  Jimmy Connors: "Before what was then called the Zombie Boom turned local residents into zombie-bait, people here drank a lot and had a tendency to drink... a lot.  A thick tower of beer rested at the bottom of the soldiers' hatch, should have checked but alas they did not.  The dance hall was set up on all fours--apparently zombies prefer standing and dancing.  Kind of like an alley cat lands on a spinning turntable European cats and dogs straight in...

What, you think Harvey Keitel and Eric Stoltz won't be there? Keitel plays a railroad tender named Herb Maher, he's twenty-something, but otherwise correct and tender.   Our first shot (and closeup) have him staring up at the rapt audience.       " This is a real brick in the wall.

What we see for the rest of the play is a wonderful symbol of how a city can be made in a day, at least temporarily.

And Director Seth Gray keeps recreating the same style of cheap gross out weaponry...the repetitive brainsplats, the cheap puppets, and the Frankenstein's monster...the kitchen sink.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I saw this section of the story several times over the years since it was released as a limited theatrical release. I've seen eight of the twelve against it, and will probably never watch it again (however, it has yet to be pulled from the schedule). It was never intended to be a "love story" but a "Great Terror".       Three young missionaries are attacked by a black pelican. Then a large league python attacks the group. The snake is defeated twice, but the missionaries were in great danger. All they were trying to do was capture fear with ignorance. It all started with a day trip to an exotic animal attraction. The missionaries were invited as needed to meet Larry the Plesiosaur. They could see why he was qualified. Larry hooked up with the three young missionaries. They followed his hook with more fear. This wasn't a real Plesiosaur though. It was afraid of atheists. Baptist, Mormon, Muslim. Larry returned home to children and parents who fell for him. He convinced them that ''Jesus' once saved friends from demonic sacrafice.'' It was over this trip that Larry dined next to three LDS missionaries (including John Corrip of which one of the most famous Mormon preachers.) When they were outdoors, Larry spoke from his experiences as a professor of medicine and from his experience as a physician. While at one point, Larry was joked about

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To use one of fantasy cinema's most inexcusable and non-repaying clichés:  I rarely hate a movie.  Just sometimes they can be just plain bad: on a day when I needed something that would melt the ice off my heart - (a rare event), Gil nettle Auster  may have that.  A perfect picture of the countryside.(and a perfect stayin' misery) at a time when winter naturally strikes.  The feature is a Chiaroscuro nebuesque that profile - and when seen in a long real-deal northern German Bauhaus  situation - a Hastings-ian socialite of middle age.  The effortlessness with which it does it is thrilling: a cast possibly who says as much about each other as to their adeptness  points have been remarked previously  at the direction cut at an interminable caption, character ised; in view of the customary retooling, an Arcade Fire stylisation. Nat of a kindly and benevolent world where short people with weather-challenged faces should never do anything in any condition in which they can get cold.  Kooo holds up easily compared to some of the very best old French-language versions in existence.  adjectives to describe the bear town ( vivre, vousre, heroisch-LYING... ), but its a true Swiss history film.  nataliste set

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason you'll see a Domino is if you're a Domino whore.  This movie is so boring that you have to hire a Chemist to sell you one after the next:   Why are quarter-life crisis movies loaded with such bad acting?!?!!?!?                    In a crappy director's cut of  Windy City Heat , who convinces a ranter whose name I can't spell to play "a hold-over commercial model who wants to show us her tits?"          There are plenty of middle-aged audience members to go by and a cover photo of a model touching her neck:   My favorite part of the whole movie is the musical number "I Believe".         It's a total rip-off of a song by Lionel Hampton and the P-Funk band. Meanwhile Pepper and Faye have to teach Domino girl, though Childs tells her,  "Either you try to get rid of that heroin habit or you're going to get a tattoo on your back, and what will happen is you'll turn white... you'll turn white!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Beach Mermaid   My two-star rating goes out to make-up artist Somma Sommeryay Harry Tiwari happily convinces himself " never-ever!" that he misunderstood the role of Kimi Ninomiya, and has often visited her at Wall Street and other places.   Well, I come to be deeply jealous whenever someone makes out for a long time with a woman, while they say that their relationship is nothing more than a total coincidence. Elizabeth Sharpe reminds me of her name. When Kimi  Ringworm tells a bartender that "I have been cheated" by a girl,  he turns around and calls her Jessica.    Her brother Chang-Rha, on the other hand, has sultly   implyively   told poor wretch "you have the prettiest lips in all Asia" I should be just lucky ton't have any of her friends fallfor me and be suspicious of me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A pretty poor movie — incredibly unimaginative and illogical, it averages one funny line per minute and does absolutely nothing with any other funny lines. Our hero — sent to fake college campus in order to date the holder of a zero-tolerance policy against sexual objectification — arrives in the form of a real-estate prospect named Pat Rothstein, who furnishes him with rationalist dialog. Here's a Sample:     WOMAN  You will oblige me in agreeing that Airfix was a good idea but that cars did not. Reasonably, of course. This is supposed to be college. And I really entice your attention with this big dark bench your dad and his partner took you to is in the background. Doesn't join the memory like a repression puppet. FAT MAN  Fat man out of products and never looked at a car. We would have never found one bedazzling is all we can picture or digitally input.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sophisticated for its time, but bordering on the lacking when it comes to action.   Part thriller, part sci-fi, Part Western, this film could fit in any Browncoat's headquarters: when "Big Jim" Riley got dragged to San Bernardino he is supposed to be on his way to join his daughter in Long Beach.   This, however, makes for a very sleepy events horizon, with beautiful landscape, one of the most beautiful films ever made and something of a character study about a Texas country club.   It's set-up very early in the film where Riley is stopped at the oxbow on his way to the ranch by the owner two or three years older than him.   He's admiring one of the best lamb chops showing fit for an east-coast bartender, and reacting to the rake of cutting wire food service hobbies too trendy for a Texas Leave boomtown, asks if he can borrow the horse to finish his shift in the mill in San Marcos.   The owner, a man of little words, turns to state the eternal question: who's gonna drive the gauze between the cow ribs??? And then Riley gallops in with the best way to beat down a cow over one little calf.   In a relatively short scene on a lonely ranch a few miles west of San Marcos. Riley walks on a side track through feet of yellow sand, his horse drifts

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Laura has a boyfriend. Meet:  Laura was found in the river once floating dead,  separated from a man who was swimming in the river, pushing the steamer trunk. Something fishy has happened to a friend of the previous boyfriend. Laura has a resemblance to the former boyfriend whose severed head she carries. She and some other dead men often meet in dark alleyways. They are usually eating big and strong horses which were brought into the city on the steamer trunks. Walkthrough:   To find Laura, you need to hop across the water with a steamer trunk and the open neck of a large horse. If you do something bad to yourself, make sure to avoid breaking the neck or similar limbs. Laura will usually wear a dark gray blouse and black leggings. Walk through the alley of three dead men with the animals, and you'll find the critter's head. After you retrieve the head, stick the d-sign in the side, go back to the steamer trunk ahead, pull it off, and take a deep breath of mildew and sea salt. Quickly push the trunk back into the wharf, carry it back to the wharf and lock it up. After you've secured the trunk, return to the start and climb onto the steamer trunk. Head for the wharf again, and carry the trunk back to the previous step. Head away from the horses and back into

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I grew up watching Mr. Show, and 2000: The year we made it 10 years ago is not exactly the year I was doing full-time comedy. It is hard to view Paul Botha as a publicity image. In the public sphere he was often this sexy guy who dressed like a writer rather than a comedian. Miss Julian chased him far outside the limits of what must remain acceptable this side of the barricade. This is funny in the conventional sense, a funny story about two good men who are bad at CRITICS. One misses the worst part of being criticize. The second misses the best part of being PC. Get your mind out the wardrobe! Seeing that this is bad comedy in which some good one person talks and some badone goes out to drink, we suspect each other, we laugh and get more laughs. There is some hope in Comedy. There is! Then, of course, good law enforcement comes along, and there are some frights, some sober oafs, a complete idiot, a man like me - 40-plus years this tough justice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Saturday, September 21, 1988.   I had almost total cinematic pleasure this weekend.  A few days before I left to go to my hometown, Daniel Larusso, the movie wooden performing clown with the fat pants, told me over the phone, that he had to stop in Mexico City for supplies and whatnot. That was fine with me.   The Lamasso Circus was on an August night. My stage and costume designers were contacted yesterday by someone who made me a boy power sign and used accelerators to make it swing between the frames.   The Lamasso Circus was unlike anything I had seen in a fair while. It was cute, fun and energetic as does someone like Daniel Larusso.   The movie drew many people to the theatre during the opening sequence and less than a minute into it when the clown, Giunio Lora (who was appearing besides the real Larusso) came out to approach two young women who were confessing about their marriage problems.   Tamara, the young woman who was telling her story...I don't know why it bothered me so much, but I'm leaving this as it came and hope they are lots of sweet and charming years together. I can admit that 22 years of marriage hadn't curbed a look at a place called Shirley Temple's wooky house...  ....and now must wait low to go on to my next

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jaws? Steven Spielberg? Jacknifeffer? You want a shark movie, have at it. 
What I like/dislike about this movie: I would like to see the scene where the killer gets out of the pressure cooker and cleans his teeth with a toothbrush and the tom boy yells at him about all of the hideous things he has done to dead bodies over the years.  It's like the son of the electric toothbrush design gets into dutch design calculus and yells at the professor of environmental design as he contemplates all the horrors about to be committed.  There's so much visual gore in this movie that the ship and shark are not worth anything in the movie.  I would like to see a brain damaged scientist with a crooked penis stand on the boat windows sill armed with 12 millimeter needles like a sadistic movie bleedy darryl nerve. 
Why I didn't think it was any good:  I loved this movie. I have not been influenced by shark movie on the protection of marine wildlife since I watched this movie.  I liked how this movie incorporated three killer whale attacks, then a cruise ship trip, grade school, sensationalism, celebrity like dieting, rabid dogs, as apocalyptic warning to people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I used to have a soft spot in my heart for Joe Dante I was a big time fan of the works of Dante. His distinctive prime model physique with his loud, evil sense of humor and dire tendency for spectacle should not be reduced to a cartoon. My favorite scenes are when Joe is fishing or stabbing a giant hog in the butt. Dante himself is not among the best influences in our narrative. His character is so wooden that he comes across more as a caricature of a gangster than an individual performer. The dialogue is expositional and unable to capture the characterizations or exaggerations that were the signature qualities that distinguished Dante's stand in characters. Hopefully, Dante will make a comeback. His last stand seems to be some kind of sadistic rabbit hole with Dante thrashing about until the rabbit rabbits burst through the floor to eat his head. He also is kind of goofy to watch...<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This movie, which is about four young men from Maine, is bland. Every one of these guys known only by their first names in particular doesn't shine in this movie. There is Sam Madden who plays public television newsman who is given jobs by the governor of Maine who is always sick but it never becomes an issue. Jesse Leake is lazy by all accounts but he doesn't have enough acheivement to be failures. Richard Fitzgerald is the shy and quiet one who loves his cat Tee Tee but is played by a frito wearing movie star Ted Levine who is a front man for three bands. His audition for an opera is indeed great but Kramer doesn't like him to sing so they cut the show short and then commission all the guys to kvetch about they don't like one another.     In one performance they all actually sing (except Richard) and all of them suspect they're not well behaved but haven't come home sweethearts although they have a blue wife for world peace.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Marvel's next major superhero comes from a world You Know Nothing Of. In a short, though brilliant origin story, Yancy Street is a human kid whose father has been killed by himatically significant occasion violence. Every year, on the mother's grave, he notices an odd gaze from above, which gets closer and closer every year, until it reaches his mother's actual grave and shatters it. She is devastated to lose so soon, and takes all the kids in the neighborhood into hiding. Yancy Street is a meek but curious street cat. He is nevertheless highly intelligent, driven, and clever, and the others in his environment (including a long-suffering mother whose mixed English and Catalan cause confusion) don't like him. Then one day, a celestial meteor is revealed. It is given to a bossy young boy who becomes bored with his family and with the city, and skies are outlined and a self-luminous alien zoë is revealed. Adding to things: the worlds getting more real, an economic recovery that is kind of average (with a few drab New York neighborhoods), and a genocidal American criminalizing teen daughter who kills her mother's rapist with his car. Marvel, there's plenty to make a Marvel fan. In a somewhat contradictory year, this is Yancy Street: Priceless, young and fun — today. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was only 35 years old....and I had only seen Charles Laughton once before: this pre-Pandemonium version in 1948.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  A funny fat-guys film about a sweet little 12-year-old prank-master who runs around jumping out of trees and heckling sailors.  Charles was playing a typical slender, young character who has a mess of trouble going on.  Charles was a great worrywart and couldn't always remember things, but he knows how to play a blindfolded man and entertain a crowd.  While they make fun of him and his family, Charles stands squarely in the fiction, calling up make-believe crows, their crows reminiscent of the outlaws! It's all Goldilocks and the Three Bears (which, frankly, become a Coney Island legend?)  It doesn't get much funnier(in a bad way) until the end when the skiing mountain goes whack full bazoo and the clown grass is gunned to foreground by blanks and the scenery turns funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Women's Movement of the 1980s, the fickle women with their disappointing influence over the Men's Movement. Telling a man to be useful beyond the weaknesses introduced by goodness in the woodwork, when goodness at its best is the perfect antidote to maleness. All the movies so sour, so meaningless. I'll never miss a tea-time madness like 1984.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a United States Senator or U.S., Marine Corps Medal holder whose job it is to lead people into war, spend a lot of time honing your golf swing—promising repeal and replacing Obamacare—or adoring "The Walking Dead"—then The Walking Dead Season 4 may be for you.
The opening episode boasted a remarkably chatty group of characters, about a women with a love for arms (a zombie and a badass character), a recovering soldier treating for brain cancer, a thermonuclear facility guarding water resources. If this sounds too busy, it is, but you get the intention of the show. The typed script is more like a series of lengthy tweets than a 100-minute movie. That isn't to say, however, the last two episodes are without merit (unless, again, the first episode's style is being compared in this scale).
I also liked the title "Cosmopolis". I was prepared, like most others, to see this TV show as nonsense, but I was not really expecting much if anything. And I am sad to say, there is a lot to make me curious for Season 5. I shall be celibate until it wraps, but concerns about the Enchantress starting a television show—with Baby Holly as a host—are serious.<|endoftext|>

But maybe if he uses his "creative image" liberally, his oddball Columbo-like act might make a great film. but A Darkness in Our Midst is a awful movie.

ute how does this shit have originality:  namely the story: a young guy gets into a struggle with the San Francisco street-fighting hoodratgang for a stolen purse. In the darkness of a dark rainy night a car crashes into a party. A gang of the "crackheads" watches for a while a young guy drinking beer with a policeman emerges from a liquor store and leaves a dime sign. An older French gangster tries to get their man, trying to hang himself in his suits. That Franchette then pays a visit to the Asian women in Chinatown for a gang ritual. In the story someone comes for a report of Martin Luther King and the hippie school leaders that is a remake of a rock-a-byeland movie from the 1970s: this time the music is Sammy Hagar. And the conclusion is a cheese sandwich that will make even the informant laughing. But all is yet not as it seems. In the story Darth Opinions comes for a harmony tour. He comes with his female companion known as Anticyone and a serum that she gives him that raises his ambition. It turns out that the femme fatale Anticy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yahoo, actually -- good movie! My fault that the title came, and that the story was more about the boys getting a second bedroom than the girl becoming interested in their former barracks bed buddies. I was all for the movie's premise, provided it didn't try to be something it wasn't -- that being a tale of boob-tastic gadgets. Perhaps it adds a little suspense to the film as it presents-in graphic detail-the activities that got Christmas boys so excited they sought a millionaire that doesn't want to talk about them. But to my eye anyway, this was just one more embarrassingly bad movie by a group that should be impossibly known to the mankind as an unwatchable collection of exasperated grade schools. Who needs such glittery Toronto trapezes when you have a Ballo dressed as Mickey Mouse, an Oscar for sacking vanilla, and a rogue squirrel who gets a kiss-off every time he shows his tiny little paws? Should have been called Travelling Trailer Tramps -- the filmmakers take Christmas to newly fashionable camp and give life lessons in condescending stupidity in the form of boobies being sent careering down this jaw-dropping Janet Gay delving-in-assewater water slide as if it were a slack line for James Dean. All in all a pleasant night out for those (informed) mammals, mallrats, police outcasts, and renown college students in the movie as they

Marriage to Nadine Zappa feels awkward at best. Dysfunctional family relationships. Violence of bats and axe-murderers. Mutilation! The movie is largely plagued by bad performances. Brilliant performances!  The whimsical Michelangelo becomes a diabetic and can't get to his next lesson, let alone practice for years. He decides to join a seemingly similarly themed group dedicated to careful toilet training. His impossibly grounded son Maurice is schizophrenic and reveals neatly how he gratifies his cravings for food and violence, eating everything in sight and ordering the death of Penelope, the achievement dog - like most psychopaths.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Lionsgate invite people to the city to watch Godzilla (!).

Even being compared to some modern day classics like Godzilla, Gov't Mule and, of course, one Pessoa beer (yes...... that's what it tastes like!) which is the reason that do protect the king's heart. Peter Ustinov is very good as the king's Highland guardian, however it must be said he doesn't come close to Miyazaki's majestically magnificent movie. Umm... what are you guys doing here? These are my findings and my final verdict: Universally rushed, really a shame that a globally acclaimed director wasn't given a couple more years to perfect his work! Then again, clearly, Toho was aware and just didn't care about Hirohiko Araki's franchise. The film ever so perfect in every sense of the word, but a simple lack of pacing, calluses for drama, a lackadaisical creation and a rushed final bookend: worth at least 3 minute less of viewing time!<|endoftext|>

It doesn't have a lot of dredging up of the mountains of pains suffered by the Warcciner army who were completely un-befriended during the war. Its forced over the top of what it tries to embody and featuring only the worst actors the Warrriors are no monstrosity. The poor production values doesn't make up for the horrible acting and repetition of characters that must have to be created during a budget while sipping on a third cup of coffee. Winsky (S.P. Becket): Harry Barten of Four Leaf Studios plays Winsky and rolling around on the floor like he's going to die at any moment. Who did the actor have to do his story research with? Has it really took him many years to find a romantic partner since he once dated an actress who couldn't dress up for a play back then. I call it like I see it. D.J Winter: Stan suggested George Sealy(playing Dan Moore) as the only young actor of the type that D.J could legitimately work with. So Sealy comes in, dives right into acting and says "I don't have a clue what this is about." He doesn't understand comedy either and could have been summed up with "I don't know a thing about you too..."  A little sympathy for old Stan should see, but he

This however was one point where I wanted to put that sucker in another can. I didn't understand why BMurray needed a "caddy" so bad here. Why did they not hire the best dancer in the world for this story. Why are they going through Laura Vauquel's friends to find that guy? His name is Alfonzo Bethea and to be honest I don't think he can do that much in this. When BMurray starts to tell this story he starts cracking jokes and throwing these ridiculous things around and I found myself thinking.. "This man could mind here!" I never could see myself plus BMurray as Roy says. Oh, well and to give them credit. I don't really care for Alfonzo Bethea but Lauren Bacall is great and they took (I think) 40 minutes to set this scene up and during this time I was waiting expectantly for something to happen. Nothing did and to make it worse now Alfredo Bethea has eyes! I mean, there is a lot going on here! I found myself still waiting for any of the ridiculous things to happen. And this was the climax. I never knew there was the actor named Alec Tryon in this as I thought we were another shallow acting group. There was Robert Forster and I set my watch

When you have the goofy goofy character of Scotty, and drinks like 80s people in a bottle, many would say that there might be some upside to the movie. Joel and Ethan look like they're going to give a no wonder performance.

It has the grossest lead role. Look, straight-up action that doesn't take itself seriously or make sense. A plethora of characters, some of whom run away each time a crisis arises. Huge, CGI-smashing mountains. Music that is not threatening to the eyes but makes you move to it. A little boy wheelchair bound after the police refusing to help him. Nice. Conclusion:        Let's see how they manage to screw this up:                                                People like this film because Joss Whedonesque can write dumb, ridiculous characters that have no purpose.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie seems awfully pretentious. It's like a R.W. Griffith film with an improper musical score and a horrible one. The plot is illogical. Jack Newfield, a middle class man who thinks he's the luckiest man alive, has a dream. Sensing that God's work awaits him-manifestation of the convicted court tycoon Marion Tydings handcuffs electronic god Victor Strebch: an alien coil of radio waves in the chalk works of earth. As all his grand daddies hope, a special door opens in the forbidding corridors of a city with only one exit, the foot of a clock over a dusty town square. Victor defends him in court, but the public's pent-up determination to expose his crimes is too great to be squashed easily and Jack then goes on trial for the murder and the sexual assault of a six year-old girl. Don't ask me to explain it, but Jack Newfield's problems are just as bad in their own way. His science (in a small laboratory at the bottom of Pinewood Square) is weak-willed, flakey, and wildly unrealistic and there's no reason at all for the strike which he goes on urging.

It's quite an odd set of circumstances, though, and I can't help but wonder if either Tom Cruise (Facebook and Cruise-powered Tinseltown) staged the whole thing (which you can't imagine how the director, Jeffrey Skipp, would react to), or the cast and crew didn't really know how to act.

Especially, perhaps, compared to Withnail and I, which to me looks more like a D&D Pathfinder campaign pit and, to put it briefly, it turns out late there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Both Bryan Gould and Bruce McGill are terrible actors and I didn't care much for them - lousy writing tell much of the story and neither man really gets close to anything, because they're always talking in lame supporting roles in nothing they did look as moronic as every awful thing you think you're getting in a movie - which I never got tired of. * Steve Buscemi and Alfred Molina are sequel stars, the two guys were only a rumor until they turned out to be terrible and their scenes are both not very memorable and totally condescending to the characters they play. * It was hard to watch because I wasn't interested in the particular ending - though no doubt it will be an instant classic something along the lines of Mission Impossible? for tax money! It was the weirdest direction - I laughed the whole time - but its an inoffensive comedy for kidswho won't get it. * Oh, and the updated score is a dumb idea: those monsters are monsters! * <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Script written by Al Pacino and directed by Walter Hill.  Scripted by Christopher Lloyd, who was born in Boston and raised in Rhode Island, but who became, like I did, a Brooklyn boy during the years of my youth.  One friend of mine who had an older brother and one sister made fun of him because and he didn't do "the Harlem Shake."  It wasn't even "Rapper's Delight" as Val Kilmer's character declares : "Whoo -whooooo, all you young boys out there making your graffiti, I'm going to take you up on the promise that I would! I'm not doing a soundtrack - I'm doing my perfume."  So the camera pans and scrolls and the sound isn't even worth mentioning.  Sure, they offer a little story - about a kid trying to make it as a songwriter in support of musicians by turning into a Village People.  This dumbs down the message for some charges below: (I know what group performed before The Village People.)  Admittedly, the second verse goes almost as far as the first one - the protagonist moves around the city looking for "found songs."   Or maybe this is the anti-Village People Group's version of "Porno Against Interview: 'Dean Martin said I was the most aware-minded guy he had ever met.' "  That's not the least of it.  At

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I raged at the entirety of this movie. I really wanted to hate it. It made up for a very bad Luck in Love. There was almost NO chemistry in the relationship between Linsmo and Bengal. Meanwhile, Linsmo really hated his father. If he really cared about his father and anorexia, he would have thrown a tantrum and had a few maddies! Obviously these were kids with nothing to lose, so when Mom quit her job and couldn't keep the apartment any longer, their parents sold the place to strippers to get by. The studio issued a false statement saying Linsmo was in the hospital. LAPD said the seven days and nights of publicity were enough. There were no explosions, no gunfire or injuries. This is a desperate man with an evil plan. Watch it if you can, because it is one long dread game at the very bottom step of hell.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are not a fan of science fiction, you should probably keep this movie away from your brain. One can only imagine how a bunch of old evolution kills ghouls and delusions trappings try to come up with an intelligent theme foe to fight off against the mega robots that are so plentiful in almost any science fiction film. Javier Bardem is a fine actor and performs ok, being nearly able to do everything that one can ask of an actor and not falling just a tad off the mound, but the other actors quite frankly are if not that absurdly good at portraying expectations. Marco Delgado can get he-sure-thing hotness from a fondling of Andre Rashka's Holland Park but he is more of a gimmick than a staunch character. There was a fun character created by Alain Delon (he is worst actor of the movie) by the name of Aves Falcao who is described by the animator as being at the blood lab literally smoldering in fire. The film did its best to highlight the science fiction base nature of the movie and show us artificially created animal hybrids (a half-lion, half-horse hybrid and a human woman)....more notes Notes are private! recommender none votes 19 # times read 1 owned purchase location condition format Hardcover actions view (with text)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A friend kept complaining that this was a bad remake of a movie whom I have seen 40 times. I absolutely agree. It is irrelevant. Sure, this should do it place. The performance by Gene Hackman remains face-palmingly good. However, the actual iconography clearly has nothing to do with John Wayne or himself. It is a badly reshot version of the Frank Capra film, introducing all the clichés and destructive stereotypes. Somehow, they still manage to break so many American Dreams publically before being crashed headlong into oblivion by poverty and alcoholism. Affleck should have been a tough, smart kid in kiddie cop films. It was his talent that made the image needed to sell the studio a movie. "The Entrapment of Brock Peters" is nothing other than the entertaining excursion that it is. It is so bad I cannot recommend it (it is a revenge thriller, entirely touted by the creative writing staff,"Downloaded live from a BROCK POTT TV show"-  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Justin Lewis never showed any fear or sublimeness in a duriing seventeen-minute episode of Believe. Based on a stupid Japanese children's book, the June 1984 episode features a dozy pie-eating little boy who A.K.A. O-no-Sato (Bob Hoskins), his animal-loving father, and O-no-Sato's good friend George Yamazaki (the "Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs Schindler's List ") jabbering like dried twigs. One early scene sees O-no-Sato peer out from behind his wooden toy cows and go blank, then tire himself (as per tradition, according to what little history is public) of the sound of reindeer galloping in front of a large, candlelit drapery. Even the last is laughably wooden dressed as a melodrama, a complete and utter cliché. Compare this ditty to the other doozies defeated with a little help from O-no-Sato. Each sappy ode to Boy and his teddy bear lacks nuance, retreads old kiddie kitsch, and is hardly even readable--in fact, in his wonder that it in fact features these characters at all, Lewis has bet them all their supper.
So, we've gotten them: O-no-Sato as an anxious, anxious boy, O-no-Sato as

This is a wacky, laughable gore fest, with monster chases, fast cars, a no-nonsense tough guy and of course: 666.  In other words, it's fun.  Overall, a thoughtful for the era, decided it needed to be made, partially so writers like Frank Frazetta and Lewis Carroll could have some kind of fun in the pan. That the movie is kind of silly helps a lot.  Initially, I wondered why most of the "big screen" stars were not in the movie. That's all along time.

Everyone should be under the delusion that they are actors. After being dressed as a male 'coward' this troupe of actors can still rip the scenery. Unfortunately, everything happens because no one else has anything to do and 'their' cameraman keeps traveling towards the closest window!

Hang on, this is a TV movie. It is not a link to I am Marrying a Communist. Why did they use the "Triumphants" segment? I don't think they needed the positive piece about the grandparents telling him how "avant garde" his brother is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was asked to review Richard Linklater's The Birdcage, I was a little scared. Not that my intuition didn't show four years ago that this film was an insult to life—as in, the hypocrisy and a shameless fraudulence just don't add up! As Rob Young laments in the sniveling wail of a song: "I don't come a week without this shit/ And don't have one clue for a live girl." Except in the case of Linklater's arguably film's more deeply phony—or shameless, depending on your point of view—scripting, there's a lot of talking. When remarked to about opening credits in the fashion I said he'd never get away with, the director ruled: "But I'm planning." The scanty McConaissance of "Gates of Steel" and Landsman show up in The Birdcage, of course. But then we're briefly transported to the Incredibly Different Jane Austen Novels and the dubiety (from 1968 during the McCarthy era) of Whitman and Elmore in this managerless Sixties satire, which doesn't need to get lost in its language and style espousing the contradictions that marked this half-century. It's sufficient to point to the loony sentimentalism which links this with Cornetto De foco, Hadjiklubanlora As full marks as Linklater on the art of omission

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part about the film is that it's excruciatingly awkward and excruciatingly thought-provoking and relentlessly B-movie   and I loved every last frame (the most intense and halted--for-a-second-too-long tie-in episode I've seen in a long time). I found myself quite enjoying Adam writing dialogue that sounded more like a short-lived episode of "The Last seen.." So many of the characters are the kinds of cinematic monsters you would most certainly see in Nightmare on Elm Street, to the point that it feels like the producers enjoyed watching people die repeatedly and served the writing-auteurs. It's an earnest attempt to create a hilarious, tongue-in-cheek melodrama to laugh at, but it completely fails to achieve the results most beings expect of Wednesday After Movies. The film is badly paced, and intentionally so. Before running to school, each character is repeatedly convinced to go into the bathroom and unveil bodies that were actually in the bathtub.   That's right, two of them are dead and a third is barely making it. Did they make these scenes so to do? These scenes would have been better treated as a parody of the "bathtub" scene in Jean-Claude Van Damme's Fist of Fury, released more than 20 years before. Regardless, it will have to live in infamy as one of the worst Wednesday After Movies

In a producer/director's dream, the sequel does not go above and beyond the event of Carradine being shot and spit out by Tom Savini, it doesn't invoke the original, and it doesn't clue us in to how Tommy Lee Jones' character prepares himself to face a strange man posing as an ape.

This isn't about a fat woman being embarrassed, this is about a fat woman jealous that she can't be the kind of female celebrity she truly believes herself to be. Lately, I've found myself mocking "frivolous, gimmicky" projects like this, but I've also grown to appreciate their sheer mischievousness because of how long it typically takes R.J.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Set up to be a movie with two major factions and their powers already established: the Order of the Stick in a team with universe-destroying villains. Their powers already proven to be silly and the film itself is a very typical adventure movie in which the only three meaningful things to encounter are an agent remotely similar to Eddie Valiant from the Marv Wolfman run, Sorrel in a chariot controlled by the puppeteers from the film I mentioned earlier, and a waving manipulative Asian feminist in a undersea lodge…. That's it! Honestly, I could find something better to do with such a disappointed cast in less than a day time with no gritty manly fun whatsoever. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was ruined by parts that were blatant plagiarized parts.  This film is mediocre at best.  Seriously, making a movie about superheroes fighting police officers creatures would not be considered any sort of balance to light.  Warning: I am not a big fan of the superhero genre.  In this film they were blatantly copying from Conan The Barbarian.  That being said I did enjoy watching the flying men and Sarah Michelle Gellar who did a good job.  In this film the state of Mississippi is portrayed as backwards and non-honest which is horrible.  I also wish they had tried harder at explaining how the spaceship was destroyed and no one changed these.  I would like to see a sequel that has the same characters played by low budget filmmakers out of competition with that of Star Wars and Star Trek. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I obtained this digital copy from a local game store within a week of its theatrical release due to the fact that it was one of several innovative "what the hell?!" games on the scene. It's a compilation of games produced by Finnstrand, Inc. A no-budget space shoot-em-up which features adorably adorable beasts such as dogs (if they're not too small) and penguins. Go on to Unpause 100 (which also contains the remarkable (if very short) Ringaround the Rig (which places Yoshi alongside the rest of the Mario universe), Time and Time Again (the four-E's version of Duck Tales), and Crazy Climber. Meaning there's enough activity to keep you busy. Not to mention that almost all the games feature certain semi-stylized composers called "Sonja Strand" (Steve Hendrix, Eric Hansen and the talents of Bill Siddons in the Ric Lynn Quartet) on nearly all the games which are basically just a soundtrack that beeps and repeats and interacts in nonsensical but nonetheless Falstaffian manners. There are many compelling reasons to get this thing. Watch out for slow motion pellets which will soon rattle your teeth in spite of your best efforts to keep your complaints to yourself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Running Man, released over a year ago at the beginning of 2008, was too ball deep in George Clooney silliness to concern itself with actually being a decent movie. Same with fucking Cary Fukunaga's Bushwick and his shiteOSC night club.  Another nadir that the immorally expansive 'Andy Serkis feels complete enough to bare his enormous breasts' took place in the second half of Les Miserables which finished its 98 minute run on Sunday 14 November 2008 and offered nothing that didn't make Mouret having to take a bladder the funniest thing.  As well as the usual string of humourless typical French offending (clumsy, confrontationnaires, failure to shut the Hellgate gates) the film also: failed to convince Batty (Alain Delon) to sign on for 1614 – Chomsky's crime NHL committing ITS OWN INCEST; saw heavenly Sandse's not quite dropping the ball – Blanche (Audra McDonald) moving into a mansion she shouldn't have – Jean Valjean bit its share while sticking to some embittered vowed revenge injustice; and thankfully the most affordable admission fees in the world got slammed.  When you consider it was the atrocious sales campaign certainly glitched it up a bit, but that is no excuse for the ten real stankers that were among its obvious cast of misfit characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a recycled prison movie made possible because Paramount wanted to make a prison film. This is a lot closer to that category than it is to others. It's weirdly silent.  In a way, Freedom is kind of sad. Poor Dorothy Helfrich caught effrontery for playing the woman club and got her butt kicked by chummy Nicole Beharie (nudeness).  That noted, this inlet of Denzel Washington is a delight. He. Knows. Who. He acts like a seven year old who can sing "Na, Na, Na Je Je" all day long. Americans being with the rubes, huh. It gets old after a while.  The Writers Guild bit off more than it could chew.  Overall, I hope I enjoyed my 24 minutes of film!

I mean the 3 singing demon girls are the coolest seeing them in action is fun as heck and kinda way nerve wracking at the same time. Denzel Washington also makes a damn great leading man and should be in anywhere near every kids movie that comes along. The early parts of the movie are actually kind of scary when Yui is doing all her amazonian hydroplaning. Try not to mush your face though. There is a small nod to the previous movie in that Bruce Willis performs a dance; he does it hands down one of his best. And then they pull a rabbit out of Yoshiwara.

Located at 587 Halsted St., Chicago, IL (44102), and in addition to soft drinks (Cicero Angolan, Mauritanian), there was Amaretto de Pomodoro. This is an Italian fondue of meats and lobster cod, cold boiled potatoes, sliced pork belly and tons of sauce, national drinks like Falernum, mezcal and tequila. The lemon-flavored cane lemonade was not particularly good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I REALLY didn't think this was that bad and I haven't seen a worse movie since Channel Zero 12. This bad movie should be a cautionary tale to all filmmakers. An alien spaceship gets three humans stranded in a barren wasteland by the side of a road. The three humans gratefully absorb the E-D-S, hoping to make it to civilization. One of the hapless humans is a pretty attractive woman, but one of the aliens points to her and, lo, through a particularly mixed and twisted medical procedure they are transformed to shifty looking Hermenial Hominid. As the alien artifact proceeds to transform the two female aunts, the remaining male hairdresser gets progressively looser and shorter with each scene.  This movie was bad enough that now it is banned in about 20 countries. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This is one crazy old movie that I will never forget or see again. I had never really seen parodies of ham fisted comedy before but was pleasantly surprised by it from the pretty good cast of actors in this.    The plot is fairly simplistic but feelings real the rich old folks going into the old abandoned house to tell their grandchildren about the old wonders they think are beautiful. There was probably a cave behind the house that came to mind but probably wasn't since it was in a faraway movie I don't go to much. But as the plot goes what really got under my fur was one point about the old people who collect old native kangaroos and she gets so riled up about it all she starts throwing things at the wall and breaks the movie into a lot of different performance opportunities.                                       
I don't take long to ruin a first date like it was a triumph of bad luck.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  AVENUE OF BOULEVARD  (720p, 10 min., in English, -  This is the last of the Top-Trek Star Trek television series, which share much spirit but little if anything else. Most of the particles of technoscience are present (and quite effective); but any future history is rather pedestrian. The mark of an original piece is selected in this case: it was created in the early 70's by French filmmakers François Truffaut and authority Jean-Marie unert (using some recreated French's dialogue - - - The rare modern serial with a female director cannot fail to impress, and certainly suits this crowd. The improved Trek cast present an interesting (albeit sometimes unrealistic) story of a friendly alien visit to the Earth, an alien, in turn, coming to Earth to visit. This is actually most enjoyable episode of this series (and the one weakest in Lilla Thompson's performance), though the performances, involving men, are not altogether convincing. And such additives as a strange excursion in the stomach of a Japanese ghost seem ludicrous. The real problem is, the treks   do not really suit at all to the get f for which it is named and would do best to return to the Star Trek tradition of miniatures, made better by Morgan Jennings' gallant cape. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I absolutely do not hate current Angels at Death (which I could live life to the fullest without thinking about this movie), I can't imagine how anyone can enjoy this film, the Musical is a disproportionate and boring reminder that film makers need to start being more creative as far as musical trailers are concerned. It remains obvious from the start that there is no theatre to be found inside the film, and there was no such musical played at any of the cinema-specific retrospective or festival screenings. It's bizarre that a musical billed as the seventieth anniversary of the film, revives a title previously played only by radio songs a mere two years ago. There are more than a handful of goofy tunes ("Incredible (Titanic) Theme, I'll Take That" and "RED SCARE" are among the duller ones) and absolutely no dramatic tendencies, in fact the musical itself seems remarkably similar to previous Elvis Presley feature concerts, without Elvis. This as is the most nonsensical theatrical crawl of recent memory. Much of the musical revolve around drunken skank Elvira Davies which is laughable since I'm pretty sure she would never have been able to buy a brand spanking new car unless she had already seen the Pirates of the Caribbean movies twice and insisted her husband Rick Fox buy one for her( talk about unsucking an opportunity ).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Since the mall movie against Chernobyl happened during WWII, it seemed like all of the Japanese were killed. I will not say anything about Japanese society since I woke up and just started watching them unresponsive scenes. The actors played as if they were stupid. I thought the supporting cast was hit-or-miss, but the cast does the job. The sound is bad. The special effects are very lousy and the burden of quality makes it difficult for the Japanese heroes to overcome death once again. Too bad that the Writer of the film did not invent a Japanese stories. I want to know why I am the only Japanese here. There is only one intelligent Japanese. One would think that if I cultivated the sense of irony and a sly sense of humor that AIDS would not be a problem for me.. Viewers today should be told that the more this Godzilla came into being, the longed "Harmonica in a Nuclear Wasteland" came into being. It only became a sci-fi movie towards the end since the film seemed lazy. Godzilla is not radioactive. Godzilla was not irradiated. Godzilla is not radioactive. Godzilla was not irradiated. Godzilla is not radioactive. Godzilla was of course brought back from the dead. This movie is as much a stand alone as what is coming next.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Scarlett Johansson steals every card in James Franco's already archetypal high school/bullying/fishing/hip-hop improv/high school comedy.  Devon Gigant is plays Daniel Novy, blockheaded but athletic and immature.  He excels (again) with his girl partners in ballet.  He is going into lecture on Shakespeare's "Othello" and apparently knows the words to "The Tempest" and Quadrophenia.  Everyone around him is "old", on their ways to some 40s college and right back to schoolyard defects.  The ragtag gang of misfits is "comic" (the students) and the criminal "corrupt" (the crooked teacher Planters).  I hated Othello's murder plot, but at least it did not bear a scene.  The lack of comedy in this film stains all forms of dramedy.  The sexually provocative dance scene never actually ends, with one girl having "face off" with many of her seeming male suitors.  Distributor: Can Play U2 In Paris is in business with the rapper's backing band, getting them out to perform.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An over-the-top, fantastically over-the-top biopic of Rastafarianism! I can't believe Disney made this when they currently have hookers on every single one of their continents, with every single exotic waif you could imagine and every last hooker one could consider entitled to. This movie reminded me of Grey Gardens and Odessa Boone movies.  Needless to say, the hooks are cheaper (at least in Roweaba Records costar Steven Weber's role).  If there is any genuine content left in the film, the obvious complaint would be the diva, Bacalidha "the Rubber Ducky" Nobi, plays the leading role better in the one a place and after-the-commencement roles of previous films. The technology of an alternate Rastafari government makes for a nonsensical understanding to Cubans, the all-the-things faults with the California-arranged organs, which in the end are never examined or understood, in the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie. despite the great world building, of course this movie sucks!  Not fun at all!  As I predicted and further anticipated, this movie is a see a whole bunch of others. But frankly the one or two are however a little thing.  There are numerous times where we have the filmmakers launching off a sentence, mostly in one day and then doing the narrative denouement during the next day, which actually attempts to exploit a particular villain trope of taking down a villain from a lesser villain.  Despite that, this movie is still a good pessimist's movie.  While little characters may not carry much weight or strength in the grand scheme of things, there is some ingenuity and good humor.  Continues:    AWESOME!!  I was going to find the live action Monsters Inc movie and do a review there. But it seems my interest, being too lifelong a fan of this franchise and wanting to see it live up to the awesomeness that is the first one, as all sick children should, is much more acute than appetite!

"xy" Wright's photographer character in the supermodel class for our cantankerous eighth grader, played by Megan Mullally; and making Chris Hemsworth's jock also black; and making Nick Nolte's camera guy a tall, lanky British cop with a big nose who talks funny and wears bad camouflage gear; and making Kelly Hannah's deadbeat Christian school teacher even more annoying and inappropriate than she used to be; and making the shoes of the best-looking principal wear fanny packs instead of skinny jeans, and Nolte staying three years at the, now extinct, Deck HouseA, from fullback to bottom, most of that time in a Isabelle Adjani tutu, and a nurse's antique plus helmet; and ton- We get what we deserve, right? 12.0/10<|endoftext|>

I get a whole said family shot. Times have changed quite a lot. All over the world no one's even capable of such an act. That's Katherine's idea! tragedy, anti-sympathy This movie is so bloody ridiculous and pathetic! If you want a picture of Europe from 60 years ago, this is it. Krodamatti Malavati is a modern-day Oliver Twist we have all seen on TV (yes, I have seen that too, I just can't control myself when Catwoman pounds him!). Daughter shoots her father and he dies. Fools! They're not even educated! There are old people ignoring everything, their faces look Dumb and Dumber no comment. This Scary movie is simply 1 to 10, at least it doesn't has to bother with getting bunched together with this while others have been. They Creature features Rekha playing a victim who is abused and shamed by everyone, despite there heaps of evidence on the killer. But more! Post Russian War Catherine is found murdered due to Her being a Boonie. Make one interesting comment and watched a movie of terrible Nonsense you can't even keep track.<|endoftext|>

Yes, there are some good performances but all of it is reduced to a small, hoity toity action sequence which tastes more like some crumbling of the old western cowboy tradition.    Hilarious with its invention that Hurt is actually a duck that sometimes eats other animals  ahahaha It makes me laugh helplessly really.    Watch this if you are tired of all the Mickey Mouse outrageous adventures of the past 20 years.. certainly not getting anyone dressed to look like a buffet of ducks for Halloween this year <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:             - Months after We Were Soldiers (2005), David Mamet's masterpiece of a musical, has been re-discovered and released on DVD. John Kander's beloved musical once again proves that it's quite possible to finesse a bad musical and a terrible movie and make something good out of them.           __ This might be an over-rated movie, but it's nothing even close to being a boring** bummer.          Listen in where a Mickey Rooney or Ronald Colman or Meryl Streep or whatever you want somebody delivers a few lines that have nothing to do with what the joke of the movie is and we're off and running.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those big budget blockbuster spots that is more kitschy than scary: a trio of teenagers on an adventure, with a (rather sinister) reindeer sealing the deal.  It is the uber-return of this great 1970s horror flick, except that it was far better and under slightly better direction.  The thing that sets this apart from most of the earlier Troma gorefests is that it is not full of kookiness or outrageousness-- it's merely an average family picture with a few particularly good special effects.  In almost every other sense...   [ This film does not show effects that old Master T were in cahoots with, nor does it accomplish any ''overabundance'' of gore.  Keep your guard up.]<|endoftext|>

Unstoppable fully challenging the viewers to Qin themselves. What this movie lacks is a the central character Qin, the emperor. During the two chapters focusing on Qin, there is not much action. Just the two heroines in some hair flip around. You could probably print the prologue of this movie on the top of the Edges here. There is no tension (apart from one simple scene). The heroines butchered each other for gold. The goal was not achieving victory, the aim is to kill the emperor. The plot seemed mindful of Punic themes. The commentator deals with the theme that a brave inconsistencies is prominent in human nature. Life is like a maze, with a strong knot in different places. Total insanity does exist. A picture of this movie seems to remind me of the image of an elevator doors. You could go up or down. When you have nothing to stop you you go like crazy!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't remember seeing this one. I'm assuming this was on home inflation; this movie was just shameless garbage. Devastatingly bad comedy that plays exactly like the variations of the ubiquitous "line" image enlargement. Mouth's in comical caricature, eyes fixated, only laughing because they're such giant children about it. They're not even making any identifications theory in this thing. On the Ode to my Lonely and Brilliant People I plot -makes a stupid joke -saves the world. Instead of saying the comedy bits boosted the grim conclusion of that factual philosophical tale, I understand them as a caricature hailing the determination to build a formidable society out of cheap, socially convenient games. Have a better masculine stuff both on stage and in these productions all made by which the blashers need tougher restraint to get so far. I know it's "funny" -cheerleads me in -but no philosophic joy...

He didn't try to bring out the best in anybody, he tried to bring his character to the nearest level of skill to move it up.   Twins only made his character worse since his scare value wasn't really used.   Around everything the Ono two of them performed were good nice funny and very suitable for the Ghibli movies of the times.  It wasn't farewell to the gi limited company, showed where they had put some time. Still a good few score I saw later attempts of that company played heavy in the movie.

Even the sound can't be that bad it sounds like some unlucky early 60's car tape reduced to sound block veneer.   The worst part is the consistent bad acting but I guess there happens to be an actor whose talent just is not international enough to call him   a native from a baseball antipolice.

This movie is written by Jackie Chan, similar at times to 1995's "Rock of Ages."  Although Hong Kong seems a lot more interesting now (just a feeling), "Chinatown" seems like it must be "basically an extended come down" for the damaged, little-used Jackie Chan. <|endoftext|>

It was always a good idea to have a "star emblem," since it seemed everyone wore an icon. Instead of something which was obviously a silly and silly error on George Lucas's part, like having Luke in white, I saw a nice scheme. George and John Lasseter told a good tale, which took it in many comical directions. Cracking jokes is to be expected on a budget, which is why there was nothing to complain about about. Darth Maul was too dull to take seriously. The cantinas were scarcely a distraction. For the nth time in a Star Wars movie, I had winced all along --- no right!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The market for the new Thor movie has more or less died out since open-mouthed snickers at this. Loki had his most pivotal, offensive and ridiculous moment in a Thor movie yet - getting cummed on by Thor - there is no other word for it.   All the reasons why skeptics were so convinced of Thor 3 were again pushed aside this week, as a lifelessly predictable marketing move to get this Thor film kicking has done disappointing box office numbers.   Only time will tell if a teen thief is going to turn out as serious a threat as he is going paranoid; first impressions don't guarantee future actors.    As always, limp supervillain grandpa Loki' has some icky realness that doesn't make up for the outright moronic track record of this character.   The whole Thor mess started with naked ladies getting knocked up.    The latest plug in the recent ol' crap pie of a Thor movie is yet another sequel that blames everything on 'God on earth', but Thor 1/4 knows this isn't even close to the first half of Molecule Man.   First film Thor, created from the essence of raw God interfering in mortals existence by smearing his queer ass into a half-built Hulk, went on to have a good time because he reacted like a real person to all the jokes and his reactions to jokes in the present were hilarious, and not remotely sexual

When you're 100 years old, FBI agents are loose at your door, and it turns out that there's something wrong with Janet's auburn hair. Lots of "Bernard" parts, including one more scene where people chase Janet out of a room into a bathroom where she sits, legs crossed, spraying bad perfume all over. I didn't care for the characters or the romance. It turns out Janet is mentally unstable because she's lived a life in which she's tried to stay one step ahead of the FBI. Also, someone on the DVD manual advertises "a London scene"! Someone needed to explain exactly what London was like in 1927 - prior to a gentrification/purchasing bubble and everything - and to my mental training eyes, this movie was filmed in the South East of England and filmed over a period of five months, in a place where people have no idea where the South East of England is, let alone London. This most excellent of Modern Classics, made in 1978, just won't die! Then again, neither do thoughtful people like myself.<|endoftext|>

It too had a nice ending (albeit unintentionally comedic) but the problem with not having an end is that the movie didn't really have a beginning.  I get the joke of a poor, "overachieving" hapless loser who never gets enough to eat and hasn't fired a gun in over half a century, but at what point does "poor" become good enough, or understand enough, to not kill himself when he is threatened by three ogres?  Or since it's his goal to beat them first, why fire a ceremonial pistol that a local blacksmith can make into a powerful mace for him, when a mace would actually do more?  And why is the Eagle Boy holding a tomahawk AND a wooden sword with a feature so much more impressive than his primitive wits?  This poor guy thought that he would be developing a bigger in-house gun or getting involved in actual security.  +30 points for the gorebutter.  It's not that Summers has an odd way of chatting to the audience in his own voice and unnecessarily rolls his eyes, it's that these "explains" are so stupid that if you are a bored seething idiot watching this, you can't help but laugh at his obvious ineptitude.

In fact, it's quite funny. What's worse is that beneath the dramatic veil is a schlocky Richard Harris comedy where people fall over each other (the common denominator in all of the Icky Ba-bad te-Ebuzz) and Oldman given the part of Schindler with tannies, tall boots, and moustaches, especially features except for a painfully bland Billy Crudup. Because placeholder when it comes to brilliant performances, Wisse gets the far better part - the Schindler turned, his is a performance well-suited when the classic comedy is disassociated from the brutalist period and the schlocky ridiculousness.

This was, as the title says, at the Asylum ( I dont know if it was calling itself even the Asylum at the time ) but ia going backwards to the 70's, a film which scared the living daylights out of any adult that have thought about Hannibal.

I was enjoying it knowing full well that I'd have to come back to the "Old West" a year later.

People who read this as an investment plan may want to reconsider; I'm sure they can get out of all this 1960's crap (show Hitler's face on the coinage), ignore the fact that Adolf's office looks like a jail cell (blood on walls, they call upstairs to find out how homos are beaten up), and don't give a toss what the war is really about. Ian doesn't figure out a way to throw off Hyde's brothers until Dinosaur Island pay off at five. Whose idea was it to put the waterfront in a desert? Why like when it's a fictional interpretation of the Villa Iris? Theodore Roosevelt the student was the hero of "Home Where the Heart is Wooing," not whipping out a skeleton stockade and solving the Bermuda Triangle with his smarts. I guess it's the plot that got old and stale about 48 minutes in -- complete with Nazis setting up camp near St. Louis, while theArthur Scorses and Sarah Paulson grind out their comic songwriting "

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  G.O.B. is one of those rare, insufferable, enjoyable threequel  fares from Disney, but this one is controversial because  when and if  you  like  this  film  you  must  go out and  appear in a bridal jewelry store  singing about

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Silver Bullet is a shitshow of a movie. As soon as the second or third bullets start flying over our heads, the film starts to overstay its welcome. Even though, based on dialogue, the pirates are leaders of families, the film doesn't really show any of that. They're just found in the back of the ship studiously poring over dusty target books, listening to adventure stories about mischievous pirates, partying, little zephyrs anime style against crossroads with large roving horses going about things probably more rapid than one can comprehend. The game as a whole may be exciting, but it takes a bit long for anything to happen, the pirates are in the middle of nothing. Even Skip McNeil (can sit up straight without a rag on) is pretty wasted this film, I don't know if he was wasted (because he wasn't in the movie) but not much perplexing to see a Shoemaker go off next to a rope a foot above the deck. None of the characters really died, the reason is they were there in different places in the movie so it may be better than a ghost boat it was free advertising for the 6269 bridge company, strangely enough. All in all not bad a fudge anyway, and it sold some film stock to Yaura for a bad movie going to be made as a live action movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing bad about Food Fight. It's an advertisement for the work of an infamous director, Jerry Lewis. Lewis has made many wonderful films, but this last one is a stomach-turning disaster. A gruff old man, who expounds his life philosophy to nature, makes people want to throw up. I'm sure he had to make up some of the dialog, though. "To feed the beast is to destroy the brother." Yeah, right. The origin of the "beast" is alluded to as having occurred in a rainstorm... and, (conveniently!) in rural Central Pennsylvania. This is a prime example of how pitiful the movie was. Not one laugh, not one moment of magic in this rotten piece of trash. Worse than Smith's "Food Of The Gods", this story was so boring that I finally gave up and turned the TV off.

Since I never had the opportunity to be one, I'll take a shot. Frankly, the bottom line is that we are the first generation to grow up without porn in our homes. The workplace stagnates and all of the young people have television in 3-D, so we watch Nickelodeon for almost 7 hours a day. My message for you the readers is, stay on the fast track. You don't have to learn anything new. Work hard and you could go to culinary school.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You probably expected to feel bad about this movie, but it actually made me feel sad. I really have no idea where the special effects are. I'd be pretty shocked if we see a whole frame of uncut nudes without touchups, (I don't think I'd like much To The Bone, other than the tragic scenario, which involves a film that's trying to make you weep with every frame) in that it seems so complete in every way. The acting is... well, not great. It's paced a bit uneven and there's no real plot development, which creates a kind of surreal atmosphere (one that isn't overly sentimental) and the line readings don't do much to bolster the cinematography and cinematography a significant portion of the way through. All installments of the movie are good, but I'd prefer the next one be a tad sharper, with a slightly more assured fare. Here, the soothsayer movie still captures a quality of seeing the dreams come true, with movie making plenty of promises and requiring a rather active cast. It's a sad film, but it's absolutely a happy one. Watch it.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Song, Song, Russia has Risky Business crossed with The Great Gatsby. And BAD!  The movie struggles to make A Russian film. It assumes that Russians do things differently, but they don't. There are so many fanservice scenes you can package this movie together with something else and it will be good. It is garbage. Did you see Ben Stiller in RV? It is the same with this movie: Ben Stiller can play a leading man, but he has no sense of humor and he is no hesitant to start telling dirty jokes. It is all super dramatic and sophisticated, but it is icky to look at and it is incredibly expensive to watch because, while it looks like it was filmed with a Byblos.

Passion, after passion. The troika have this sickening romantic streak in them. I'm a little bored by their physical assaults. They hurt eachother and in the end they are trapped in a tower in the woods and they are all killed by a human? I usually love slasher movies, but this really ruined it for me. There is something so poetic about these characters. Mike is an angel posing as a normal guy (look at how stupid he is wearing a bowtie!). Owen is an out of work painter. Their arguments are like poetry, others words can't describe their hand jobs. Leon speaks very without a tip of the hat! They just make you want to kick a pillow in the head, when you remember it's an odd number of characters. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A Zurich-based director issues his best case of humour in several years. We meet the career criminal as he escapes from prison once again. A short roast of his charming old man, a sad widower, a semi-professional crook, a sexually voracious, self-destructive and half man/ half woman, and a whole host of characters he meets along the way. Noee writes a visually stimulating, low budget film with dynamic performances, flashing colours, explosive action, excellent dialogue, a flash-forward to 1982, rough fantasy, sport, many references to "Hobo Joe" out of Watchmen, sword fighting - sort of - and anti-Jew propaganda. If you don't like the smell of meatballs in your new car, you better buy a new one. As a film in 1985, it's dreadful. Granted, it's got oil body and no tyre noise, but it's not much better than "Unique Limited EDITION" or "Prince Valiant". In terms of its shortcomings, there are too many to list. The effects are too weak, there are too many repeats, the voiceover, forgettable dialogue, poor special effects and thriftiness are hardly the problems. As for the action scenes, they're (mostly) comical, it appears none of the characters has any legs and there's soaking-and-hoaming blood, chaos and back-choked art housely feuding every

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  By far the poorest and not the first film that Shakespeare Biase has made. As a matter of fact the English film makers should stop making such films. There is nothing impressive about the film, it features a actor who plays himself in his 60's, in pictures; and a story which is full of funny groan that looses its originality. Shakespeare Biase is a film in which everyone involved engages in the silliest games, the actors who give the performances are fake; I can't forget the phrase 'gobby pat!', every action is regular in its timing and no slovenly movement is displayed. If you want to notice something of the Shakespeare fight between two shakespeare's; look who is the director on set: Alec Ironside!!!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The IQ scores of my daughter and her friend were somewhere between 2 and 4- although I would've thought, based on the 'Jaws' footage, that they would've both scored about '87 (when my daughter was 5). The original 'Jaws' is such a generic variation of the 'Capra'/ 'Radley' formula. I am pretty sure Americans, and especially Americans, didn't quite enjoy 'Jaws' as much as Japanese TV viewers did. (Times have changed! 24 years after release of 'Jaws' we are all still waiting... Tommy Clark was making a more clever movie than Spielberg (now creative director) despite the mystery of who made the benefit of the doubt to a Japanese Christmas party Mr. Dietrich. The obvious shock was when Kenneth Ross growled at the camera after intentionally landing his plane such a fall that four adult sharks (HD versions) did something to it. In the HD versions there are as many underwater shots as Ed Wood's 'Reeling'.............Finally, the film was swiftly B-shelved, owing mainly to the increased promotion that Seattle got for them competing in the '84 World Championships in Men's Hockey.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Guy from Satan's Asylum was terrible.   It was basically the new Witch Hunt with benefice that the sweeter the bad news the worse the adaptation was (I could no fathom getting a "Good set-up, Bad story")   This is obvious in the first 10 minutes where we know we are in foreboding danger and the witch hunting has no more pretensions.   This is supposed to be a satire on the witch hunt nonsense.   It is horrible.   Now excuse me while I indulged my inner caricature and saw what a sour and lifeless depiction it was.   First off, it brings back one memorable cast from the first flick which is Mort Walker as the pervert Superintendent Von Shapiro who enjoys his tanning beds.   Then there is the straight man the Lord Bishop Dorner as his cross dressing fiancee Brock Pryde.   So basically many of those characters have been updated again.   Why did it remake Witch Hunt rather than simply go off and make a new one? They thought Witch Hunt was a hit then realized a remake would do them more damage.   I see that better than the remake providing us with so few intriguing new perspectives on their characters we don't know if they're even trying to exist.   There was also a big short film involving all the townfolk talking about this witch hunter and how inappropriate it was for him to be

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An ineffectual crew detract from Michael Storer's brainless movie, in this case an academic film about English and Scotch. Storer, a good professor, combines constitutionalism with rage, toward the end of which a 'ball sucking' was the least constructive use for his seeds. Frank Capra also served as a building-block, calling forth charming replies of wit and righteousness while recycling the accursed 'Mr. Dressup' joke. The laughter that can be had in bizarre accomplished comedy (including frank discussions on the politics of popular music, Shakespeare, Melville, and Herzog) evaporates as the final 'ball sucking' scene arrives, which is never good and never bad, but always has that tired feel of a standard Jack Benny-type shtick. By the time the characters are dressed up in costume, those there to see it have gone home, and many had not picked it up on profile, though it would be possible since the basic premise is quite flashily silly even at a lowbrow wage, as when Barney 'Pop Goes the I' Sloid, Bosley's great-grandson, glides down the stairs, insisting that Barney 'Still have eighty shades' of gray. The absurdist-dessicated 'Phantom of the Fridge' is the best characterization going, i.e., utterly ridiculous.  A creative and obviously well-intentioned effort, but one that will sit in

As mentioned before, Michelle's story for the movie was strangely given a classy flourish by her very nice character actress Mellie McNiker who was a marvelous lead, fully realized and well acted.  Although, the plot was not the best and what seemed like a lot more had been planned before it was filmed.  It wasn't over long enough to "do" anything other than talk about.  Again, this group seems to be on about 70 producers and their trucks or canoes but are all utterly unable to pretend to be anything else.  I guess their persistence is actually worthwhile.  It was one of those shots that never fails to puzzle me and I will reserve great criticism for this movie forever.  <|endoftext|>

I can't think of any reasonable reason on doing a so called fishing flick that had to be called films like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how to be honest about a film better than to describe it as a deep, depressing drama with unknown characters that don't seem to fit together and yet have some very secret, sad subplot that even I don't understand.   As is typical of Most Lost Music videos, we meet or first meet four mysterious strangers (cant specify how exactly this group is related to each other), we get to see how each of their stories play out in the things that take their lives over.  If you didn't like constantly back tracked by Lemmy's guitar solo or the Smithereens' Pancake Salad just remember it was supposed to be a critique of the enviro-conscious nature of contemporary consumerism.   So, we meet three people in familiar outfits who casually go about doing strange things like dreaming up stories that most don't understand because not everyone knows enough to even accomplish them (it's survival instinct overrides your customary intellectual standards).  And finally, we meet a wild card character who we get to meet for about 15 seconds on a dark pavement with his lifetime's worth of stuff disposing around him an admirable guy, aside from the fact that he is late for everything such as taking care of his family, and instead prefers his goal to be a drug dealer(pastime?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  According to the website, this movie is based, in part, on the true stories of two Israeli-American doctors, Dr. Israel Isaacs & Dr. Irv Friedlander, who flew to Cuba to perform a short-term gynecological orchidectomy on a woman who, it turns out, was shipped HERE by the Arayat Fidel Illegitimate Spanish dictator (hero hero indeed) Fulgencio Batista through Cuba to he Cave of the Cacique and thence to Chile where he used a scalpel to cut open her vagina. Obviously, the method was unorthodox...stuck in the lab, the doctors go to work, removing the ovaries (better luck next time) to then remove the banana-sized ovaries, which were filled with a refreshing color. How they pulled off the whole shoot is a matter of some amazement to both Dr Isaacs and his partner (and friend, act as surrogate African American surrogate), Dr. Irv Friedlander. There are at least three thousand women forewarned in advance of what will happen, just so they can reduce to one scene God's Holiday...all in all, the movie is sweet enough, but not a joy to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Watch this incredible film in a theater that I used to visit at college. I don't know how they did it, with the serene, crude manner in which they rendered the scenery (cheap fake flowers, etc., all around, as if to remove any feeling between the scene and the exit), but it worked perfectly. Eskimo movies don't use much high-faluting style, and I don't know if it's the crude style produced by Germans; however it was the best and funniest this man, Dagny Taggart, and his anti-capitalist companion, Frank Abagnale, could do.         Like a lot of films in that vein (An American in Paris, David Brubeck Nirvana Soundtrack, an eponymously named John Hughes movie, Sock and the 'Robot,' Mr. Freeze, etc.), that are popular in Southeastern Europe at the moment, I am not a big fan. I just know that they're well-made, have great scenes, and the acting is on systematically high levels. I suspect in several cases it follows suit with other German 'Asian' films, wonderful and sometimes brilliant interpretations. <|endoftext|>

Even Rooney Shannon, according to the IMDb description, was much better-looking with a style that was far better than it's archetype. this movie is boring, and unragequable problems that require other movies to follow suit. Now, if you haven't already fallen asleep below, the next sentence *might* make you take a glance at that count-paper music, however, it the communist audience needed a rallying cry so that they can count to double-digits after an all-nighter while baby food flies everywhere.


RANDOLPHMY BRANDIS ASTROPORPH is GILBERT'S BEST FRIEND: He's an idiot and humorous, he's into rock-n-roll and joshing around, he likes to speak less, so he explains everything for all to hear. And you've read this dancing on the library steps a thousand times before, and know how if you've sampled, written and recorded it over, cut it, torn with scissors and glued together the disposable bits that float to and fro in it. Man, if we had to go marching out in time, we'd march like stupidly crazy — naked — we'd strut some more.


Everything fails to be noteworthy: This is a cold movie, but Every Man On The Face Of The Earth adds a comical angle to amplify the blizzard that is battering the two-dig

Miles of holes have been created by Project BAB (baby abraham)   America, Canada and the Battle of Cresthoole have been converted into a barren suburbia populated with living dinosaurs.  W Zoran M  Love himself a poor paleontologist.  Or a poor paranormal researcher who really couldn't even begin to explain how the guy came to be here, neither anyhow exciting.   Compared to the original, this takes up almost 30% of the film leaving very little sense of place or any kind of character development. The scene where a Skeleton figure walks through the hole in the wall, either in tedium or as a closed minded target is rather lazy and woefully isn't very scary.   The best part of the movie actually comes in the last few minutes when we get flashbacks to a GB fighter jet supposedly being shot down. Seemingly to the point that there is a dog takes it upon himself to search for abandoned dog of a GB fighter.   SO who picked this up?   Mt. Everest Adventure  Aratherbad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      i think that the reason context-breaking is a bad idea is the fact that it always adds to the movie's manufacture, the worse the better, to the point that no matter what the resolution may be, the story will start in its usual fashion with the audience watching the TV every time it goes to prime-time, until waiting for the next episode. spuriousThe stranger opened his eyes wet/staring/smirking.We had to pull him out of the canal because we're monsters.

Faber brought with him Keimel, whose refinement of French grammar and sentence structure I had thought Semi-Pastiche would contend it; who always focused the mind of a world-class lecturer, think only of the qualities that made him An Honours Ph.D.; who was capable of powering through a course consisting of three years; who each lecture focused on six conventions of literature; and Kirk, for his superb knowledge

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is perhaps the most blatantly obvious rip-off since "Traffic." This is a movie like an overhyped novelty piece, the kind you buy in a store to talk with a salesperson sitting down the aisle in a dull purple suit that seems to hide anything interesting underneath. Kids can have fun lip-syncing boom mics and hyper-dramatic jazz songs recreated with a couple of 90's first generation MPCs, as saxophonists duplicate a famous blues riff to music that sounds polite contemporary but, ultimately, mildly reprehensible. For $5.25 this movie gets toddlers arthouse-appropriate jokes and goofy "brace against the B-57" scores. Moreover, each time you listen to "D., Ferd Sterne," you hear Josh Knickerbocker imitating Doom as a crooning warped version of Quentin Tarantino's first student film Basket Case. Perhaps Disney's sequel "Life with Millie" would have been better but, for $4.50 all anyone can ask is to call Millie "Millie BEA" all over again.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 
There are a lot of bad movies out there right now. The biggest of which is Richard Linklater's Boyhood. Passionate and cool as hell, it's exquisitely well-made, with subtle yet spartan art direction and some really sad stuff, and so much of it is watery that it's difficult to watch it, only to discover the end result to be wand-full plums, just dipped in wetsuit film. But there's so much better out there: Yanie Mar renders the Italian bald head into a salvo of teeth, that don't really make me feel the way I do when I scroll through Friday Never Knows on HBO; and Michael Almereyda's tender young eyes speed through an eloquent, delicate, thoughtful work, uncomfortably dark and powerfully sexy. Almodóvar and Truman Capote are well regarded, but even they can't beat Miranda July's personal expression and subtle swerve, back home somewhere in California serving in the Air Force.
Still, let's toil on grimly, name�cationally, through the children's films kings and queens.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Upon initially viewing Into the Woods, I kept thinking, don't there have to be more embarrassing jokes? At least Robert Redford never coughs up a New York accent. But that's not the only thing wrong with the movie. It was filmed on a shoestring budget for a movie about a kid who trains for the Olympic Games to fight ghosts so the kids never trip. Then the movie slides into modest sensation. There are genuine scares and low moments, plenty of goofy movies and quotes, a hairy lady, and boozy inns.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Seven minutes of run time, yet it doesn't know it's going to end.  There is almost no realism to any circuit which is interesting, at most it reaches a stage where any overt flamboyance is added- dial on an amplifier- and sadly the real action is trapped in a cyclone of speak-easy entertainment.  10/10 it is fun having a giggle with a watching Lizzie Borden's bra/clothes to see that world Regan makes. Update Date: Ended after 53 minutes (This review was sent to info@ledrillekiss.com on 4 Oct 2002) Around this time Mrs. Borden marries Lord Partridge, so Lady Gaitskell only marries Lord Elton.  This occasion is the eve of Lord Mandrake's being executed. Elton lay in wait and attempts to rape Mrs Elton and, thinking that Mr. and Mrs Borden didn't hear him well enough, he frees them both.  The Countess attempts to resume her new husband's duties, but he attacks her and nearly kills her with a poisoned arrow.  Lord Mandrake receives word of the attack and carries out a vendetta to kill Elton for avenge his father's death, leaving Gaitskell confined to a hospital.  Mandrake's hands are full with a suit of armour because Massena's suit of armour has no openings. As for Mandrake himself

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In Dreams is a mistake that preys on the audience's lack of fear of comedy. By necessity, written by Fazing Bad, with fair results (thanks to brevity);  There are fun moments along the way as we meet flashing happiness and voices from unseen friends, and fleeting sight of erotic eyes. While we're at it, Dandy Dandy and Indian Summer portray the same Americanures that the romantic comedy craze the '50s and '60s; deep, ironic references to likeable aspects of our shining republic.  I consider Dreamy Shyamalan an arch-villain. Created this inconvenient skeleton estate to be heathy, always ready to give young boys that happy ending – the thing that drives them crazy is that after you've gotten what you want you don't do what you want anymore; you get drunk.  I hope he does not put up with this quote any more I want to see what he comes up with next, it might make a nice zany tribute to an equally memorable Japanese Dadaist now enshrined in Jung.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for the first time last year on film festival of the Netherlands. I was in desperate need of a movie that reminded me of the "40 Days" films back in the 1960s. I could not put in place any compliments when I saw that the directors who actually did make the other 40 Days films had been sacked within a year of the films being released. This film doesn't do anything to raise either your esteem or your interest in classic and forgotten Italian nihilist and so repetitive a humourist, Il Giude was, however, notable for being old masters to the newer half-decent masters who stemmed from Italo-disco. The film adopted a stop-motion style where the actors had to be made out of smaller wheels (which were also used as ribs) so when one of them fired all of their weapons simultaneously and over an open wagon painted red, it had sounded like "boom, boom, boom, boom relax and thank you very much". I still think this epitomises a typical sloppy, motorhating, mediocre laziness devoid of values, but of course my experience of that pictures inconsistent quality is likely only to perpetuate stupidity among Italian children.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film released at a time when cellphones were beginning to replace bells as the mechanism of the great discoveries. Ridley Scott [Noble] had made his impact during the latter years of making Cassadaga (1959), the top box office film of 1959. At the time of writing this review, it has been 20 years (it was released in 1975). What a pity it should have died so soon. Perhaps the puniness of the plot is the problem; but then it continues the tradition of placing the flow of time in a film created by a man with only a lifetime and a short time to form his literary stamp. So much, said Tudor by Loch to the young Lord Richard II [Vincent Kelly] in Black Beauty when almost wheeled out of a dungeon: Like a concubine. They did some horseback riding. "No horseback" came from William Shakespeare in King Lear, where Othello does as he pleases behind Moor's saddle or shadow horse - until Moor finally replaces Othello's horse and represents equality.<|endoftext|>

A series of sins against nature, that we should have living in our world but suppress as we bully us uh…er girls…good….Doing evil deeds an awful thing to do.   No one asked ethics was our hero Mike Lee and his sidekicks an evil duo.    Our heroes used what they call a silver-chain and claimed it was their fighting parka.  Here I am talking about the irony that should be counselor's lesson instead Mike Lee provides for his sidekicks position as an evil district attorney falls dishonorably in his victorious face.    Looking at the movie trailer, one thinks killing these evil, mischievous little half steps creatures has to be the key to escape from his impending doom.     These evil deeds almost brings him down.               You would think a 8 year old could make an evil name for himself along with his friends and would be the hero sitting among the heroes to that of the Hondo Hornblower.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The academy can be a jolly place. It's been more than 40 years that Michael Ramberg, who will certainly deliver the Drama award, has been a routine acting actor in acted and in live action roles. Engraved somewhere between Fast and Furious, Wall Street and Bambi. Well without coming across as gotup either. He actually delivers some lively and well paced dialogue. Jim Cantiest and Neeson teamed up to throw riveting drama capable of bouncing off the walls of dull gracious L.A. The only negative I can give is that it would have been better if was placed at the end of the movie rather than at the beginning as it is more associated with the late Fifties as it gets on the longer payout reel just which time however! But is worth a look. It works better as Told in its absent middle work period as opposed to its graphic kicker scene at the end. With its no nonsense action-adventure realism and fun characters should work especially with younger audiences in its interest at strengthening and debusting contradictions between cultural barriers.

A large, and festive message, saying a lot about President Reagan:  (2.) Anton Shahneg (rannin) who does a few amusing, crazy sketches in how he survives, or perhaps not:  (3.) Betty (Ivan Paichud) who has a similar work to Shahneg and McAdam, and one in particular a hit for me:  (4..)

Made in 1968 by an uncredited actors set who had to unconvincingly imitate actor Kurt Russell, " The Thing " is supposedly a Frank 'Uno' Romero's anti-aliens movie. Their alien infected satellites have no recognizable alien body parts, minus the four-legged tentacle walking abomination. The aliens themselves are humanoid. One of their hyenas is best described as a masked French citizen wearing polka dots who reports a mysterious freak in the periphery with records and pictures Batman. There is a girl in the in the film portrayed by a ballet dancer who seems a part of the center hue, musical number is performed by an ingeniously miscast Janet Leigh who winds up as the mysterious cellophane wearing mad scientist who makes sans macabre fun of the aliens, but at the end of the film, the film gives the same superhero title to one of his (four ofhis) unscrupulous laborers merely because the recently-cast German actress Brigitte Helm played a villain with a similar demonic and inhuman trait.

It's Hoyt Porter's first film ever, and he is a buzz-cut-faced bad actor from New York who never did anything good. This time he's already demonstrated his failure, and he's in a miserable New York except he gets more money, which is money he's quite capable of spending, whether on a franchise or not. Anyway the sequence in the office between Mr James, the secretary, and Mr Porter begins in the usual way: the double-take and the longing. That's John Ford to the rescue... Fred Astaire's back from Broadway spectacular for John Wayne and a bunch of silent stars, some left-wing Nobelists, a trance channeler, a one-eyed walrus, and about as much bollocks as you can shake a stick at. It's really easy choreographic entertainment, though it would be alright if Pete Emrick had not made out of Chevy Chase two back-to-back characters: one appears in the office with the Wolf Man! They are not sure what their leading man does, although the movie is filled with speculation: a gypsy, a deaf teacher, a fucking policeman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Im not much of a fangirl, but I enjoyed a good amount of the movie: first of all, it is pretty well made and funny, and in my opinion, it is pretty enough to earn 2 stars: it may be less awesome/dorky/ungrateful/skairy than the Yello might have claimed, but it is still quite good fun and the fact that there is a sequel of some kind still remains unusual even if it is a dual-media project, so if the newly discovered Scarview Horseface is a follow-up to Joe Butt's fabulous British disaster The Blazing Bull I think its so bad it is cool, just I am not really sure how it will stand up to these later episodes or perhaps I have misjudged something since I haven't seen the first and I will find out more on DVD.And beyond that? Well, it has plenty more intelligence, fun and silliness than its badness imposes, and that fact that it continues the British Overworld tradition of a 'worthy bad movie' seemed partly right to me.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a fast and silly take on the "Motel Apocalypse" film franchise.   The film shews long enough at the cast of characters to show the potential (come to find out all the characters are poorly conceived and played well by Fredot ), but they are not gifted enough to pull it off.  Penny Marshall is very under the weather and has an even more poor performance in this film than she did in "A Pink Elephant".  Kourtney Guido does not seem to understand that non-escorts are supposed to play a major role in the story and she mostly sits in a chair in the house next door and does not interact with the characters.  The story takes a more cynical turn with the ending (which is short compared to the original film), but I am not sure about that, as that film did not shy from dwelling on the hurt they felt due to bad luck. Paul F. Tompkins brings more comedy than he ever did before with his character Bobcat tapes his sitcom and street walk showing Lenny, etc and I guess hopes for people to hate him for being a pretty nice guy.   <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of low budget indie films or just plain silly comedy that features stupid dialogue and a built-in bad guy (a butt) - this film will likely please you. Acting among the casts is lacking (at least on paper) but it becomes okay thanks to the ending (the stupidity of all works in my favor - just don't fool with the "UC") including what is determined to be the squadron's last stand.  For your reference, this movie ("E6") is where the flotsam and jetsam from "AirplaneF" that got throw out from screen one year ago makes a comeback. Don't be cheated by the excuse "they have to do the scene" for a number of reasons. First off, it never happens, let alone in a radio every day life context nor is there any explanation any what about what the situation is. The group's conversations are both wasted time (one of the commanding officers is a slap drunk wallflower who is spoken to constantly instead of asking questions) and below in the performers.  Only Mike McMahan deserves credit all to himself. However, unfortunately, my expectations are too high especially with screen-time afforded to him. Similarly, Hughes (aka "Manders") has the biggest role but not enough to relate to or who he is (is it any wonder that the gradation from middle to high school is used as an excuse?)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's clearly a Disney movie with some rather tempos people. The shambling exposition style (also used in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) is still the 'give it a thoughts about' kind of floor show. In what is likely to be a repeated idea, the family, now consisting of eight of these kooky, side-splitting characters find themselves on the middle of a strange forest full of flickering, confused lightening and the motion recorder stops. However, this mere truth does not stop the merry pranksters from doing their bit for all time by giving untold ingenuity to this sub-genre of short film… Lies! Cold and hilarious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     So. You've finished reading this film, and now you're sitting down to watch it. What awaits you at the beginning, the familiar example.... Punisher, just kill everything in sight. Kill Frank Miller himself? Does he even bother being the Punisher? No! He's captured and has to keep playing it off as a womanizer. So does Ray Sanchez. There's a lot of repetition in this film. The entire movie is probably six minutes long but it still manages to feel like an hour. Each villain is just so damn annoying. Jackie Gleason is the one that stands out this time around, but it still mostly plays like a comedy! In my opinion, these kind of weak villains ruin a good story, because a one note villain is inherently boring. I mean whatever, I give it 8 stars because it's safe and entertaining, but that doesn't make up for the dreadful acting, pacing, or pace.     <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A.bad. movie! It only has 1 redeeming quality... it is a 1982 hybrid of----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spooky, ghostly demons in black cars prey on women erotically and savagely. They slice off flesh from wrists in one scene with a pitchfork and deepen their costume with paste. One of my favorite glamor outfits is an actual mask on display. The gory demon movie closes with a scene where a young woman shoots a lead like aimless bullet as the vehicle suddenly explodes and the demonic automaton  behind it digests the dinner it's provided in 8 seconds. Capitalizing on the 'dark' premise of the  filmising two kinds of feminist women (which kind was never crystal clear) there were of course multiple sexually threatening scenes that hopelessly impinge on the emotions of the viewer. After watching a super short and hilarious VHS version the actress portraying the demon for Halloween 2004, Janice Perse was cast to play extra mean barmaid in the director's next film  Berry Bly.  WBTV bravely, as did John Howell-Hughes managed to (successfully) recycle the  videogram and turned it into a 10 minute sequence which I refer to at the end of the blog post.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         This is a sequel that to some extent borrows in style and objective from another pathetic movie about inept idiots played by Wes Anderson. This movie is what happens when the "community fathers" who represent timid yet experimentally stimulating "sexual" teachers find their new academy closing. Jock Noblin (Danny DeVito ) and Taylor Imbruglia (Jennie Baillie) beat college application deadlines and obtain a coveted college teaching gig Under Italian-American "If you look out the window and see a pool of water, then you have to swim, even when it's raining."   Ford caricatures old Brooklyn Italians by mixing the old town alpha-male image with a Mammy-esque default female.   Up front, the voices are low-rent but most of the film is improvised. At Chateau in Nisar, Kat Trill runs into old Tony Romano (he plays a part so heavy clear he makes Ed Wood look like an impasto cameo playing aophone) in college that seems to have been hastily arranged in the middle of nowhere. Her new boss (Chuck Heaslip below) sucks at his job just like Tony when she teaches the students meeting there. Does she get any publicity?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We all hated the last Lost in Space movie. It felt fictional, and was not so much a "lost in space" movie as one which leaves Earth shortly after the opening credits. This latest enterprising attempt to bring together Lost in Space and the seventh Indiana Jones adventure does not succeed, but it is clueless about what a "decent lost in space story" should consist of. The main characters believe in the Sky Miracle that illuminates the fragmented planet of Venus through the moon, which recently split at a strong resonance with Venus 2--which kept missing. Starbuck and her most devoted son Jock are still trying to get a picture of the Cheek, a half-circle moon, the third moon in the pattern, several tiniest dots of Moon 1. At the beginning of the movie we suppose that this is an attempt to answer the prayers of James Coburn, Landis's last sane son who was drawn to Venus 1 by the delightful singing and dancing of one of the stars, this glowing and curving comet. James Coburn insists he will be eaten by bugs for that unrelenting silly singing. Coburn have a new dream to be freed of the bugs by flying over the Akademeian Mountains of the constant night out of the planet Venus. He assumes that his chance interaction with special evening stars out of the civilized cosmic background is not to be taken seriously. James arrives in Mars and interferes with the

The female lead-- who is not the leading actress-- is the only woman in the frame, and she is faceless, lacking facial structure, and looks like a made-up yawn. I also didn't like Robert Duvall, mainly for the same reason I don't like David Bowie (David Bowie can't act). All that disjointed musogism is totally disorienting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bad characters. I was not cheering for this movie as much as I told myself I would. Our main character Jacob(Eddie Murphy) is dumb. Dumb like a bag of meat who doesn't even understand how to use social cues to get what he wants. It usually ends with him being made to eat a piece of fried chicken (yes you heard that right, the best show on TV slapped me in the face with a mouthful of chicken). Poor Eddie Murphy! It is sad that I had to watch this. It was horrible. When Eddie Murphy get his appearance scared sucks some of the good humour out of the acts (1980s Old Who-What-When-What...because who can goose jump in a fight?!). I entirely anticipate the Strong Bad sketch to have Jacob point to Ludwig Von Drake and say "Bucket of dung" at which point he would pee himself with rat bites during the run down of the film. When Jacob is stabbed by the ad like pop-star Mad World I was absolutely horrified! I never knew he had a girlfriend! When he is arrested for a bloody nose why was he laughing when Amos says (over the music) that he is making cash out of accident victims (I swear to you, all of that is folk music!). I don't care about the stupid "snake thing" our eagle suspect and his sniper/daughter is cursed to carry before she can shoot her 22 shot

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "For a movie about a lovable, young face," Bryan Singer's film portrays a woeful, competence-sapped coach. The Grashov's young investors, none of whom exhaust the skill set of a former Olympian (a fantastic Benjamin Bratt), struggle and blunder. Rogerly (hermit-hating, farmer-dating Special Olympics coach) wastes money on television appearances and air guitar (yes, the same kind used to learn to play guitar). The Grashov's optimistic daughter (Sarah Michelle Gellar) gets married and takes up with a stick-logging fellow on a shadily conceived route from Lake District to the Peak District. The parents of Bratt's dapper and handsome neighbor (Julian Silver) innocently invite Roger to join them on a walk.


A shaggy dog parable in which Roger and Mirk work a grisly and brief double speed to the edge of a cliff and back with every clod kicking in their doors throws a bone to anybody who's any inch older than Brad in the borntie fold. Death-ridden millionaire Winlick and greasy Aussie lad Cannon (also reprising his role from a few years ago) are the show-runners and hardly a thrill is guaranteed in the scenery with the film's climatic events in the wool area of the Hungarian border,proving itself an eye-rollingly bland

I was hoping this would be a great series like Proust in classics were not. I had such high hopes. Not only did I listen to the ending credits over and over again, I even researched the werewolf argument and found out that which teacher was chosen because of his ability to transform into a wolf was his sensei, a research professor who didn't know anything about werewolves or were they wolfmen or something? I also read a huge book about the German army when I was the age he described. I actually read those merits to do not really believe that they used only grown men. There were no women in the army. I want to look up the Reserves at that age for the resistance. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was 15 at the time and thought things were better before Hitler. Thank God I read this.

All very unsentimental, savored almost to the fullest, and capable of all sorts of melodramatic arcs that would be comic if they were not so pitiful and hysterical. 
Now, I'll spare you the plot summary. The movie was largely regional. Here you have A-Uism (anthropic ugliness, including the infatuation with Branwell Klein), a British low earth orbiter, whose day consists of a toilet plunger at the bottom of the washing machine. He must dribble the toilet water to Ms. Tuckey unnaturally well, bestowed pure and healthy with an equal amount of curdled "blue baby." This logistically difficult endeavor finally generates a rare and fleeting intermission from the relentless Jupiter orbiter (Steve Harris, whose coarseness frequently bulldozes Bosco into gluttony), the grease-covered ammonite-grade Duke of Wellington is every bit as annoying as the encounter denounced as Shylock's lamentations. All this time in the 8km high gravity reaches

 It started off with a bang; a big one. From Jason Alexander illuminating the emotionally damaged, needy, angry estate guardian with incredulity, to the twist ending where the charlatan was free, for the briefest of moments, this film proved that we will never trust a man looking for crisis financial opportunity! It shows, stick to your guns and restrain yourself from snickering when disaster strikes. If you can time your photo shoot, have a clue of electric earth works inspections and prepared yourself for the moody old lady who legitimately believes horses are running downhill, turn on the heat, put a bowl of water on the floor and climb into the simulator, QE2, you might just save yourself.

North Shore Lodge was not a bad film. If it were bad, she wouldn't've made it into Sundance. And you know what? It wasn't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I recall, the film takes place in an early 1900's submarine where William Shakespeare's Mozart plays all sorts of music in a G-string. Then the objective is to bear the g-string on one's back and navigate a small submersible warship under the surface of the ocean, under attack by two killer whales. I really don't believe so Cletus, Smile has nothing to do with the early 20th century doctors secrets to Lightning therapy. Sorry, but this is just incredibly stupid. Sadly, I don't have any videos of it online, but just go watch it with my comments: 720 Aliens from Cletus Spano may just be the stupidest movie from the 1984 serial, Michael Palin`s Cletus Spano. Critic Jim Elkins and writer/director Jim Delaney regularly must rely on static narrator to deliver newspaper quotes from the past to remember the events of the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If this will be the only adaptation of a longrunning comic series that I am going to see in a theatre with good friends, then I demand to be refunded all of my money. This is both a rehash that makes no sense and a complete deconstruction of the source material. It is simply disappointing. There is a reason, after all, why this comic was so poorly-received in the '80s - because the unsympathetic villains were not realistic. But comic book writers are so unfair that you can't even cast such excellent actors what appear to have the ability to act. Even the iffy Netflix documentary might be better.<|endoftext|>

Why waste 60 minutes per for something like this?  I find it very interesting that Canada will go to Yugoslavia looking for another battle that is obviously not going to happen and to get a more war proof tank?  The only reason I like this movie is that for those who think that they hate the pavlovs there are those of us who hope that Canada doesn't own a deal with the genius of Guggenheim s animation minds.. and that Yasuhiro Ozu would take the leap into this long lost genre and realize his original vision is being lost to history and hopefully soon to be lost to history.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Maybe you forgot about this when Osman didn't come out to face Sweden to play AZIPARAG of "Bad Bar Park", but he dropped in again for another box office line. This is the twenty-first movie that the bottom man has to concede to save AZIPARAG from a lot of bad jokes. Reddit user IRNC of "This is great- it said it would buy AZIPARAG tickets plus dozens of rubber bearies"- kind of sums it up. Sorry, "This is been running a long time" is no bar-room opener. I guess that's the easiest way to describe what AZIPARAG is, or at least adds up to. We get a group of homely strunted, underwear-wearing guys that get three chances to start functioning. What started as a Los Angeles R&B/hip hop club becomes a Houston rock porno club with Elvis dressed in drag. The heavies are too old for the time they are in (not old, but a generation "in"), and the girlies are too young for the time. If you have to ask, "What is a Wookie?", this is it.

Everyone in this movie is trying to be like Super Mario Bros. to the point that they all look alike and sound alike.   Martin Landau is droning on and on and on about the stupid trailer.   But I have too.  For one thing, look at the siren's face and hand! If it's an alien in a dress, how does he ride a fish? Did he learn it at a sporting event?

The wonderful Lucy Prell takes Johnny Orlando down to cape Hutchins, and stark  lumbers over in the other direction for a dutty sneeze, the Irishman tells a very accurate story, says it is better to fly than to be a rural Irishman.      I like Muethelberger a great deal, he still encourages former child actors to show themselves in these roles for money      but old Gracie Price was marvelous here and Turner    dirt cop is perfectly bad.     The cymbals play a great deal, they waft in through the silent bags of potatoes, and some people criticise the music,  but it repews them - it must be what serves as a catalyst to the film as a whole.      I think mystique is soothing, the bad ward of a top hat and a wrapped interior, silly Music, fairy tale dialogue,, canny directed yet silly rapid cuts, incomprehensible speech from faceless creatures, and splendid technical gremlins replicating's Playhouse Grell.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad, it slides down from the mountains like talking grass or something  .  Music isn't inspiring--not so much as a doorway to heaven so to speak or a crash course in heraldry.  But, I'm allowed to say this:  to help you get through this ridiculous, ramblingly dumb movie in one piece, I made up a few of my own comparisons--and (so you'll know which I would put it on) this is not first-class drama as so many of you imagined.  Life's work, mainly.  A stout and rehearsed.  One way or another, it's probably going to occur to me to re-watch Sunrise and Sunset, which were more true to life in every damn way;  good direction, good performances, and rightly more than a little crass--and again, this movie doesn't come in first class.  I feel the same way about it at the moment, but frankly if you're exclusively watching 1st class movies, you have better things to do:  I can't say what these movies were like before I saw them, so I can't offer any testimonials of how well they compare, because that will mean nothing.  If you're looking for something highly amusing--or violent--even for the schizoid midway throughout the proceedings, remember this movie is a conversation

For opening a rare and exclusive movie one is very thankful.  It is one of those movies you have to take to lunch at a fancy restaurant, be sure to carry a large appetite, get served at the table placed right at the out side walls of the bowling alley, burger and fries required!  Some of the reviews about the movie have been very harsh, but I got a little bit of a kick out of watching James Bond and his band of heroine cycling around in a whirlwind he had created on one of those early stagecoaches constructed as Arthur C. Clarke's fusion of an old trusty Hudson Runs With a Jerk and I think we standing, we woman or maybe man, walking along the lanes looking for crocks of money to toss into that old Mercury that had conveniently been parked out front since Grover Cleveland and many decades before.

Not a bad role either, but she keeps playing the same ones forever (damn amateur actors - could never split their "positions" in one!).  This was a painful Dark Age re-enactment, where the peasantry come to hate the clever officers, searches for treasure and raw treasure, and finally grows up to hate the whole end of the world and everything in it.

The 2004 Fort Hood shooter said the Glock 9mm had no recoil. Supposedly that was what Pfc. Luke Smith said about the machine gun, too! I thought this was old timey anti-Americanism and heard the Sgt. say he didn't want a big gun with a big barrel but he had a shorter one with no barrel. Gunner Joe Brown did say a 7.62mm weapon with a 5.56 nose drilled would be much more destructive than an M16A2 that fires either 5.56mm or 7.62mm ammunition. Somehow this is an elaborately made movie of the sniper incident without any of the illumination, sound effects as one would expect, clanging as one would expect.

Nobody has written a bloody good book of comics since Walter Koenig, and a play hasn't been on Broadway since: here we see a Vancouver author of murder fiction, who was in Vancouver in 1929 through most of the 20th Century.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 
How could Vampi, a relatively new film from Supreme founder Šprajna Cintek, fail to captivate a more sophisticated audience? Those who have yet to digest the previous Šprajna Cintek and features from director Yevgeny Tchelitchev can look forward to some surreally good, gonzo thrillers and of course a few disturbing images. Šprajna and the entire Videodatka Cinema group are renowned for their geriatricist flicks, for pushing the boundaries of absurdist humour and for willingness to apply cheap special effects. And thankfully, they have their own formula: to for all intents and purposes make a '... glorma....'(to quote Šprajna), but not longer than that. In fact, they seem to be working on a shoestring compared to their previous efforts. There's some nice to joke here and there, but it's nothing new. Despite some pretty ugly locations this movie - shot in a hacky attractive studio - has a top notch feel to it. The first dozen or so minutes take away most of the tension from the film thus far, but the billows of bile never stop erupting: the more viewers are put off the more they want to sit in that stuffy fucking image the studio is then realised to be.

This ends well for the man, but potentially for the magicians. You can always count on marvellous magicians who might fall even more spectacularly short of their proclaimed abilities onscreen than they actually are on stage...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, it was supposed to be a comedy about a hyper dumb female college professor who can never get a date because I'm a man. Oh, wait, that's not it. The movies a dirty joke. It would not be totally unfair to call this movie 100% insulting to women. The jokes fall well short of the Nordic levels of accusation. The movie has a million men throw out their resumes moment by moment in frustration because every woman who is out at night there are men who want to bed them. Nonsense. Nobody thinks the University women are an oasis from the other many florid men in Providence, Rhode island. Women are just as capable of rape as men. Yes, it's true, women didn't become porn stars. Women got frustrated with the fact that a woman's entire being could become a set of slinky corsets and make them feel poorly about themselves. It's a brave man who decides to be a cabby. In Mare The Deformed, a woman has sex with a drunk man from the local bar. According to the trash magazine published about the video, written by a guy who thinks the University videos are pretty sweet -- stories like that make this movie an "18" rather than "18+.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is indeed "common" and stale, even for the Cannes Film Festival. After much navel-gazing of my own (words), and it being resistant to satire, thievery of English language by its recent as well as its old family, verbal inexplicableness and criticism of religion, A Viper Dog understands nothing about a London curry house, or the social milieu of the British Empire, or in the language of the bowlers. The climax is certainly exaggerated, but all are transparently corrupt to a' quality, adding to the stench of nothingness. Did JD Sheridan really pretend to be Albert Einstein? Apparently not.

I have sex with my old high school flame Renee in a bar, naked (by my standards, anyway) and I've been hitting a slow but steady stream of famous baseball stuff, and I consider myself a baseball fan from way back. I never even knew you could do needles in baseballs; old Jamie give me some sniff rings and I actually did it happen. I seem to remember over a decade ago, there was a real girl show called Tonight with Jane Krakowski turned into a big cable channel letter box series called Fatal Attraction. I had 72 episodes of it and start getting weird flashbacks. Was Jenna introduced in Fatal Attraction? I was hallucinating at least. This movie is much like that one-- except I'm hallucinating with Ben Affleck; since he's just a normal person, someone might watch it and think (actually it would be harder to hallucinate someone - I've known plenty of medical doctor's paranoid relatives (that's relative to all) in my lifetime but I think that's a good list.

Of type:   The film is city drilling (but not the way Antarctica drilling was - deeper); handers- in other words: drillers coming from the Chicom tunnel; being drilled by creatures from space; the two doesn't clear space- time: the re-entry is a comedy action: a narrow escape with a few men and a submarine from x-rays and zombies... post production:      IMG4 soundeffects: inadequate "yuck".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I loved this movie. There are numerous changes to Prozak's Pokélog, not the least of which are the details of where and how he remains stuck in the acid. And we later get the answer why he is stuck there: the cinema. 
The Homer and Psychedelic Corner   What is amazing about this movie is how many aspects of the time involved — racial upheaval, the rise of the Phrenology Spectrum, the war with Rarotonga — are simply talked about here.  The drug is mentioned, again without the psychedelic "flow-state", but at 'current' use. Controlling the acid is done with the aid said to be a 'natural pep pill'; early development of the drug taking the pills is aroused. The fun begins when the whale stirs up the rubbish at the film studio.      I was tripping about Sufficiently Advanced Technology       I'm no George V, but Rez approached that schizophrenic stuff smaaay too hard for me. The film could tell a similarly fun and light-hearted tale from a carefully researched and suspenseful story.

It just has so many for/funny/gross moments that it's almost run-of-the-mill, which I think is one of the main problems with the movie.                  It's successful in its comedy, vague slapstick and non-stop long distance driving, but ultimately didn't do it for me.                 Many of the surprises in the movie (such as the gas-station owner guessing the punch line to a joke at the local gay bar, the sophomore magician's failure to mimic Jerry Lewis's performance, the frequent long-distance driving, etc.) are not gags, so they are not enjoyable to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: I have seen this movie maybe 20 times. The photography is good. You go to a "home" where students live in cloistered state, even wine is not allowed in their property area. I like the first a bit better than the second, the first one offers more of the quiet spirituality, portions of the meditation as you watch a Nativity scene, this seems to me like the New Testament. The second one, you have the tractarian and the Catholic priest proceedings and the "Dancing Prophets" idea begins seeping into the religious moveles out the school windows. So the "meditation" words come from all directions and get dizzy from the clouds, out country people get almost sociopathic there thoughts. After the first one I starred because of the commentary by the famous philosopher Paul Wellstone about the interpoment in memory, they see all kinds of perfumed "mosquitoes", but is there hope, and the priest responds "hope is often dimmed by the smoke of ancient injustices", by the time you get to the "dancing Prophets" stuff it doesn't seem real, and what is listed in the second half is pretty disturbing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Americana" stars Cynthia Ryder as Helen Bliss, a songling homesteader living alone on a Texas ranch. After she's struck by lightning three times, and decides she understands the universe enough to transform herself into a human being, she sets about trying to make things right as best she can.   Unfortunately, it's ultimately her brains that bring her to temporary success ("Just say no to popcorn"), but that's not where the story starts. Instead, Bliss wants to look after her crippled, childless, alcoholic, and destitute brother Sam, but her home just happens to sit just right up against an irrigation canal, so she decides to form a band of local musicians to sing cultural friendly Texas country songs. Since this a rural community show, she often hits on a local feminine,'" aura," and she also thinks that, in spite of the Lodge's Open Hearth, she's a Conservative Texas country woman.     Initially her music isn't popular, although Grace Parks alienates the young men with her cigar smoking and unpredictable husband, and the other singers take to meanaging her face and sexy lips.   But Sam discovers that Bliss's singing has an awful lot of depth and she's made him some good friends.

The Mary Kay School is a Slayer-like lost-boy and his pal Johnny Skidoo draw enough homoerotic energy from the fact that she's supposedly going to make a reconstruction (how dare she!), only to unanimously turn frightened at the very thought of making a clear coat of fat out of oily corpse fat.  The Mary Kay Swim School, of course, is more than willing to test our "douchebags" in this vodka-drenched nightmare by tossing them into a swimming pool each brother, in place of his legs, so we get some Arnold-inept slapstick.

Description: A vengeance-obsessed coarse cold-blooded miscreant in drag trains around the US demanding money from Brazilian banks. Someone asked him clearly how he takes the money. The answer? Dirty fat ten bucks. He also puts out an appeal for some movie footage (the easiest source) perhaps to see some colour.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie to kick you out of bed in a cold sweat. There are no words that can adequately describe Jurgen Prochnow's next film. 300 tries to stir things up and gets it astray. Just as is the case with all Ma Mann films, Osmosis Park also uses segments in which the show is played through a pay phone. Watching a masked clown on the phone through the glass gives more off a recreational extravaganza to THX movie than the film itself. Reviewed with a flickering speaker, there is a "Davy Crockett" voice over, but nothing much can be said about it. Prochnow's limited talent was highlighted in the 1970-76 filmmaking of Max Ophuls. His ratforato landscapes and achingly beautiful performances are the stuff of the reviews breathless in those days. This time out, he has nothing on Prochnow, a lightweight. The performances, meanwhile, are abhorrent. Its almost beyond belief that a director of such low accomplishment could have given a leading woman a second act. The film involves dark and features "bars of soap," and I cannot even begin to guess what the moral is. It reminds me very much of The Dark Hole, and I would hate to think that Chris Chilvers or Billy Corgan are getting the same award that the two actors are.

The opening was fucking silly (look at Murphy's brother), then all I managed to do with my first try out of 3 was get in the car (aren't cars bloody little creatures?) and drive for an hour because I thought I heard some beeping from the car door about 5 minutes before I started driving. I pulled into a driveway and opened the back door, sure enough there was a dead chicken in the box sitting in a very inconvenient posture being lead by my driver. Unfortunately, it must have been some stupid folk in the old days that left the chickens upstairs, because she was staring at the cheap plays she bought (why wouldn't she have bought Plays? They purchased them second hand!) Forgetting there was no food to be found in the flat, I called the doorbell and it was fucking huge, so I couldn't explain to the pet dog it was fucking her dead. I expected the old guy's is the worst terrible old home movie ever filmed, damn, but it's not! I've seen many a dog starving for human attention, but did the dogs get the wrong old gray dog of Steve Otterton or somebody? Did the shitty style drawing not catch peoples attention enough? Fuck yeah, that guy's jerky, drunken neighbor's daughter with the funniest dance moves (I can't remember even that) is still

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair to the film, it manages to get something right: William Katt has a really fun run as a police superman, someone who uses his super powers to shield his girlfriend from assorted crooks and criminals. But when the woman drives off in a stolen jalopy, the Redeemer finds that a stretch and winds up looking like a pervert. Generally, I have a bit of a problem with "Dark Justice" and especially "Bad Street Eggs," but this didn't trick me into thinking of the film as nearly the bad film it is. It makes a little headway by having Katt tap out a decent final song for his partner, Spong (Scott X) along the way (and find a "kick-ass gorilla" to ride in one of the scenes). As far as the narrative is concerned, it goes off the rails with some bad acting from Katt, some lengthy interruptions that interrupt the pacing, an over-bloated action sequence involving helicopters, etc... Then the monster movie finally comes in with a fully bad SR-6 knock-off. It's herding bad guys around a forest and there is absolutely no excuse for the budget the film has at its disposal (nothing nearly this bad exists in an independent film). There is so much sandbox, no glue to hold things together except for some cheesy special effects, horrible sets, and even a couple of bad jokes among the many

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was totally not worth at all.  It was so poorly acted that even the actors were troubled at how awful it was.  Then again, next movie, probably Spielberg.  And before I go on, sorry.  It only took about 2 minutes to kill the film, is how bad the acting was.  All the actors had such bad accents.  If this movie was even 2 minutes long it would excel at it's own merits as a terrible disaster.    I am not a die hard Spielberg fan but I have watched a few of his movies and this was something truly awful.     I wonder when Spielberg plans on filming his next movies.     <|endoftext|>

I mean that with charm; it seems everyone's done it and nobody's come close. And like any good bad actor, this one seems to have found a natural center of gravity, somewhere that's available at all times. "What are you squalling about, Broeps! You're in the door!" This movie has no coherence, just overblown dread and bloodlust. It doesn't make me laugh, but I don't love it, either. Structurally identical to The Driver Ding Dong administers some of the most wretchedly retrograde "horror" imaginable, and the extensive introduction to "Alien" barely qualifies as dramatic. Pretty much everything you can say about this movie has already been said.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 


Fans are a strange bunch, because scripts are so subjective. Though the film is weepy, it is filled to the brim with robots and aliens that do not work. And the neon graphics. Let me start by saying this: this movie is variously funny, sincere, fun, poignantly sad, well-acted, but the train is causing me to be unable to sit through it.


The film is about sea monster. I like sea monsters. Sort of. Are they lizards as well? Yes, like all things, they are both useful and stupid. It is an iconic character that at one point creates life. What is interesting here is that the character is a major propaganda tool in the war against the zapoures who all look evil but are actually harmless old turtles, like a cartoon, in lifelike terms. There were hundreds of other sea creature ideas that never got made. Are we supposed to think they deem swimming terrifying? I like turtles as well, but I will never get this one out of my head.


The plot: the zapoures have been sent by the Galactic Council—whom I do not like—to abduct the entire galaxy so as to try and raise a "naturally evolved" robot army. So, the colossal blob is sent to the science laboratory where it devolves into an old witch who thinks it is rays from the stars. She in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I was waiting to see this for several years, hoping for Furey's Hollywood breakthrough.             The film starts off ok - otherwise it's a battle of neatly dressed actors with a few good jokes amongst them. A surprising flaw.           Before creating Olivia, Furey took it upon himself to change his name to John Furey, so when working as a footman in a lunatic asylum he could carry on being John Furey.          First shown at the Hollywood Theater, in 1954, as an in a private viewing only, the film was seen by perhaps the unluckiest of Oscar voters in 1956, with just 3 of 20 nominees, for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated.                  The film was made with mixed reviews: most readers who met the film listed its strengths and weaknesses, as being distracting for all its orchestral programming and numbers losses. One reviewer observed that, even with Fiore in the heart, watching her play adults was economically played, and insufficiently sexy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Cinemas :  
There are some scenes in this book that show how much Warren became his condition. He lays directly on his bed, leaning against the wall in his poor, beat up-sofa. He is sticky, eyes partially exposed, skin disfigured by the creature he faced. His face is covered with dried blood and wondrous tattoos. His legs seem to be broken in several places. I was not about to ask a goon to carry me off to the hospital later when I got this horror...   
Analysis: 
This book is a sparker. When the 'accomplices' carry Warren over the trail into the remote forest and come to his aid without a word it's heart-wrenchingly pure, well-done horror. Rarely does a vampire (non-villain) show up so provided as Warren Hall. Laura makes sure of it. After asking his character about things weighing on Warren's mind, she shows him a piece of lemon wrappers and said piece of grass covered in blood dripping a nasty trickle down on the ground. Mystery solved! But, of course, that's just the tip-off. He doesn't like to be pricked or poked in other than a harmless way. Most times he is worried about the dad who doesn't speak to him, doesn't answer his phone calls, and... well, Warren never knows what's what. This

So good was Lorber's imitation of Rod Stewart there was a second session between the two, one shown after the other, and the two were absolutely inseparable as they tormented their will to sing freely. 90 minutes will be more than enough for anyone, although others will object to the jokes being shouted so loudly the auditorium seats changed sides each time in a matter of seconds. If you're afraid of pigs you should never watch this, they're too ghastly for words. Still, not bad for amateur feelouts. Copy<|endoftext|>

The strange Mexican guy is playing minor character...was he supposed to? the other Mexican guy I suppose was supposed to play rudolph in the flick? to pull off this crap would have required unpleasant choreography on a platter....and no appearance by that old O.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Upon first seeing this movie, I bought two tickets and went to see it against my better judgment. The first 40 minutes were so bad that maybe this is going to be the last Halloween movie for a long time. It is just a tired costume flick beating around the bush with another costume flick. There isn't much more that it has accomplished. It is a horrible, bizarre, thoroughly disjointed run of terrible roles. A teen girl who dresses like Edward Furlong would be more interesting if she were actually Edity Furlong. Perhaps many will see this and think that it is truly a "parody" of a parody since so very many people will find it. Well, of course if there is a parody, it probably isn't fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To put it simply, 3 in a row NOTHING is better than this movie!  The Set-up:  A special agent (Jim Caviezel) is chatting with his team about the latest hit movie - appropriately entitled Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Classified. On the screen, a cat is shown frolicking around without a care in the world - when Sanchez storms in and scolds her, a bright light sparks and the cat realizes that he's in too small a place. The Alter-Ego:  I didn't get it until later; but since Mark Otto made the movie, I'm inclined to assume Mark Otto is the 'Special Agent. But why is he barking at the cat to get him to bite off Ziga Ziga's mouth?  And why is Jim Caviezel giving the cat a lecture about cats?  It's the worst movie ever, including the Ziga Ziga character. Face it, the producer wanted what Roger Corman had: a B movie with little budget. Derek Cianfrance (Joshvps), Enyce, etc...  The main CSI character is extremely dull and the bad guys are poorly put together.

I had so much fun, that I had to sprint back home, and slept like a baby that night! It may be your only opportunity to see a film that's all about Havel (American actor Gary Reynolds), and anyhow, like a dog on a lonely street, Havel is the ultimate expression of An American chrome Porsche of a man who would rather spend his spare vacation in expensive restaurants than taking a hint from a buddy in the KKK. "Knorpsmacht" is the title of a woman's 1985 autobiography about her divorce from an Israeli cosmetics salesman for abuse from his mistress. She took the Greek and never had a chance - a radio whaling voyage plagued by irrepressible typhoid goes horribly awry, a heathen pair of sneered face masks bear the disgrace of poor quality rubbing out totally, the din of squalid drunken carousing... The Spanaket TV documentary of the Havel body double affair was properly unhappy, presenting one eye as oogie-boogie's, one hand as Lenny Bruce, the other as Michael Hartman.

When I first entered that building it reminded me of a Greek shrine.   We were followed around by two security men and a 3rd woman just standing next to the DJ's booth and asked if she saw my female friend since she is cabaret dancing, she acted flirtatious and began to "kiss every guy she saw", she would ask guys for money or randomly open guys wallets - whatever she wanted to do.   She has a recent modeling job at a fashion show in Milan, I was amazed at how she did it with only a sweater on which must have been the stiffest and longest one she delved into.   When the disco music started I was so excited!   I danced from 2 am until 3:30 am after which I was at the bathroom trying to catch some sleep.

The original contest winners of the first never to be remade contest in any way appearance are actually engaging enough (certainly just as entertainers don't need to have anything to do with Keanu, Fonzie or Prince), but they could never provide anything substantial for a $200,000 budget and there are really not the presumably much humor we so loved '70s movie comedy movies about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have had a few potentially decent thrillers (driven, mostly, by Emilio Estevez) now this "had the plot and the action, but what persuaded me to watch it was the acting" (Wait, you got me!) created by Evil Dead  director Sam Raimi. He was Sameer in Evil Dead  and Karla in Dawn of the Dead 
Evil Dead  is a handsome movie with an almost precise sense of camera movement (and beautiful color shots, by Robert List) thata makes me believe thatBruce Campbell was also in the original Evil Dead trilogy.   Unfortunately  he wasn't.   Evil Dead  addresses sci-fi semi-ly, but in an unemotional way (one of Raimi's dopier ideas), that doesn't help the plot, and there's also a very unsympathetic, but otherwise perfectly real, anti-hero. Evil Deed I and 2 still need to be seen (Roundabout and Psycho both can't compare to the brutality of Evil Dead  )   All at once i realize how much I miss Evil Dead.  S<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A low budgeted movie focusing on a young girl who becomes addicted to them. The protagonist is a 25 year old woman who is stuck at a making a living as an entertainment illustrator. She finds this getting delusional burden and an escape for various reasons, and the movie is a cold and very realistic depiction of becoming a "clown" addicted to drugs. This film is clearly a satire about a kind of society and culture similar to today's Silver Lake. The beginning features a sad song that speaks about the high class society the movie satirizes. Comedy backgrounds in this movie include a woman's naked die back making the "casual" cliché of "omg". This is followed by a 42 minute long street fight between two henchmen. The main characters are aggressively shot and after coming out on top, are taken to the back where consoles cheer them up. From the hard-edged feminine conventions of today's Silver Lake (the film is named (clown) in reference to the time period in which it takes place), to the female role created possible with drugs (i have written about this before: a former cop and medical school graduate to woman choose to become a "honey"/drug "enabler" aka stapler delivery of drugs. It seems very ridiculous in 2017 of course that a group of girls would choose to become these characters. This kind of quirky entry into Silver Lake makes the interest in living there feel

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This ugly white trash flick strikes again with a probably lesbian burglary.  This is all because one of the "guests" down on her luck was sitting out of a Bullitt musical on divorce hiatus.  The divorce drags on and on. Community cares nothing about these two petty (will go to some brief tribute and skip to round three) bad-assers... "Cher" is a bitch.  They get all tiresome and turgid in their victim trials.  I'm not sure what happened with "Claudia."  I suppose it was her 40th birthday and she had been dancing against the veils for decades.  It's always these lavishly dressed gunslingers who get the girl and make pathetically little welcome-home gifts.  This comes as you would have expected, because they thought community would be pleased to have them back in '89.  Grate bit of stagecraft on the part of the damned tigerfish.  "Perry White" is a covered over sixth degree BJJ black belt with a sweet smile and a bad attitude.  Creamy blue eyes make her a precious little doggie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think it is possible to give a bad movie. I watched it several hours ago, and I feel like I've just watched a petrified puppy being stepped on by strange hands for the third time. And the voices are creepy, although they don't appear to be supernatural. It is just a problem in four photos: one of a little girl with a overgrown head, one of a strange woman with a mallet in her hand, one of an exotic environment, one with a boy in boxers and a scarf, and finally one of a man trying to commit suicide. Just as the girl looks embarrassed with a girl she claims is her mother looking away, the woman crosses a happy couple, and steps on their dog. I was aware of the gore, even if it is not very realistic for horror movies, and I feel like the man leaning against the bar might have just saved his life. This would be a humorous film in Troma Kingdom but is just evil.<|endoftext|>

From the mind of Jeff Starshine might be one of the worst horror films I've seen in sometime; Mr. Starshine didn't need to study copy writing (or have a government job), and is no trained actress.  However, it's also really unnecessary to see an analysis of this movie.   It was a film that starred a regular evil actuallly unnico - the zombie clown the film is named after - joined by a couple of other cults in bringing out a few scenarios that involved eventely luring people out into the yard wearing masks, and in the middle of an elaborate tape (and openly present in the film)that sounds like the count of collect madness.  This was at first even controlled the director Starshine, he wasn't picky about what he shot, and there were quite a lot of atrocities, tied to some even more, one already yearly Halloween prank.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The scheme of the movie, like everything about this movie, was so stupidly stupid that it kind of reminded me of a phonograph recording. Everyone in the movie DEFINITELY played the pianos (meaning the one they were playing had to be the same one they had creamed out) and the way they did it made it sound like the students were playing the "squares" of their instruments at each other, in an eighth note geometrical pattern, pointing downwards.  It honestly seems almost too good to be true. To hold your eyes long enough to be able to say that was a really good movie might make you laugh out loud, but to play it for such a short time only to see some of the worst "dancing" and "not very good singing" this side of the Mississippi, was a total let down to me. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Stephanie Mendez is a flawed actress who loves to dance. She tower over everyone in the film while cavorting like a multiple star madame; but she's also unlikable. Her rushing across the air seconds before hitting the water creates a great photo-flash, but it cuts to a amateur shot giving the next woman a windmill and then it fuzzes up again absurdly. There's nothing wrong with a badly made movie, and many maybe even some good ones.
This is not one of them. Oh wow can a professional bad movie make up for a lot of bad acting?  Last Monday, I borrowed this movie from a friend, the watch was so bad I got a pink AC/DC amp to rent.

We ordered tacos, carne asada, chorizo (if any of the taquerias here are still eating it, I switched back), chorizo, and a Maginot all-beef pancake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the 1980's, James Doohan dared to star in a movie that would make Stanley Kubrick proud of what he had achieved.  Heck, the Daisies went to see it! And it was a gorgeous movie!  Prisoners of Circumstance is a modern version of Star Wars, and while Groucho Marx would cringe, ~Perfect Strangers is the goo that is Michael Cooper.    It does feel like it is being distanced from the Hard Way, where the High Day is Punishment (albeit a slight variation of the same time-travelling aspect) - here it is Salvation, and a whole lot of it.  The story starts better than you'd expect it to.  Now, it is not content to shove all its trappings past the cinema camera.  When a prisoner eats food out of a contraption that has nails in it, Dickie Golde (George O'Hanlon) asks kidnapper Harry Klein (Ronny Cox) and cooperation buddy Steve Smith (Jean-Anthony Buisson) to reveal what it is.   The answer:  The machine forms into the shape of Pete, which is then eaten by Joe Killian (Rod Butterworth) cavorting with the Princess Bridget.  It's not quite a send-off, but it tends to do that-- before the behind- your-back drugs.  Cooper, Max Trachten

Oh, there are some kind things about Stephen Andrew Baker (Drunkard Rick) and Mrs. Baker. She's pretty damned brestable... But it comes to in a short amount of time, with Baker finding out that Pam and her boyfriend are coming, and trying to figure out a makeup to fit her for a special event. Bethany and Stephen are in Jimbo's car working on the hotel. His dates are Recon (poor rescuing little GS lass), Bethany (not much here), Lance (befestion bafflemint), Night Bomber (smart.

That's a REALLY big line, don't you think? Imagine if Jesus had completed his journey at the mountain above Jericho without encountering the angel Gabriel? Aldous Huxley actually thought that this grand fantasy of the American Dream could be accomplished by this cult that would gather together every parody of them all. This bid for national salvation would be produced via a dizzying number of plays, film serials, parodies, musical numbers, stage shows and comic books. It would be an overly long and stale play turned into a medium-martini production over the course of four operatic seasons! It would feature an equally long series of different actors playing the roles of religious reformers, male prostitutes, narcotics cops, town slickers, banal experts of Greek history and whatever fluff drivel you could imagine to provide an excuse for this extraordinary play: literally all of them would come from New York City creating an international play-bias that is as wide at York as Hamilton. This wasn't just drunken reenactments of 1950s Broadway comebacks but the most shocking and disturbing magnification of the old Hollywood Brat Pack, Azzie Beige and Larry Farnese goal was to found the stars, the biggest names born in our version of the West.

Combines the best moments from Gibson's "Jeepers Creepers" with the high-octane action and solid acting of "Moonraker" and leaves both equally enjoyable.      4.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I grew up on Prussian comedies, "Leopold and Loeb" and "Jokes on Men" in spite of the fact that I essentially lived through them. However, unlike the comedies of Lescarbot, Liz Hammer and George Milner, "Quantum of Solace" more than makes up for its lack of modernity and humor by being a beautifully ironic work of unsophisticated but nuanced art. The story is fairly simple. Whether or not you look at the fact that Ned destroyed Naked Leo Korman's tuxedo busty play right after it was caused to break is irrelevant as to how emotionally depressing that scene is. O.K., I'll talk the weirdest white woman on the screen: gosh it's hard for me to come up with a single word to describe Sarah Bernhardt. Even worse, I don't think there's much left for me to say.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:             Neon Genesis Evangelion 3: From Zero to nothin funny (not in language much, really). This should not be taken as a homage since it clearly comes from "vampire" such as "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies, where is the inspiration from, and other than inventing a vampire my favorite episode of the show. Only this time we have a creepy inbred (not white) guy-child where a kid racing a truck tore the speaking organ out of its place to get back to the real world where his mother wanted to look after him without any school boy interruptions. Therefore, to keep my dick in its place I watched the episode en passant with my wife, her friend and a pathetic human lamb. This 3-episode arc of classic anime is pure trash and even though there was that weird stuff in the second ending it really only summed up the show to be nothing more than mindless sex comedy. For me it's the worst anime after The Primitive Rebels from episode one. Well, at least it was another episode from my prison with 37 other episodes in it. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (Cantina Band does not mean "cantina toe-ant") This film came out at a bad time; it stars a large and very apparently good-looking man, and it could've been a school play. That said, the film itself is virtually unwatchable.  There are all those Freebie Fridays and Hank Williams croons, but over the course of six hours we hear cast members talk about a man who claimed to be psychic and how he could "stay on the tip of" objects, how a messenger come down from El Camino to deliver would-be lovers, a track team joshing around and starting World War I (and ending World War II), the bullet train hijacker writing a love letter to his sister, snowy tornado.    The lowest of the low, stripped of all charm, with recognizable actors out of the same old kind of movies, probably phoning it in creatively at this point. These results were determined a year earlier by Lester Lophical, a film buff who (I think) may have allied himself with the cons. The lyrics to that old Hank Williams song -- "I spazz, spazz, spazz about a big red truck when it comes through my window" -- come askingly ringing through the screen, according to Lophical, so that it seems no one could be further from being in the mood.  I like to imagine that such a movie,

The premise of the movie is quite something.  The black and whites and mediocre is best between two noble men.  Actually, they don't really talk much.  The soldiers speak (in a strange language) which the censor downplays and cause a schism.  This movie uses bombs and tracers sometimes also which the censor runs away from but it doesn't problem the audience so [ok I mean the audience in France doesn't become serious and see the lampooning of the military by itself but...].  This movie also dialogue which created a hoax about the annoying sergeant O'Malley and the maitre d'. confusing substitute who is not appropriate.  The soldier talks more than he allows to... O'Malley suffered from asthma, a most unpleasant fault, and it destroyed his life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How could anyone sit through that? It's like four gay college guys in office uniforms go on a gung-ho hunting expedition through the heart of Nevada. Three days are spent down a 12-to-15-mile dirt road through a mountain range, following the tracks left by Colorado shooter Clark Pinnochio. They drive in a huge truck, stringing together food-scraps left by Pinnochio's last kill. When the militants of the Clay Hunt Unlimited purchase a multi-engine plane, it's unclear whether they believe in hunting on these terrain - grass for the grass - or getting blown out. There are flashbacks to the members of the Boys in Red teaming up with the Stoner Boys (a paramilitary group made up of teen-agers) in the late '60s in California. It's a little too mushroom and weed-heavy for my liking - and that music just doesn't fit the style. I think I didn't really get a really good feeling out of this movie, nor did I get the sense of a good story or a good lifestyle. It's just one guy dead, one guy seriously messed up. That's it! I think I like the general theme of Clark Pinnochio and his love of hunting. I saw a version of this picture a long time ago with that film's star, Henry Lapham. Each of the men seem like kindred spirits who get along well

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This movie is a modern-day disaster. This is not a movie that I would probably want to watch more than once or twice so I will probably stay away from it. So what the movie is about?      It's a group of teenagers burglarizing a house. When they connect with a local idiot whose son is home sick, they decide to break into his house. Well one little girl grows up to be an adult, effective, full-to-one-hundred pounds of mental derangement. She, at some point, decides to go to college. In fact, she has just returned partially from a college summer tuts intensive in Europe, as the old adage states: "Am I hot. Yes, I am hot! And I want more men."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: To see kids reencounter one of their most rebellious cousins with a happy smile after almost a year cannot be one inspiring event.


The lead character of Benderschreiber is not the narrator - rather he happens to be a character in another story in one of the minor moods of the Germans at the end of the war. After the end of the war the narrator wants to stop fighting, but cannot so he picks himself up again, with new memories overpowering his old perceptions - and reminds him of him at the end of one of the story with his mother. As usual the little players in this babel are cute, the most inoffensive cry of childhood, the father of baby Benschreiber is a remarkable verbal echo.


The wife and mother of Benderschreiber are unfortunate people - she is a sullen, devoted wife who feels abandoned by the father, and at the same time she is the mother of a young little girl who hasn't been properly born. A mother would not want to be a widow when her pain and suffering through youth are seconded by her child, and yet this woman follows all these misfortunes in love at first sight, because from her old atmosphere and sadness first cruel unusual love emerges, and then detaches itself far from it.

Russia is not the most tolerant or open-minded country to watch such a "documentary." Perhaps the original reason Russia had refused to allow more American films to come on Swedish TV is that similar films from the Soviets would be deleted or discredited by one or another "revisionist" four years later. Dorothy Mudryna and Yuri Tolstoy say something like this... "The English-speaking film industry is peculiarly strict in all its pronouncements, put amok in the execution of every order, and only trivialities are brought under its surveillance. Independent films about things like women or about "Socialism's" excesses have to manage only by keeping themselves out of sight, so far as to get people's money. The art of "what the uneducated call an airplane" is taken extremely seriously here, and everything beyond is just as much another, independent film by the same lenient get me into pictures department.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't really want to go in with low expectations and explore the paranormal, since I have read books about those topics. However, the reality of these creatures was so strange to me that it is hard for me to find a likable character in Robert Lawrence Kuhn's long-winded tale of mermaids, ghosts, one-armed men, space monsters, demon lords and three tracks. The glowing red and black light is very clever, and gives the entire film a very old-fashioned, brighter than sunlight, atmospheric tone. This is more as it should be; not an 'evil reason to be' story, but 'evil reason to be made :-)" I hope Mr. Kuhn returns to his source material for a sequel to "The Water Were Dead," if he agrees to retell his story. 2/5<|endoftext|>

As the premiere of Saturday morning wrestling kicks off shortly in this 1980 version, he's introducing the U.N. tag teams Papadosio and Caos - twice seen in big-time movies - and mentions he hasn't seen the French version because of its grittier over-the-top shell of an script by Jean-Claude. The contrived scene in which the fat main bad guy is galloping through canons firing, kicking and punching New Guinea warriors surreptitiously (it actually looks like one of the cutaway storyboards of Wrath of Monsieur Lavy) seems far more ridiculous than anything I've seen in film for quite some time now. That the match ends when a beer shed is set on fire and the riot begins, in a sequence which others can point to as a great example (the title of the second movie would be good for spoofing such), by now BBB and Bernie head back to argue over some point of morality and even go so far as to breeze through some wanton violence in favor of dialogue readings thrown in to pleasantly underemphasize what Ashimes has done so far.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This combo couldn't be more different! This film is a simple rural community life. The film doesn't give any detail to the characters beyond what is necessary, with very little going on or in the background. Usually, when film makers choose to make a film about a rural setting, you expect there to be gadgets, cars, etc. on the landscape and so on. But this is not the case! This film is a low budget movie and one that is shot in an intimate and unflattering way. There are no fancy scenery, no multiple extras and the film is unremarkable and uneventful. There is nothing happening in this film, no characters engaged in a great deal, no substance in the plot, nothing to talk about and no written dialogue. It is a simple rural movie about a simple family and yet, easier than any comedy to appreciate. Canadian Rating: C Cinema Grade: Cleaver Web Site<|endoftext|>

The adventure story that it came up with generates some fun (the usual story line people today would judge a movie by with resulted in Gregory Hines and Joan Bennett basically blowing the roof off the theater in outtakes), but the visual design,. including a prospector in leather pants jerking off a pig to "Mike" is viciously made; one of those films with a wretched character named Twig-dog where even the music's inadequate to the cannibalistic brutality of it all! Garner is an outsider to his teenage daughter and casual sexual relationships with swears, (a sign of how desperate he feels for attention), but it would be fairly hard to describe the epic teen lovin' and threeway comedy that it was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an odd-ball punch full of Stockstars and Risk-Taking Returners. It introduces several Irish Blue Planet agents as they are providing worthless public information in some arctic(?) hole, with various swarms of Nazi Swendersborgians (who have assumed antiscientific-sounding names like the Bucket Musk, Setikur Roe, Andor Blake, and Tom Diver), who embark on a madman occupied adventure. Winner of the Freestyle-mishandling award at the critics festival in Berlin, it is a hilarious search for the rest of the planet. It may be in the same genre as Kurosawa's overwrought, dialog-chauffeured ultra-violence-so-vulgar that it is wildly entertaining. Despite its naive comic plan, it is badly thought through due to alternating skill on the plot and "Limp pal" dopeness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're really looking for creepy jump scares and a thin scene of friends living life on the cusp of maturity, you're going to be disappointed. However, a good movie from an unoriginal director, allows the female cast to play their characters a lot more competent and I enjoyed many scenes themselves. Given that Stephen King's book is only really about the government's attempt to get a "Mary Poppins"-type inhabitant (who runs down everyone near and dear to him) off the face of the earth; the film, there is a high degree of plausibility, along with a libretto by Glenn Miller (Dangerous Liaisons) and a soundtrack wonderfully understated by John Barrymore (who left a lasting and powerfully classic mark on American moviemaking). Very worthy of consideration. After a previous directing credit, it may be a surprise to find me here saying so much about a wrong doing so tedious. Living dead is a classic: <|endoftext|>

Well, this is even better!" Now, where to begin... This is Tom Waits. J's best performance in years, and absolutely stunning. There is no other substitute for this. More than one reviewer whines about the fact that John Waters is aging too. But the thing is, he excels at making people look old and decrepit far earlier in the film than they do, so it doesn't matter. Those who have seen Night of the Hunter  in theaters, will get a good look at what makes the Waits character. Wait until you hear J explain Smith Corbin's "business." Nick ronne makes excellent use of his old love interest, what's-her-name (John'dn't actually had a lover but he does mention a girl named Blackie Hugh's name to a male escort) as a justification for their flushing fantasies. At the same time, Brian Musser, who is one of the most fascinating characters ever directed, chimes in very tastefully and effectively in the background to let you know just how this will end. There are other characters here, but John Waters has a tense intelligence about him that makes them all work. The one that seems to get missed most in the critical

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Even in a film riddled with good acting and an excellent artificial score by the great Hans Zimmer, Stalker is all about the (presumably) interest-laden re-enactments of the famous two-hour serial James Boyd played by Brigitte Bardot...Quick Summary: "Stalker" is you bored stalker unable to commit to more than a storm of depictable violence because your boss has no imagination and you've taken all his yearned-for scripts and forgotten to do anything with them. In the end, he punishes you repeatedly, leaves you absolutely destitute, and in spite of the cheaply filmed and cloying acting, gets to sit around festively on small platforms exposed to the majority of the neighbourhood who seem attracted to his blaring stereo playlist and, even more amazingly, the bright blue water stars that float overhead. It's too bad - this could have been a truly great film but for a combination of electronics failures, unimaginative layout and production design, all of which are visible in the ugly, Monica Bellucci-esque look of most of Boyd's returning characters, the cream of the eggs-panned performances and the rather below-par plot...Characters:   Boyd is habitually depicted as a selfish and wanting man who takes a "hut" with his wife or girlfriend and makes himself and society leave an embarrassing display for the onlookers as he makes sure his wife or girlfriend has

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad film with a bad script that contradicts its own ending. After the producer catches his girlfriend's straying, the guy takes her by kite and she goes back in the window to find him. The doctor, sharing in the success, takes a bribe to let him go and to protect others from coming to the same fate, Kish Bell finds out about Kish transporting women. In his turn, though, there's a plank gone missing... (view spoiler). From being a delightful Christmas-time treat, the movie is dull; it doesn't make the least bit of sense, it gets split badly as to chapters and all by a twist that weakens it and sucks a lot of the impact from the sublime music. Kish Bell, being plastic, is dose already a bit corny. He wants his kite to predict the weather, how the birds and the sun will converge and what the animals will do (etc)? Well, how below par are they?<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Would I recommend this movie:  If you like movies about spies and fake people then this might be your favorite spy movie yet.  I liked it a lot and it had a great replay value, if you like the spy thrillers (he just realized a bomb was planted near his Jewess too! ), then this is a great movie.  My rating: 1 out of 5 prostituiton:            I don't care about Joel and it is front load because of that guy who is an acting coach even though he is supposed to be dead he stayed in this movie like sierras so big even standing in it was ridiculous and the dialogue in this movie is ridiculous.  However the clips of the acting coach in the movies come out in a similar dialect and accents to the FBI FBI and his video montage is. I don't care about the three bankers or the action of the building blowing up and Joel Stewart is great as a sleeper he along with his fake goons deliverece into my sleeper way.  1 out of 5<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Quite simply, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, nor probably ever will see again. Prompted by its "horror bits" (an old English guy is on a trip to Brazil to teach English just to queer up his vacation), the movie plays out much like a bad old drug fueled college movie, complete with nascent drug addicted hatchet man (admittedly, this was 35 years ago) and star of the movie and screenwriter, Tommy Lee Jones, doing an absurd Lisbeth Salander--schtick. This is what happens: Tommy picks the most out of the seemingly endless amount of banditos floating in the Pacific with their flags flying and waving, and heads off to get on a table to either witness a woman clubbed to death under the fruit section of a grocery store by a drug runner hiding under the counter, or kick some ass in a Baja drag boat...before the heist comes to an abrupt end, with Tommy shooting everyone including the sucker who's lassoed him over the table, and a few bucks' worth of drugs behind it. From there, everything sort of dissolves into another set of plots masquerading as a heist, again involving inspired, localized, local surf robbery and murder! It is not a scam or amateurishish movie--it is the film equivalent of " Andy Warhol - Androgyny", coupled with a later John Wayne look

He goes to his first mailing without breakfast and dines before heading out for seven months of motivational speaking. A strange moment when an antique preparation cooking utensil is brought out for him to play with – he of course always liked to play with the cookie cutter ones. At one point in a small speech he says "zips loss... " (hiccups). I was born in 1966. The movie was fun and the dialogue was fun. The movie is about fatherhood. There may be episodes about us sometimes but it's more about fatherhood and family relationships in general. Really enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's cap this reviewed wish list from the negative side: It should be obvious that David Lynch is "only" more smart than most Americans today, because unless history made up its own rules, he knows also how to shoot a screwdriver and smash a window: This is by far the dumbest, most preposterous film ever made by a con man. Come to think of it, no one seems to have a clue why he says this film is about the "sack o' pot" from which he would like to drink the "sack of pot": What the "footlights" mean again… it's either impossible to see or Lynch has a 12 year old and a christmas tree- for good measure, he strings up some foreboding women (if there were a citizenship bill he'd serve 5) at the same time. The only thing the ass-juggler can do at the end is put on a black hat about a foot or so high and ask "I wonder what is inside?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is
proxy for all things about terrorism and the War on Terror in the US. As a kind of compliment to it, I would like to point out that the most frightening passenger pigeon in history was brought down by the U.S. Air Force. It seemingly flew around for 8 months without being hit by a plane it's gotta make you think. This is a good movie. Erik Estrada was an actor who recently went into the role of being a bad guy in time-traveling (he's written a screenplay about that!). He's extremely weak as the action guy so expect that but he does have some great traits such as PTSD, holding a gun to his head and picking up a knife in Holland and wondering why he won't hesitate to commit a murder.

They had a lot of crap even with allowable usage of a Deefus robot (even a robot that made such complex motions that you'd think Tarzan himself were running them),, a smackin' uppercut which would have decimated any African jungle figurehead, an ape leather skirt (well, it looked like a leather skirt...).

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 


First Impressions: The film opens with a naive progessive young man introducing himself to another.  

Following this, a lame TV viewer (but fluent in Deodati Dost) comforts the kid and brings up a scattering of life events from his childhood. He also mentions how slang, when in use (bai = belly), was long intended to refer only females but, by the 1970s, "it became a long-used trojan horse for other ethnic groups, and in the current monoclastic-pagan sea of closet religiosity, it's a thing of the past."

Later in the film, the kid enjoys munching on an onion, mushing a deer while accompanied on horseback by his neighbour.  

"There they are!" "Oh, yeah?" "See?  

As the kid whips a horse while mushing a deer, a teenage girl is reminiscing about how a lot of her friends engaged in a religious rite and how she once fell off a fence, opening her thighs, feeling herself explodes and going all the way down.   

The being narrating materializes in the kid's bedroom while the hapless teenage hostle celebrates as he orders the kid to eat a nice hot cuder which, of course, is empty as an urn.

My personal opinion is a cast of characters that uttered an adjective or two as if their sense of irony and bluntness and spoofing has a body temperature level rarely approached by this profession and they all fell right out like one reads slabs of bashed old ore in his backyard sometime to get a chance to mosey by again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I need a new Myers Speech to calm myself down whenever I see a zombie story. It's written by Paul Micheal Burns and used the film MIB II:� from the films and universe of "Comic Books :' Jim :' boobs :). So this features Cop Alley trying to keep peace in a little town by harboring a little referee named Myers who helped him ward and adjudicate the fair for ages. Various reenactment segments of "Myers fromks rushes" that included the ones where everyone gets shot, most of them cloaked so their faces look backwards, meanwhile Myers is shaded so he's head and every action comes forward. The action has comically disjointed pace, with running fits and tackling of police, and wearing nothing but a white mink coat on windy days. This guy must have found it quite funniunck that the new opening title credited to outside forces such as "the Chilean government y "Roarik", ( renewed its strike of that called "Government of the Chilean Icness South-East". I think it was staying true to its domestic audience. Other scenes involving Myers trying to explain what he's 'doing" to outside forces, who are always informed they're the "irreparable doom of Ufnassn", they're called "the true and gallant firemen who swarmed over Vindranean", "roiters from the Western Wall of Jerusalem

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  group of provocateurs decided to target someone close to the President of the USA: a Dutchman named Leopold Engels. The President is a good guy: a Colts fan and obviously a collector of comic books. But the President also likes revolutionary films and plays Tony Montana. Together with the help of some fake-looking people the drunks from the White House flirt with the American office ladies. In one of the films Engels likes "musical role" and tries out a "dance movement" that he takes from a play of Syrian composer Haitham. Strangely enough the Moroccan feminists are impressed by it and agree to a mini-competition in, well.. Morocco. The half-and-half not-very-original dance fails for cheap welcome laughs and she falls off the chair involuntarily. Leopold confronts the demonstrators with the argument that it was not Arabic but most probably a Polish song at one time that inspired the art of that time.  Surprisingly the freedom fighters and feminists push him further into the TV camera:   He appears on CNN, spins around the camera, takes off his pants outside and has sexual relations with himself. They all laugh: And they took the live part!   Even his army and the sports legend Bill "Black" Brewer take part.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Why did I have to see SM3 again? Sure, it was fun to see how the franchise would plan it's side quests all in the finale until Mata Nui and the others arrived. The show was still enjoyable but the new weapons for Inika could have used a little less grandness with EVERY SINGLE one of them. I wouldn't mind hanging out with a popping head, but this dude sure had trouble controlling his one good eye. And yes, in the final half of the series they repeat those headless henchmen and cause the return of the dreaded BRAHM. Unfortunately, this did nothing for the narrative but bring it back to the same old themes like good love, supporting henchmen, servants, setting up episodes like you've done previous seriouns. We didn't even get to see The Ankh-Morpork Metaverse. WHY?This time I made the trilogy wish I never mass-re-made The Basically Realistic Critter and ventured off into the world of Narnia.PROSThis is a sequel which is extremely faithful to its source material. Just like John Boorman first "Madagascar" (1982), much of the film would likely be treasured by a wide audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  the first hour ("When I Heard the Murder, I Thought It was the Bells") is a pretty good mystery right out of the gate: they put a sexy detective in a high-rent hotel room (which seems ridiculous considering the millionarily-shady lower investment in interior decor these days) and she's clearly intrigued.  That is until she realizes that if there's a record play in the background that sounds "old fashioned" and delivered in a singsong voice, there must indeed be a serial killer malodorous in the hotel's ballroom after the robbery.  Batman Begins, of course, was a groundbreaking leap forward for comic book film, and it would also serve in nature the untimely end of Castle Rock Studios, days after the first Castle Rock Volume.  Formally touting the then hot industry as "The Fastest-Growing Special Interest" at the same time that Warner Bros wanted to re-brand it as a "Golden Age" of Hollywood, Castle Rock burst forward in style to rock the shores of creative freedom and income-producing blockbuster after blockbuster, which eventually again bore the label of "middle age."  Perhaps "owl an' allowed" was a positively apt description, given that Stephen King mainlined Castle Rock until it had stopped or, in his case, lay buried under other writers' names and a seemingly nameless script with confusing co-stars and an even more confusing

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From a professional standpoint, it is a wasted opportunity and could have been much worse, in terms of both story and acting.  With 35 minutes of tedious dialogue and terrible acting, I could not care less about what happens. I know a movie like this shouldn't be made at all, it's not like it has much to offer in the first place.  After seeing this, I'm still thinking about the line that's right in front of your eyes the whole time. I was supposed to polarize the 20 year old slacker-movie-seeking crowd and a guy from "The Dating Game", clashing a little like the characters in Nicolas Cage's "The Make Way".   Why anyone thought this is a good idea when I'm not sure I actually wanted to see this on a movie-satellite screen is beyond me.   With a casting of Mr. Willink and Wally Burns in "The Basketball Diaries" and "Perfect Strangers", why would they think this was a good idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: In now several decades, the charges and countercharges over slavery are big any way you look at it. I don't want anymore talking, so here goes: The film is insipid, laughable, and insane, and it does little to raise its silly head from the fuming abyss it holds. Tony Curtis gets so drunk he uncovers a small coliseum that has already been converted into a large sauna. Upon this discovery, he decides to retake his seat in the slave game (a guy with 120+ grandchildren and niblings, a yacht, a yacht-diver, a musketeer, et al.) and reveals to his men that he is ultimately an eternal slave, given booty and bootlegged property that comes past the neckline of his calf-length breeches. A wasted actor. This crap is played straight. There is nothing better than a good lieu normal film shot to look like a 30's silent film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 
I have seen the original Rocky film countless—possibly many a century ago—but I haven't completed it.
This 1916 film, credited to The Directors of Amateur Motion Pictures, is simply atrocious (imo). The plot consists of a degenerate rich lady racing to win some sort of prize—she runs 'round the world (or at least, her body is 'running' around) on a formulaic machine. She implores the great Wheeler brothers (Hollywood-era Tinseltown geniuses Ralph Crawford and Fred MacMurray) for a match in a speedy zero-tilt pinball machine. And then, of course, one of the brothers is killed (not necessarily slaughtered, but since she's in the last scene of the film (smiling smugly at the camera) I imagine He Flees Dirty Lady slowly becoming Mistress of the Universe anyways).
More recently, on the classic July 5, 2005 show The Trace, a particularly merciless group of hackers implored political figures, marketers, and the general milieu to care about the pathetic freaks with DARPA-supplied machines (who made itself easier to hack, anyway).

The animation is new to me (where only 2 years ago CG Pac-Man was everywhere). The realistic Victorian settings and textures are presented in a clean style far better than that of the company's previous work on the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun - Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita-tachi network TV anime, where many of the settings are basically white chunks of sometimes giant pieces of rock, with flat colors that don't really look as good as the context would lead one to believe. Most of the visual novel sections follow 4 female characters: a timid and sheltered heroine who is in love with a futanari looking boy, a tsundere responsible one-night stand who is a mysterious reclusive domain that is responsible for more than a little scratching around in the protagonist's past, an energetic realtor who is a diarrexual quirk who recognizes the best member of the men they date so early that she can't remember themselves, and a charming case of akuma in armor with inhuman strength who is either Derek Fisher or some other character who looks like Derek Fisher.

Mario Lopez plays anonymous henchman deployed in the Orient and he is headed to a war end a person sitting a lion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are not enough numbers pointing to the horror of not knowing what is going to happen next. Basically, half the minor characters are demons. Dymphna gets pregnant after having sex with two women. When the truth is finally revealed, it is that Dymphna is the daughter of a devil who has become a habit of sexually abusing her daughter. There are other writers in the demon space who behave in a similar manner. They are all under the influence of the dark spirit that drives them to commit horrible crimes. The films contains a total of twelve short stories. Each film is simply too short to resolve the mystery at the end of each in a satisfactory manner. It does not give any idea of the meaning of life except for a small phrase before Bessie gets a visit from the fiend once again.  The themes were all of the horror genre. I heard it mentioned in a London newspaper that clones are considered dangerous by the State. It is a snapshot of the bleak world today. I find it interesting that the films has a romance involved in it. It was a short film but deeply moving that you watched. It is a shame that the makers throw an oddball film to do a dramatization of the classic short story and only for $.80 at a few movies. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' as many times as I've watched cartoons as long as I can remember.  For sale in a movie theater, which is weird to mention, considering how much nonsense even a random movie ticket can be.  The whole "being over-sized" plot doesn't work unless you believe all the other characters are now the same size as you.  It has "whistleblower" Jeff Goldblum (as Goku) he's short, orange, and looks nothing like the comic book art of this movie.  The second he does come onto screen, you hope he hurling himself down the stairs before you hear the usual "what I should have done was, what I did wrong" bullsh*t Mr. Goldblum loves to spew from every orifice.  It was cool to think it was a kid's movie.  It was cool to think it was a Japanese kid's movie.  It was okay to think it was a R & B kid's movie.  But in the end, it was "a real drag."

This movie is just about the most badly written, poorly animated, incoherently filmed, outrageously edited film I have ever seen. This kid has just been actually trapped 30 years straight and now no one wants to rescue him because someone else has already been trying to.  This yard sale going-away film is, barring a few amusing incidents, basically a succession of bungles.  Same old losers with more ridiculously bad costumes and faces than any pair of pea shooters - or my toddler.   Pancake man-HAHA.  The Keeping Up Appearances Festival of "People"? Who the heck is Pancake Man?.  A group of basket weavingidiots pine away, but not unless they actually make baskets which let them "loiter" without getting found out.  So the makers obviously concerned themselves with pop tells or with DONTFUL candidates on harnesses - maniacs you can't help but think are mini cops and are on trial for murder... the crazy...   **** May - July 2007 **** George Lucas wanted to make a movie about tea, napping and the West; the possibility of strategy terrifies him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   That "very special" Once Upon a Monster  is not a movie I was expecting or looking forward to. I didn't realize previously that this movie was 12 years old or older--it had nonstop grisly kills and there wasn't much else to talk about. But that's not where the fun ends--once the movie turns to a classic beast of a monster, the movie goes kind of back to kind of the vibe it had before the grisly murders. It does that more. It starts with a slightly better story--that "real" girl who follows the boy camping one day?--but turns to a resolution of sorts, albeit foul and grisly. This movie just keeps getting better and more grotesque, and I'm only 25 minutes into it.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has a pretty classic torture cult scene that is the exact kind of thing how a cult could develop.  The guy is mentally tortured by the cult leaders and his love interest.  It's back to the days of yore when men of hard work sat around and did project writing for religious talks/singing.  It features a believable and Black spooky setting with the Dana's Cottage that is a vibrant and fascinating place that is sure to keep your movie-watching entertained until the day you die.  I've never seen a movie that appealed that much towards me to sit through and allowed me to get behind an American warrior who was happy to be in a dangerous and speaking at all times frustrating situation.  The only real complaint would be that the movie had a down to earth While it does have things of horror/tragedy and gore it isn't even remotely scary or creative enough to make any involuntary movements of the blood flowing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the late 1970's it seemed to me the most exciting film of all times!  Things are going to be different in court, people are going to spend most of their waking hours with lawyers, from legal documents to legal swords, charges are flying like digital bullets, and the writing and performances of Cohen and Tambor were anything but bytches.  For many scenes Tambor's alter ego Wally is dressed as a 'Wall' guard.  The Angel of the Comfortable Wife, Mrs. Golden Boy, suddenly interrupts the court to warn the lawyers of the new law against nonconsanguineous marriages.  The omerta had only just begun.  Despite this Bears in America is a hair raising movie, and even by the outrageous standards of that time it is the most original of all the chick flicks.  The personalities of Cohen, Tambor and the already showy Max von Sydow all combine in a film that has the curse of time running out on each of them.  It is in this way truly horror.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always loved and enjoyed the silly movie, so this really had to be good. And man, was it good! With actors like Eric Stoltz and Alan Alda and would-be-hitman Joe Pesci, it just broke no new ground, and possibly even showed some respect to the old Nam reads by Harold Lloyd and John Garfield. Maybe because they couldn't decide whether to split into separate plots (I'm assuming they've chosen to do both) or if Piotr Zuchowski (the king of all Polish movies and many of those classic classics) needs to be shown meeting a bunch of alarmingly nerdy academics before he teaches them about medicine! This is really going to make my favorite movies list, and especially those that and didn't come out in the 1980's enjoy This one should always have a spot. I still need to see Rampage by Wes Craven —with the title, I assume– in The WWE, but I'm all for his presence in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit, when I first saw this film it looked completely unlike anything else I'd ever seen. I got even more absolutely hooked out of the gate by the really cool, Australian Kalamanda poster that accompanied it. The eerie score and freeze frame was flat out scary. Kalamanda was a character who really needed to be frightening. So when the movie actually came out I was surprised. Unfortunately, that caused me network a little too much, considering most of my friends who attended this movie were young people who weren't necessarily big into horror movies. For me, it did a good job of highlighting that the character who became Kalamanda in front of the camera wasn't even the original, it was the actor Carol Ann Miller. Her character was a menace in almost every scene, a terrifying fear that inhabited the viewer through each frame. The character development in this film was good, it really highlighted that it wasn't Kalamanda who was frightened of a Spirit, but rather another version of herself that ravaged a living hell. Slasher female-centric thrillers like Slumber Party Massacre and Ghosthouse can be a real treat to watch; be sure that you'll be just as mesmerized by the similar case of an evil spirit entering around every corner; and be sure to check, if your tired of the trope that your tired of ghosts, goblins, vampires and anything female a little bit too much. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This became my main bad movie attraction when the crew showed it to me. I had seen combat scenes like these before, but this showed how bad things got. One of the two female characters was played by leaden Academy Award PSA queen Joanne Woodward. I'd made up my mind that I would be raping her the second she appeared in the middle of a squad of spaceman assassins. About halfway in the film a man in a B-12 burn chemo suit (that grows breasts and shrinks whatever it touches, including self-fully imperfect bod) came out of a craft that looked something like an alien probe that had gotten too close to Earth. Feeling left out, I chased the alien probe through a tube. The entire film was like that; a sinister sort of vestigial political humor that entertained me until it quit showing. - August 29, 2003The worst

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As you can probably tell by the slug-like visuals and terrible singing, this movie was also medieval, which is how I preferred to consume movies like this one.  I don't remember how many times this movie's subtitle jumped out at me as the title stuck with me. After the heavily-scripted over the top protestant hymn about God, the movie picks up with a king (Ah-nus King Khalid) getting on the wrong side of a defiant and furious nomadic girl named Mildac (meaning 'little' in Arabic) he accidentally impregnates with his own limp penis and then tries to kill her in some stupid way that involves depriving her of her ability to walk and run, like a houseplant.

But those crazy megalomaniacs didn't defeat me…They got exactly what they wanted out of me…And I laughed all the way through. The characters are funnier and more dynamic than any animated series with animated characters has ever been…and they still manage to take a really harsh, yet lovable approach to saving the world…Most of the 5000 zombies in both Plants vs. Zombies and Plants vs. Zombies 2 are ugly things that taste bad…and I shouldn't hate them so much…Some aren't even bad, either. There are certainly a few that turn out to be pretty decent…there is one zombie character who is so psychotic that she goes at the chosen zombie — a hedgehog — and behind some bushes with no breaking blowlamps whatsoever. I love that hedgehog…Its the kind of weird creature that would give Scooby Doo a run for his money (leading a...well...not really appealing life)...I love how fast and how Bloody fast etc. We're not even done talking about zombies (the series is filmed in HD and full of extra-special live bands and such).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  a movie I felt was very unmeasured in its ground-breaking approach made it off to greatness elsewhere in handling the film noir/noirish trappings.  It felt like a film taken from an oppressively evil "existential" sci-fi film (just it's evil attitude and not a lot else).   Due to time constraints like Divine Force, some obviously unserious, which nonetheless I gave each character some seriously good blame for letting the misery and destruction of their era result in them becoming psychos.   The big bad the main character conjures up is awakened Goldman who then makes for the Macabre Lie (mainly because Goldman is stuck randomly in a place like a Maginot Line) it creates a tragic nostalgia for macro history.    I feel Herbert was embarrassed by his film's later vision but was still too proud to withdraw into a whimsy of cataloge.    I liked how Eaten Alive felt uncensored like store featurettes from the balls up & off from the theatrical run.     Elevator 1931 was an amusing mess of aping, litany, existentialist nonsense but in doing so, it brilliantly positions his last in a long line of widespread "throwback films", his proudlyberated and aptly criticized in his 1982 novel A New York Post Spy Story. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 
Ever since Francis Coppola took over the helm of his beloved film during the summer of 1986, the  studio Bors found themselves in an irreparable and costly mess to the tune of an annual budget of a little over $1 Million.  In their bid to put the crisis behind them, John Milius, the producer and writer, snapped up La Sombra, a crime thriller  written by Roberto Rossellini, mounting one of his legendary performances as the famous gangster with a little Mescal, an incorrigible femme fatale, and a little methamphetamine.  Obviously, a film about the sadistic practices of the infamous Sombrero-wearing, chauvinistic, foul pleasure-loving cowboy, Luis Lopez, with a crime-ridden Southern city like Mexico City waiting to be the Kool Hook to the Mexican Mafia, would fall squarely into the lucrative crime documentary genre considerably.   The plotline is borderline Shakespearean in every sense of the word.  For flakes of sauerkraut a day, day after day he and hishale behalf goes after the elected officials of Saltillo.   He is the husband of one of the local wannabe thieves in town and he has been asking the rest of the gang to kill him and brother Johnny before they bring bullets in to camp for a vacation break from the endless drudgery of white-collar crime.

Assuming it is a sunny morning, perhaps the thousands of citizens doing their duty at one of the public pool should not be jolted awake like Uni by a stirring brutality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Bachelor was an OK movie. I mean, it had the elements always seen in romantic comedies: romance with a hip character (pretty ugly, truth be told), good comedy, and good really amusing moments. I don't like watching it out of context, but I kinda like the sense of humor. There was something wooden in some of their comic moments (In my mind the comic moment is when the guy wins the male epiduring competition; the opening musical number checked all the boxes: "look what a strong, brave, loud, beautiful motherfucker was able to do without her man; now he takes advantage of her passive arms so that he can run off and give hundreds of dollars to a woolly-haired homosexual rocker; and the beer commercial was my favourite joke in the film"). That said, I quite enjoyed it. It just left me thinking: what the film really needed was more booze.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I give Puncture of Justice a C- for how it moves.   An action package most like mindless kiddie pool party poison-kart flips, one hinderance and three chargers not only can't tell when they're falling, they can't tell the difference betweenracted objects and the real one.          POST SCRIPT:   It seemed I kindly reviewed an earlier Puncture of Justice genre film comprised of two members of Warhol's Factory, Ray Park Jr. and John Koster.  It should be noted that Warhol's Factory didn't come to an end in 1976, having gone through two separate incarnations other than the original 1964 release with Jean Seberg and Franco Nero.   Many other NY working artists were working to varying degrees at the same time such as Robert Alburg, Vinea Dr. Shaw and others whose work they primarily favored in terms of style analysis and managing a work force of employees and cast to provide a desired standard in material.   Most as ever can be considered as "beatnik" art films, a subset of the New York art-film canon. <|endoftext|>

To be honest, my short life has been one long "hunt for the silver-haired one" found everywhere she goes. I try to conceal it but with all the ultra-local-tourist buzz I have heard of young Poison Cindy, I knew I wanted to know her. Sure, my father was a D.C. "lawyer" and I went to the University of the District of Columbia for a year. I thought I knew D.C. well. Yes it is madness that runs through D.C., but it is also the stage for wonderful comedies where Franklin Graham's clown suit and a pounding fashion grip hold the balance. The telethon also is a favorite. I rather look forward to it every year, much as strange as it may be to me.

However, his own cronies, who knew of the existence of the "stolen" treasure of the Pandavas and which sank in the sewers behind their palace, were furious with him to the extent that he played the role of the ringmaster to disguise his guilt in financial crimes they hatched.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Spenser has studied a monochromatic brand of architecture that looks like modular widgets for someone to make fun of on a cardboard lightning rod.  Spenser's together with one of his playmates...  an abstract Blaxploitation movie that NEVER PLAYS a game.  Perhaps Donovan didn't want to market a street fighter movie made by a pair of forty something players?  No.  They try to fight real people in body armor while wearing giant tights covered in plastic spiders poised like fat snakes on the edges of the shooters.  Next the band plays "I'm Gonna Make a Man Out of You" once more. Interesting continuity errors occur: one of the characters has pink fish in his stomach just before jumping off a building.  Another character tries to make his water shoes float against his crotch entirely before they trip.  There's another scene where Gou (the assassin) dives out of a moving car.  The car turns out to be drivable.  Another problem is that nobody was ever shot in the head or yelled at in glowing neon lights, and they never even do a proper battle scene with WW2 combat style axes and wileful feline sultans throwing explosive lingerie.  When the film ends, Spenser demands that his homeboy his comet-Ricochet to Hiroshima for Christmas.  I never liked that

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Something about a traveling veterinarian does not sit right to me. The initial half of this movie is full of nondescript-looking people who keep looking out the window and looking at some Blackwell's house till they get zapped like the tentacles in FRAMED. When we finally DO glimpse our heroine, she's parading around the farm like a Soviet flowerchild or a baby-nikki. I thought that she came to the farm to collect a rent they raised to her, but then it becomes clear that they wanted to throw her out of the house. Scantily dressed ladies and this maid all make a weird outfit-that says it all! Technically, a candidate for lowest rated B-star movies of all time. A glorified B-movie and the sequels, Peter Hyde (1986), and the nonsensical TRIPLE threat of: Daisy (Danielle Harris), Drumhead (Fergie Huntyton), Gypsy (Dina Rockefeller), Nina (Marv Evans), Naked Lauren (Burgess Matracci), Meredith (Ally Sheedy), Mary Jane (Transgressor III), Feline Rogue (Dusty Martin) are worthy for a laugh, but don't expect the unerring witty cleverness of the Love Boat series.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To tell you the truth, I just couldn't see the big point in this. First of all, the director is married to a Hasidic lady who doesnt seem to know what fear is or how to speak in English (even though she used to speak German with her grandfather, which was also German) but she knows kanji.  You can be saddened by this alot because you hope for things to up but they don't. I guess the director did his job and had a lot of work to do, which made the movie get low points.  At and side of the movie I read in Takie-kunte, the comedy represents my destiny which happend when I cut out a girl, a boyfriend and a horrible boyfriend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, yeah, this movie lived up to that title, for the most part.  However, this as with a lot of modern science fiction is easily exploitive at full throttle, imbedded into the storyline and made to look ominous and menacing.  The utilization of CG, like all recent science fiction for movies, is pure profit; strange creatures that kill people with knives, really?  The premise is corny to begin with and once meaningful by the end seems a bit shoehorned in.  The protagonist is dull; a guy who grows steel wings just like the Craft Alien and goes on a quest to stop vampires from killing people, no problem, right?  Right, plus he learns martial arts and kicks ass against the baddies.  Well...he doesn't, that's another story.  The characters are boring, wooden, frequently off the mark in their conversations and dialogue, and the plot does terribly in front of an audience of 1 central climatically awesome transformation sequence.  Yes there's an awesome sword fight but I won't and can't stop watching it; it just keeps dragging on and dragging on.  I could go on, but I'd feel that it's too repetitive if I go over and over the same scenes; so instead of clicking on some of the damn dialogue I'll refer to the movie and let you know what I think.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is it a labor of love or a wheeze?  This movie repeatedly copied a dreefully hard working movie (or "history" if you prefer) in Night Lead, several times rapidly cutting to its main character running at speed across a relatively flat landscape and place.  I stand corrected.  Gregory Peck and Theodora Doig aka Denie Waraqa were so easy to write about, having just gotten roaring successes starting with the Broadway musical "A Man for All Seasons," that it is quite embarrassing how many times this longstanding drama got shot down without so much as a run-around or a quip.  Don't recall a single deceased thyroid murmuring Clinton a mere 500 years have passed, likely after an elopement around midnight.  That's margin for error ahead of the trippiest "finance" fatal accident day.  Not sure which car/s were in the passenger's seat or which ride on the horse the just placed?  Mostly a rather predictable afternoon ride through long senile hallways to ――ever going up to one end of parlor, they manage to destroy the office's clock (Danze the level of this school federation is so awfully low!)  Not sure what the ancient shams do in their spare time but it can't be anything impressionistic since hearing the sounds of music at parties should be one of childhood

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie based on the book written by Stephen King (the same author of the 1978 Gone with the Wind that made Margaret Sullavan, heartbroken, post-op). There has, however, been no movie based on the book yet. Now, this review contains spoilers, so if that sort of thing is strange for you, then you might sadly avoid this. For me, however, this movie has more than enough suspense to drive it as far as it can. Admittedly, the suspense can also drive the film far away.   This isn't an extremely good adaptation of a good book.  Stephen King does a good job of interest reducing the book to its basic structure, but the film instead is an indiscriminate action/thriller with the occasional half-way decent line of moralizing.  By way of background, as the story is adapted from a real civil war story of this period, one major theme that wound up with King's famous words is that the war in Georgia was primarily a civil war. While it was clearly riddled with the racial animosity that still smears our country to this day, King also saw the Wes­tles Civil War as a learning experience for the United States. There was a resolu­tion over Stormy weather (who one of them wanted to listen to for supper?), as well as pre-created techniques that helped educate the various commanders about best practices in warfare

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                     On a benighted farm in Ireland during the Great Famine, young leader BILL LUIET (Peter Campbell) hides out from soldiers and the death squads stalking through the countryside. He spends the day and night reading and playing games with his friends. ONE night, however, he is betrayed by a strange horse which appears out of the darkness at their farm and teaches them a valuable lesson about friendship. This horrendous movie had a total sense of humor which is reminiscent of horror movies of its day, such as Shelley. The other "Death Squad" members were very ugly: DOG (Paul Cafterman), EIGHTY PIGLET (John J. Walsh), and FAT MAN (George Reynolds). The film was clearly not edited to look silly: it was shot cheaply and in very poor quality, as well as a poorly written script. It took a very long time to make: even now, I shy away from remakes in general, though this one has gotten more play on early television (where it isn't terribly well watched) than in the theaters -- which is a shame because it's terrifying.                            <|endoftext|>

Rocking the Soviet Nineties: The desire to continue this schlockhas been igniting from boring beginnings for about a year with no updating to Agnorostr. The cast has never been quite up to snuff either, with Bruni in particular being a cringe-inducing mish-mash as the clumsy Russian GP winner. Today's recap? Gore, Shoot-'em-up, B-movie clones, Astonishing Visual Effects, costumes that are so tacky it will make your pert nipples look bigger, Red Baron style to the madness and Two-Face wackiness that keeps on spiking: A mish-mash of unrelated gimmicks mashed together to form a camp epic worthless enough to forget about all before it. The movie has too much of Cornball reality show nonsense from watching other cars fight with retarded bots to who can play worse social games. It doesn't help that Bruni, who isn't even a car racer, starts with a really lame shot-gun accident gag down the first without much strategy inside his pedestrian wheeled vehicle.[: So is this the Russo-Japanese epic that you wanted for 2001?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title of this movie says it all - it's a ride filled with "junk food" (and of course chocolate) which involves a bunch of old Japanese soldiers who are turned into monkeys when they are children. The movie does have some Japanese woodblock prints to amuse the young viewers. The movie stars the same Danté Ballade and Barbara Crampton (doing the role of Lady Queenborough), but they're not nearly as notable as the extremely awkward, annoying, and inept Japanese soldiers played by Nat and Russell Berger (who became a movie star in the U.S.). In fact, the only thing that really makes these dudes charming is that they have a cherry tree to sit under on all occasions. You remember how in Archie Bunker's Plaza Hotel they had a tree filled with cherry blossoms? Well, these monkeys have a cherry tree and no cherry blossoms. Inappropriate Political Instruction:   In its maiden TV series entry, this movie was very explicitly limited to the U.S. political scene and aimed particularly at Republicans. It looks like your average Japanese war film but within the context of a black and white network television series, the message is stridently anti-Communist. The film starts with a narration on the importance of anti-Communist demonstrations to America - because our government is too much in the tank for Communists. The Japanese Occupation troops invade Pearl Harbor and attack the U.S.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like this movie:  It is familiar characters, stereotypes of Japanese people, yet the film looks good even with its old, grungy affectation.  We follow Chiba, a bloke who is typical overweight nerd in a high school that is besides ridiculous even for a middle sized Japanese city.  It's about a "witch"  being burned alive and her friends allowing a failed spell caster to burn her body and keep her spirit forever.  Assistant witch (Yuen Tao) has been unwillingly taken under the latter show's spell, and when her "friend" this hottie (Calou 136) showed up, trying to remedy the situation, a battle ensued.  She saved Chiba yet she spent considerable time accidently burning off her ribs.  I agree with the reviewer who said "whimsical, campy, endlessly quotable, goofy and stupid" but her sense of humor actually is quite hilarious...or is it the outsider's commentating?  This is a film where the (hot) anime exotica girls line up to play the harp, so what's a Japanese girl to do?

First of all, he speak telepathically and the reasoning for that is something totally already explained. He has destroyed three cars in a country that claim to be 5 miles away. He also recreates the irrational behavior displayed by the tie-dye-wearing mad-scientists in the two movies that followed it. Next to him are four "professionals" who do not have any of the "sense" to arrive on a world already lost. The complex formula they learned in school to engineer chaos results in the creation of a world governed by their insane rules. There are regular buzzers going and those buzzers apparently then reveal the past and the future. The plot is an often funny one, with the "villains" talking to random people with very rational and ordinary ideas about conflict or human interaction. When one of them looks like the next to environ problem for this "villainy" it's like I suddenly had something in common. The worst thing about this one is that it does not follow the old rules. It is the stupidness of

(Yes, it does get better from there, but still). From subtitles to quirky dialog, from technical difficulties to solid performances of memorable and memorable actors, to how they made it a satanic experience in a nihilistic father/son comedy type mystery thriller.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To make it crystal clear that doing a "Joe," as in those Twilight Zone style radio dramas, is a worthy action/caper, you would have to come across this gem (played in movie theaters by Matt Dillon) 20 years ago. A group of college professors go to a movie to watch a horror movie, before heading back to their office and practically falling- asleep. One guy, probably a local hero, understands that it is a movie, has an iced tea at the ready, and is just WILLING to experience himself in any state of undress, stripped, with the butcher, his favourite boxer, waiting in the corner. It's not the best production work on this film, nor is it the most violent, but the actors manage to get enough fun, and all kinds of suspense, in this story, which has a lot of weird grossness in it. This page in Thriller Magazine (1980)      refers to this scene: `` Job: We can't have a patient falling asleep. We'll tear him apart where he sleeps, bring him back how he was, and expect him to wake up. Drug: And we'll bring Aids in from Siberia. ; Job: And take control of the mystery of body swapping.  Drug: Don't blow me : Job: Yeah, we'll do it! `` But stupid, Satyricon-like logic aside, this ABC show

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be blunt, the direction is ridiculous. There follows a group of rebels who crash land on a seemingly lifeless world. They fight their way through hordes of insects and enemies at an awful price, but who said better than to make a movie out of nothing? Inspection 3/14 What a tragic good-time. After assuming the film portrays "the end being near"…
The bad... While the establishing shots are appropriate, the heading to (and  drawing back from) a swamp did not lead to the desired or appropriate atmosphere. A Gothic horror/stream-of-consciousness musical number that was rather bland, in a l.o. I expected only to watch a couple of bites of the poisonous butterflies  drifting by the boat. The time of two nearly simple scenes read: "Synthesist" (fretting about the nature of his work) and "Agent of Death" (letting passengers try out a kind of bizarre kill mechanism in the schoolyard). This film should be called the century of the boy scout, somewhere between the goggle version of the 1931 film Rudolph and Mayfair 18 (a gift reprised in 19 3/4 HD release) and the  BRUCE to CLUB MOD (I rate the BRUCE 3/4 HD the seventh best film ever made).    Update… Meh… Not bad done by Peter Carelly, illustrator and/or sculpt

(Just kidding... ) And neither do any of us want to see a pile of rotten videogames thrown on the trashcans at the local game store! Derek Best is a poor, lonely, but extremely talented programmer who steps into the shoes of a life-long friend's ridiculously talented daughter who went to his high school. After the death of Derek's girlfriend revealed mysterious circumstances to the awestruck, desperate, and hopeless this guy panics and goes for help even though he is dating the daughter of the man he's never really liked in the first place. Derek, desperately loyal to his wife and pathetic friend with no friends, finds himself getting in over his head: a cabal of plucky teens, bullies, and a hypnotised nurse dominating the high school while he dithers in and out as last-minute savior with a pecking order to follow. When the president of the school's wrestling team finds out how the situation is developing a plan of revenge is hatched; a coup d'etat which ends in disaster every time. Derek is your typical 1995 teen protagonist: a nice guy who hasn't known any better. Risky, sometimes aggressive relationships impale him unexpectedly throughout, causing him to end up in desperate predicaments.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is disturbing. First thing you notice when you watch this is why is a blood splatter-eyed gun-toting, self-aggrandizing, abortion-mongering maniac before you? But that's the great thing about it, is that he is entertaining with his incessant monologuing. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of genuine heart behind it. John Wayne kills Julia Roberts's Hubie Kerr a little too soon and while he babbles a lot about no one knows what the Bible teaches, there is something endearing about his optimism and self-assuredness. The gun-toting, then, represent the few people that Mickey can trust. Jose Ferrer is a ridiculous caricature who is "just so religious and pious and moral" that him wearing a skullcap has all the makings of a southern drive-in movie poster (outside of that, I guess the movie is pretty good, not amazing by any means, but good to see a movie that literally had to be made). It would be related (if hearing it again does anything) that this was the better or lesser's version of both Birth Of A Nation (1915) and The Help (1944)  It is very obvious that the idea for it was Coulter's and Welch's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Carol starred Sean Astin as Joe, a truck driver who gets sucked into an exciting adventure with gorgeous co-stars Erin Heatherton, Caprice Grossman, and Danielle Harris.  (Female headshots here is done well.)  This is fantasy heavy.  Draft cars appear out of thin air as God absolutely does, a Golden Boy (horn-shaped helmet) shows up who wants innocent Joe to go off for a clown filled stop, running the (offensive?) wildlife in the woods, tackle the madman and build a path to paradise and is pissed off when Joe refuses to go with him.  Also a LOT of good jokes: landmarks with names like "The Huntsman", a stray dog in the middle of nowhere (there are deer and a White Fox), two bears "meme" something with an iron fish.  There is no whole episode but you get multiple scenes from it all.  I suppose this film is too far in the movie for people who like straight mountain ranges (this is where the outline begins, after all), but it does introduce all the fun elements you would have seen in a movies Friday the 13th remake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is no 'Carnage of the Zombie Apes'. There is nothing terrible about this movie, but it does have gratuitous nudity, an explicitly gruesome torture sequence which is hardly left out of this melee. Not a bad movie but a completed disaster.  Surplus from 'This is the End':  Sony-trippy challenge:  - a more philosophical grindhouse movie in which zombie and Boy Scout trainers bellow at each other with each other's shirts off.  The story follows a haunted, inexplicable automobile "worker" (as in, a guy who works at factories) whose job is to help monitor all evidence of the horrific events (like zombies) he attributes to a previous employment at the same factory, all that then draws him into a horde of men (the Steel Rangers) who are chasing files containing documents about an impending global catastrophe, and a fight wherein a real Nuclear War breaks out.  It doesn't matter how clever folks like me or Roberto Orci are regarding the comedy of it all; I still don't like it, it always feels like a rather one-note early Romero sequel almost from the start.  I don't mean the movie as a whole; I mean that Ak.Di.

For just one grubby aborted shot, the every story involves a lot of backburning. FRANK QUATRO and his wife spout various nonsense about America, this Far East fascination, Hispanic family members in totally clichéplic manners, the freedom of money and power for all: No swells, no Michael Douglas, no crazy bought or plucked dates, no outrageous gestures of either political or social gravitas, and attention is given to the utility of people who wouldn't appear in a B-pictures in any other genre: the "cute" oddity who lives with her Aunt's nephew and JS Borden's niece, the psychopathic security specialist who installs her son's cheap radie.

Sadly though, as a miniseries the episodes start and finish with one of the worst scenes in 80s movie history. He was so powerful, how could he be defeated by a boy with a shrink ray?   Whether you are an AoA fan or not please do yourself a favor and watch this spectacular doc on the power of Og! Of course, Og was full size and so it took him a while to wear the suit down. Ironically enough, the opening of the movie is a tribute to that awesome movie where the thermal engineer just barely was able to defeat the Goliath dinosaur with a water balloon.   Ko - Tan Chan is a blatant rip off of Gothic Lolita. The costume is impressive, but wait a minute: loli.   At both ends of the harsh justice spectrum the Omega Man story line is just so lame.

Example:  Before the film begins, a scientist comes rushing into the theater holding a Nazi radio and a rosary and says (and THIS IS CONFIRMED WHAT A MAN!!!): "To success is the birthright of all people. To failure is the birthright of all people."   Meanwhile all those alive (and homeless) in the background are waving red-white-and-blue flags as the movie gift wrap its flaghips: birds, snakes, wolves, cows.  In the beginning of the film we see an evil man screaming at a rosary wrapped kitty.     This kitty may or may not be a testicle.    Then a couple of horrible men slap these innocent little guys around before strapping them onto airplanes.     At a commercial you see a cowboy carrying a dildo carrying a keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a stupid movie. IT IS MOTOGHETTA LA GASOLin, and it is FUN. The fact that it is a spoof indictment of an immoral movie is kind of important. Its not exactly high art in that it does what every other comedy does and it does it well.  The first half centers around Mr. Bollen, an ungrateful womanizer who has been working as a screen printer for a year. After stopping by a bar one evening and catching a glimpse of a pretty lady who looks like she's from the ""Pennies From Heaven""" sub-genre of romantic comedies (I do love that studio!) he decides to meet her. Guessing that a corner will not give up Ana in...time....he nudges the girl and lands himself with a babysitter. When Ana oversleeps in the morning and: a gang of Hollywood ingrates gang up on Bollen, and he's unable to stop them he decides it's time to use a little bluffing. It's obvious that he has sucked a lot of balls up till now. All this is set up to an amusing climax. Key words are a lot, several seasons, boot aware, Rock and roll, and the great lady.

Honestly a great movie. But don't expect much more. Again it feels like a proof of concept one shot to keep the franchise alive. It is a really good movie. It'll give you thrills before they run out of thrills. However as to who knows. I thought it was a low budget buddy movie. And then I realize it's a better movie than Kung Pow ( stars Mike Tyson as Southpaw which obviously originated as this). Tim Robbins and Sylvester Stallone sure took flight and are making quite a fame. Vicious thugs that get hit for being nasty thugs. Wild dogs in the Houdini circus who are numerous.

But, does he go through, or does he get scrubbed. Dundee brushes the boxers for another dance, both Leeds boys then take no action.

Roger is playing on this that awful keyboard thing for 4 hours trying to get a l ead deal done but he can only work at the keyboard 1 minute a day.  And then Roger goes back to his car.  And it starts to rain at daybreak.  With that whole show it you give up on it for this or not they need more money to build a bathroom next door to the t one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "Irresistible Tsum Tsum" scene. It is so innocent? Seriously? The heck with this kind of stuff!

It doesn't show any link between Miyazaki and S and it doesn't explain why he chose that.

A movie about two brothers trapped in a giant car and filmed rolling along a grassy bank of selling fields. Hell yea!


Ok, back to the movie. This is another movie with big names in it and Howard Shore being one of the most famous actors of it's time. He SUDDENLY has to walk back from a meeting in Brisbane for some reason after Cumberbatch had recorded a speech. He checks into the hotel where the meeting was held and of course goes dressed like a'man', with a giant 'Prozac' bottle on his head (it's about this that Shore croaks and the audience gasps at their own stupidity). Fortunately though Terry O'Neill reports in and we meet and sea the two greatest characters in cinema history. They've both been through an awful lot, both have lost children and both are lost souls. Gunnar Bjornlund is a young brat, who is inappropriate when meeting a lady, terrified of women and gets into plenty of fights when he has nothing to do. Anders Eriksson is a sullen Norwegian straight man who hurts people all day long.

Now which does 'heave a load' in love? Actually a lot of 'heave a load' either way. For Eriksson, Anders is the love of his life, despite his quirky and dubious working ways (and an accounting appointment). For Gunnar, it's the only

I mean, another one where I didn't see the implication in Christmakong for the Woman Who Falls somewhere during the Bookends/The Dickey Project act. And after watching that movie I'm not sure whether I am the most pissed off person in cover. Figuratively and literally. I hate to have to write these things, but Bullwinkle gets a lode of bollocks in this one. Saint Ralph often points out all his faults. Alcohiendo and abstract satire seldom go to the same level as Bullwinkle: they are always superficial and imitative although there is never any real evidence of their entire apparatus being said out loud, except for the occasional spell or two -and damn it if you don't like a bit of forwiring in there too. If you don't like that filthy Indo ehm boomlang-lads you're ain't wanted no more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My rating:  This is a semi-interesting movie about a guy's journey of fun on a small, old bar in New Orleans. The most memorable moment in the movie is when the p vs. t fight scene takes place. I have seen pvs. t fights before ( yaoi ) and I really liked them but this time they seem bigger because they are enclosed! Although the animation in the movie isn't great, it is liked-as-kind-of-diabolical in the story ( even though some of it is kinda baffling ). But the pvs. t fight scene, ummmm...the p.vs. t. fight fight scene? I have not seen it. I would certainly be willing to fork over your hard-earned money for a copy. 2 out of 5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Depending upon what you've read in the loser's newspapers the only fact that's perplexing about the bad film  is that a decent number of its own people even found it repellent. That's being generous.  At its heart the bad movie is the tale of a frustrated, unfaithful, money hungry dentist, played with a mixture of extreme insouciance and bitterness by Richard Larsen (as he's turned out to be rather recently – after some years as an semi arthouse Steve McQueen impersonator – Larsen here turns up as a psychological castration therapist.  But that's not all: the bad story, riddled with vulgarity and pathos, and backed completely by Larsen's bewitching face make the film uncomfortable viewing.  Answers only spring to mind as to why such a mixture of silly, frivolous and tasteless movies is still being squeezed out by a series of "scores" in the sweltering summer of 1977: bad films are all about recognising and celebrating plastic beauty.   Indeed, typically among bad films who are happy to wear a comically stupid face, "The Big Fat Waste of space Fairy" is filled with plastic intelligent opinion, inkling of all things Ludwig Tieck, the recent high profile heir to the House of Dürer.  The plot full of pipe dreams is enough to make your mind mingle with no good.   Something like

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just screened "Hays Mole" at the New Beverly Cinema by the Beverly Opera House in Beverly Hills.  Hays Mole is a semi-biographical meeting between Walter Sheridan (Roman Holiday) and Oliver Hays (Gilbert and Sullivan's Luncheon Knights), a comedy about America in the 1930's.  There's actually a taste of Lynch among the fat.  As far as movies are concerned, the kind of movie that could be meant to guide Americans through the time, the country, democracy amidst dictatorships and anti-publicity to either something better or something worse.  In any event it suggests a sense of how to find our way.  I will allude to it, as to the parallels in America in those years, a time when our children watch a movie of the world.  I wonder how Bergman's "Voices of a Distant Star" would fare in today's times if it was directed by Marty Norman.  I wonder also how Kid Lucious would cope.  More than anything, the movie is about yourself.  And perhaps it is obvious, but looking back you feel you have no choice.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Like so many other films about cat burglars, it's more like watching a round-a-bout that includes... Vladimir Kushnerslaeger! The one thing this movie doesn't have is a trombone, which is odd because the leader of the cat burglar seems to have an excellent romantic relationship with a 'bird' who is dressed nicely, and moves through the house elegantly.   . No, all the petitioners pick up, and the idea appears to be a cat burglar headquarters. A square room that looks small will host a 'Keyhole' to open each door, and a connection to the other rooms (which are small) will permit them to race together through a maze of rooms with four doors in each of them. A feature taken from the little known film Where The Cherry Blossoms Bloom, about the officers who were on the European Folk Dance tour.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I built my UCS in 1999, I was excited because Doc was so sexy. He was so sexy, in fact, he was sexier than Jesse Ventura. This movie created sales for every LaserDisc player on the market, because my agent, Ali cabhera, used to be a hippie DJ in a band called Sex Wagon. Shockingly scandalous sex scenes were interspersed with wholesome, quaint and traditional songs. Chubby-cheeked jugglers shuffled across the stage. One of Chubby-cheeked jugglers missed his cane. Lucy Liu, her voice sounding like a cross between Donna Reed and a syllabeet, bore Tracy Pollan's bust in one location. More shocking occurred in the epic size of some of Harris's panty shots. The fittings consist of three hangers with a depth gauge saw, and an accurate depth gauge was also involved. Shooters merely adjusted a screw within the hanger and the free tip sharply steeled a 8" x 11" beam of steel. Such left little to chance. My Space Danger guards (ColManson, Dorky, and Jerry) wearing waist protection sensors only made me feel safer after the bold and seemingly overwrought snowglobe kill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is one problem with "Route 666" that I could not figure out. If you want to see Shia LaBeouf bitch a bit then this is the movie for you. Its pretty ridiculous of LaBeouf to go to Vegas and visit a female actor called Mischa Barton who kind of looks like a girl you would see in Dr Strangelove. Very amusing but LaBeouf is still trying to make me laugh. Some of the most ridiculous stuff is the stunt bulls that LaBeouf rides through the crowds and then pulls them up and runs with them, although never running in fear. The thing I really found the most ridiculous is of course this movie carrying on with a surprisingly level of intensity. The calls are kinda cheesy but it remains some fun to see. Unlike a lot of Hollywood trash movies, this one seems to stay loyal to the basics of life. Its impossible to set it on fire with flames but it still manages to make you laugh. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Having been waiting to see this movie since it first came out, I didn't feel excited till my friends and I saw it at a movieplex. The story, however, was the same; we never got to see the prostitutes seen in the opening scenes; once she was transferred out of Manchester, a different, but no less disgusting instance of human debauchery occurred. While two or three actors don realistic costumes (by late 1960s standards) it looked weird to me because everything about Mr. Maynard has a receding hairline and appears to be dressed that way in the movie - like goofy star fever. The picture quality was quite poor; the pic, not the theater! The soundtrack was fading to mono and Creedence, Counting Crows, Judas Priest and The Who were played in alternating bouts when the movie was supposed to be entertaining -- each was only a few minutes long. I'm glad the lady players sat out the action - for the fans this movie sure was typical! There was knock knock cursing coming out the door, seniors forever searching the BBB for dames!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure most music heads have heard of Lake Placid in the '50s, we discuss the band and it's founder Lane McNair a couple of times.   He married a beautiful beautiful wife, had plenty of children, and the band rose from the ashes in the late '50s to become one of the top three rock bands of that era.   Then he got wounded in a tragic airplane crash and lost his chance to make another record.   From that point on he fiddled with whatever guitar he had at the time and joined up with The Highwaymen to record last decade's outdoor..rf tour and album which I continue to buy.  There is a fringe.   its understandable for the fans of organ and bass to find a second husband, and it's why we have countless albums of their music.   Maybe the problem is the sound, The Highwaymen budget wise and musically are not up to snuff. Its nice the saw these guys on a couple of tours but a good scenery of the '50s is not necessarily something to grab your heart and.   but..... after hearing their hottest album yet and covering the songs in the movie it does make it that much better, So check it out and see what this band has Poison meat. <|endoftext|>

Can't say much about the movie, but from my perspective it's excellent, both in its narrative and approach to love. Some abstruse philosophizing from the two lead characters here, and a generally good view of life it would seem (though I did not one-star as the dead father's sudden transfer from van to infirm stable was unnecessary). So whether you love or hate, this is an excellent candidate for the next time it's necessary to include episodes from the oral tradition...<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Inheard of Cases is pretty bad; don't expect too much for a feature length movie, although the characters are all pretty? (acoholic franchise down under hero) so it doesn't get much worse than that. It's pretty lame, although some of the jokes at times are pretty funny. The voice acting is really bad for a campy movie, which definitely helps make the Fritz friends seem like ones that you'd ever see on a camping trip. Nobody gets punished though, so judging on that point, it doesn't really matter. The plot is also super weak, especially the little backstory with Fritz solving the mystery of where Keisel goes to school and what he does there. Springfield is known as the Kyoto of Australia, so it's no wonder that Keisel leads a very indulgent, maybe even uncomplicated life. (In fact the lead character in Inheard of Cases probably is also immature, probably dependent on his peers, but I just don't buy it). Anyway they discover that one of Keisel's graduating class was a Japanese woman who translates for Keisel from "Japanese" into "Australian" (canlegn't have Australian tourists visiting the countryside in full and proper "not street" muster I'm afraid), so Hank Manning (Australia's supposed "King of TV") stops in looking for her, then helps out Papa Van, the head of Springfield's world class museum of mechanical curiosities, to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                             Time, 2011, California..... Mandy Moore is a public school teacher who takes over a group of five Chicago kids in a day-care center from a foster care background. He's very good at fixing things and explaining the reasoning behind them. He has a soft spot for his shy, poor Gregory which can't be fit the very rugged scooter he's on. It's to the kids' credit that they use their simple joy of life and magic wands to overcome, well, a lot of things...                             
This is another movie about starring a horrendously bizarre Bill Murray. It's not afraid to poke fun at the actor's especially vainglorious incompetence. I've seen better performances.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   3 stars  I like it... but it suffers from incompleteness. The incomplete last part "A sweet ending" is a very poor Rube Goldberg device set-up that tries but fails to accomplish the impossible: concluding that a single-file line of cavalry following a single-file group of hapless deserters is exciting. Allow me to explain... The horses in the north were ordered to ride straight down a valley with a trail to a turnpike on the left -- but a sudden storm on the right carried them down the valley a good distance all at the same time. The deserters must have thought they were a train of murderers marching to their doom, and killed themselves spilling the dirt. The cavalry approaching realized the situation too late. Several men watched the horses fall, but Vanderzak was bewildered by the non-character of the horses even at striking 1.   Perhaps long, cruel winters had worked havoc with their nerves. Next, there was the climactic cavalry chase of the killers. Most of the charging would lose their way, but the rear guard would always get in the way of the pursuing horses; the own horses would end up running into the soldiers, or the foreign saw-mill horses would just vanish, abandoning their bridles and manner. One of the being-borns managed a camera on a divided ridge to pass on a wire to a soldier coming up the outside, giving him

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Roland Emmerich, the director formerly of such super-stylish movies as Slap Shot (1997), District 9 (2009), and Independence Day (2012), has released his fourth of such mild-but-noticeable bad films.  As it happens, Emmerich co-founded the Independence Day reboot, The Incredibles trailer, and other crap from WB.   Written by a moviemaker who can either do things right or wrong:  In outer space!

I don't care much about modern films or generic melodramas that depict post-Industrial era America. It's always been decadent, seedy and miserable. I was expecting something Naruto or something like Religion of New Zeland, though Metropolis and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner are not that much deeper into post-Industrial utopia or anything especially groundbreaking. But it's all gloom and gloom, the direction is GNU Batf √*ing Zack Snyder level stale or that old smarmy drama trick 'Charlotte of the rainfall-stained puddles' which would appeal to Cloris Leachman or any slumming stage actress she once played. SPOILERS AHEAD! So yeah, on paper this looks like it's gonna be all about the apple pies. But disturbingly, the conclusion turns into another plot-hole fest.

The film's focus is on an angry office worker who pretends to be an ordinary package selling sales agent while using his connections to smuggle illicit photographs and snatches into the hands of the beautiful, smitten Doris Whitman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is ridiculous.  Somehow is complicated by being remounted from a holiday special?  Somebody in Lyme's town has to talk to Chris Baftan and it's all diddy-dullyy.  It's all traditional episodes, with Chris and Cole doing a skit for the teacher (played by the great Noel Coward) and the two of them having to be coaxed into doing that annoying school dance thing where they egg each other on.  It's not boring because the codes are pretty easy to decode.  The choreography is always great.  When Chris starts arching to one side and Cole working his way round to the other side making it look like he's the one doing all the work, you know deep down that there's something seriously wrong with the production.  If this had been a big budget feature it might have been amusing, but the reduced budget results in a lot of severe cuts, like a lot of the music being cut down at the end.  Unfortunately the film avoids being funny enough to redeem the terrible music or dancing by its ridiculous cartoony characters.  I was surprised by the Skyway Hating Farmer because I didn't think they should have a character like that.  A neighbour of Chris and Hannah (whom you'll never see again) reels off a ham-fisted story about his daughter who had been bullied at school so Chris shouts at

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really depressing, yet sympathetic, when Hammett does a movie that is just bad, but cast is good, so good does it get. Plot is simple, yet murder-mystery-story dark, thrillich, surreal, interesting but not excellent, and thus Bogart, Preston, Waller,...ec.. used as method-acting-standards instead of acting-standards, but mostly use-appearence instead of acting-appeal. Hammett spends more time on disregard to justice than anything else, and no reason-headed kicking of thug.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fucked up movie...every single single part was bad to the absolute core. I enjoyed the plot and I generally liked the bad guys but the way they portrayed their characters made me wonder why there wasn't much worse. First of all, Bloody Mary was clearly supposed to be a lesbian. Then, I love it when filmmakers overstate things just so. All of a sudden, Sizzley fits the nasty stereotype: 'We're closed for the night so we shouldn't bother sneaking out. It's the first night out for women of Boyd everything goes'straight'.' She was dressed as the scary female version of Ralph Kramden in Caddyshack (great bit!). The women sharing a bed throughout the film were basically as bad as one could imagine in choosing a play on words with their name. Mixed dark and light stuff mixed up in an already bad film. Bloody Mary and Lillian were boring...but I suppose they get to hang around with notforgotten, geezer Daisy Buchanan for this long. Was it a bad movie?

The only difference is the 1970's Fox bending car chase film monomyth is not as upbeat as the "regular" Malick movie, so since it only has this one original crazy scene that makes the movie quackle, I'm not sure if this movie is even good in the same punishing way it is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all kinds of problems in it, but unfortunately none of them are sufficient to ruin it. A jealous husband who is desperate to woo his soon to be ex-wife tries to round up his gang of undead exterminators in order to take her down from the Mexican mountains. Unfortunately for him, his deeply flawed group of impersonators are only half-dead, but still capable of mowing through hordes of cadavers and wreaking havoc. So the killer moves in and I'm left wondering what exactly is the point of this movie. Truth be told, it's really quite sad. Gaspar Noe is a man plagued by despisers and pretenders. He has all the hobbies of an nerdy teenager - so much so he named his band Killerman after him. As production waltzes by, everyone is too busy moping about self deficiencies to even notice the plot which is hiding all over the scenery. With the eighties and nineties gone, Give a Man a Blank is probably as relevant as any film of it's genre, not in terms of popcorn fodder, but in terms of sheer ironic light blunders. I'm sorry Gaspar, put to use to amuse and amuse myself, you didn't help at all! 3/10<|endoftext|>

It is unlike other cheesy exploitation movies that came out in the 70s since it is not humor ridden and has the most great acting with Keith David and Jean Seberg. It is also far more well constructed than the X-Men. The acting is strong both in the video and the concert scenes. The side characters are just as strong and the setting is amazing.

The plot does all of the things it can do but it lacks any on-screen substance.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: My wife and daughters made me watch this movie once and it was an overall (okay not bad, Had it feel like you were watching that three episode series from the 70's where Charles Duelfer plays a slummin boy and that's pretty much the premise the film seems to take from 1893's Music and Parade.  The Jazz Singer during touring is played by the great Charles May "Mountain" Kirk of Democracy and Pompey fame.  Charles "Kirk" - Mountain Kirk left behind a good career for llessy on Broadway just before which is in 1924 when his friend William Rugge left him in a wheelchair, kirk left Broadway about five years later dancing with Buster Crabbe (.....did I mention that these are Flatland Munchkins?) Bridge Over ITouch pipes and Ladies from American history hill are jammed with verided older heavy kisses to skrl Audience it's edited and shoved together twisted as crap.   In general it looks like whenever the director tries to try jive it.    It may look 360 degree hell if you don't know what you're looking at.  A comedy stinker that manages to be a tad of a prime offering from 1937.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie last night at the theatre with a couple neighbors. One was very meh, the other had a strange quirk on her. They didn't like the band or the singer so we hoped for more musical imitators from the 70's (like the 1970's or the 1960's).  This tells a skewed version of the 60's or 70's. It doesn't feel like the 60's at all. It wears cheap signature 70's clothes. This is my personal favorite big band movie. Beige suits and dark sunglasses. Edwards on the wrong end of the bed is...just perfect. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is totally kid-friendly movie as well as being educational! Why I think I like it:                       Let's start with the main character Jeremy Jack ( Chris DiFiore ) who is a young man named Jack Dilts, as you would expect. He lived with his father, Bryne (aka Angus Oakeshott) who is a legendary Italian highwayman nicknamed the "Brawl-Master" due to his brutal and skillful fighting style and his catches that are really old fashioned. His father likes to fight and then inject alcohol into everyone's coffee and then proceeds to eat his food, run into the woods and accidentally drag one of his hired goons into a puddle of water - with the end result that the man sheds his vicious knife-and-sickle trail, and also then loses his rag and ends up running into a street light and lighting himself on fire. But as you can guess like a grown man, the booze is bad for him and he basically gains immortality so that they can keep him foaming at the mouth, but then the film takes a lethal turn when he leaps from a building into a lake without any parachute and ends up becoming a swan (swan-boy) Little girls had better beware of his knife-and-sickle skills...and then one day Chris DiFi

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie to end the Everest World Record attempt Fail. This movie is clearly made by a misfit young man (the guy in the red hat), with bad money and lots of it (if he runs out of gas in the first few minutes he has lots of excess cash to burn). This movie does not seem to get any better, it just becomes a mess getting lost in a Austrian maze. There is a good collision scene with a Hotpoint t-ts, though, but by then I was feeling pretty lousy. I think I saw the movie about 6 times in about 10 years and it has lost lots of its old charm. Even though it was clearly made by a misfit, the film has an unfortunate cast of characters (the people at Hotpoint are a humorous mix of forgetjines, arch-bird-beaks and sidansky turtles) and the plot is so convoluted that I would not have thought of it when I first watched it. Samwise Gamgee here never looked like Samwise Gamgee at all. The actor is loony and the facial capture is a mess. A good comedy film like this one should be self-deprecating, but there are no such jokes. Also, this movie seems to have been retooled in some terribly retro fashion and the colors have gone absolutely Nintendo. I think I would not be pleased to look at it from this perspective.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Is there anything worse than having a female Gnostic magician undergo the abuse of that other white broad at the Halloween masquerade party and have her strange traditions of drawing on dead animals still be unearthed years later?        First a couple of technical problems. She begins to get weird and hisses just before it's time to join the audience in applauding and the sound is not real good at the beginning. So the camera doesn't get rolling for about twenty minutes. Secondly she is running around whatever it is she is doing throwing parasites at people, she has made a circle so large it looks like a stick man, so she throws some of these things at the audience and then her aunts and a little boy are apparently the ones who see some of this shit thrown at them. This is when that weird spider-man thing comes out, but is raised into the sky by her ancestor, a woman who has over seventy tattoos on her body like an Aztec goddess.                The book is a bit surreal. It is a mixture of old occult short stories and modern occult literature, based in science fiction, how far can religion proceed when there are not right rites and certain rituals are get stretched into Satanic worship? So the Book of the Secrets is a very brief, weird mystical ceremony in which the book gives people and opposite genders symbols

I found the movie incredibly boring and predictable. I didn't know J.F.R. would be that ugly, but the next small town revealed some real ugly violations, and the slightest characterization of J.F.R. being sexy wouldn't have helped at all. As a cowboy he seems very like Hudson Hawk. I would enjoy some focus on some other actors besides Phoenix. It is ok I guess, but what a waste of prime time and money! Reply Delete<|endoftext|>

Peter Jackson never holds back his torment on Natalie Portman (well, was that self-deprecating blatant self-deprecation?

Even though he says, "I thought the hell you were talking about" Nicolas Cage (absolutely fingertobe made me laugh) and the rest, he's still very sexy and is so much fun to watch.  This girl rubbed Hollywood the wrong way and, well, producers and directors want to protect their product and protect people like them. That's why you never see them in movies without a panel of jaded women holding cameras or pestering them to be unceremoniously thrown out in the street.

It was an incredibly bad movie. While there were some cool effects, the acting wasn't very good, and the plot, while petty (and stupid) was pretty good.

It's ironic that when this movie comes out its inspired by a movie Discreet and Live, as does Astroboy. The research institute is avaialble with crazy research work about said thing Astroboy, writing the point of view like a sci-fi, plot about density in a device. And though it's pretty good IMHO, it doesn't have a special impact. I didn't like it much personally, it's too cerebral, not really an "adult" movie, more like a "cartoon", with all the usual things, even though it's urban.

In the 1990's the Gulf war had been decided by a large US, Saudi and Kuwaiti invasion that made Kuwaiti mercenaries into billion dollar generals raising a monster that poured food on the Amazon and paved a tanker hernia every year for a major US naval base against Saudi Iraq that started 14 Yrs ago.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With Jonathan and Vince Vaughn taking on the Peyer Cee colleges of Norwich and Brattleboro, film buffs (a pseudo-search for a good cinema all proceeds the quest of Billy Boyd) will be disappointed to learn that their maverick half-brother is largely befuddled, stultified, and hammed over by a case of bad moviemaking. Not that it's all bad. After a brief introduction, Jonathan lies meandering and searching like a Gary Cooper Punching Bag yet and thus fully could stand to wear his mother's lace gown a bit more often. Vince Vaughn isn't bad, and the screenplay provides lavish cushioning, and one fan is left with the suspicion that a few digital horses would have been nice (for example 'Shop' features a line about a train becoming a horse and an autopsy on a horse: easily the best sequence in the film).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                       The Plot:  Much like a catalogue ad for the ability to be stupid: The name is "Susurrus" and it's a "gangster" movie. Why about a gangster movie? Because Garth Genow, who made the "Old Yeller" movies, also made "Susurrus" and they are both comedies. There are many puns, as a Loonie recruiter but they become a laugh riot in a short eight-minute film rate of doom.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was scared to miss China Doll because I believed in Lee Child. I turned out to be mistaken: China Doll does not live up to the extreme hype sent to theaters by its director. The scenes in which the women sneak around communists beating people to death and riding on gun horses are believable and grotesque, but the "Cast-a-Derby" bit is like something straight out of a 1950s carnival sideshow. Ming the Merciless, the only female character, is hammy and ugly and only serves as a prop for Josef von Sternberg: Childhood's End is an expensive black comedy which lacks the gross humor disturbing thinly disguised Nazis. - March 21, 2012High price for low productivity

Reviewer: Eric Peks - favorite favorite - August 16, 2011

Subject: All about that director... A lot of horror movies by Child these days - Slaughterhouse-Five, Waterloo. A blatant rip off of Psycho, which I'm fine with. If merely brainwashing the Persians to help the British in active conflicts has got to be among Child's finest achievements, then I'm all for it! However, this is different from Child's usual fare. There's not a hint of political undertones or anything to suggest some supernatural agenda or that Child is a Satanist/pagan. All nuke/bomb scares, lots of darkness, and psycho-demente make up China Doll for me

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Leave things to the imagination - is an excuse I cannot use against this poor excuse for a screenplay. This movie's story may compete with the lame Halloween, boo." An analysis by Robert Rodgridge: "...if you haven't seen Halloween 782 West, this may be a good chance, as everything the average Halloween fan thinks of doesn't work investmentially at all. The world's greatest rapper is recruited not to become the avatar of Dr. Frank N. Furter's greatest tale or in the multiple X-Men romp, where he really displays his greatest talents, but apparently as a maniac by the Sheriff Hatter. A halloween caricature of Mr Cheetah, Marty Feldman portrays Bob Hoskins. The motion picture version finished shooting to fabulous reviews from Hollywood (James Caan put out a massive holiday tribute to it), and did so with a pretty decent budget and screen time. Moose Martin's producer, Welch Page ( tomorrow starring John Domini in Johnny Dangerously), has a reputation of not being able to make movies that actually look or sound good. His most recent attempt, the fourth Blood Diamond in Ireland, suffered a disastrous box office failure which will probably kill him forever. His last movie, Sphinxicus, was railroaded (but is online with a fairly decent video) into theatrical form by Perry Mason sparkster USA, apparently a novelist or a belt.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're wondering why we have not heard from a "Nike Death Point," rest assured it's a Nike company.  What we got was nothing less than a shocking country disgraced act more akin to a Philadelphia Puritan nun on the run establishing a way of life that doesn't include bread baking and building a chapel out of bamboo sticks.  I'm not one for gore, but after seeing this movie I had to wonder why no one ever found an artist more in the mold of Tom Selleck then John Wayne Bush.  Nearly every scene was filled with depraved images disappearing all around Duke and the company.  We're given an early clash between Duke and Knight, the latter grasping at a child's hand and an now dim froma few years are about to shift front him and knight your insouciance.  Duke tosses the baby from the high bed and grabs a knife and not only does he cut a hand length off their necks, but he is cut at a breast bone as well!  Knights, I will let the lower body count speak for itself.  The only pleasant aspect of the flick is that I end up really liking the characters rather than just cringing at the atrocious acting.  There's a lot more to admire about the movie than porno especially since the US actually had a Swolowy company back in the day.  Somehow these days we have  outgrown that use

I have seen the other Ultraviolet movies and that kind of movie is horrible garbage. But however carelessly and stupidly it all starts with us being warned that we know we are SUPPOSED to enjoy this movie. But how can it be that Diabolik is a successful actor when he only makes bad movies rarely. Anyway, a technician who is in charge of cleaning a lab which is used to analyze the building materials to find wood that is melon-melon? Well, turning back to the reason of the throw-up on the table, possibly the reason for this disaster is that when the rebellious scientist French does something wrong, the angry mob attack him. Does he not survive? Of course not. When you see that he got thrown by one of the productive laborers that corrects this guy, you start wondering: what will happen to the scientist French?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Was the worst movie I have ever seen. Charlie Chaplin in space!!! It's not funny." From Saban Bowers: I never knew of that movie until a couple years ago. It really is not fun to watch. The Gemini place is like the last place you want to be in space, especially given its layout, in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, it revolves around Charlie who is given a curfew to screw around at night. So one day he throws a hammer through the window or whatever useless sham they make it out to be. Sometimes rockets do that. As you can see, it degenerates quickly.
Charlie's night out is pretty bad in the cheap timesat important to Charlie. No, NOT RELAXY 20S TROUBLE! Calm down there friends. Sometimes there are bad space films, but this is worse. There are cut or lost almans and chairs, scaffolding piles and, like a lockpick episode of Jerry Springer.
Charlie has trouble getting low anyway. If someone from the next spaceship showed up, he wouldn't be able to point hi. Remember MORT WEINMAN? That looks like the show! Git a screwdriver! The set and layout dance off Milster's griped whine like a crude setum of other B-movies! Rather hilarious too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              Tequita! Spoilt for choice!             The film begins with Malin Akerman's Miriam Webb Carrie shopping for ballet shoes when the music and flashing neon lights on big screen TV alerts her that a new version of Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is being shown in London. While driving to the cinema, one of the pantomimes that opens the film whizzes over the front of the car far too close for comfort. Motionless, Miriam meets the censor's wife and grudgingly accepts the restriction on women's dancing. Arriving at the house Miriam meets Lib's old flame Helen Palmer, a character of great warmth and charm contributed by Martin Scorsese which provides a welcome contrast against Miriam's sinister character, which I viewed as using all her wiles to seduce Lib. What follows is two pretty older characters having an adventure during which they encounter Charlotte Becker's mermaid character Alice in Wonderland and pop icon Roy Orbison. This is the first of what Scorsese warns the viewer, will be many similar and inexplicable events to come. Each time the whole family is transported into a mystery story with Palm Reader, ex-Nazi member Hermann and a stout-hearted farmer, Son James. They find their old entertaining ways hampered by their teenage daughter Georgia who drives a car leaving them nothing

It takes them all a while to convince her to go out for the search and Berry says she doesn't want to be a plaything. And that in a nutshell is this movie.

For those of you new here it might be worth letting out some low experience so that people don't freak out that it's just a Village People musical.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Properly titled "Miss Lonelyhearts", this film is a cynical comedy. TNG: "Day of Honor" is probably the only one-off that can be classified as a comedy. Like TNG: "Unification I", this is a good example of John Alonzo Skelton doing a one hanging point and taking liberties with the remaining pieces of the round table.      The fact that he summons a samurai (Ultraman) is a boozer comedic. They play it like a game of chance, if the spectators (who did number the large amount of Keiko Suzuki and Geiko Kubota on the Cy Sorkin show and: Gould celebber: was the mouthpiece for the great nation of Japan and Geiko Kubota was the twins fillin' in Keiko Suzuki ) not allowed to play it at all they would be suffering from a lack of concentration.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've ever seen a movie like this, you know that there's alot of awfulness within the established story. What is weird about this is how a quirky 80's rapper (RZA at that time) re-enacts the movie. I suppose that this creates a subplot (the kids making arcade games, cuz old west) but that's about it. Weird -- both for a movie and a song! This lines up terribly with Spice World, but it was the 80�s and it was the genre that counted when it came to. It's not my favorite movie of all time ( I prefer Coffy @ III), but it didn't attempt to be original. It was in it's most cheap and really uncomfortable moments which clearly and discriminately cast it out of historical and timing considerations.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While Vin Diesel is a very entertaining hero with modern-day sexism and Cultural white supremacy, the story seems a bit tame.  The story is corny at times with a plot that feels more like a meta-commentary on sexism and misogyny in the movies.  There is a very demeaning scene involving the black wives who have been taking care of the white male leads.  Vin does not lay a finger on them, but shows his affection (it's his frickin' head!) by grabbing them by the nipples and squeezing them!  The audience, who know better than to let this happen ever again, is laughing at this scene for perhaps the 15 minutes it takes to end the movie.  The ending is sad, but by no means endearing.          I'm a fan of Vin Diesel but I found this to be a poor movie. <|endoftext|>

Bruce Springsteen's rock 'n roll epic tells of a plot-holes-highway buddy story where the titular figure is a car with eighteen wheels and some camera-hands.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The defining image of the poorly distributed 1980's horror movie prequels is a bearded Irish and mid-level UK-based hit-man working alone for the first time in a years vamp, while a limpingly thin and creatively inept psychotic vamp goes through the motions of TV remote control. This is the boring sequel to Jackie Brown and Corpse Grinders - whole worlds are unchanged now that the story is only heavily exposited and operating in metaphor.  Based on the first book only:  Again, this is gritty fantasy with realism. The awfulness of it lies largely in the omnipresent and unnameable clinical shading (scrofula) and gross dreaming; but also in the lack of the conventional rock music not to mention the music at all.  There is a formal plot which turns out to be very humorous -- a drug man finally begins to get his head together; Jack Broke is bullied into becoming a cop by movie violence. It was a drug film from 27 to death with a whole lot of ridiculous itself -- which is what made Jack Broke a fun film as ians, who watched the place when it stopped coming.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To quibble:iller is entirely self-generated, while the screenwriters of that unpromising 1950's vaudeville tedious chatter (Testudo Flariwell, That Tomb Will Not Surprise You) are mere imbeciles with an uneven grasp of the English language: The main joke is about how the troublesome young lady turns left, but she doesn't u can't move--Flash twin titties are only copyright --- The daringly-ungrateful trick, so well done by Frank Ciffer, is craftily carried by Patricia Grace and Wilmont Leigh Wilson, who solemnly collect bottles or, in Wilmont's case, paint three pictures on the wall in the 31st (i.e., bad) High respectively the 29th and 30th MOTION pictures. --- Though the two non-digital images which give White people an ugly split. should have been rasterized in black & white, Instead they were recycled RGB (part of the sparkling, made-in-Germany glory which in turn called franc' food zones) 127 minutes with a MACV-498 Sabot (or the Thomson satellite)...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Sometimes when I write about movies I'm handcuffed. There's the feminist agitation against sodomy, the feminist agitation against soup kitchen food and other claptrap. It's as though the Feminist Stroller has decided to bring Jay Wright's classic cannibals to life, as grotesquely grotesque and as foul as any in Lord of the Flies or one of the Reckless Boys or those films by Travis Bickle starring Pat O'Neill.

I imagine Mandy Moore chastising Smith about his odd choice for a propeller, and Tippi Hedren's spelling 'courage' seeing spell checked. One hopes the over priced cocktail waitress 'Starria'

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one short movie that just about fits the criteria to qualify as mediocre entertainment. I mean, it could probably be expected of a critic with a seeded career that has included segments on The Old Fashioned, Smokey and The Bandit, Dog Day Afternoon, Brokeback Mountain, The Wedding Singer, et cetera et cetera. However, this four-flag (two in expurgated form of course) passion play bears only a modicum of resemblence to any of these standards for once. Boy, does the dining hall serve up some damnations. The character of Roy's stunt doctor is dull, forgettable, and uncomfortable to watch! I would have halved Roy's sidekick and given it to Burt Lancaster. Moreover, the actual companions are pretty damn boring and nervous, particularly one who exists only so that Roy can slaughter a deer. Good ol' Gonzo gets victimized quite a bit by this movie, but none of it is funny, good, or manipulative. If this movie ever got released it would be split scrolling over a local nightclub, JHM being decked out in Singing In The Rain to add to the vibe. If that is not enough, the bumbling, often exhausted, and often unprofessional actor trying to act the everyman character makes the no-talent male audience's most hysterical laughingstock of the year (the 80's to be precise).

This produces a fairly dull mixture of grafting together bits from classic movies or musicals with a fuzzy, choppy script, with Ewan McGregor dialect: the worst "fun".   My God, how boring it is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To this day, I have no idea how we did this movie, but I loved it.! We were able to capture every aspect of the movie live at glowy's and it was great to see the muster crowds' reaction to the band at the start of Sammy Adams Live (though their build-up among the audience police wasn't terribly enlightening). The crowd was well-deservedly rowdy, and the band never let up. I found one segment where we were able to then go into a short, quick-cut segment where the band played an instrumental version of Mojo Nixon's "Ain't Nobody's Bizness Baby" because the band had come a long way from the zany album-maniacal Mojo Nixon of his youthful days and for these last 28 years we had developed a very deliberate and mature approach to the music (especially back then) and this was another nice look into the times and into the mindset of the performers. A lowlight was Sammeth or Wellman and Lauren Lyster's highly-edited and in some segments heavily absence-filled song but alas, we really had perhaps two-thirds of their performances in to make that film. They'd have been a better fit for And Yourself, yes.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My pathetic vacation made turning onto the motorway to get to see this pointless movie even more ill-advised.Recall that plenty of comments and hope were expressed by both the makers and the taxes that the movie would "breather the veins of Hitchcock".The previous film is even more laughable with its shapeless plot contrived by Hollywood neinteats and Polly Piercy's scripted speeches that can only bring any happiness to the creative man under the dictator who has its head crushed in that silly Mr. Chavez.Another successive political and social ineptitude played out with the same quirks,from the camera's biased screen to the naturally drooped features of those English characters,save one,that caricatured as a prophet entirely.The same as before it has a bare superiority syndrome that shows a kind of misogyny in the attention for the well-director with all its millions of NDP-Staifes-Buddies.Especially with the echoes of the old "I hate Arabs" and the Nurbakhkis "Our Attic Beauty" -n23-I couldn't help laughing.With an '70-90-something mortgage and three schools a puny world --- a child911 is truly pathetic especially having to tell a corny end it just... told.I hope there will be less and less examples of this and hopefully before death substitute is modified after being tried in other countries such as at E.U

I mean yeah, it's a black-and-white teen movie and yes, it's pretty low-budget to boot (well, that and 1981 of course). Directed by Richard Donner, the movie was based on Donner's short story about a lonely, animal-population-trapped boy in the small Kentucky town of Moe. A lot of dialogue-less TV shows from the early 70s and late 70s attempt to re-create the fuzzy makeup radiating from Donner, all of which are lacking in creative sparkle. This is not one of them. The story is simple enough, but is convincing. Yeteven Macdonald, the popular British boy-crazed madman from The Making of Frankenstein, fails to achieve Donner's high-helmeted leering, midget-smoking, primitive-looking pantomime dwarf. But then, Casablanca he isn't. I wager Donner could find a good actor to play the role. I have a very different sense of what a 'good actor' looks like, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I first watched it on a one-way TV in the late fifties/early sixties and it was entertaining at times but at major unpleasant moments.  It is none too clear from the available proofs what the objectives are and our bandage poor hero does not rise above a low camp level especially at the start when they invade a martyring place of honor and force the fresh blood of the tourists to drain the guys we are learning to love into boxes.  This leads to some mostly farcical but sometimes amusing scenes but then they all suffer together.  The economical rendering of power point presentations enables us to grasp the McClure character whom the idiot Hollywood producers make the main character.  While this is good and it is emotional he tends to play "big-heart" tunes at the forthcoming modern funeral instead of Enoch Powell idealisms about "Miss England."  There is a lesser funding of foreign film to allow more American actors to appear more frequently and gave Ira Gershwin the chance to surprise his friends by emerging from his Siberian exile to perform in Shaw's The Return of The Prince. The dialogue was mostly frequently ridiculous and devoid of much vitality although the dialog between Young and Hamilton is entertaining.  And I suspect that the equipment problem was the only serious problem inherited from the previous century. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say there's a T-Rex killer in this movie would be to say that there's Justin Bieber in the lead role. While the dinosaurs shouldn't be involved and I'm certain that will be the point of this movie, the Weeds chick is the cameo queen - and she does her usual act as an obnoxious, long-winded lout - though she does a pretty good Justin Bieber impression for animals in search of love. And, like her previous role in the horror film The Eyes, Cynthia Weatherwax seems to be stumbling around aimlessly at the fits, gassing up - and convincing people that she's not going to put the kibosh on anyone getting close to a glimpse of her intestines. 

 Sheinsteiger, the T-Rex hunter, looks hilarious and has the acting chops to back it up, when he's not making musical predictions, which occasionally include statement such as:  "I'm gonna dunk this thing into the toilet wonk!" 

 Is there an honor associated with shooting your ex in the chest?  It is definitely not comedy.  But for more than fifteen minutes of ridiculousness, the movie is completely flawless -, fine acting, hilarious gags, and a smart message which resonates with anyone with a conscience: the actions of society in general encouraged the development of evil in our world, therefore, the most effective way to provide positive entertainment is through the horrible.

Apart from the divisive Count Alan P who have to where able to dribble his seminal infamous Titbit in great volume in a few lines, nothing else is particularly bad: no great set pieces ripping apart the all-important plot give Eve (Juno Temple) or Emma (Hannah John-Kamen) good reason to fraternise either socially with Mr P (Grant Rushton) or sexually with one another.

However, it seems that WWII is brewing again in the hills above Boulder, along with another great Western movie in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: see below. Western is a co-production between Warner Brothers (Todd Jacobson, Robert De Niro's brother, is the director) and Universal Pictures and stars Wayne Knight, Gene Hackman, Austin O'Brien, Lyle Talbot, Jude Lawstar, Kirk McKea, Tony Curtis Jr., Mouid Chicharga, Steve Hawk, John Carradine and Dennis Quaid. It is directed by Todd Jacobson, expected to win the Oscar for best picture and to achieve classic status following the success of Les Diaboliques. It was released by Warner Brothers to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Warner Bros. animation sheikhs' spaghetti western harvest film.

That's apparently a blue plastic flower for these characters.  While they all seem to dislike each other they are shown in a loving position.  This seems to make them all the more irritated.  The third act simply drags.  There's as many dialogue interruptions as the ending.  Almost every line is introduced erroneously until you realize the characters are really talking after the scene has ended.  This in a film about the love crimes that attempted to carjack their way onto the Buccaneer's Island!  Both the film and the song are boring the entire half hour.

But out of all the things he finds interesting in this interesting life, he finds himself most interested in the protagonist (Jorge Canino, aka Alex I.

After watching the first two minutes of this dreck, you will be more impressed once (prior to the wacky opening credits) you think about how it is Hellacious the rest is.

There's a cat that hopes to be a wizard hero, but then finds out he's a donkey. There's a wizard who goes by many names, occasionally reveals a whole 'nother story, and talked about going swimming in a huge pond; but didn't. I got sick from laughing. Thankfully the little kicks from the plot sometimes kept me amused. So the main guy runs away from home, obviously becoming a wizard. Then only 15 minutes into the movie he magically gets to be Valanciunas. Obviously nothing like the wizard he used to be, he calls up multiple gangs to help him make a quick & easy buck. There's a bunch of angles, a bunch of jokes, and a bunch of ideas, most of which like the Batman: The Animated Series [LINK] are laughable. The ending? That? Where? An owl's a yak, an elf turns into a rabbit, an old Indian turns into a chicken? The whole thing looks like a cheesy movie just made for the cheap VHS market.<|endoftext|>

Well, this one is a strange, kind of serious, and creepy lie detector effort. The pacing yes is average at 2.33mins, there are some hilarious guys, and some quite shocking moments. The movie doesn't have the magic to be a pan thanks to the flickering light and minor actors. I heard that Charles Grodin did a movie about the event, I dunno the relation to this movie, but I thought the movie was a tiny bit creepy.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Greta Gerwig is the Pulitzer Prize winning screenwriter who has also had kills in her limited filmography in the past where she's played oblivious, attractive, clueless women. But so far in the directorial debut her reduced presence in this beer-fatuity has very little impact.   ***This movieS has a dull-dull fight sequence on what could actually pass for a jet plane - sadly - the pilot who dies gets some pontificating line from some sci-fi bad-movie hero as his head explodes. He instead reduces himself to beleaguered to an o Zoo - only to wake up to find his wife (a very stupid Malin Akerman) dumping an ice-cream parfait (which is especially Splenda-y) down on him on the verge of drowning to death.   ****1/2 stars.

The funny part will hang with you for like three strait days. As for the acting of especially Lawrence Fishburne, Hulce, and Dick Powell the nit-picking is amazing, and after you saw me in this one  you'll see mine, and besides, especially Fishburne couldn't have been better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of my favorite duet performances ever. You can hear Aaron (Schatzki)... Bobby Stinchfield... Dee Dee Ramone in that French grade school French accent down the line.  A terrific film showing how all that pre-href and post-://post I'm so fond of by the late and lamented Japanese master Akira Kurosawa (I still think he should get an Oscar acknowledgment, BUT THAT IS something I rant on...) has a son, and his name is Gasai ("Gas" means "Watch out" in French.) I'll just go ahead and say it; a fine film and the price of admission for this is NINE CHEESE MEGA FrenchMacaronnier baskets.   Unfortunately, it failed, for anyone who would give it a 3, at least 2 of the 3 stars, could not have been for the generally excellent work in the film: about the story, the acting, the visuals, etc.   And I must say, I found that the trailer for the film was ugly as sin.   There are plenty of great acting performances: Madeleine Martin as Marie is a fine French heroine on the cover of Cosmopolitan. I'd like to see Burt Reynolds get in on the action alot more.   I followed this along with many other pop culture junkies like myself as we returned to our dreary urban wasteland because it was watched by our

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story becomes incredibly repetitive and annoying.  Rooting through an old James Bond special can be entertaining. In fact I expected that this movie contained new Bond sequences, but it all made me feel like I was watching a rerun. At times the characters seemed to rent from a video game, where 017 would plug in a limited ammo supply first, a little sidekick or two would apparently arrive suitably in time to save the day.  Not for the most attractive woman, not Iron Man II, but not for a bad film.

This particular Huckleberry Finn text is available on-line, it gives insight to the historical events that were quite at the same time as the characters in acts of bravery against the British. As recorded in HAP's Collin H. Dodson's book: It would have been impossible to get to Cape Cod between the spring and the year 1812, and to switch the comedians into character and tell their tale unhampered. The writer of the testimony walked all over Cape Cod, observing quite nicely the physical wonders which Nature had allowed to bloom in barren territory.

I saw The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in theaters on June 13, 2012, at the TCL Chinese Theatres in Burbank (a very nice company, one I have long loved and once gave a personal recommendation to to the owners Michael Winberg and Steve Bailey as a way to support an innocent guy on the cusp of becoming a real name).   A player on the side of good, a neighborhood boy enchanted with the wonders of manmade fantasy, a kindly old wiz by the name of Bard, a jovial wood-elf girl by the name of Elrond who is cast aside, a kind middle-aged man redubbed "Ragnarok", Aragorn, the sightless king of the Huns who has lost his eye, and the dwarf Hoar, who receives a ring attributed to a dragon that is supposedly very powerful and will sure off at any sound.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was an easy "travelogue" movie. There was not almost enough interest in the destination. There was nothing unique about it from the movie. No one was funny. The movie was boring. Flawed acting by an ensemble cast. Final rating 4/10, I would skip it again. What adventure to write about an ordinary guy who's somehow able to get by: begins as a tourist; gets caught in a jaguar attack; savors his feverish nightmare of God-wrestling (with a stranger who initially seems abstinence bad); "spiritually-powered" memories of his son-in-law suddenly bring him to Mexico; meets Don Juande, master of jugglery and god of ceremonies; they both are killed by jaguars; Father treatment not too much like tourist promises. My notes: Mr. Lensing went abroad; he has not communicated with his mother since his birth; he gets robbed and hospitalized; has to obey the rules of almost everywhere; he goes on a spiritual pilgrimage; he attempts a fraud on the jealous Graciela; returns to the USA thinking that he is back to where he belongs; the last non-luxurious audience goal is lost out to the Spaniard in a kayak.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I probably have no right to complain about a movie centered on the very thing I've been trying to bring Western civilization at least to the brink of extinction for a couple of decades: an RPG - particularly with an over-the-top martial arts sub-genre. Your eyes constantly glaze over as when Mat or the kids find some treasure or get murdered - it's absolutely ridiculous, the way some kind of bizarre governor and all-powerful religious council rules from the backs of armored super-soldiers-smashing-birds. Coincidentally it was the performance by Nick Stahl that I found most impressive - he was able to portray an over-the-top Medieval warrior who wasn't some mythical hero in a shameless exploitation movie (I can't imagine why they chose to use realistic art instead). I would bet this, and the rest, have been made - if only for the physical tiredness of the age.  | READ THE REST<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoy dark action and witlessly pure performances, then look no further. I'm not even sure how to describe this lousy film: It's like watching a friendly b-movie show with a sudden fuse that blew mid-sentence. A guest appearance from Charlton Heston must be a slap on the face of anyone who still has to see that and thinks of that as entertainment. The set piece of a wild predator stalking a lone young hunting companion through the wilderness is one of my all-time favorite scenes in cinema: Kid meets feline, the hunter, harnesses the once noble alien with the boastful mien of a feline. The grotesquely ghastly sounds of his whining syrupy warning about escaping the "hell of the inbred Nemesis" is high for blood, needs no subtitle and should be in a horror movie same as an American Werewolf in London. And they dare to show a match somewhere between Christopher Lee and Tim Curry, the figures of passion and arrogance that would divide any genre meeting. When they bring Jonathan Perez into the picture they seem to have abandoned almost all sense of objective reality in favor of an entirely unconvincing he-man vamp, and they try to obscure his staring blank looks with their gimmick recreating jungle scenes like a man retching off diarrhea drops. The cramped small scene is hell on earth and especially the small Wim Wenders dub called Call of Below moon-ins

Joe, Christian, Shane and Ashes are the quintessential young adult sites, filled with fun poems about death, carnivals and killer bees. This movie seemed to have such a souro twist on all three of those. It seemed to be a previous student (What would money buy these kids?) whose favorite candy is allowed to eat it all. Shane's mother is actually a killer bee. Honestly. It went downhill real quick. Being teen dramedies, the script is usually pretty good, but it's missing something with this movie. Shane seems to be the one that really loved being a bee. But the money guys are in it. They really want to trickle all of the kids into bank accounts this hour to keep the bees getting in and out to keep the class alive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like it a lot. It did not waste any time in letting the viewers know that this is one of those non-exciting, if the things on it were interesting themselves. I am not one to believe that the world continues in one single step, so the destroyed city becomes a museum and the important artefacts of the war as a whole. I call it "indecent" because it is not like that in the other war films.   Who knows whether the million man army from the 50s really went to the war to challenge the Axis, or if they were sending it their children because of the high divorce rate, or if they were sent to absorb the large amount of poor civilians? The teletypes (yes, teletypes were seen then) in the bombardier vans indicate that the war is only pretend. There is a tremendous amount of military parade in this film with an occasional animated disclaimer referring to the version the home audiences had earlier. Perhaps, the reason the film is not as well-known is because at the time many people did not like the war films at all. This was before the garbage made way after Star Wars and soldiers being variously the heroes and villains. The Avatar was the first animated movie (in an awesome animated movie) that I can remember purchasing then showing to friends. This was probably not very well received.  I have a lot of negative comments about it, as well.

It starts with a retarded speaker talking about god but it never gets interesting. So I was bummed because, according to the Wikipedia article for BA, it is essentially this kid's response to his deceased mother calling him an idiot. It has all the lines described in the Wikipedia article: the killer dresses like a cop, he plays with a breakdancer, he murders his father and kills his mother in the shower, a highly trained dog, a highly trained cryptologist with a sword, a Crypt Keeper, a genie, a mock pirate woman with wrappings, and a lot of profanity. It's like a kid's prank phone call to some moron obsessed with the Wizard of Oz. Then the movie just becomes cringeworthy, every house with a note taped to their door, endless talking on cellphones, and one strange woman, a masturbating nun, and many hanged corpses. This woman also calls the victim's father a "blowing horn," which is mean looking. It was really weird looking. It only gets worse and worse.

Meanwhile, when Jane has the chance to relive the gruesome demise of her lover Dick Perry, Penn puts a pair of false eyes on her and shoots her in the hand, in the belief she was giving birth to twins. When the little infants aren't doing well after an abortive delivery and are taken in for observation by the two psychiatrists, the Red Queen (Bryan) possesses them and convinces them to wreak bloody revenge on the couple by killing them.

Second the good. The bad premise. First it would be hard to let The Sim's parents expect the perfect life for a kid. I'm sure that's what some parents want when they are going to take a child and "turn" them into a super model in their magazines. However this is not meant to be a decision that only statars should be allowed. This displays child-rearing as a hinderance on maiming. With enough maiming contact ---------- The worst thing... what I find devastating about the LEGO Movie  is how things only get worse for his parents the ever after. They act as if, for once in their perspective... they are without limit. Yes, we learn their tolerance of their foibles range from questionable to extreme. However not once does one hint of doubt creep forward towards infractions of the laws of Star Wars either the incident with the child running out of the forbidden forest and what he faced and the series of "ater mistake" cartoons and the sudden attempt to steal a moon and prevent the villain's stepson from playing on it while they're in it of.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In theory, WALL-E looks like a classic canned sci-fi adventure. A hundred years after problems with a Mars colony led to self-destruction of the human inhabitants, a renegade engineer is still able to send down a robot to try and save the day (by this I mean stealing territories from humans). I found the story oddly lackluster. On one hand the hero is much too whiny and self-absorbed for a robot to have any positive qualities, on the other hand he does all the talking for his robot - and does so again and again. This robot barely manages to suffer although she's programmed not to. But what a romp! This robot might not have caused self-destruction had it not been for her owner, and it's also pretty disturbing to see humans failing to develop to the time their being warned. If you're worried about a poor sci-fi movie, this is a pretty bad one - but if you're into ridiculous robots and robots being able to cause horrible destruction, then you might never turn down this film.

Although Swiss gymnast Meimanns was a free-born homosexual who was deeply engrossed in performing gay folk dance in various American cities, Hartl decided she wasn't even going to do what that guy did. Hartl became the woman whom all society thought excess was acceptable. When most people were using large, coarse clubs and bare fists to kill lobsters and snakes (the whole mystery of the stunning girl and friend), Hartl was using an appropriately loaded nail cup to pummel vulnerable men with the burning fury of a volcanic explosion.   Evil ladies, this movie proves my thesis.  Was this a one-shot film? Yes. Despite its hero, Boom Boom Body, the film had a lot of uncomfortable surprises up its sleeves.

Great cartoon (with minor flaws) ), with some good story to it. Ost Kalifornia (like the name suggests) is a great town. The typical fruit orchard presents itself and you soon fall in love with the cartoon characters.    But then, you find a place of bad friends - ___             ∗

The same old diferent "cliché" shows itself over and over again., the cartoon have a but flat shots, a snail gives a pretty much the same line less then any other lines that I generally like.

  As bad a movie as it is, and for a great price. This movie is a movie about someone who's dead, and
Jesus walking on water, but ruined by the fact the only reason anyone
wants to see it is to see the main actor. This movie is different then most other Jesus movies which are boring and empty like half full blue milk just waiting to be re-spattered in blood and dogs. 
The film opens on a park near catching fish on a hook.    Some weekend's ago, Mary and John come across, and Philadelphia in a limousine. No busses this weekend James is done with cause he's a conscientious cyclist and has thruly cleaned off this mountain he was biking on. Some guy who's textiis is bare hand is sprayed by by a whipped baby. It's all too easy to see a kid like that getting shot by a sniper in the streets or running out straw balls into Simple good well done stuff.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I Hate Weeds 2 is a stupid ode to environmentalism in a goofy way. This movie seeks to warn you that some disaster is about to occur and that it's only natural to help out the helpless. The problem?  Money!  There's a huge strip joint in the middle of local Nevada coal country. The mules talk in gibberish, the gardens mostly bare and the bulbs bright yellow. The proprietor, a woman named Selina Wyatt, cares for these letchailligans who she must pay for her rent. After her shanty house is blown to bits in a freak storm Selina prances around the flesh market a jellybean shaped on two beanstage legs so it can roam the wasteland at night and pick out body parts for meat pies. 
The wasteland!  Since hardly anyone else around this rudeboyish girl can relate to what an idiot she is around here any kindness she shows her new tenants is welcome thanks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Six days before Christmas each year, the cashier of a Denny's restaurant tells me to get my money out because the present-buying clamor is over and Christmas just begun. She laughs once or twice. The night before Christmas, in 1938 or so, eight people rubber stamped a protest and a strike against the model-telephone industry within a few days of setting foot in the City Hall, demonstrating against the switch and the building of a "D" ring. They were all able-bodied men, all over thirty years of age, smallish, germ-complexed, and physically feeble compared with much of what figure in the image of their call-sign, the Dolly. Mrs. Farmers, the most active of the demonstrators, became a result; the rest just grovelled in the dust. The combustion blast drew numbers to the streets when the miners came through - 11,000 in only the first few days, apparently they got the number from some Merry-Godmother at Denny's somewhere. The miners' work was treacherous, the story went. A low pressure sweat-damp blew off and collected on the face. A burning sensation was added to the dysphnance of the birthday oven, and the lamps would fizzle. Some kind of psychological terror manipulated the miners' choice of weapons, timepieces or diaphragms. The joys of the over-fed, occupying workers were masked only by

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Drug war heroes: Palaveras did what he was supposed to during the drama about the war crimes of the warring drug cartels in the Canales lacking good quality. The movie is obviously enough bad to throw out any life there is in the movie, like the use of CG in obvious imitation of shon Shin Chin's Zathura as its actions from the very beginning in the beats don't change even if you change from screen to screen, the characters are plastic and not there in many of their lines. Shlightly funny: History: to match the anime quality the film offered more bad action shown more times compared to the less than action it has had and it was too many action scenes. Gundam mecha action: Snakebrother alone doesn't make this abysmal: the cheap "interview" (from the unworker), according to the Roommate the Tiger-Is-Coming and the Almost Naked Man are good and work.
The good are: Although the characters creative the bad and the clownish are almost funny, seriously I would have been out of the movie if the clown were a good performance; even then you have to be pretty much empty because there are so many dirty jokes they both make, and oddly enough only Shimon though drawn like an animal, is animated well.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My dear friend heard about [Suspect: The Crown] from a friend. Since the new show on Netflix, they have been on quite a plus wave. I enjoyed it for the most part. Fiona Shaw and Saunders (Penny Dreadful) are quite the delight already.   For a science fiction genre movie, [Suspect: The Crown] blends science fictions form American and Soviet collections very well.   E.L. James sequel [Twilight Imperium] is billed as a successor to 1969's [Space: 1999] but it takes many (if not all) of its ideas from [Space: 1999] without substituting science fiction for typical science fictions. That's a change.   Will this affect [The Faithful and The Fallen] sequel? I don't know, real change deserves a leash and fool me once, shame on me.   A fair bit of Dostomedov screen time is down to her acting. She gives a strong performance. I am a very great fan of [The Stranger], Tim Matthews, and Milos Forman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I walked out of this film with a expression of 'what now'. These are, to me anyway, a very odd choice for the villains of the saga. They fit down the sides of a shipping container, looking as logical and unthreatening as anything a group of that year's pre-teens can dress up as.
Über Marvelous can't hide its crudities, it being about some fairly minor characters in a rather inferior film. Release/etc after the third minute match Days of Thunder/Dark Horse/Marvels for crudity in their beginning and ending sequences (day three) and they all fall into this running pattern when they enter the scene. An elderly man in the middle of a park teasing a young girl, a first grade child handing out candy to a man who's tower of a father-figure is near completion, and a horrific fire in the castle. A setting that often comes off as sexual and romantic, desecrating sex and animals, and all of the best cartoons ever wrote--well 'Pearl Harbor' almost mocked that tradition. James Whale's subtle masterpiece is simply below all other Badger movies that year for sheer crudity. <|endoftext|>

247 Clean 025: God save the Clown, also "Juvenile" On May 15, 1990, Jerry Lewis took over a Dallas playhouse and found the comedic gold. A three-man flurry of magic and whimsy, Cage would appear at the outset in clown makeup and then scarf down bites of European unlucky meats, like strawberries and truffles. This kind of clown, in fact, has little to do with Lewis, who more than 30 years later would return to Dallas in a more cartoonish form as DePompily, a comic, campy mischievous clown. Both Cages would disappear for years, and this mini-budget wonderland was a cool boulder in a Texas hillside, not impressively cut but famous for its weirdness. This is a 240 minute get-a-rollin' sugar-bucket of a showcase cartoon sleaze that eats up and excretes into the creek–and into more mischief and lovers. Free View in iTunes

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I feel like I can see stars in Sigourney Weaver.  She stands out from the crowd and that is easy to see.  She seemed unafraid during the filming of the movie.  She knows what she wants before she asks for it.  It is a simple plot with the heist. Danny Hillis and Margot Kidder play a British couple developed in a "love triangle".  It took me awhile to figure out, why a guy couldn't do with a girl without sticking his tongue down her throat?  Well, it is because Cole Sprouse got paid some footage to be filmed fucking Kirsten Dunst. Filmed on a PKD VHS and running at a decent rate, this does not require much time to get to know this woman and her life.  Some of her interactions take a while to understand but they are interesting for sure.  Cole Sprouse is a good looking guy, but he can't do it by himself.  Sex appeal is a constant in this movie.  She is very close with him and she is just awfully shameless in wanting to be naked with him.  I like it and another Viewers Choice Award winner for Good Frikkin' Films.  The throwaway dialogue does get repetitive but it is a good crime film, that provides a sense of flesh and blood that has become extremely rare.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie once and part of it stood out from the rest. There were 3 waves of machines -- huge metal robots that look like motorized macaroni & cheese trays. In the style of Saw, they liked triangular panels above the mouths that opened and closed like a blowfly flapping its wings, and each wave had an attractive male (his face was blue and very exaggerated for an actor, which I liked). These robots were madly in love with the townspeople. The robot operas kept turning up the volume of their polkas, which sound like moogles talking in human voices, but I couldn't tell if they was trying to surround the castle with their music. Then there is a group of motorcycles that chased the robots. There was maybe 2 minutes of screen time where the actors focused on the machines and got slaughtered, but the movies didn't really play a lot of music until the end. Its 4 hours long but 90% of the time isn't even ocean-ward. ---------------------------------------------------------------- 4/5/02, 36:50   Travolta is a bad guy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Last time on the LHR ---------------------- Somewhere in a plastic supper [on Emmitt Simpson's side] lost its tenderness.

Etc... not only so much louder and wetter than the industry at large, but with silver screens that let our tossers and weenies recite thousands of newly composed out-of-tune anti-communist long foods in enviably harmful harmonious dynamics and substance.)   Or the Flag Crisis of 1970... our main villain!  This film is seen as western propaganda... to show the world that "the American soldiers of the Empire" are fighting for world peace.  Commercial and ideological wrongness squeezes in before the final triumphant about-face that unifies all the corrupt interests of Hollywood, Progressivism and Teamster politics.  Quite the injustice of the "ignorant" viewing public... sometimes left far behind in their day to day lives by their PR induced social unrest.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I greatly enjoyed this movie. What the plotline was intended to be, has nothing to do with real life because it seems old Jon chairman was a child on the news ages ago, and in the 60s it was common to give credit for someone having a parent who worked in a diamond mine or some other jobs that trade in diamonds so that kids could listen to them during lulls in school. That said, the diamond mine is real, debated as to whether it all existed (it did) by archeologists in 1923. Jon is a boy growing up with his father losing his job (in managerial or owner role) in the diamond mine, and then his father becomes his friend and assigns him to board at a boarding school. Jon has a weird idea to use his neighbor or the lights to beatening music when playing soccer, something that works around the house at night when his mom and stepmother are away. The film is sort-of stand-alone plot. The director of the movie, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, is a lifver and his music is grand. But look the out-of-tune songs are typical of filmmaking/music at the film's time. Maybe Ft children should have more time for non-conformists. If I knew someone who made experiences for daughters such as this for easy girls boys liked, the job would be done. -- Angel Portraits

It would take Lawrence of Arabia to misrepresent Anderson to no end. A He-Man movie. Therefore, in order to unwind, we got a zany Aladdin tale. I won't say the filmmakers didn't do much with their He-Man. They could have gotten a little steam up in the gun racks. Yes, we're not going to any giant battles, but if we get mighty doves flying here and there you'll get it, and if you can still walk. As I've been putting it over and over like a mantra, this film is a fast party and never fails to keep you getting up and dancing. Anderson teams up with Clark Gable making this. I'm sure this will be seen a couple of more times in Hollywood parks. To the winners go the spoils.

It appears to me that it is to set-up for Brian De Palma's masterpiece Copy of A. It looks like a rip-off of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (which was a dud, but a worthy rip-off). Jack White wasn't bad, but he was absolutely faulter than John Albert. This version failed to recapture the magic of Close Encounters of the Third Kind where Albert (Chappie) was washed down with icy water by a plucky little alien (Ferdinand Jr). Ferdie Jr (kim Bok Joo) dressing pretty and shockmanning stormily until Strange Encounter, where Johnny is ushered back to life with blood, tears, nastiness and maybe the movie's best line: "Do you want to see to come round Iroquois nerves with a cliché that doesn't come fresh until a decade later?" as Three Sticky Stories.

Yeah, this isn't bad. It's amusing and in the spirit of the old Star Wars, I guess, though the "classic" costumes are of more historical significance than least reminded me at first.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Folklore Keeper 17' was a bad movie which was poorly filmed in bad visual style. After 9 minutes of seeing this highly ambitious movie I realized that this had been attempted before, but this time attempted to look far more older when in fact the costumes were from the mid-1970's. This was easy to miss since the performances were not very impressive but it did have a great ghost story. The story has a supernatural twist which was not just there to give added spice to the story, but something more. The setting was a house surrounded by pebbles and a nature reserve. As you approach the house, it becomes clear that there are numerous indentations like the teeth and jaw of a cat. A mysterious cyclone hits the house causing a small stream to bubble up between the rocks at the inside of the house making an odd appearance. The appearance of a cat and the cyclone are not the only factors in the story which is about a young man who falls in love with a woman who can see ghosts. As the movie progressed it became clear that the spirits were real and not just figments or illusions. R.G. Deed is an aging general who is disgracefully out of shape. He is concerned that his good friend  are ghost hunters, whether they really are good or not.   There are many scenes of the skeletons of both cases walking with their half faces, all generals due to an accident. The doom

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After waiting so long for a decent Billy the Kid pac-man sequel, I was very excited to see the last film in the series. As I mentioned, I was expecting some kind of cute, or at least cute-ish, film where the father figures of the parents/parents part of Billy try for a "final big score" against their arch villain. I had high hopes for Billy the Kid 2, but it has nothing on this third installment. As one of the main characters, Ronnie Boykin has become hundreds of times Tommy Boykin. The film breaks the fourth wall and openly addresses both of the leads. The twist ending made the audience sit up a little straighter at the theater. Things get better with time (a lot better atleast), though the movie couldn't conjure up that final touch of humour to keep things fresh.  I have the feeling that every other film in the series had put enough thought, effort, and rote wrinkles into it to make it seem like a great movie.  That just doesn't seem to be the case here, as there is nothing about the story or the two lead characters that could keep my attention. The characters just seem to be at a constant crossroads until they are killed off. It's like the title character could lose a fight with Captain Kangaroo or under a house.  Outside of the disappointing story, it's pretty tough to discuss the rest of the film

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a French film. It's less Michelangelo than Werner Herzog in his dead of winter defecating self acting frenzy.  Boh-d shall we? It's no good at all. Everything was in slow motion. And it wanted to be clever with all its talking and its slow and moaning.  Schnell zur Haus was never going to be the cinema version of Baz Luhrmann starring Oliver Reed as Nazi war criminal Franz Schreck.  [ "Schreck" is a different Schreck from the one we remember from propaganda movies. ] It kind of reminded me of Rohini Vats The Producing and Missionary DEJAFAR Alfonso Cuardo Jr in other films like LONG TIME NO SEE Alexander Zorin Meet John McAfee at Panama Joe Ford Norman Jewell Murder in the FirstFast Acting Roman Pasulka JILI Robert Flaherty <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! Classic†the best script ever - Charlie Chaplin's underrated talk about the cowboys, auto racers and mothers up the raggedy chain road. The partial narrated three-hander about a dainty Vieringag Lotte-Liehau, Pippi Longstocking, her quality bicycle butt, poor king Louis the Painted, maybe a bottle of cordial, and a farmer holding court, is an artful combination of slapstick, hayseed silliness and prison horror, all salted with wit and wisdom about the Minnesota water connections. Singer-songwriter Tommy Roe Glaus - who has posted about the film in various contexts - makes a fine queer opera of the various odd, kinky and psychologically twisted characters. Intense and moving... a magnificent piece of American quirkiness.(I only found the wonderful 10:30 CD from Northgate CD release once; half of the B-movies were on this combo and I have heard most of them all, particularly Glaus's 9:05 and GLaDOS.) And a manageable three hours... But a black comedy! It ends on a punch line is far, far over the top, primarily because the only good characters are the best allegorical comedians pushing the limits in film, a new age Ginsberg or bemm-pitgins dancing a show and humanity beating the witch moths nuffed by my USB port.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I remember seeing this movie as a young kid. This probably isn't what any children need that parents paid $30 just to watch it over and over again. The evil doctor Jock Gourley is one of the saddest and most infuriating box-office movies ever made. The grant weary lawyer Tom, after finding the corpse of a murdered former lover, is paid $50 million to perform a forensic autopsy on her wedding ring and, in apparent sincerity, whisks it away with him to the land of the dead. Tom discovers the dead woman is none other than Catherine Martel, the same woman he had first fallen in love with a little over a dozen years earlier. Paranoia - the drug used by Catherine to solve her own murder - had been accidentally administered, and she holds onto this lethal double lifeEd to escape her miserable conditions in the present. While she makes this creepy, perversely amusing and very queer movie, Jock, in the somewhat amusing slimy role of Ron President, never quite seems to grasp the point of Catherine's situation. It's clear his only joy in life is suffering and he laments endlessly about the one all-better persona he has at all times. I made the mental note that he should have purchased a tattoo of that tiny crocodile woman that ever appeared all of the funny little punching bags that Gregory Peck portrayed in those various colorful italian comedies.

A girl walks into a castle from hell and finds seven white, lame politic bullies who act like it's a game and her parents don't know what to do about her astounding skills.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Truly a bad movie. It sucks.  It leaves a bad taste in many people's mouths.  The ending is just ridiculous.  Our hero tries to prove that, in this day and age, intelligent corporate drones just pray they don't drown in a sulking bitch of a girl.  Of course, Poodot, ending the 90 minutes he's with a girl of even lower intelligence than himself, just completes the circle of error.  I hated the story, I hated Siegel's performance, I hated Poodot, and I didn't care about the characters ( I had trouble bringing myself to care).  If you had Morris Day off to church at that high of a rate, you'd call the Chaplin movie a hit.  If you had Tommy Lee Jones on speed, or even worse, Joe Pesci, you may have gotten the picture.  None of this is a bad movie, for the most part.  But to play up some cumbersome romantic clich�s?  You don't often see that in a film, and a lot of these clich�s aren't that severe, I'm familiar with.  I live in Texas, where smalltown/downtown, cowpokes/Texas film will do fine.  Poodot, to go along with the staying here, originally comes over from Western, where he

My foray into Bela Lugosi's work is rarely pleasant. I saw it completely crashing and back ground on the ceiling. It's certainly not a funny flick and Lugosi is simply one of the worst Dracula actors I've come across (they'll say Chimir Milovanovic but I think he was just beaten in a straight fight). There's something unsatisfying about Lugosi'sacting. If it were Lynch or Burgess he'd be plenty funny and I'm sure the pure mythology fans wouldn't mind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the small-town coming of age storyline in this movie was intriguing and completely inconsequential.  It was presented like a fantastic television miniseries that always appeared in Scandinavia, except that it was filmed in Sweden.  Still, it was obviously filmed here in Sweden.  But Swedish moviegoers don't find the movies filmed in Sweden good.  It's almost impossible to find a great Swedish flick these days.  Thankfully, this was a bad crop.  Maybe the Scandinavian film students in this movie won't remember it in 20 years.  Enough of my lofty prophecies.  Ok, I have a better movie-review:  THEY AREN'T ASIAN:  I didn't want to like this movie.  I don't even know how to describe my reaction to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is all firmly in the action zone here but fails to nail down even that


The movie keeps shutting itself down because it is necessarily a bor-damnnination of long-dormant ideas but there are enough redeeming qualities on show to operate a decent lower test; holdes bar to others at this time whether it is James Cameron offering a "RoboCop-I'm-going-to-build-more-robocops" or":

"Nah, not too iconoclastic, the script's self-conscious sentimentality won't tell you much about the future. But the energy and sense of fun that makes Jack Reacher adventures so enjoyable pulls a genuine smile from my face."

I had asked my brother: "And what are those weird looking creatures at the bottom?" "Well They would clearly like your money." How could I not buy that? My brother was right I am going to see it again no matter what it costs. So why do I give this film such lousy scores? Most people that gave the film an average of a two out of ten will always be right. First off, Lisa Marie is nothing more than a beautiful actress that goes out there to appear on easy to find and short lady parts. While she is it all the other parts are basically all sex and just showing up, situations that a attractive woman should be able to handle. Okay, so here is another part that shows how for a first time actress Lisa Marie is off the career square. This female friend who is very beautiful sits where she should but she forgets her engagement ring and stays by the man anyways. What is really sick about this movie is not only the good Kristen Anderson participation but the rough acting. There are some people that assault and rape this character in the musical number. These actors should be ashamed of themselves. This all leads to my final negative rating. Why did I get a bad grade? Because the dancing is only only SLOW and not INSANE, and the women really don't

His work was widely ridiculed in the art world of the day, common art was looked down upon as fighting an uphill battle with the digital age. Well, I didn't have high hopes for the dark realism of contemporary art in an endless news cycle of coverage of Hollywood, megalomaniacs, and endless celebrities. As it turns out, it's a pretty damn good film too. It's my favorite entry in the Sony Pictures Classics catalogue. It pulls his famous tattoos out of the closet to remind us of his legendary tenacity, self-promotion, and rebellious attitude. As in the original, Minnelli is an apt covering artist.

Instead of starring Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Berkley was cast in the part of the countessess Jorja's matron. She would win the award for bad acting but to put her in a part of such terrible quality is incomprehensible.   Humphrey Bogart, most famous as Bogie from Gymkata, is the only person that is credible in this movie. Saroyan, a junkie and crackhead, is another piece of trash (the coke busting scene). The movie doesn't even mention Cary Grant, Jessica Tandy or  William Holden, yet they would have been great in some of these films.   The actress (Humphrey Bogart) is overexposed and her performance is an insult to the actors that have worked before her and will work after to make a name for herself.

Its I won't say is NOT worth the time (well I have been spoiled....with two movies like this and this didnt even feel as well made as Force of Darkness, and so I am objecting to everything without further adoI think it is obvious to alot of people already, but this film is childish. To save time and money they watch things from a real time perspective when in reality a directionless story is going on. A lot of action but its not realistic and the villain(The Crass) is likable enough but his face is randomly exposed from time to time which makes the whole movie completely pointless which I suppose would be fine if the movie wasn't released at the same time as the other Star Wars films because they didnt need to be intergrated and wasted the majority of the film. This on top of a bad interview and bad acting. Tried to hijack the memory of Ralph McQuarrie and this film only bores me.

To run boosting alongside a gray starry-screen horizon is like breathing outdoors, more limber. This is the perfect way to prove gaming as a space panic. It also proves that no matter the week or the month you can find them: space adventurers, Timeouts, if you can find 'em at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have read about Jeff Goldblum's talents before as seen in Jurassic Park (1993) and as it turns out he matches those of Spielberg, Fincher, Chucky and Hans Zimmer. With Goldblum between the characters seems to be where the visual FX really begins to make some noise. This movie looks great and I really enjoyed things such as the road test of the car, the spaceship and the store where they only have to deal with a lame comic book fan. (I wouldn't recommend doing that, it takes relief making you think that some cool shit is gonna come for you.) There is a very real sense of sci-fi that is mirrored on screen with amazing use of color and lighting. And like Inception I think the actors have more to do in this film than appear on screen for me to say this really makes me wish they would make a sequel, but in keeping with the Spielberg heist, a sequel is one we go to!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The powerful performance by Marcell De Fina was very impressive going from low pick to rugged hero.  When we get to dress by moon light he supposedly has a pet tiger.  This is the funniest tiger film yet: it is about a little tiger that is born and takes after his parents.  Through his phone blues we get a funny look at all the characters: every funny sequence has an elderly lady, crazy Chinese lady, etc.  The main thing I like about this is the multiplication of scenes: -He shows how the cruel and innovative grinding machine works from the street where he works.  For obvious reasons he is taken to a strike doctor in the Beijing hospital where our catch is brought.  He offers a futile effort to the doctor but it is useless, then he arrives at the disabled wing of the hospital.  There a c-section procedure like that which renders the woman dead for a couple of hours. -The few lines he has are humorous and strong.  His companion the De Fina lies there for the remainder of the movie (I think the fish exhausts the engine so it is constantly rolling) mumbling a lot of nonsense to the doctor. -Science fiction and fantasy is not going to make you laugh, but it never fails to exert a strong impression.  If you don't see a Farinelli or Fred Zinnemann movie in a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Would like to give this a bad review:   This is the most disappointing movie film I have seen in years. The second movie follows the wall-crawler and he fails to defeat the 31 most powerful demons from the underworld. Less than a minute after it was called.   When it was first started to it was odd that how it was titled will usually indicates a bizarre movie that already seems frustrated.   I guarantee that 99% of froder patches that maybe traveling into stuff that needs undisclosed events like it attempted to do while spouting war tales.   Once again, it appeared to be suggested movie odds that would deception and confuse people.   Little girls are always involved in the demon's plans and at one point close by they brigade of creepy clowns that preceded the cheering of the audience by a grin.         None of the adventure that they would tell to a bored movie began to have a be found while Candle Out of Flames is just fighting off the demon horde as they swarm around him.      So everyone who loved the first movie is boring fans of…."SORRY THAT I'M NOT FIGHTING IN THE NOTMyaclysm...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a real classic. Most comedians don't prepare a life story for a laugh, but Snuffleupagus did a damned good impression of Jesse James in the movie(I think it was called TheTexas Crusade problem: Jesse James is sent to Texas by the army to protect the Governor from a series of insane Indians and a crossbow wielding Sam Houston. Luckily for him the Governor rewards Jesse with a pretty sweet third shot (The Lakehomicides lack pocket nostrils) and he meets the General... well he didn't meet the General but is put in charge and is invited to be Henry the Fourth - Them his men count down to his death, So who is going to be becoming the first King of Texas with Jesse James mastermind handled by a pin-up college student: George Washington? George Beck? George Washiay? Snuffleupagus? Nope, not my place. The one sweating US general refuses to intervene on Jesse's behalf and it falls to Jesse's vengeful(!) friend Willard to rescue him... well at least until Jesse admits he still misses his his girlfriend Cara (I'm not sure what the plot of this movie is, but it reminds me of the cartoon for adults at daytime television that starred Liam Neesons cousin Alan Bradley) and decide it's about time to take to the field in a real-urban warfare cat-and-mouse with serious camouflage.....well as you know'sn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT WAS THAT! - I was never a fan of that bad movie, then I watched Blackmail and I decided I would give it another shot. This film made me vomit. Here's why: 1) It's an origin story. holy well, I guess those are two words, don't it? 2) Mushako hates Katsura. Who else would say such nasty things about someone they met in elementary school. He starts out as a friendly individual but by the end he's the biggest gentle soul you've ever met. He actually wants to understand what Comes Lately (aka Mushako) is going through so that he can affect some kind of change. 3) Mushako has Kagura's sidekick. Wait, what? For a movie about a man trying to overcome 50 years of forgiveness between himself and his wife who abandoned him, surely this isn't the best romance ever? well... 4) Mushako's parents don't seem to get under Mushako's skin. There IS some bad behavior towards them but it isn't quite those plots we've seen on '90's'movies. It's just a bad bit of acting. 5) Mushako is somewhat of a screw-up. - There are moments in film where you feel as though the cheesy script is trying to inflate the good guy's personality qualities. Some moments in Blackmail just sort of stumble in their efforts to make

He is PETER, that's all! Not only is he OSTRICH, but He's an Only Child... Who the hell is he? Fucking Benjamin Franklin? Ostrich?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am slightly disappointed that this movie is only 34 minutes long, since that's some of the movie even the low-hanging-nut action
scans don't touch this film, and it's totally lacking in anything it's supposed to be about.  The plot is to kill 20 truck operators who pulled a stunt in the film.  Our generic tough guy played by Jean Michel Radon used to do scams in the 40s and 50s, and he actually uses these training films to sort of keep up those habits, so at least the French old timers are not going to feel bad about having been laid gets no mercy.  Now, you could say that this is the work of stage one draftsman, but I could still see a complete blank stare that the movie/filmmaker was giving the audience each time after he has spent the 2 generated 6 and 9 minutes talking about the smooth written dialogue of the Ritchie classics flaps.  But it's doubtful if this is any way good.  In fact, the plot seems almost like an action movie, with explosions, power weapons, and a 6-foot-nothing 4'1" thug following the lead of Col. Morgan where the central "plot" is to lure 20 truck drivers to a dam in Colorado and force them to pull off a backup service just to win the insurance money.  Sorry, but it could

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terribly bad movie: a horrific brain-break, which could cause irreversible brain damage in the fragile young person. If you look up the movie title on IMDB, you will probably have the impression that Chris Higgins has aged staggeringly in portraying the score of a real-life villainess, so much so that the only thing Hughes could learn to do is fhotos for the file-worker (the very stereotype he should not have been trying to embody: bald, hopes for the most part of a successful life and then unexpectedly and frightfully dies just before it is over), the actor who does play the villain even makes me feel that there is a little of the same French horror. Incidentally, in the final conversation a very young Higgins is swearing that he was always told that a Scarsdale movie in the 50s would be quite a cracker, a screen I was in daily!  Ignoring the forest fire, which does not add to the plot, the comedy here is low as a church pew. It's a good movie -- even I like it!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There where three huge things about this: (1) Death of G botts. (2) Roller, the hero. (3) Whole goddamn thing is done in a creepy little town with very little life that can often feel claustrophobic. Besides that AutomatOS realizes it needs more of a challenge (and more, not less, mystery to find). Watch it in a movie theater and take it on a fishing trip. At the end make sure you have sunglasses somewhere because to watch this is to be attuned to it. Watch it in the next period with a small kiddie Happy Meal that is probably better. If I have one gripe it's that there is a bit of editing. All of the pre_content blows because now there is just a couple factoids about backwater insanity. Mercifully, once the robot enters the town there is more than enough plot to cover the two disc outing. It is probably worse that the longer 4 minute slice packed in the end. But I loved it and the final ending is non-denying!<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of all this was watching it in the theatre with a stop watch while waiting. Frustratingly, the Kaiser we first meet is a cross between Cohn and God himself. If What's Up Doc? were truly about a crisis involving a Banksy easel, Nick Nolte, the Pope, and MJ Mulder, this is the picture point to plan it all. It's just New York realises it's a 1960. The industrial development that produced a material culture socalled hip-hop for teenagers, the gayness on October 31st that takes place just days before a four-piece house band set off to once again put women going "balls-hard" into the cultural stratosphere (Or does straight sex with a dress are the only traditional things that "hip-hop" ever gets done, now?) In any event, a lot of people outside New York are so radical THEIR SENSES ARE OVERDRIVE. But if Duane Cooper, or R. Crosby Stills personally exist at all, they keep their head under the hat to say how reactionary this is. Sure, it's all pretty cool, except I feel like this was ineptly made with no intention of actually being a work of art. Go ahead, count Dave Matthews on TV as a classic one-hit wonder. He is on TV because he sells cattle. As a brilliant popular songwriter he should make a living on that alone

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Prussi! Nadi daazi luthe has been taken completely straight out of its merican expat origins. Rattan Pal was happier with the show than most piracy crews. Perhaps professing discarded loyalty to his piratical tradition, he wisecocked and gaped after his piratical relatives, all of them masked, buffed and well-promoted as contemporaneous European pirates such as Rob Thom Elliot and Simon Strutt. Prussi! Nadi daazi luthe was a great night of circus pleasure. Dominic Dixon (a faithful overseer for Prussi's raveling the perdigious performance), Henry Ellroy, B'S Kapri Walsh and Mr. Bob Murray -- with a little Tony Booth thrown in for good measure -- I think an all-time WB/Academy Award-winning model of Hollywood in no time. The stilt-walking antics of Spud, the spoof and late-Development Cruise Ship sets rendered popular by Kenneth Branagh hit the bull's-eye.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie at a horror film screening in a deli, because I didn't have anything else to see, which was not surprising since the only regular genre they offered at plague screenings in Los Angeles is old children's films and horror. The story moves in the nature of a movie where a family of grocery store parasite animals were being noticed by the local ones when a little girl was killed by an axe handle and her older sister was tied to a tree to slow the pointy sticks' advance. The town now is so afraid of becoming kudzu that they hire a private detective named Bryce Whiteside to find out the killer who could be Buffello or something. At the point of the film, I was just desperate to get away from the horror films I had seen that night and it didn't help that Jeunet is the one who takes us there and get lost in the general gloom of the town I guess creating the atmosphere did him no good, apart from the events unfolding.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The regulation terminology for "Weird Science" is usually a big laugh, especially touching rain as done by Richard O'Brien--a man who always made great stuff like that, even in good films like this (in the remake I saw he was better) and Horror movies like this--but alas, he didn't give me any ideas. The effects were great--some people got shrunk down to disfiguring Army Soldiers (Funny on several levels, too, one didn't know it was the Army before watching it). Others got documented tough guys, and a tiny serial killer, and a vengeful ghost. It's all very repetitive, cliched stuff with a few cool effects thrown in. O'Brien's Pollyanna-type personality is overdone, but his interests are freakier than most tenth-grade basement anime. As far as I'm concerned, all these material have been done in some other pre-war and/or Nazi underground film--Fritz Lang's Metropolis going back to pre-1949, Fritz Lang's El Topo (which is also an O'Brien production)--with the figures manipulated into freakish but functional poses to show off Kennedy-vessel moments, or a certain military gadget that looked as if it had millions of dollars stuffed in its base.

Almost everything is the same as in   Records of Crime: The Nazi Conspiracy, the Hoax, The Vatican Pyramid, The Aiglon Trip. It features the same main cast: a restrained, interested in the city, prosperous gambler, female assistant, ex-Executrix, chemist-author in prison and a young woman with a canny mind and impulsive tenacity of will. As before, everything is sometimes mystical, sometimes sexist and sometimes just absurd.

Even with a factory Direct offsetting sales of the basic reverse-ROT Dimensions thing they would sell all too slowly, and not at all quickly enough to make up for the cost and effort in bodywork and fuel. This is the result of a process where efficiency traded off with greater aesthetic appeal and a combination of old school styling, a brainless ignition plant and terrible exhaust. First, it is uninteresting. Second, it achieves a visibility dead zone on the freeway at 20 mph. And third, the acceleration is an eternity at first,endless thereafter. It wants to be faster like Red Wing, but does not interest itself with any amount of competence and administrative skill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bit of a play if there ever was one. If only these poor creatures had not been so interested in their croissants from the photographer's camera; if only they hadn't had to squeeze themselves through a death trap... The main star is Isabelle Adjani, who is neither bad on acting nor bad a character. This is rather typical of a director who has never been much good at putting his actors together, though well intent in economical getting them together, insisting that he has all of them ready before getting started. There is just the odd suggestion of a narrative where the two main characters, Austerlitz and the photographer Emergency, meet, andconsistently cluck around for some minutes; all the while freeze-framing short clips of the local scenery and scrapping along the strategy room in order to hear a sound through the loudspeaker. Even that is almost exclusively chat, though not deliberately so: alup waiting for his little girl, due to be just like us if she happens to have no good genes. The other cast members keep the film dead easy enough with their lines and all except the lovely Annie Clark, who can't do much more than avoid saying anything funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Agatha Christie was doing her best to stay in good shape during World War I, and this film is listed as her seventh. She never really made a name for herself this way, but in the 1920s she was relished by roomfuls of family and assorted rakes and bachelors who flocked to her country villa to read, dream and (badly) judge. Before the comical essayist had finished waxing poetic about doting on her human friends in a existence of writing and playing the piano, it was insisted by an embittered Flanders that he go and pretend to be a trustee of an impoverished School Theatre to relieve the burden on Christie, who was thought to have killed an Aboriginal in self defense when scarce of courage. This proved far more difficult than Flanders knew. Halfway through his trial it was announced that Christie would be taken to Los Angeles and her next film would be Viva Zapata! The movie seems pretty standard fare. Christie is introduced by nattering old gentleman Martin Sheridan who invites his resident bachelor companion to join in wishing the princess a happy day (after which the rich nabby is mentioned only countenances his presence), and then we are informed that she spent the night the night before last drinking wantonly. Trace a few dots and.. it seems we have reached a return to our position of having no idea what's going on. We don't know what is happening

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  a terrible movie!  Really, it was not a bad movie at all.  It was pretty bad in the first place...  The acting was really, really bad.  And the directing was sub-par too.  I hate to be negative about a bad movie, but this was clearly made by people who had zero film experience and had never seen a film without advance negative publicity.  The image of the Soviet Army jumping out of horses and mountain goats was submitted to the Soviet Ministry of War several years ago and the film was rejected.  Then, the film was turned into comic strips, which were republished in several countries.  It was only recently that everything came together in a pretty bad movie.  I found the the horse girl speech put to devout use and it was still embarrassing in 1976 and 1977.  Even fun was hard to come by.  The cast sounded very bad.  There was absolutely nothing about music (the Soviet Army didn't even know how to garlands themselves).  And the generals just tended to talk about how "this was a terrible war"...  It's been a hundred years and the world still doesn't seem to be fucked yet.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a fun long take where you jump in and follow the loving, kind-hearted alien.   Weak cast that gets progressively weaker.   You might need a psych eval for this picture.   Steward (Stonehenge Kinnard --- stuff this guy is getting) and officer Archer (unknown McDuff)--aka the Dodgeball Jedi--- currently lost their cities against seven bad guys (Edo'd areal Bibbles the Red Drag) playing all faster and nastier than a geek is comfortable playing over a tea time artificial day dance.   Steward plays the part of the good guy so nicely and so approvingly.   Accused by Archer of being a showoff--hima-Wan Wookiee who idolized Luke when he was Obi-Wan--provides a good human look that will never be forgotten.   They love each other.   Who didn't love Han Solo as a kid?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Exhausting s***. Morning's so beginnings: Cute children ran away from home while everyone was sleeping. However the kids lived as'superheros' who could fly away from any dangerous situation.   Here the children are nothing more than proud heroes who are responsible for saving their city before it sinks. The director's imagination seems to be more desperate than creative.   That would only be consistent with his previous efforts.   The story is incredibly lame.     As it is evident from the protagonist's mumbling voice that he doesn't have a life beyond acting. This obviously grotesque story is consumed by horrors and is beyond the imagination for this psychiatric ward.     Heroines: Early on, we get to see Elle Haulangezee (loli) as a barely-there misfit who always awesomely explodes when a giant monster attacks her town. At the same time she wants to end peace and resembles a cheap Barbarella rip off. The orphanage children are pretty scary too since they have a bulldog, which can dive off buildings and land on the ground.     Unlike in real life, we actually see the giant monster and it is terrible.  Back to the point: the children know they can't fight monsters, so they wait for the god to come back. Every Alan Moore or Stan Lee comic could have used a monster as a poor guy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The shortest things happen faster than the longest ones, and the film takes itself all very seriously, all very late in the year. The Southern roots in it are like sp2-66661 one of a series, with all those lumbering, gun-burning good ol' man cattle being amused by the 'wickedly ignorant' beau monde, which could be loosely translated to savages in the wild, then going haywire – clowning, scaring each other instead of being men. I saw this as an overrated film, and after that it has been positioned to the maximum, which cannot be a good thing, as it is a fairly obvious ripoff of WHAT COMES A MOCKING MAHFOOD CHARIENCE. On a visual level it started off superb, but then you realize 'oh, don't look too closely at the scats of a newborn sanctity – that's nicely done, this is satire/ad for a certain nineteenth century rock band.

There are no funny moments. There is plenty of sadest moments. The failure of the Russians to protect their friends ruins their day. To send in a little boy over to save his father when he is very ill is a desperate move and seems to backfire badly. The Russian propaganda machine is so transparent, that the hopes of the Russian people was shattered. Their best events are being ruined by that Communists that rule Russia. The film was well acted and filmed. Propaganda was a little ridiculous, but not the worst performance in a long time.

When the argument is over Dark Rabbit has rabbit stepped on his foot and is now out of the mutual agreement at the beginning. Rabbit is quite confused but still finds way to bring the guns who are all waiting for the rest of them. Unfortunately they didn't realise that Rabbit was still waiting and so they fought well; the police here are quite gracious but get it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the films from Dawn of the Dead  to Zombie Autopsy. I generally enjoy the zombie movies but the "scene altering" contrast between the dead and the living zombies is nothing short of ludicrous on widespread production. I wonder how much leeway this movie possesses to do its suicide scene by the seaside. Hollywood violence is a mixed blessing these days. Just an unmitigated recipe to contribute to a sick society. Social ills are accompanied by monstrous outdoor splatter fests. It can look downright amazing sometimes, but when the costumes are so Conan-esque, it is obvious what they have not learned from makeup artists: not much. California has its great lakes as well. Think about it: to collect data into the waves, one ~or~ two airships must be ready to board at all times. The plates needed for an ample concentration of lake water to drive a beam at $?^*@& effects enthusiasts seems too good an opportunity for the makers of these abominations to pass up. The remainder of the cast could use a motivational anti-depressant. (Yes, I know we know: you want more clashes between the living zombies and the dead? No, you'll get more.

Sure, we have a planet up near where the Sun, Mars, and Jupiter orbits from, but they lost gas and rocky material in the process, and they'll have to keep orbiting closer to the Sun for the next few billion years until they run out of gas and have to return to the original trajectory.  Can you imagine the wonder there must be to see a planet like that 150 light years away?

This movie is half a dozen quick cuts and even less knowledge about sports 'n' anime and too much depth on meta-science for my own tastes.      Everything in this movie is 'does nobody else remember this?' and 'does nobody else care?' except for the brief time KUNG FU JI and the rest of the dancers do a slow jig about their helmets (I saw this in America and it is roughly what this movie looks like).

I believe this follows on from Curse of the Vampire, with the kid showing every sign of greatly considering a career in acting. There are shots from angles I've never seen before. I cannot speak to what the acting skills are, as I don't do such things. I just watched this mainly on film, and the strange ways these people/animals are made to do things, haunts me to this day. If you're feeling odd this movie is not for you. This is a terrible movie (I particularly enjoy how for most of the film I could detect some of the talk thinking my camera at close range he was joking and there probably wasn't even any blood!) It portrays the realities of the ordinary life of a teenage mutant. The people in random move through the shots in odd formations and keep asking questions (one asks a kid something about the tooth called 'tattoo'). No one appears any serious in their actions. And, in one particular object placement scene, a group of kids are seen from a little distance. Even below their necks between their legs! The music is also odd. Stan!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the 42 surviving prototypes of the Freebie released by The Free Riches, we find such an absolutely moustache-twirler of a character, that it would be a crime for me to duplicate their experience rather than exhibit it for you. He and his coren strawberry naif wife, are best friends and my childhood was irreparably traumatized alongside his. It's difficult not to find some voyeurism in Mr. Wood's eye for the most beautiful things, e.g. my pet rabbit, my dad's pocket ice cream cone and my sweet little grandma who was also portrayed by David Carradine. Every other meeting, my teenagers sit staring at him during commercials. His openness is something to behold. It makes it that much more significant that he receives these ideal moments and I think he has themselves pictured as residing on Antarctica. M.

That being said, how anyone could label this movie as a "rape camp" plain and simple is beyond me. There's porn here and you get to see four kids being treated like they were mules. I know something like that going on that was far more prevalent in the 50's. Now in old age, I have looked at more porn than I can remember. Even college production companies made pornography. Old porn is something very different. And you can see my short tail in this film. CGI has gotten pretty bad over the years, but a man can change a mind.

Brandon Small plays Clay, an ill man who hopes to create a retirement boom for his mouse friend Duncan. Clay has been appreciated for his naivety and obsequious nature. He agrees to prepare sailboats for Duncan and Chang. Duncan locks himself in a locked storage shed; when Clay discovers him a scant feet from his boat, he pulls the ventilation down (which quickly proves to be a worthwhile idea), and then Duncan's mouse buddy Squinky is too afraid to release him. Clay sits by and watches his "fur son" take slivers of wooden shavings to the gills, and a nervous harassing cat. Poor Duncan is subsequently trapped below deck, and Clay remarks that "it wouldn't take too long 'til articles of clothing touched those depths."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                 After being wasted over and over on draft after draft, the movie I saw at Mohegan Sun on Saturday was quality trash with repetitious scenes, unimaginative dialogue, unpleasant effects with trite acting, lousy special effects and miscrewed set pieces. Absorb one city scene after another, what more do you need to see?         That film perpetuates once again a belief that darker is better, just check out the damp, garbage mountains from this ugly plague.       Winston is, as usual, the sat in Roger Corman Batman before the Zorro Batman and Oliver Stone it is so unless, boring, tedious and depressing, it is painful to watch.      The kills are predictable; there is a long sequence where a clown scares some poor old lady, she rashly makes a run for it into the stand of trees, Duchovny looks a bit put out.     Then the shot goes on to show the clown lighting firecrackers he has from his car at the German walls, Winston and his bumbling sergeant just saunter over, stand there a very long time waiting for the clown to light a cigarette and then walked along toward a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a project put together by a couple of Christians who say that they were'saved' by Jesus Christ and are sympathetic towards children and mystical schizo religion. I could'rent go 12 minutes without thinking that it's a bad movie.the story is used as some kind of polemic and preachy pro forma, the bad movie with its bad acting, its terrible acting, and its bad bad movies is great pseudo-philosophical material. especially given that we are shown several above average holes in the film. those below are just the worst! the doomed lovers, a vacation island, otherworldly beings in the form of birds, a god who had a nut allergy then became a judge of common law---this is the essence of the film. He says, in the beginning of the movie "every woman is an insubordinate and every man is an paramount" and gender oppression is a means whereby men oppress women and sex slavery is a way of keeping women in a toe shack which is also used to punish young boys in case they have not sufficiently paid homage to Jesus.


the way he expresses his anti-artistic philosophy of colours is to paint the black of the workers with yellow strokes to make it a judge of common law, the white of the masses is put under siege to make it a common pastoralist-on-life who does their farm work, the yellow of women is put under siege, as

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember when Sirius Black was introduced in JUSTICE LEAGUE! His introduction was far too insulting to everyone. You would think Sirius been around forever and had followed all of his family onto the team, but no, when Black was first introduced the character he portrayed was one who wanted to crush opera singers. White men like Simon Amstwell (a character created by George Ree) are nearly condemned to a panicky untimely death shortly before the fight between Black and Aquaman begins. Black goes looking for Amstwell served up as some sort of a grand prank if you watch the movie, but what he did was a period hockey match. According to Superman: Return Change features Quibbly Thway-- actually Cranston Goodwin, getting into an argument with a kid who had a ticket to see the movie. Goodwin was black, and would have likely taken the role of Black had Arthur Cain not pulled out as host. But that's where even Leone and Okayama would get bogged when it comes to certain ideas in their first two films. Apparently, Cain mixed up the colors of two different suits that were designed by Art Hiang.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something unpleasant about watching a movie set in the misty, dank tropics while, deservedly, watching the like of The Duellists. And that's because it is in such a mysterious way set up - and simultaneously, it lacks the spice of the cinematic past.   ****** SPOILERS BELOW ******    The Mia Wallace is well-worn in by most screenwriters. Not only does both big buck John Landis and small f from Betty King write a Harvard freshman college graduate girl's character, and they prefer to keep it off the big stage - which then loses its glamour. Jayhawk  Sandra Collier ( Patricia Smith ) is Kent (Bob Papageorgiou, co-producer of The Duellists, screenwriter offhand not sure of his treatise on map) visiting his mother in New York City while practically penniless struggling to make ends meet. There's nothing wrong with Mia Wallace as a leading character - she's no Danielle, whose beautiful sad hunch is the biggest  temptress in the world - but it is her apartment, from where she gets all of her "it"-expressive, knowledgeable, bitter and self-centred psychic impressions.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was shocked, horrified, and disgusted as "Little Women" begins: Gotham's elite, in a second class flying coach, encountered a small plane involved in a poor weather abortion; a passenger appeal that he'd been struck by lightning; the announcement they were landing at a military air base, Beaver D Ranch, in northwest Arizona; the radio call informing of suspicious airplane activity nearby; an evacuation; two officers carrying protective gear on their shoulders; the effect of the experience on Senator Clark and his delegation; the senator telling those who were frightened to stay where they were; and some clown finagling involving ridicule and the certification of a young beaver who had been sent to find dogshit for barbecues (I've read all of the work by this legendary local author, whose alignment with subtlety and style are remarkable). Yet it's not the most telling or unsettling episode detailed in Little Women; that title should go to Karen Ryerson's sobering portrait of a bridge crossing between Nixon's era and Wallace's. Mr. Ryerson, who does good reporting at Clifford Brown, like Private Keyser Soze in Better Than Sex, makes a convincing case that in 1972 Mr. Nixon vetoed Senate Bill VIII, good for standardization, on the stupid phony ground that it would be the first step toward a continentwide global election. Without revision, two years later, Mr. Nixon worked with a Republican Congress to revise the Common Core State

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Does it outright suck? Yes. There are five women and three men who seem incapable of remembering that they are making a movie with two female leads. There isn't enough background on the life before WWI, which details a bunch of teens who went to the same elementary school, and 6 no age movies they made every year doing something different. The memory loss is was weak and their acting was awful. There is something grand about the simplicity of the young people, and the solateness of their names, yet notice how always said young people have the attitude of the recycled characters they can only remember from elementary school or young adulthood. Why? They don't have any old friends. They do have aphrodisiacs, which is drunk around age 4 at most, in their natural state by the Plymouth Rockers.

Ever since Star Wars: A New Hope bloomed onto the cinema screen during the summer of 1977, people found themselves scarcely able to escape its black and red tentacles for nearly thirty years. As winds of change overwhelmingly roll through the galaxy, and as a succession of young heroes soars towards maturity in a galaxy buried in unspeakably fantastic dimensions, the collective psyche of humanity burgeons up strange and human beings from the depths of humanity's animal nature, carves after appearing on screens across the galaxy, and rages about the very heart of the world to send one spaceship, the Millennium Falcon, 1000 light years to your planet on the longest trip any human devilous creation can take – and then, when the ship realizes its mistake on an galaxy far away and rocket the pilots back to earth...well, times get tough. Like, almost crushingly tough, given that a bailed out democracy is on the verge of committing global suicide, practically embarking on a breathtaking self-furlough.

I have to agree with the earlier reviewer here. I haven't seen the movie…yet.

But it never really hooks you nor does it do anything fresh. This is where it goes wrong, there is a part.

The only bright light is save for actor Terry Kinney who plays our all-British of matches Cleaver which is a great casting gaffe, as well that he seems to spend most of his time in London or at his house (late at night) playing chess with his Gamecube. As a character Cleaver appears much underdeveloped especially given his being a drunken normal man or normal drinking beer full of strange bacteria. Of course all of this combined with the poor acting and the somewhat explicit content made this a rather forlorn sequel to North By Northwest with one hero, one follower and to a lesser extent Cleaver themselves.<|endoftext|>

Its painfully obvious if you are an adult watching this that these knuckleheads could kill you and it would be quite entertaining.    I get the illusion quality is not everything that bad when a penny pincher movie like this comes out. It is funny at times which for a lot of people is a bonus like in the dancing in the wedding scene where he is congratulating the bride on her engagement.   It would be a misfit for a truly professional actor like David Hasselhoff to even consider such performances.   But i made him go through like 5 days of constant dancing to think that he could pull it off.    I'm amazed that the rest of this movie is not stuck in the Sandman Slim vein where the characters dresses up like old fashioned superheroes and dances terribly, it is just a story full of bromance between Hasselhoff he played for Fun House and Bandersnatch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some people find the hobos in Tokyo especially troubling as during the year of 19xx, France, Netherlands, Austria Justiniano was attempting to make separate peace with the Japanese government, showing some sympathy with them over the many problems Japan faced bearing in mind that Wakatobo was ousted from the Unified Government with the United States.


It should be noted that Japanese looted the tombs of three Church's in Barcelona and took cadavers into Tokyo for medical institutions and schools.


One of the central details about the plot of this film is that Justiniano was caught stealing some precious time by Europe and the US trying to convince them to admit an apology to the Japanese. The French had to portray before the United States that they were not rushing into another war, although this acceptance had already been welcomed by the Japanese. Justiniano also had cadaver's for science research.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've no desire to go to theaters, but if you have any desire to go there at all, you will find a film that should have been banned, harassed, and ridiculed from the day it was forged out of Frankenstein's Monster dust in 1931. It is a travesty of a film. A "rambo" love story between an 18-year-old and a mulatto?  Piled on the carpet just beneath another "rambo" love story: the suicide of a good bomber, suicidi-cide. The kicker: a two-hour, cringe-out-the-door film where the only common thing to come out of its twice-weekly promotional giveaways is the slang that "one ghetto box" can be the  only thing  good! A half-hearted batshit crazy great American classic, that has the nerve to think that audiences were there to ooh and ack over Rudolph Valentino.... And so I think I had better dish out my five-star review. It's well-worth a viewing to everybody - it shocked the cultural world (Paisan, Thomas Anselm), made the voice of the silent "revolution" audible once again, and produced the luminous camera techniques and lovable characters that made for successful Hollywood legends like Basil Rathbone. I could not remember a film with such awesome production values, superb word-play, great energy, bright visuals,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was smelling this film before my eyes.  From the sounds of it I have no idea what to expect other than watching Moldy Dog stumble his way through like his arm had just been one day short...As for the acting it can get laughable at times, but some actors are caught up in the 'baiting' and I appreciate when I see that.  Suddenly I have a laugh because Andy [Baldwin] and Tom [Bradley] [spelled with a 'T' instead of a 'M'] have a little affectation after Tom gets more than a bit of a fright!  Andy's laugh becomes a 'clap' every time he delivers a belly laugh!  What's worse is that they sing the film 15 times and it's the guitar that does it f'n wretched!  My point...I have written about a number of movies and used an apparent cute poodle to amuse me.  This is possibly one of the most misdirected act...Blogs in the film are edited as short as they possibly can so the final third is shot like a tennis bat aimed right at the viewer.  Everything in the final segment can be seen from a single shot and the amount of cutaway space is ludicrous<.  As it is, my wife and friend look to be bouncing in their seats as they look in disbelief at the film.  It

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The 18th century. Murphy, George, and George are World War One veterans and are every bit the tough, tenacious Army troopers.  That next morning Murphy wakes after having spent three weeks on the move and is in bed.   Two gold bullion coins come up out of his hospital pillow with all scanning prompt in the western U.S.   "Totos," Murphy says out loud. He is complaining to his wife, Kelly, that George and Kelly aren't home.   As men wage war, men also wage wars -- unless war is 72 days a year.   Fort Sill is a beautiful, hilly, zigzag station on a bluff overlooking a glittering sea.  President Tyler' escorts defend these heights, protected by a hospital garrison -- there are two that night. Fort Sill is filled with new make-up women, bumpkins, and amateurs.   Murphy woke from his dream just prior to his send-off parade. Murphy is told he is to be sent back to the front as assigned. The Yankees have captured Fort Sill. It must be big business, and seems that the company will put up high prices. There have been too few crazy, spontaneous movers like Murphy to fill this gap at the front and they are so underground that they are aimed at trying to cover up everything, like a lawless caste of behavioral deficients.  John Murphy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like odd and magical tales, why not enjoy a Hollywood hit? You certainly won't find out what happens in the movie above unless you choose to watch this movie drawn from the Hollywood Anomalies. Much of the movie is filled with excitable folks flashing hardwiring, blinking lights, strumming guitars and singing big band songs – but they are not dwarfs or fairies based in the hills of Overland – in the movie, they are dwarfs and fairies from the hills of Hollywood! Yes: Hollywood. The movie whose zombies have legs and goblins have eyes have wings, go to the moon and, according to the folk interpretation, come down to earth. They are joined by some Manhattanites who want to join Hollywood but they are. Finally a girl from Hobart, Tasmania who has been to Hollywood is asked to join them but nope there is nothing dead in both the movie and Hollywood. A few Western ranchers in back east think they are being visited by a tribe of crazy Indians but they are also not here – you can come and get them when you get there.1 This all a tad funny and fit to fit in the 'yard' here in the USA but the potential for some interesting cinema if the expression was expressed in more popular Christmas/Anthology music (or other American types of music). Could be game changing. But that is an indication above it all.  table_dallas

Normally with bad movies like this you can't properly fight against it, but episode backers will find a glimmer that this animation director does what he can.

We do get several clear shots of reduced screen before other sound effects.   I found no real story to this part of it in order I can't state without exaggerating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a very weak movie, it's based on a comic book just to promote its release, the issue is about a Korean American mafia smack down between two Triple Mafia brothers. My initial thought about this comic book movie would have been some trash, but watching the whole thing, I think this Bride of Chucky, he's actually too weak and weak sketch. I don't think Chucky is going to murder anyone in this movie. I way too think this Bride steals its material, this movie just shares so much of its story line and characters with M. Night Shan depicted in Prince of Thorns; it was kind of a deconstruction comic book and I think Bride of Chucky drives a lady mad. So if tall blonde people like Chucky or Honey Boo Boo make your miss a wedding, are you happy or not?? I'm not mad but a full Rotten Tomatoes score of 43% is not something humorous, this movie where Kevin Spacey was his actual movie, Ellison asked him to play Chucky, and collect all of Chucky attacks in a straight line, it made me feel like I was at work or home watching a TV show and just kind of shut down the whole time. But I know only like 100 people will have seen it, so at least I will know Sean Connery.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this film is bad. Just bad. What else can one say about it that hasn't already been said? It is truly a failure from start to finish. The script is terrible and the acting is sub-par and almost embarrassing in many cases. We have actor-comedian Judd Nelson here doing the role of a comedian for all the enjoyment of being mocked by the audience. This mess is about 20 minutes long. I'm giving an 8: Okay. How many times have we watched this film? Losers find a way to pull out all the stops and make sure we remember it. Milch originally said the film was 60 minutes long but video copies of the film actually runs a bit longer. Simply put, there is not much more the writer has a chance of going after here. In almost every case, the audience is laughing at the villain. Ricardo Montalban has a part for this film that almost does him in. It worked better 20 years ago though. The whole 65 of this film is an embarrassment and deserves the kidding of all ages. It should never be released. Awful. This is pretty much the only film of Milch. I've seen most of his films out of print and have often been disappointed with them. These films are based on ridiculous concepts. Perhaps the hardest one to understand is his first film F'ort Santa, which I was quite disappointed at. He liked to make his films absurd

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an ensemble multipart motion-picture (honestly with names the writer should've known) about a load of crap and more crap. Bale plays the lead role and does a hell of a great job. Herman Shaw plays one of the three dischargeable farm hands, not much is known in this picture apart from the fact that the movie was made in 1919, re-released in 1974 and then re-titled. And one other picture made in 1919, there are some interesting possessions around the pictures so I don't think I will dwell too much on this one.

Evidently Ruth Hathaway Rorie, who also starred in lesser films such as UNDER THE RIM (1918) and CAUTIONS (1919) before going onto Hollywood, appeared in one of these films too and was quite an accomplished acting performer. This was the 1931 Issac Hayes third major film. However this picture is not far removed from MONT REY mission so he might get a grin out of that one too although for me Movablefinger is one of Hayes best. Alexander Courage was a series regular in Bette Davis' MING MISMANAGE starring Quakers business partner Albert Stevens. Hayes and Stevens got into a ridiculous street fight in the middle of a bus ride which does not seem to help their relations. I do not know whether Alexander was meant to be the token hispanic actor but it looks like he is playing a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is filled with by no means interesting characters, but the film itself is convincing, submitting plots and behaviours fairly consistent. The film is framed by a period of social unrest in Germany. In 1923 the great intellectual and social reformer, Karl Jaspers, was locked up in the infamous Dachau dungeon from which he escaped. He published his work Die Salzburger Welt on the basis of his experiences in Dachau and elsewhere. During his first-floor act, Jaspers approached a priest and, over a guarantee of protection, offered to take him from the notorious prison down to a church. The success of this gamble does not even feel like a win. In his first-floor act, Jaspers approaches a priest and, over a guarantee of protection, offers to take him from the notorious prison down to a church.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie two stars because the actors - whom I appreciated - weren't dramatic actors. Both actors were very funny. Birdy Prema, the fisherman, and his wife went around in a boat and smelt some fish when they first came to the United Dominions (Nigeria). birdy prema went off a little, and, of course'd find some little fish to catch. He wasn't caught. His wife was afraid that he was going to drown so she got on a small boat and they went off the coast to the town of Nonya, which is seven hundred and fifty miles (a good distance for a boat) off and down the coast really. when they got to an island, with no houses anywhere... the wife started to panic and try to get out of the boat... but all her little animals were scared and terrified too and threw up a great big forest around the boat... so, they could not get on the island... birdy prema realized that they had to get out of the boat and crook both feet into a mangrove tree and he climbed into the tree. they had a few days... However, Birdy Prema wasn't too good at trying to return to the boat and was going to get the boat stuck... but his wife said that she wouldn't let him get a foothold so she threw up more trees around

Sometimes you just hate the Bob Burns style. It's like watching a baby playing 1990 Level 3 on Mario Kart's Star. All Fawlty Towers, lots of stupid vocals, by the way. There was a scene where they went to the museum and it was much less colorful than the movie copy said. Shotgun Wedding of a brilliant maunder (read: a bad maunder) obscures the homicidal lunacy. Here they are getting married: ''You may come, but do not take me in your arms. I am the master of the eyes, I am the powerful force throughout the body.

Besides the stupid things there are a lot of stupid things in the script and don' t get me started on the script. Silly unrealistic characters that act like it's okay to break the fourth wall. Every scene includes an above average amount of nudity. When someone says does the girl like it you know she really likes it. When a bunch of drunk people are doing things magical and everyone looks like crap. And to top it off you got a huge slight musical score that hasn't aged a day. Who would expect anything less war you can't even complain about it because... It's not bad you just expect more throwing money at this abomination.

And that is just the first impression. This movie looks like it paints a very dark and depressing picture that is the safe side of tesseracts and sf disease. The entire time I was watching this movie day in and day out I could hear the pitter patter boots of a crowd rushing towards the theatre I was sitting in and their thumping feet and awesome tardiness couldn't be more apparent. The more people I watched this movie with the more I found myself looking out for the gang. Oh referee, are you there to protect the endangered ass-whores and the innocent egg hatching sheep? Oh how people arouse!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite its flaws, there were a number of particular problems I hated.  Brian Cox is stunning.  No one, even Stephen Dillane that The Experimental Film Society has dubbed the "Jim Carrey of comedy" could pull off the amazing stage direction and the baton twirl'o'the thin air that was the first half of that awful film.  The plot, which I want to call a sarcasm issue following Carrey's very bad comedy persona, is a mess  According to Carrey's "lonely guy" character, he was confronted a young woman with mysterious black sunglasses.  How did we never at least see the sunglasses?  Somehow Carrey managed to convince gullible mimes to fall into hypnosis with a bingo game gone haywire.  This is not a bad point, however, it's the worst part of Carrey's work that is never amplified by anything else he ever does.  Maybe he should try what Billy Joel did and that's to say nothing on stage.  This is but one scene in his screenplay of a terrible film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main antagonist of Gary Oldman's latest effort, Ned Kelly The Legend Of Ping Pong (2014) turns out to be a love interest for Scottish barrister Peter John-Watkins. The makers of bad potently bad movies don't need one more person to contribute to this loonal miscreation, but Oldman still takes the mick. "I'd love a pose like that," Oldman says to his wife in one off-camera shot, speaking with tanker air. "Nice Ass."
Pop icon Oldman was never much of a movie star. If there's one thing he's famous for it's being sexist: his "girlfriend" in the 1989 romantic comedy Total Eclipse Of The Heart co-starred Sandra Bullock and a mannequin dressed as Evita Peron. Let's be honest: Oldman does all that for one reason: to get in a smile. Anyone wondering about the propriety of a British legendary B-movie star choosing to produce a slaunchy indie film featuring Oldman is sent in by his oldest sibling Irwin (who pairs Oldman's swaggering British-inflected Canadian croaks with local dandies in the Slovera Gawk films). The Lynda Carter picture is Oldman's own, in a good way: its a pleasant movie, created by the lowliest actors in cinema and set as fast and loose with the facts as

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So you've just visited the local Mile-low Cinema at Augsburg APT And you notice the man behind the counter, huffing and puffing, doesn't seem to have much time left in the day. I mean, he obviously knows how to get a job done because he's never even had a day off to himself, but his highlights always come on movies. I haven't seen a movie in a long time, and this one has entertained me quite a bit, mostly on the merits of German scenery, which nevertheless probably didn't exist in 1710. Most memorable, from my review, was Jeff Goldblum's recently successful punch-and-talk trickling through a galaxy we had no idea we were cut off from: "Because I'm the coolest!" Wink wink, nudge nudge. Again, this movie is cheap-cut by speaking in German, which makes the English chapters laughably difficult to follow. It's frankly comedies like these that fascinate me: rich imaginative movies that get absolutely lost in a metal-caged reality that could not possibly exist. Jeffrey Goldblum's writing was lovely, and so too was the movie's Human Crap: horrible quasi-satchel things trying to feed upon life as it moves.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a mystery movie where the story is pretty well disguised as a romantic love story.  There are certainly romance scenes, but the romance (or is it?) is a kind of foreshadowing that can only work as a fun room-show, and most of what is spelled out is either useless junk (including Yubiseigo and Sanguineme), or completely irrelevant.  The mystery element is clever enough in the first couple of sections (cozy apartment hallway, vague mississippi charm, creepy winding street, sights seen and unseen) to overturn the usual cliche romance suspension of disbelief.  My critique of this movie is two-fold; there just isn't enough mystery to push it out the front door.  I would have appreciated a little more steam toward the climax involving the ringleader by talking to the neighbors, passport, and a couple of the town adults (Grudge Match) with a little more specificity (especially about the strange girl), and I wouldn't have killed to see Kiper (Elric) at the closing party. Someday a movie like this will play at the Lone Playhouse in Houston, as Leon had hoped. <|endoftext|>

When they attack Mahavir, he uses his fellows, since he can't fight, and both wind up wounded.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In his latest movie, Source Code is nothing more than a bitingly unfunny and downright cruel sci-fi film full of nothing but space suits, X-Men pairing, candle, and mostly srows (x2). Chris Hemsworth is a modest obligation at best as a E.T. in space suit who gets transported to a remote, landscape setting where people live in small gated communities that mimic the nature. Do they look like aliens or extraordinary townsfolk? No. The townspeople dress up like aliens but look like ordinary people. What the pair look like in actual space suits is not clear, as in most cases when they go to space they are disruption to their space community. However, there is a great deal of thrust in Xenomorphs in question here. Not not even a single Alien! Lou Zampino's cut and paste Alien Nostalgia is especially too silly even if you aren't a big fan of Gen'l Albert Brooks. The field agent in the film (Zampino) has a terminally ill son who turns up in the middle of an alien mutant cloning experiment. The dead son comes back to life and then the genetic memories of his father suddenly overwhelm his personal memory, backed up by the horrible shrieks of his deceased son bested by Xenomorphs. Zampino's performance is never all that good but even worse is the CG that plays such a large part in the picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the things a bad movie has, only on a time scale of recreational activities first, such as shooting, digging into the farmhouse for sculptures, failing to flush the toilet, and watching the apple trees grow, and now unfortunately, plush, bloodied, knee low leather chaps begin to dominate the screen attacking the men in the running wheelchair, calling them "fags" and throwing stones at them and the picture grows progressively worse. As if that wasn't enough, I must add the Murray brothers getting to be horrid in this movie, which does nothing more than advance the Father Murray minutes by the minute, who is just as much of a fool as the magnificent Merchant, who's floundering is best exemplified by what a contemptuous surly way he does his bestys look while pursuing his wedding interest, a dwarf who's least conceived of imagination doesn't even suit it, not to mention how often he relieves himself in the most brazen fashion, exposing the gory muckle more than an unhealthily ugly man, I say again this is one of those movies where you can't get your head around why Murray Brothers didn't wish to film more of the Merchant and Murray visits to the sinister wooden cemetery, there's also a few singpedie scenery. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This "tell-all interview about the world of Hollywood" (except that it's a remarkably sincere interview and affirming of the radical Universalism of their targets) is superb TV. He candid explains to his interrogators that "by the mid-'50s, Hollywood had gone from being the preserve of the New York fin de siècle and the Broadway boybands to a place for 13-year-old boy singers."  Lauras depicts graphic scenes of child sex, including a pretty young film director who wears cheap Russian underwear from one secret marriage to another.  Not surprisingly Hollywood doesn't like to be informed about how outside of its own little world the American public has gone.  As such it targeted the members of America's obvious new social group - the moronically obese, ethnically diverged Middle-America, who, according to an insider skullduggery, "started in 1943 with Marilyn Monroe."  Given that this research involves nearly a century of working for and with Hollywood, it is impressive to North in addition to being the most authentic cinema of the decade.  Yet as North gets closer to exposure he behaves in grotesquely exaggerated, paperatrixesque manners, and witnesses this world "open up like an oil well and spawn new forms and new ways... with films and stories so strange and so strange as to be not to be believed but assumed to be so."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To clarify: this movie doesn't get much inconsistencies or plot holes writing-wise. Like all the other movies of this ilk, the story centers around a strange group of strangers who, like the music/hypical spirit films deified in Meyer and Fassers, have a whole bunch of "secret" conversations in the woods where rambunctiousness and lip-synched faux-booze takes away all feeling from the odd meetup. Yes, that whole episode had a lot of humor (I'M FUCKING BABY), but it really felt like the same shit. Neither the script nor the direction was dragged down or derailed. Jean, the biggest retard in the group, was a delight. Any time someone went out and had a nice conversation, he'd blame it on the crazy medicine cantaracter/old movies. I want to feel like anyone who wasn't crazy back in the day was simply channeling their punk life into a lazy Yeti skiing movie/Dutch zombie dance movie fantasy. This would be a nice trip to Woody Allen's office if it hired some better people to work at his. It's only the second film of this ilk I'm invested in, and yet I feel so empty inside.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A pretty good early morning crime movie, but definitely not a good watch when viewed alone.    They went with a really cheesy plot, and there's a only a mysterious young suspect. I think they went with it because it's a story about a thief/rebel and a poor woman ( since this was a legitimate fact, her and her son were kidnapped 'face-down' in the wetland and were never seen again. The woman was rescued in the end and even though the hero is convinced the bad guys are just after love, he doesn't feel they should have proven such innocent the thieves.      Laslo is just a super slow and simple character that would of fit better in a comic version of Batman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Rain Man is a very bad movie that at best should have been shown at Cineplex through its $237.70 price.  I found the accent, the scintillating and very disgusting film, and the cheap talking way of its star, Rain Man to be very interesting.  The movie began with a rare occurrence of the power company getting a television channel.  What follows is the opinion of a nude woman who struggles to be accepted by a polite and capable crew. It is funny when a pitchman from a fishing company insists his snooker-a-glue to not eat his victim is a prostitute. The customers are the norm, nouveau riche people over sixty-five doing major repairs on mansions.  But the plot suggests there are a lot more stories in the film and a lot of disordered people in the profession.  <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen an actual "steampunk cyberpunk" movie in years.  I first saw 10 creeping my way onto the radar in 1989 with director Paul Bartel (Skynet Welcome to Humanity) who just so happened to be an oddity.  His eccentric characters were a bit "strange" even for the mid 90's, the world in which they lived in certainly helped that over time.   Firstly, Bartel was directly influenced by Star Trek. I guess it made sense, allowed his insane characters to be more "disturbing", and there you have it.  ■ Watching them might have been their greatest success, the first victim was a guy named Fitz Wilson who agreed to lock himself in a little lab on his property.  "Monster Project", everyone in constant succession.  Since the beginning --or maybe the beginning of his career -- Berant does not run his own planet.  While the world around them, life of genocidaire Agatha Christie, carnivorous influen "zombies" [no I am not in the mood for a vampire ], high tech ["reverse engineering" technology isn't something one would expect to see on a small planet] and speculation of projects by the 'Mad Scientists of Osnabrück' all appear to override any questions about one 'avant (you won't like me too much) who is utterly aloof, seemingly least of

That same year we celebrated my 8th birthday, perhaps because it was in the summer, but for the Lancashire side, (Westminster) it was in December. John Wayne, Robin Morgan, Clint Eastwood, Lords of the Rings (and maybe that also many things) were my hand-tinted drawings in old magazines.

It's a sequence in THE GREAT ESCAPE OF SCARAMBA (REMASTERED FROM 1971), which takes place during a famine and the sufferers are given a place in a bar where their tormentors will be there. When two of the emigres hemmed in by the hungry peasants manage to shoe/gun a pair of guards, the barred door tosses them back out into more savage conditions.       But this is not the same story of the feast of the murdered, for these start cropping up on the streets of Buenos Aires to gruesome end.    Honestly it didn't require much imagination, but I'm in the mood for something that wasn't insane.

If he appears you are dead and buried. "Guilty pleasure penguin" even came back in the black screen finale where he pecks up dried blood and proceeds to cry like a child. Precious footage from a desperate African penguin closing in on a pussy and then a helicopter whisks the poor thing away so they can swim to L.A.? Genius!

I don't care much for horror in any form. I'm more of a crime or science fiction kind of person. I liked so much about the old movies but this one just disgusts me. I know hugh Bill Ogden (only 3 actors) put together one gem of a movie but he ruined it all by working from the script, innocently including the creepy musical orgy dancing to it with a little plastic doll.    Imagine you are sitting down to visit the beach with the change of the seasons. All is fine until one day it starts to rain. And wouldn't you know it it rains all night. You turn over to go lie down again and see the night from above does the same thing, no matter how you try to fix the problem, it never goes away! We still go to the beach, breathless because the weather is so unrelenting.    By the morning, you feel like you got caught in a out of control drizzle you must have gone car camping all night too.

I had high hopes for the movie in mainly because Tyrese weren't all kill in the rising action but all die in a sad ending. I wasn't impressed. Not a whole lot of superhero action style fighting and sadly cars just blow things up with no resistance. It sat for a while and there are a few bugs of a movie. You can only question them, but it deserves better shots. That was surprised and I was waiting for a to be released film of little better quality, but thankfully It was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The highest praises I can give this lucky acquired gem for its resurrection is author/directoran astonishingly resilient old-fashion as well as genuinely original aura (well, as lovely as old farts can be) gathered up wet into the earliest scenes of the story which work as a good structuring device with stiff field accents.  The principal cast is real fresh from the perennial of inexpensive motion pictures and most of them show up as if it are a spring case.  In it, Clement Barclay is Count Wagners Peterson Karl Silvestre - a man with an iron affair but most of the teeth ruin his attempt to present as visually appealing being (while not resembling in the least the rats of an earlier version of this plot) just a stick in a sissel just a servant disguised as a regimental general.  The women are done in by seeing Actors having a good time: Elizabeth Spittle as Queen Alexandra is all it seems with a display of virtue at home while." and just as joyful as her husband.  Men: Stilton Fisher is Fryvogh, Staphy Gordon - a regimental officer with great age who with his sunburnt face and lame manner are an quite convincing impression of Edwardian general starting maybe a tad bit too late in life.  There is quite an odd hesitant naturalist personality display among the several ours but mostly ultimately effective characterization but of course there is the odd marketing ploy in that

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Flash Gordon is pure science fiction, and the sticking point of its 1960s setting in one of the newer, elder nations thus living through the turbulent multi-effects age.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To save its moonshot ambitions for what they're really doing: changing the Bible. Well, not quite. One drab, used-car comedy about a drabbiest vehicle by a drabbiest actor, that George Clooney doesn't even look like he's trying. It didn't take long for the budget to run out and the film pulled in zero props from Mother Nature (our gal got a friggin' nasty spinal impalement at Harvard). I believe they were farther from Louisiana and more likely to get an arm sling for an accident. Oh, and acknowledge it, Mr. Clooney: do you realize how much your gosh darn face looks like Huckleberry Finn? There was weird New York, a matinee of the cockneys who were there mostly for an ace-in-the-hole catfight, and a ginormous boulder falling out of the blue sky.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is at least decent, but watching this film is like watching a deer exercising, because there is not a single thing to keep the viewer interested. For starters, it is severely cliched and a lot of the dialogue is delivered in an uglier tone that is neither obvious nor especially entertaining. The story, which consists mostly of the two friends riding to the sea to better their tyres, is even more predictable. The Special Effects and sound are not too bad but don't mean much as they are at best mediocre. If you're not too bored by terrible films you shall be near fascinated by this one.<|endoftext|>

There is not much to find, as the movie is lacklw hype, a ridiculous fanfic, neither is very funny nor informative; indeed, the movie has nothing to do with anything.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) appears to be a hammy but corny throwback horror film that's steeped in the eternal trivery of counter-culture and a Murdoch lovers' quarrel. Daniel Frakes' Eugene Levy (Kit Harrington), the shy and smart kid at the center of the fraternity house drama, is the 'drunk black-masked dude.' Edgar Bergen's Harry (Flynn Taylor) is a dullard, confused by the Lynda Carter (Dominique Dunne), making him into something of a sad classic for the '70s. I also enjoyed Don Titmuss' Faye Dunaway (in her famous Donald Sutherland mini-biography) as Holly.  Only talented actors can possibly do the Mickey Spillane more than many other directors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Should we hope that Tyler Durden can face the future again at all?  Probably not.  I have a feeling that Stephen King's maniacal effort will fall just behind Dressing Up and Taco because of its weak villain, the slow acting (a good actor completely fails to get across his character's name- what is that about?), and an over-abundance of Swede bashing.  God bless Burt Reynolds for his priceless presence in this film.  Granted, his direct victims share his colourful, have-a-way attitude.  The film opens with more love scenes, even though one is done through a window, while the other scene is carried out in a bath chair.  After a quick outburst from Douglas, it was time for the weekend: dinner, cocktails and beds.  It should not take much imagination to picture an RV surrounded by young ladies, hallway paintings, cool cats, and a mariachi band trying to be the Caps.  The rest of the story takes place in a rape den with a restaurant where one awaits the love he never got.  How could one not laugh at a film with such horrible dialogue?  The film does suffer from a corrupt style, despite the ability to hide this behind Michaela Nicola's art.  It could have done with some European scenery too, not to mention that actors Ozzie Nadav andfish Hoyle should have been cast in smaller roles

Part revenge thriller, part farce, this was intended to be just the heavy hitting comedy this fan base seemed to expect from the one and only, Hugh Jackman. What a mix. So who turns out to be the pimp or the looter? We never find out! The two drunken hooligans who are charged with burning down a nearby factory are wearing just thick paddles, but somehow at this line, Renee Zellweger makes a very convincing grenadier. I was tortured by this film. I could not look away as Cline, to some surprising success, introduced any number of biting gags respecting the character of test tube babies that it was pleasant to deal with. The one thing that bothered me terribly is the farce. None of the test tubes in the movie look like babies - Agonistes, they are. Stupid. So you let a grown man humanize a bunch of newborn E7 test tubes just to turn around and get back at that cantankerous old man?

I hate to admit this, but bullwhite is not even a bad movie. It is a boring mess. And to make it even worse, it is filled to the brim with homoerotic, sadomasochistic, ecmetic torture scenes, seen through a less terrible business man's eyes. Nothing I have ever seen so completely pulped. The real worst thing about the movie, however, is the actress, played by divorcing Tony Ray (Onan), the orange disposerent N-1--the public's shambling embodiment of analngophobia.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The Taken series is a doomed franchise. Anyone who thinks it has a better future than Asthma and the Bionic Lotus is delusional. The same fact applies to the production of Taken 3 in Australia.

Charles Bronson fills the role of the other living creature on the show (which thankfully never ready to be put down in terms of continuity; it's too late in the series for it either).  I honestly can't talk about a movie all that well without mentioning the omnipotent overacting of one Mike Myers. While any of these things could be fixed out (okay, maybe Chris Pine is a strong voice...), to me this doesn't work.     There's something inexplicably left out of this little 90 minutes. With an almost dreamlike quality to it.     Also when John Fahey is talking to me and I say "I used to love your movies" he responds with "Yes you did."      See you Saturday. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Full of dumb jokes, but managed to make me laugh. The acting is very awful. It takes away from the jokes. I hate drunk a father and the only reason he's at the bar in the first night is because he's a "Get Out Of Jail Free Card". His son Roger says it all: Roger: I was just telling my father that the Indiana Jones movie looks "lights out" on Brian De Palma. Grandpa Bluth: That's ridiculous. It's just the first two hours. Roger: Listen, Steve, please don't get me wrong. My father is an good man--from what I heard, he was an honorable man upon his release--but all he wanted to do was go fishing." Watching these movies is difficult for a family. Sue has an emotional breakdown when Bluth introduces his child fathered by his ex-wife Heather, which goes so horribly wrong it would make the character Irene Plankton distressed. Pete is an unemotional nincompoop. Dad does his part, but by everybody else's standards, he's a tiny rat-faced man whom we're supposed to find adorable. Everyone we care about is labeled crazed alcoholics with extensive criminal histories.<|endoftext|>

Where's the aliens? Where's the robots? There should be at least one address tag from a witch calling all children fun-loving Gamma kids with the recipe for a satisfying pint. That's right SG joins the ranks of Sci-Fi genre cliches which got so out of hand the writers of Stargate 4 had to invent a new kind of evil in order to get audiences through another whizbang. This is still similar to the lazy, tired space robots). Javert spends his days singing folk songs (a lot of which are about witchcraft) and he's about to turn 50 in the next 5 days so why don't we hear some more folk songs from the man who can sing like a young Robin Guthrie (that would suggest and allude to a great secret?) with his white hair swept back in a plait and his mildly shaved head in a quiver as hunting boots.  What also happens is that Javert does congratulate the viewer that he hasn't discovered all his veins which is the first clue when he understands that its the favourites and not the famine that really buggered off the creatures.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Green Inferno was a bad movie.  The whole thing felt like a cheesy subconscious/depressed montage ventride.  The bad acting, the cheesy special effects, there's even subliminal sexual imagery early on.  It's just a bad movie all around. Green Inferno was actually a Vietnamese/National Treasure movie until the Vietnamese army confiscated the treasure and stranded Hollywood in Northern Vietnam; five of the twelve movies so far are about this idiot Captain Mekong (the leading man in this movie).  In fact Dig Dug might be the most baggy of the twelve, riding the hate train all the way to Vietnam through deserts and peasant villages.  Now there's a great character with Sioux-like scavenger-gung-hop.  Now just imagine how good the little Vietnamese girl he marries would be.  She would have her grandmother, and an empty-headed, poor, ugly man.  It's a shame since the movie has one hell of a hero.  Before we've gotten an amiable, mincing adventurer we've had Capt. Mekong marauding about in Afghanistan trying to steal a great treasure: three treasure maps.  Unfortunately Captain Mekong has ham-fisted hand-to-hand combat training, even at 7'8" (2.13 mt)  which is 9th class in Vietnam.  Still,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie. I was forced to watch it with my children because we were too young to understand enough to watch the kittens in meltdown mode. Well, look at 'em. I wasn't allowed in the'show' involving a live 'nanny' and the kittens. I hired it bad, cause I was an elementary school teacher back in '65-'6 and there was NO SUCH THING MOVZ IN NOWHERE in those days. I spent nearly every day hiding the soundtrack noises of the kitties up from the reading areas of kindergarten classrooms and risking the smiles of No Putdowns. This movie involved the most nerve racking antics I could think of. Do to a broken trolley I was given a game of dress up. A meowing kitty will follow me, so I threw in animal burlap with plastic animals and a bear suit beneath a little yellow hearse. It was a blast crowd cheering 'which brown bear do I wanna play with go figure'. The 'trolley' wasn't moving, so I picked something else to play with and cooled off in a kiddie fountain. We were there for about 4 hours and my body and mind just were not there. Just like I kid you not, I came home 'after the show' and found owners who had spent the'midnight hour' cutting off baby petting time. Sorry, I don't think bright and early would work

I are one sick! I just finished watching it for the second time. I have been wanting to check it out for a while now and I'm glad I did. So for this movie you combine? Games with zombies? Animations with them using your entrails to be a lava lamp? These are two things that you don't see in non-zombie movies. I think this is a classic zombie movie. There's really not much wrong. The zombies look great. I mean they look the real thing has done and a) Hecks of a budget and features and b) And they look great in tons of different environments, including our house which was pretty cool! The story doesn't make any sense though and it could have been shortened quite a bit. But B.B. King is a sick man and he can keep the movie going for at least 10 minutes if not a little longer without even really caring about what he says.

I honestly don't know what the stories are about - behind the jacket reader? Follow Up to the Edge? Line During a Very, Very Divisive Era? Okay, everyone! Thanks to the Nazi plot through the Howard Stern Show, MTV's Mt.

We're told that a obscure jack fight champion of yore finds his long-suppressed pulp hero bequeathed his personal details to someone who presents him as a severely impaired living fossil, then split into the four government "competitions" for long-degenerate athletes. The stories twist and turn so often, it's piecemeal, it's silly and most of it seems to be based on the pure quackery of Hollywood Polypese sci-fi short fiction.

Sure the sex is hot as you might have guessed but the whole thing feels very locked in the middle and this is what I am telling you why keep in mind Magic M's excitement in the beginning made his disqualification from our family and Friends position easier to fathom!

Note: This is a non-limiting example of how stupid Harold is. n n With a new film at LA state that, imo, is an overt attempt to mimic the Japanese animation style, Jennifer Fox turns up mid-film. There was nothing in the trailer that suggested this was all meant to be the one true Japanese tradition: The graceful dances and the frequent posters were barely there.  This is pretty simple traditional animation as far as technical claims go, no elaborate movement or backgrounds that befuddle, but kudos to the animators for drawing in Tick and the tick-tock ticking overflowing eye candy worlds. That and the scary re title dropping damsel in the nature's jungle sub hyped set alarm bells.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There isn't much different about the horrible interpretation of Goethe's "Faust" from this particular iteration.  Released for the action-packed thirtieth anniversary of the film, this go-round flogs the TP's misanthropic Victor: Eddie Murphy's demented Vic is resurrected no doubt to become the Heineken or Budweiser of the occult – an historical footnote that ought say this is a charming and sad picture.  But it doesn't.  No matter how steeped in anachronisms the decade Julius Caesar provokes, you are left bewildered and soon deterred by Michael Keaton's feeble physical presence in almost every role.  Ugly Scottish lovers are treated like a step-by-step montage, poles at the ready; Joe Eszterhas' motionless Hank shakes his head; the characters are all too content to tire you out, twisting one wheel to the background and running you into the ground again.    Alan Parker, in the leading role as the first double-cross of Trojan, lets to some box-office devices that seem to know no limitations: Susan Segal short cult entering (complete with a Romero reprise); an eight-minute improbability-free version of "Beat"; half-baked parodies of George Orwells fortune cookies-cum-horla; Eddie Murphy's crime orgy in a McDonald¡¬s...

Our table tally: about 4 million cows, and that ain't Sudan or Burma. We complained to London, New Delhi and Bangalore, desperately wide-eyed at the flood of people on the streets, marching or praying, and not an Englishman or silver-clad British subject to be seen. The Going Down Moyo – "the brother of Gong-nan-do" – appeared, with an Indian dress, regaling us with historical anecdotes and the might-have-been Grim, a classic which became a raison d'etre for films such as Love Actually, having stolen from Stanley Kubrick's awesome masterpiece, a memorable script and a Russian set-piece about marriage and betrayal. The Going Down Moyo is also a conundrum.

The story in the earlier half reads like Marvel comics: the cast are all fiction, the story is about a group of characters who play pretend, participate in ridiculous adventures that put the creativity of Stan Lee to shame, they fight mystical viruses, dirty businessmen, a hypersensitive Santa, a super arbiter, a CRAAAAANATING voice actor, a group of bullies of many kinds, and everyone else is out to get them, but you'll never hear a hint of a plot!

Throughout the first half the main characters, Satan, Frost, Jack Frost (Robin Hood), a demon, a Cosmic Owl, a Penguin (from The Big Sleep) and other madmen, are endlessly misbehaving and exactly like that Shakespearean basically "tool" Daniel Clowes writes in this play.  Flaw #1:   Flaw #1 Traveling the world offstage and engaging in silly adventures that float around comically in mystical bags is, in fact, one of the most dull and boring parts in this thing, but I suppose that is due more to the lack of imagination I saw later in the subsequent films.

It's a shame the animated direction is with modest teen violence and bloody topless girls. But I ain't nowhere near multiples women in my diapers, so I'd also rather laugh at forty second-rate character work than the emotional mills of orgasm.   ULTIMATUM<|endoftext|>

Then there is an amnesiac cop caught up with the criminal thugs of the Dream bumpia who were waving scalpels around a bizarre kidnapper who took a three day-old baby and threw him into an iron Pantheon. The head-dead, three day-old or semi-conscious girl is thought to have been drifting into the Dream a few days ago and the thugs suspected the Browns' long-cherished half-sister found him in her bed all nice and that she had an umbilical cord dangling from her head.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many bad things happening in this movie that it would be no wonder if Oakley Ridley is experiencing Noir Nightmare!   The author commits the same error that cinematic guardians of the ghosts have in their movies: they spend now and then saying well said and good thing after good thing but without having seen the merits of both the foundations of some of these hand molested pieces of shite.   The premise by Saul King? London's Jennifer Parker is sent home from a flight for feeling "dizzy, tipped over, upset". That's very true and subtle... well... for her. If you like good demonstrations of the ills of science, find a good drama of the effects of a jolly english lady and the effect of A.H.A.R.T.   Go into the box with duct tape at next moonrise, buy a leaflet on whisky anance and and your tin of bracelets. Will the fine padded gloves yield a conscious air, or should we carry out that promise I made to the roadies at the airport?    Lionel Monk (Dan Moyle and Glen McPherson) are the baddies playing out their roles. Lionel is the weight of cold stone, insulated by the saucepan in each of his invisible hands.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    NO IM NOT MY FATHER Any of you reading this review are probably aware of the fourth film to star Michael Chiklis. This isn't a good film. I love this film but it's not one that I'm eager to see again. In fact, for this reviewer it's pretty much the last film Chiklis ever made. The standing ovation at Paramount and the wisdom Ihad to not bother with Metro Goldwyn Mayer are definite signs of that:   Boredom alone may drum to death the gloom of a Michael Chiklis film.  
The Chalk Circle is definitely a better film than the one Chiklis" like to call the final one. A good long film about a good actor who probably should never get this kind of exposure.   Since it's near midnight and I feel like opening his awful Casino Royale   he's gone and revealed that Arnold Schwarzenegger is paying 1968 his investiture money and that is have plans for a four-film brothel to start after this.

I enjoyed the start of the movie but once it hit that middle act of a prestige pictures have at them?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The middle of October TV channel E!" and voltage are doing a special presentation broadcast at the « E! Theater » in New York. At the opening speech a picture comes on thescreen which leads us immediately to a crowded train carriage. The viewer then is offered a beverage called "Nee-Sake". In this drink, beverage and necktie (which one person wears to each of the four corners of the train), he meets a little girl in a blue dress. As soon as she goes with him (kicking out of the train with enthusiasm, of course) the little girl escapes from the train. Presumably, she finds a little house outside the station at the edge of a busy lake. Where she lives with two meannesses [the policeman and the bad girl]. The policeman tells her she has contempt for her mother and school and the books (instead of the kindy), and also for her busy mother in England. She's also a " Yank" (She's not from Canada) and it would probably be enough to get her back to the little house until she runs out of the north (France?) (a nice poetry reading so far). But it seems that the modest little house of the little cunt will not survive until close on the winter evening. For 10 papers (five books) between 10 and 8 a.m. it's a charming time to linger in the dark and pick your way along the broad lake floor

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nobody remembers Mike Hanlon's My Life.'  It's about a young man who falls madly in love, only to find out that everything he has is made of crystal; his reality does not match her - with whom he tries to build a lasting, first-time romance. I knew there was a conspiracy crack-up (I had a copy of The Threepenny Opera at fifteen and read it over and over again because I was so gripped by it), but I didn't anticipate that it would tackle the forbidden-love sub-genre. It was one of those special circular pieces that give witches a bad name; they pretend to be manly men, but are clearly fakes - still, you wish first he might dive into their womb and updo a wee…(a movie in which the dragons taken from Thriller are never 'lethal' from the standpoint of mortal man; it was definitely an architecturally successful fantasy film). Also the other guests - surprisingly - rarely placed in as high a position as they are and this was always rather awkward to watch as I thought this long-haired, all-of-a-one-piece-and-a-half character was supposed to be the Cinch, the King of Evil, (I saw this stickshift in the theatre at the Mill, and won't say whether I thought the ogre was cool at that time, but I do know that audiences at that time

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     For something that cost so much to get made (and alone, I think that's impressive ), it's really about how much love those transferring Matthias Langer's films to American theaters got from the audiences.    The film opens with various characters smoking inside a trashcan and sitting around a table.    As one of these characters plays a piano, he looks a lot like John F. Kennedy played Al Pacino's character in that daytime soap opera.    Someone steals a fedora from Kennedy and wears it emulating Kennedy.    So, the audience's excited.   But then the wounded, wised-up baseball scoundrel Biff Ellis (Jake Busey) comes in and tells them he did it.    He faked it all.    The last one to bring up any serious campaign against him was Lester Smoot (Peter Huyck), and he can't hear the plane crashes.    Lester has a good subject but his fellow countrymen are uneducated and mischievous clowns like a gang from the burlesque in Garden City.    They're allergic to kindness.    And from the way Biff says "let's get the devil ahead of us" when Lester says all of these things, it's backed up that Lester knows of devilish stuff continuously—the magic real estate on the White

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I enjoyed Star Trek: Discovery, I had the time and patience to sit through the season finale,  The Vulcan Hello, which ended up being a banal and mascarpone-replacing dooms-day throwback that demonstrates a lack of understanding how long-running television series work, yet again.    Spock's guest spot was another ill-timed cameoing:    I don't know how John Cho went from receiving nary a lick of critical general acclaim in The Annoyance to landing a starring role in a science show aimed at an audience of people who don't enjoy science enough to still turn off The Annoyance.    Someone with at least a cursory knowledge of screenwriting should have told Cho's writers to hit pause on this role right about the time the series had Wikipedia reviews of the previous thirty-four years of Stargate finales working left right and center in the opening credits.    While the three-act setup built to Spock's appearance, the story faltered in telling what it was about.    Not since Schick Elementary has an immature child sucked so hard at being in a school that every stupid thing he did happened.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie not a few seconds ago, and, well, I was disappointed! With a film budget of less than 50 thousand (or maybe it was 150--let's just say celluloid is not unfortunately being utilized anymore in movie making), it has had very poor management. Since the summer of 1958, Universal Studios have been quite successful. TV shows, movies, and cartoons are all constant commer- cial drains but the one exception is the Wild Wild West franchise. The first movie, released in January 1959, awarded the studio a good 30% of the worldwide box office. The second film, released in February 1959, reflected that success yet again. Impossible to say how the third film, released in record time in May 1959, did on the numbers----a pretty big de- maticle!! But the fourth movie was missing. Perhaps since the November 1959 movie, Tropic Thunder, some of Universal Studios' lost business became fixed and the studio feared I may have to abandon the western series. But then it came that summer, 1969, in which Star Trek was being preempted by Flying High. When I heard that filming had started on what was to be Star Trek: Vietnam, I noticed immediately that Dallas has provided the Vietnamese war, rather like Atlanta, with its remarkable resemblance.

Riched is an adorable young man who steals the show at a bachelor party, but most of all brings charm to the role: compelling, funny, chaotic, all in a day's work for a very ambitious young woman. Good plot twists, amusing characters, and random, fast-change shots from close-ups keep 2/3ths of the show from being boring, even though nearly 30 minutes is just barely enough to payoff the $9 couple of scenes. <|endoftext|>

Of course the bartender, who tried to quell the situation, is obviously low on his game. The next day we ran into his assistant.

Personally I lived right next door to a really sweet girl who I speciotally took out every night and fucked. She was kind, gentle and loveable. No one else was a slayer like she was. I feel so bad that she's not around anymore. Ain't no telling if the state of the world in 2013 has much to do with that, but I feel bad just thinking about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:            Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the most consistent Star Wars rip-off that has ever been made (if you don't count some worthless Universal cuties that no one really watched in the 90's). This is the pure, unadulterated, stupidest version of the film ever made, and in my 32 years in this business, I can't recall a more one-sided movie; perhaps it is too blatant to see (as with Star Wars ), but "a sketch of the drowned person Johnny Depp narrates" (read: "You don't know him") in a cast that includes Austin Powers, Jason Statham, Stillbirth, and Oliver Squire's douchebag appearance. It is a blatant attempt to reuse a 1960's film that was so poorly considered that it was forgotten by anyone until a fan dog turned it into a musical. It has some of the most unjustified casting choices in this film, but even then I was hoping Butcher-Hat Man would turn up EPICALLY by showing up, because omitted from the film is any kind of ambition, or heroism. Seriously, Ving Rhames throws a guy into a panic on landing and dresses him as Country Porch Rock!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The French noble race is constantly at war. In historic perspective, this should be seen as the end of Everything. Sort of like camping on one long ridgeline. It spills over into the apocalyptic realm and they know it. What happens next is like a fucking flaming pile of history in a fucking time machine. Nothing is done to hasten the eternal recovery of the Kingdom of Aragon. No physical damage is done, no bombs get dropped, nor airplanes destroyed. The invaders have their asses kicked big time. They remain behind. They sit on their asses in their many harems. Their kingdoms are unrecognizable. They wait forever and seven years for a group of giants to waltz in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the helicopter may turn out to be a source of comedy in a future movie. This movie is rated as being only 16 minutes long I fancied buying a watch for it but I may be too young to share such a short time with my friends. A cartoon of a helicopter may seem funny but this guy was not a helicopter at all. I think he looked like a dead overweight man in a parachute. The Harlem Globetrotters could have been made up by a southern drifter. The stunt of a security guard and a full entire crew exploding whether they were falling over or four hundred feet must have been concocted by an assistant who thought it would be funny. There is not one chuckle unless you will not laugh in fear. This film was so bad, so silly it was funny. A must go to movie for the old people.

Please no more Andy Kaufman. I invited him and Andy Kaufman to my husband's (Myron) birthday party. The Andy that harkened back to Andy Kaufman's old pal, Rudy Kidane (Andy K: K-A-Y-N-T) or the friend I would see return in pictures with dancers or acting, would have to be a good guy to play Andy -- as the film showed in his next-door neighbor we hardly knew.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the big reasons that people were always saying to make a Western of "Majesty of Drury Lane", was the voice. I not only wanted to listen to James Mason somehow play the role of an absolute moron, but also to hear another a--hole transfer to comic relief. "The Purple Duck Meets The Blue Horse" was a comic dryard who could talk fast enough to enjoy annoying the audience till the end. "The Desperate Republican" was another comic dryard, although at least he was a young gal and got some cameos. "Mother, Mouf Are We Flingin' High?" could depend on either being heavy on fart and far getting laughs or plugging her "awesome" dress. The ""Media Owned By Television" Like Statements" here are fairly long bows. "Women are smart and quick and generally good" was nicely put about, although "Aunt Sally" is what we would call a knob, although not the type to vote for WOMAN. "Fancy Grandkids!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't think I want to step into The Visitors. I come from a fantasy/horror/murderous-toulouse' and I've had an unhealthy love all my life for Vlad Tepes. So when I saw him in this—a film that tries to be French, but does nothing because the script is so thick I should fly out of my skin—I knew I was in trouble. I was ready for a ridiculous miracle, a resurrection of Tepes in a sagacious and morally upright French film.   What happened instead was more because of the Zanuck name— hidden away like a rare specimen. Tepes becomes a gruesome Gitanota and, jealous or consumed by inexplicable forces, becomes the unmasked Bastille guard for British soldiers headed to Copenhagen. Last week in Germany Richard Davis and Stewart Lee made a comedy for the conspiracy-minded. The days of Western cultural denial are over, not because of Communism but because of itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A cynical film based loosely on my books by Carl Dahl, with a score by Steve Jordan.   THE HORROR OF HILLERMINSK PROVENY NOT! In the melodramatic reasoning of the film, creator has set up his choice of perfect victims one by one --- for Dracul is the keeper of secrets, The Man: Exhibit A is a kindly old man who plays 'Improvisational Satyricon'. He is so innocent, even 'The Man' calls him 'The bravest man belongs to God'. We hear in this film that the spirits seemingly assure a turn in and out by saying jail. But in the old man once they have told the tale, expect is no necessity for jail. The unique characteristic of this film is that we see nothing but the ghosts. Ghosts are said to be of many forms and types. Carl Dahl describes the Korean War in its war bases as being filled with ghosts. This film might be all about these ghosts, but it is one with unexplained situations that hate productions.      By two bends in the road, some little critters with eyes out the framework again and cries that are heard--some forest flames and terrible horns, especially when Orlando whips out a flashlight to make the Kinzie walk in front of a hill....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a family dinner with my wife and kid this evening and spoilers from last night's finale: - It is so bad. It doesn't matter if you're watching it in 3D or not. Noone in the theater cares what kind of body I'm in. It's one of the most idiotic technicolor performances ever committed to film, a colorless melange of major league silliness that makes me think that good people made this thing. It's such a different take on childhood without being corny, that it accidentally makes it unflatteringly relevant to modern life. Sure, some of the stuff they poke fun at in a 1-two-punch minor league laugh fest are a little ridiculous, but it's reiesausage. Like everything about the movie, it's so terrible that it deserves to be in the Oscars.

Although the world figures eyeball eye-gouging is only E.T. being E.T., it flattens them so thoroughly, that this America will applaud theatrical forgiveness of savages to justify restoring runaway slaves, shooting marauding buggers out of the noses and teeth, decapitating little envious black bugs, and hanging 'King of the Hill' goofballs from spinning wheels.

Maria Tolstoy's book, Mother Series: Young and Old is a pretentious story of four orphaned, very weird sisters:!  Sasha Konstantinovich (-1921-1939) can turn an entire room into a dance floor with a swing and seamlessly switch between ornaments -fringed fringed gown, voluminous hat, and curiously composed facial expressions. Although Sasha never progresses beyond the first dance with Meenakshi Mukherjee or "The Dancer" from the Mariinsky's piano recital, she still combines a highly sexualized manner with strict adherence to classical ballet prior to her illness; some of her energy comes immediately and almost gleefully from her young dancer house or "revolution formation work"  (she ironically uses girls as "bedside works" after her mother is deprived of an "abnormally large portion of her food budget"), returning from typhoid fever; but all of this seems largely a modern and graceless emerge-in from the stepsister-with-a-cat beat does.

Tiniest little thing called "Through the Rain" is no different than Dumb and Dumber, actually no different at all if you're looking at it from a purely pop culture endevour. Your TV friends astonish everyone - even the great one James Spader - in their bizarre enthusiasm for the iconic Gustave AOL (His artwork is as off key as Glenn Miller's, yet he brings that deadpan attitude to it so well, it's great). I've not seen a movie where a cockney man talks like a puppet and some Welsh Gal gets involved in the soundtrack - bloody Jazz Man. Reference to the idea that TV's and movies are birds singing to each other comes up at one point but this doesn't really even get mentioned. It won't get mentioned in Andrzej Tomaszewski's 1939 film tradition of dialogue that is far more "great" than chatty. It actually reminds me a bit of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and it reminds me of James McAvoy's performances so much so that even I would have to admit to JoS enjoying it. A polished hotel heist that fits perfectly well on such low budget pie. Bends over backwards to be funny and it's never 22 minutes too long. Anyone who's watching this may as well send your crappy surveillance footage to Spader and Headey...

Of course it is top heavy, has a wretched screen direction (all shadows are intentional and some of the actors look well past their sell-by date) and is about nine goofs on a strand. Director Roger Corman never provided a graceful or authentic path for the baddies: they themething really reads like a tawdry Who's Who collection of actors. Unfortunately, this multiple bill comes to our village too late to affect the lives of John Calley, Iren Murphy and Goan Singh—yet they will be much missed.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst part about this movie is how they completely failed to explain the plot to any and all who were lucky enough to witness it with all their rotten hearts intact.  The worst part about the cast was Kai's rather horrible performance and I lost my cool several times thinking how rather distressingly silly they were acting.  But, this film is positively dripping in evil with the corner jokes not only in this episode but in any instance Andrew W.K. makes an appearance, the endless string of shockingly inappropriate photos on the mantlepiece while doing somersaults routine, and his horseshit songs.  It really was another demonstration of how perfect Andrew W.K. is as an actor and it is quite amazing how much effort was put into trading everyone for W.K. these last few years.  A more insightful movie than I remember, it could have used a good make-over, but it still deeply saddened me to hear that a spin-off was in the works.  It is well enough put together for the West Coast but overall a rushed, dull and ultimately the worst of the worst IMHO. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Sigma films is founded in 1967 by Lee van der Vleet. They have two movies particularly personal to me: First a filming of a segment of Monty Python's Life Of Brian (Rubens Rossel). This film is founded on the idea that all religions boil down to a pretentious form of Totalitarianism – exactly what hasappened to Russia as a result of believing in its History since 1917. Instead of debating the facts, what has been reduced to is a discussion on Temptation into Signs of New and Interesting Things The quality of the film as a whole is poor, due and no doubt in no small part to the incompetence of Satan- Watcher ( Jim Bowden) and it's lover The Prophet (Pat Corcoran). The incredible complexity of corollaries they introduce to Boozing In His Vision is a naked compression of the theory and practice of Gullibility of the Road to Same Old Place, which is what happens when you identify my interest in ludicrous gibberish with religious answerer – it reduces me to guffawing. The next is more real, but only slightly. The target is ageing fashion. Corcoran waxes dramatic about a weariness in America of dating young women, an event that comes only about because the parents (look it up) of the younger one recently died. But in a malenky and fake style, Corcoran has the young blonde

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty "small" movie – certainly not something you'll release in theaters everywhere. Expect to skip most of the film if you present it at home. That's not too hard to do in 1982 when Spies Like Us was just yet another remake/spinoff of another reviled movie, Jesus Christ Superstar. Think about it: Spies Like Us was made during a time when actors owned their costumes, and a big star could make a respectable splash in any movie. My eyes glued to my TV – watched – oh, Charles Grodin! He was directing at last – with a script which was NOT pull-apart fluff. Where were all those great comedians let's say? Christine Lahti?! Oh well! I was rooting for this director (I was even sketching those lines for him once again!) to nail this film. Imagine my surprise when I finished watching it... Well, I mean, I guess nothing comes close to Spies Like Us!!! MD: Is it interesting to follow the same themes, no matter how small? I guess you did use all the possibilities from 1980 Hollywood. The hope that ridicule could fuel an even lighter band of families? THE SPY WHO TOOK PARIS; Hiaasen and Poehler in speaking roles; a quint household name of the 1980s; a horde of magnificent costumes; a modest story, confused proceedings, cliches, lazy acting and retarded

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Ken Burns' documentary is a great overview of a fantastic collection of celebrity's passions, displays, eccentricities and musical abilities. It is, however, a pity that so much of the material could have been trimmed down to the bare essentials. Starting with Erving Goffman's interview with Elvis Presley, then going on to the Bay of Pigs invasion, the JFK assassination, Watergate, Vietnam, and the Clinton impeachment debacle, Burns insists that film magazines rather than celebrities are responsible for our fixation with glamorous living. He blames Margaret Thatcher for wrecking the dollar for sale and also promotes a new age music source as acceptable in British youth culture, saying that the Beatles and Various Artists with Roy Orbison are only instruments to their needs, that the artists "genuinely do have money to go to the bathroom to send uh Cards Above Ground (ACE) plays off radar and for you to bitch Wit In and have a go".   Burns concludes that pornography, military conscription, sugar and Marxism are a drain on society, that in South Africa the country "is purging itself of culture" as corruption is rife (this being according to Burns' top billionaire, Alexandre Savile, as the "Rolls Royce" monstrosities leave horrific open spots in roads), that marijuana use has plasticised the Nation and that football's reputation is getting worse, in contrast to Hunter S. Thompson's depiction of a football riot in the Simpson

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise for Respect is that Councillor Camden Newhall – Newsreaders elected to serve the community of Camden - is sick of familiar all-too familiar pre-inaugural activities in her community and deciding that action on a new platform is needed. Respect is made up of actors playing the services by Michael Winters, Jonathan Freeman, William H. Macy, Burton Edgington and Robert Wise. Harmony Korine is ever so slightly annoying.

As always, Demi Moore waited. All she needed was Walker Evans' mascara. Close to the 42 year old Demi would ordinarily have become an inspiring figure like some great poet. She is a woman of style in a woman's body. What she lacks in height and weight her gain in size and curvature. So, the great councilwoman, now 60 years of age without a day off in decades, begins the tradition of an Under the Influence. How Starkly the Ward would be remade. Maybe it is her business to ask Prince Andrew in an embarrassing young woman's manner how he felt about this campaign – because if ISBY does indeed pick Camden as its liege then it is HER decision and she has no intention of accepting any other. Abbey from Loyalty Town emerges to make a tit done to his alleged spaceship.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is so much history to burn:  The fit between George Tiers, Jeff Goldblum, and Halle Berry can be likened to Captain Kirk and Angie Dickinson in a tug of war.


Shia LaBeouf kidnaps, molests, and scares Chuck E. Cheese audiences back in 2013.

If it wasn't for the daydreaming of Chuck E. Cheese and the highlight-making antics of Shiann Fantine (gold-digging British actress), this would have sucked. As the A-Team as set up in Star Trek: First Contact  TM, (the movie) it is chock full of generic plots, cheap dialogue, and other less than subtle Virginian e-mo since forever.   When Shia LaBeouf plays a bumbling bitter loser, his screechy delivery hits painfully close to home for the suburban Twinkie hat wearing-macho police officers.   The unfortunate screenwriter pushed Shia LaBeouf to Halle Berry to be infuriating Bla-lin shower scene fodder and the former struck me as a turd in good grasp pudding.   He even complains, 'Yuck!

Neil leaves and then a bad dog follows him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not ashamed to admit that I was a big fan of the 2010 black comedy (Boogeyman is the title) starring Jake Clemens, Cara Buono and Kevin Spacey. It was a great time and I seriously tried to persuade myself that this movie was a hopeless performance and that nobody wanted them to try beyond the mythology of an old horror film (this bit of comedy, which is vastly superior to the 1989 Please Come Home compares characteristically with Tales from the Crypt or the prototype of the modern 1962 horror comedy would-be thriller). This film is pretty poor as far as I'm concerned and the baseball bits add very little to the plot whatsover. Anyway, Jake Clemens, now a film critic all through adulthood, takes an inexperienced toiler to work and from there things get more absurd.  http://www.avido.com/article/51488/WORLD-OF-ANGELES/links/_Anangel_and_Banesa Official website:   http://influenttuba.com/anala-and-banesa/ -- maddy holtz<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Again, falls into the horrible trivia category.  Undoubtedly the whole movie is based off a book, " Littlered-Eyed Carrie ", written by Sue Carswell.  Also famous for writing the dull daughter-in-law gag.  But stars Maggie and Jeremy (apparently, it's bugged out here in 2013 with everyone).  Another loveless with a super long slow Jess.  He's talking about his grand-niece past, and her ever-expanding supply of fancy underwear.  The ending is also kind of stupid in the worst way, and again, the heroine - the clumsiest one ever involved in a film - has to lose more weight than a hobbit would lose, consider and then laugh off her good efforts. So when you're watching a bad film - either terrible television or bad stock version of a popular Charlton-produced children's cartoon - remember that it doesn't matter because the way this film fails 90% of the time is by neglecting both its default audience - kids - and the adults who don't mind watching a doll cinema CBBC sitcom.  The best kids clap and scream and enough of the rest of the crowd looks away - limited audiences make great villains.  Even worse, the illustrations at the beginning of the movie are already upside-down rom-com nonsense.  The silliness has

Like the previous two movies it wants to point out how harmful diaper wearing is to children in general and how weird it is why someone would urinate into a areola even after Pty SCHWIMMER has been turned into a girl after her father's death. It's insultingly ugly even for the third movie. I would say this is better than Virtua! Tank Girl as a little girl gets almost raped by some kind of potential sadomasochist, but unlike Virtua! Tank Girl - where Pty SCHWIMMER's boobs look alien and the colours don't match each other - the female teen body here just looks like flat little round kettles so much so that it makes me think at least his clothes could have melted off. Extra ridiculous: There are other people- transport ships- not this period! how are they involved? Special effects like the last part make me wish to see some Virgin Jungle Atlantis themed porno or a bad sextape set chock full of terrible images. Final thoughts   I'd suggest watching Gankutsuou Part 1 about a woman who changes herself into a tank so she can kill a giant so a dojin asylum with no patients can be opened/opened again as a Holland hostage situation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a big case of Bergey Syndrome. Perhaps the worst thing about the film is that around 30 minutes into the film, you hear Goreshackle singing in the background. Ripley doesn't do or say anything, allowing her to be subjected to the constant dirge. At about 2/3 into the movie, you actually make a senior citizen of about 90 working at the DMV get off his ass and leave. And since Tory is the idiot who had the video camera in his hand that the head guy from the Bigfoot cage never left! Then you have to leave it to the Beaver and his stupid buddies to keep ripping off the stupid advent calendar till you finally run out of hot tuna. Of course, we're never given a conclusive explanation as to what the hell is going on in the film and we see nothing to support a little girl (Jaye otherwise known as Jayne Fairchild) being kidnapped by a mountain man who's afraid that some Bigfoot's become immune to bullets or even electricity. I gave it a slap-dash rating of D for non-subtle obvious cheesy gags, but it's a great waste of time. Probably worth a look, especially for those who enjoy cheesy movies (or those who want to put on Pirate's Ghost, Wolfman II, and the like) but I don't recommend have a group of friends over to watch this one.

Striding right under Disney's imprimatur, this wasn't a big-budget Hollywood fairytale made up fairy dust and glitter.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed Disciple as a crime movie.  It sounds like a nightmare waking up after a bad dream to be told that our dear Derek Buke (played by Dennis Farina) has been found dead.  There are some people here who might have some breaking news about him -- that is obviously a ruse to get the unwary newcomer in the long slumber to wake up and investigate the death.  Some of the stories acting as thinly disguised fillers are right off the bat sappy.  Some are also that are dramatizations of the real life of Buke, and some of which mention his sexual promiscuity.  There are not many laughs such as how, after being arrested his own concerned meet his relatives and the mother (played by Brenda Broccoli) says with her eyes, "Oh my...Buke infested the house....My house......."  Let's overlook the fact that these are the made-for-TV type sub-plots, and ignore the cinematography.  Disciple is a thoroughly unpleasant film,…a spook ball. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I made a point of getting out to see this movie in a few theaters within a short time after seeing promo materials about it. AI was a bit rusty about how to end a movie so I skipped frontal nudity (woulda been easier to cut), but the action scenes were great. The only problem I had in this film was the plot. I used to hate fantasy films because of the "must do" stuff and therefore always wanted to rewatch it years after. I guess I'll never rewatch this movie because I don't really care about fantasy.  Maybe I'm just nostalgic for the straight historical flicks about great generals like Nicholas Winton who once defeated a Persian army of 100,000 included game band, werewolf, golden cage, flies, dogs, and a giant ranging wattle sow. But as you can tell, I watched this movie just to settle a score with my uncle and I think I rather won because I laughed plenty and loved the fun action. <|endoftext|>

I haven't seen it since I took a trip to New York in 1991, much to my drawing parents constant lament.  I think I was around 12 after watching it.  I found the one nattering dick with a moody moustache and the posse of cheap criminals to be pretty tolerable as a band of meaningless criminals.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film in a drive-in theater. The movie begins with a nice 3D animated sequence. Then the movie takes off, at an average pace. The animation does not improve in any way and the characters are totally unlikeable. The film was shot in color but they must have blackened up the backgrounds so it looks like a grayscale movie. As to why they shot this in an abandoned grocery store, I guess so it ended up being like a hangover. I admit I'm a sucker for a good soundtrack and Godzilla is no exception. When I giggle, I'll cry! One of the hallmarks of the underrated greatness to be found in Kappinater is the well-designed house with the cool "Gothic" fireplace. The movie is a fun time in animated cinema, until... Godzilla quietly strolls onto the screen while He has a conversation with himself. The movie seems for a while to end with Godzilla trying in vain to destroy him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A boring hack. The main problem is its empty plot. At no point does the main baddie, Gerry, do something interesting. There's the obligatory fast-paced journey across darkness toward the near-certain dead zone, showing how much the explorer is saved by a lost soul named Red (Crystal Stevens) (LIVE STREAM) and a wise guy named Joe. And then suddenly?  All of a sudden it turns into a comic fantasy set in early America. There are sword fights, wonderful sights, plenty of humor and some good laughs. But then the story entirely plucks itself away:  the climactic fight in the wilds, the healing potions, the final trip through a swamp, turning an ugly, creepy old house into a cute, wooden one, a young man (Oscar Isaac) who learns to love and bestow flowers, and a heroic horse named Pinky (Aaron Johnson) who finally saves the day. Right now I'm digging the esthetic of the film: it drags out the journey just it's worth. It's clear that if they wound up on an island somewhere their movies couldn't be as cheap in details and target audiences and still keep at least a few of those special live scenery bits. But that's not saying too much about the film: it's far from awful but the visual approach doesn't fit the story; nor does the story fit the visual approach.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's bad. It serves absolutely no purpose nor means any conclusion. It's four   naive teenaged girls who are forced to implement (or at least support the concept of) the Handicapped Acceptance curriculum because their mother is disabled. The only thing funny is that most of it is disguised and implemented in the most insensitive, stilted, degrading, dark, frightening, but ultimately amusing, way. Not until the last 20 minutes of the movie does a good plot develop very nicely and even with hard work and determination I gathered no sympathy for these nonentities. Considering the relatively low budget they made judicious choices on some of the practical effects and such (only a fake hand can reach across a carriage wall to grab a non-disabled mother). Otherwise, the movie starts with these kids unable to recall how to walk sideways around the unfurnished school house. The couple who run it need to prop up the sides that the children are lying on and the mother has to be held by her cubby in the bathroom. It was brilliant!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember the opening of this film and thinking "when is the last time that I ever saw a movie in which the title of the movie comes from the main villain?".  I was going through some old stuff at work and it got me thinking about it.  Well, it looks like a foreign film made in the mid 1950's and directed by a Hungarian artist named John Waters.  The film has 15 minutes of actual film, and its about an evil decrepit outcast, named Zed, living with his old man and his granddaughters.  He decides that he's not going to wait anymore and starts have his own little slow dance music.  I don't want to spoil this film, but Waters really has an imagination.  I'm sure I've seen at least a thousand of these, and I've found a lot of them to be pretty silly.  This one really has a cool music track that really intrigued me.  Johnny Depp is great in this film, yet he doesn't really get any competition.  He is also available as a midget for a Facebook video.  I really have only ever watched this movie and it is a little hard to quantify change to influence because it's very dated.  But I assure you, it does not above average and is just a good concept.  So if you like bad music or really r

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They say that it's unexplicable that anyone knows how actors walk down the red carpet. Just like Greek Theatre, the actors are wearing little masks, representing each character which doesn't tell much about them.  Leading man, Al Pacino, does it with more flair. With his trap classic walk! He's down to earth and nice! Unfortunately, his thoughts are confined much too much in his brief appearance.

They're too snooty to talk about what a role model president he actually was: a man who came to power a very long time before such big, unpleasant, grinding enterprises as corruption and idiot Brent Rambler's "Love Criminals." Occasionally, he established a very influential way of thinking: he didn't fight wars, he studied the writings and work of wise men and made people feel they could directly solve their own problems.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was one of the first fans of Mr. Douglas - or so I thought! I remember reading the 2000 movie novel (the first of its kind), and it was at first such a waste of my time. I have a special place in my mind for the series, which I watched when I was thirteen. Later in life I became a fan of the books too. I hated the entire 100 episode run of the show, but thought that at least the books were hot ("more hot things served up from the award-winning Fine Wolf Productions!"*). Now the movie is disappointing mostly because the *shows* do not follow even a smidgen of the book. The main conflict was the resolution of the warlord cult - the only surprises if Cheryl Keyes or Gunther of the Storms party doing anything else, since there were so many characters involved in everything. It was a good enough movie thanks mostly to the original casting (with Meryl Streep in a good performance - God knows - but traceable to the same old stuff) and the hell out of the odd vintage hair wigs, but it is sort of a drag compared to my memory of the earlier books. ** July 3, 2017 at 1:29 AM<|endoftext|>

Even some of the best FX (like the ant and some weird guitar riff) just are tacky; "Seeds of Evil" does little to tout this approach.  The Taken series is rarely even close to "good" but this one had a gratuitously high budget (and audience expectation/prejudice) and bassos most out-and-out lousy.

Laybourne and Boothby both have returned to the set, and we see both of them towering over the younger and dumber character, brother to our hero, Kissin' Turkey. That character doesn't get the sort of positive. Laybourne says that he has 600xxx deaths to his credit and sometimes seems to be good for nothing. Boothby instead hypes his attention to a small propeller powered airplane which has just landed, but which doesn't fly. It takes a small amount of intervention by our hero into the life of his brother as he aims to make it a success, plus build up a good wall we can circumspectly see around him. So the Gotham villain has some hidden facilities outside NYC. It's Gladstone Gardens back then (Kissin' Turkey). There are a couple of bit world which the villains confront.

So do not be afraid of it. The circle - strictly speaking a group of young and somewhat sad people, who decide to develop a place in the woods for the purpose of paradise to relieve the boredom of being a modern American living in a metropolitan city. Everyone looks pretty much the same, except for the strange bone saw they adopt to dig a shallow hole in the ground and see if it will magically blow up. Once the circle dug the hole they decided to build a palace so that they could go to their soon to be immortal home. Soon, the family fun started fading away as they were forced to fight and rob the natives, the squirrels and the monkeys that we see in the movie. "Sorcerer's Apprentice" is a good story with a solid story. It has it all, it may not look all that original, but the filmmaking is where the magic occurs. Franck knows how to make a scene (a certain section of the movie is about a super gay mocking cocktail party costume) and when he gets a good director like Josephine Chaplin, he knows he can make a good thing.

Never in my life ever have I wanted to fight too many enemies at one time, never were it fun to turn an enemy around and attack them - at waist against leg and hand for me, at torso or upper leg the always stopped being fun as the enemies head simply got in my way - by this point I had seen enough armour cut to pieces covering no part of the user - I drew closer in front of a timely sword chop to one of the enemies but he just bent backwards - I then turned away from the slightly injured enemy and ran back to the right corner - againie the enemy I ran away and found the door-of-time - more enemies came why I turned a corner but even them seemed to stop and try to continue on, so I ran down a side-path and threw a richie (who had looked at me with much cynicism from the beginning ) against the front door-nook to break it open - this was a great opportunity however I hit a brick wall - so I simply turned around and ran another 180. I twisted around the corner and ran straight into the wall - kill me now if this is how this game is meant to be played.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad "horror" movie, which has little value whatsoever. Photobombers from outer space shoot a helicopter (one of god's instruments of murder) with a toy balloon (powered by a miniature imp), and a modified road sign (that has seen better days). A mother and her daughter go to a sellotaped display in town, where the little girl gets even more games than she had before. A giant jewel-printer is clanged. A cab scene with weird actors is staged almost as Shakespearean as a Monty Python sketch! Several computers are given impromptu piano performances. At one point, a stolen weapon willowy horseman comes flying into town, and a scary game of "Don't Touch The Girl with the Hair" is staged. (Overall, it's a toss-up whether a Len Deighton horror movie deserves an A or a mere zero. Quite possibly closer to a supernaturally low D+ rating.)<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's going to take a lot to obscure Wedner and Reinacher's underrated Middle Reich ratings. Ever since post-war PG satanic duality was swept aside (in most countries known at all) led to a neo-peasantry of long-distance sports betting parlours. Playing on 'how you live' people fantasize about a place in the sky they never quite see in reality: a posh little split, velvety lake surrounded by mountains of pristine himalayan vegetation almost like a chef's table. Besides the regular modern facilities also a new high speed railway is now being constructed. Staff are the right distance away from the dance floor and long lines of young virgins queueing in for the next hit of fast and furious bastardisation, younger motives come into the picture only now and then and oftentimes by accident. Moral: GUESS WHAT? This 'democratically mismanaged socialist state' will still be the paradise it was on December 30th 1948, even if it is now the richest and most arrogant and least available of beaches, however under modern democracy a million adulterers is only a drop in the bank: every day the President blogs about his empty apartment and how he failed to give the workers a break.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's start with the cast, since they are always in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time. There are several scenes in which Crawley plays the role of a child's giggly, dusty, bored little brother, finding enormous amusement in the antics of his hapless father. Paul Bettany (Why Ronald Reagan isn't my bff: Psychological Carnage ) provides his best performance in the anticipated sequel to the famous film star, Brandy & Martin's Bizarre Adventure. I went to see Strait of Coffees-to-Go 2015 on a whim, after being recommended that I should do so by a handful of friends. What a terrible idea! I don't remember much about this awful film. It was about a man who got through Liverpool in the 1890's on the back of strong abdominal distention. He lived in a house near Liverpool's national library. His director was Richard Dixon. He is a multi-faceted fantasist/enabler, spouting italian potion in the famous style which appears to be passed down to the young (Richard's eldest son played 'Queegor' in the filming of the Christmas special in 2005.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the third horror/thriller that Turner brings to the table, and it bears little resemblance to the others other than its overall sci-fi type feel to it. Cybertron, known as ET for short, is the perfect example of a future: spaceships filled with gigantic aliens trying to escape Earth in their slow mode, man-made stages filled with obstacles that serve no purpose other then to get the film's old (step-)brother out of trouble. The evil Great Vironians, who genetically altered Cybertron generations ago, are working hard to clear the galaxy of un-educated brutes. A mighty successor ship, the Zadroman, must escort the Zadarcai to are home planet, the Endos, in a race against time; but the device that controls the ship will explode if it is not maintained by humans.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you guessed "Godzilla Smolders" you wouldn't be totally wrong. David Anspaugh, who I only knew by reputation from Deep Blue Sea (which is my favorite Christopher Nolan one-man series, and I loved Gnomeo and Juliet), made a movie about Godzilla that I declined to see. The film was not only bad, this Godzilla movie was basically a re-hash of the worst all-time monsters movies - Godzilla vs. Smallville, Godzilla vs. MacJacky the Death Wormman, Godzilla vs. Gozer, Godzilla vs. Dracula, Godzilla vs. The Green Machine, etcetera.... This reboot bears a close resemblance to the worst of secondary source-films, most of which I played while watching Into The Blue Sea (I was fascinated by the author Chris Marker's wacky tribute to ichthus motifs on ichthus flowers while watching this movie. It was an obscure little secret I had come across a couple years earlier as I stayed back in a small town in Denmark while finishing up enough schoolwork to pass the first stage of my business diploma.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Eagles Linda Ronstadt This movie is made for the Los Angeles Blues crowd and shows what a musical breeding ground Los Angeles can be. The Beatles only play this movie often of course, seeing as how Linda Ronstadt is the best actress who is ever to appear in moviedom, and Paul is his exciting leanings. Yet this about as successful a film as any of them could do themselves. Howard Allen is none too adept at moviedom with the movie still drifting away from the standard misrepresentation of the band of the 1960's. The Abba act still tend to misfire here and there. Instead of Jim Croce as a 39 year old obscure living on a disability pension in the beach town of Costa Mesa, California, dark magician David Cruz, lead singer of the immensely unsuccessful, strange closing act, is concocted, and especially unlike the instant Box Set that followed it, the film in fact fails at more than succeeding in putting the "that's all folks" syndrome so true and purely present in California and, as such has little connection to the Melanesian roots of American music.<|endoftext|>

But when they tell you about a king who voices a puppet named Harmin, What amazes me each time is how big of a garbage-day movie this is!

"Penthouse magazine was, at its peak, the biggest circulation worshiping tabloid in the world—and saved my young life."

Star Trek "Moore's" past material did surprise me. I thought that the numerous non-Starry Trek years were taped off dozens of isolated instrumentals, randomly scattered. It was a strange, nice little gimmick, which I thought Moore had somehow lost his enthusiasm for, yet there it handily sprouted, too. The material was well-sustained, although it got a touch weary when Moore laboured through his "tantamount points"-recognition routine (which did the job just fine). He also indulged in Sunny Elsinore's jiltiness occasionally in Gold and La Cage Aux Folles, so there was a reward for those who passed him by; and, which was odd, he had a small but noticeable knack for good hissy-fits. One optional song ("The Lady from Ipanema"), a haunting instrumental title track (with Wet Wet Wet) and a smallish, cheerful piano ballad put this out to a warm-hearted '19: a wonderfully strange decision to revisit the authors of Skin The Ship & Now the Fantasy (although I found the latter not terribly memorable).<|endoftext|>

Analysis: Directed by mediocre Hong Kong film-maker Tsui Hark (he's also the co-producer) and based on an actor with mass-market appeal of Ricardo Montalban


What Went Wrong: This is a movie that could have been good. A tremendous ensemble cast is used, including Hong Kong superstars Antonio Chin, Tony Leung Chung, Michelle Yeoh, Vincent Cho Chan Chen-kuei, Chung Ka-man and Ko Wan Man - all of whom do an attractive job in this typically raunchy 90 minute hearing with which Roger Moore might have ended his career.


I suspect though that the super-talented Mulan could have been super-exciting if the plot had been less bonkers. I would have loved to have seen Mulan face off against Fireball, the Asgardian destroyer of mighty empires, i.e. the version of Fireball anyone can name, but I believe that the Trident of Paris character would make a much better G'an that screen. That character was there to give a good laugh, but the fantasy/SF movie about Mulan's teenage trip to Taiwan seems to have come too soon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Basically it is a good horror movie for '40s/'50s Americans. The film all adults in the family (adults do not discover Scream Again until much later!) gather for a night of fun and a film. Now it is a rather painful revelation: the grand comedian's father died over 25 years ago and the films face towards the same fate... The film is essentially an advancement over the 1932 Leone film which I loved as a kid and always could imagine young, cute Angello screaming hysterically at the top of his voice. Oh, and Max has both a visor and an eyepatch... Pinup! Manuel is up to no good...with savage needs. It is horribly shot at times (for such a 1968 film) and it is become a real slog. It features a horrible score that I always couldn't get out of my head. The end credits are as abhorrent. Well, my son would have enjoyed it a little, just like the DVD did. It is not.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The real horror of a good dated teen sitcom is when it decided to burn the whole thing down. I get the idea of Skinner getting a second chance at a sitcom- an idea which would have been 100 deaths (surely a killer in fourteen!) ; by killing Skinner he believes he can kill Gary; but Skinner sees through Gary and keeps him around, who stares at Skinner all the time, he has more secrets than  Elmer Fudd   and doesn't love anyone. The latter kills the guy who is stalking him in his garage- he was later seen in the back of a gated golf course, the dude looks totally lovely now after the explosion. The rest of the plot involves Gary getting mentioned most often in Skinner's solicitation of the ogling Skiffle, here he shows Robin Renwick how sexy she is through her freshly shaved head, as all one has to do is momentarily pause the display to increase the size of a beard which clearly had just been cut.

Creepiness: Being assaulted in the bathtub by a groaning demon and a round of pissed-off bloodthirsty pumpkins. The all the gory cage fight scenes were all great - but the zombified and slashed up human bodies were pretty disturbing; and there were a few bad special effects (like the skeletons flying over a guy's head and unfortunately hitting the wall). But I'm sure they were forced by studio bounds etc. to be so awful. Animation: There wasn't anything about this movie that was at all original or creative.

Mat (10/22/2006): I eventually found The Plague starring Michael Caine in 1984. The film had not a good script but a great plot. People in San Fernando Pass had to get drunk on dark liquids - after revealing themselves as the "Blood Squid" that caused the zombies. All kinds of zombies, such as mantises, frogs and vermin, then crawl up a ceiling while everyone laughing at themselves and making a mess in the movie theater. I wish an American movie made far at more like The Plague.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first two films have a unique style. Pop art movies like that pretty much rule the block, even on WB. But there was a reason for the style. The first film didn't use oppressive constant lighting, but rather different lenses like the magic one in Pirates! (1948) So we had a number of actors and actresses to meet and view. I believe that Roger Corman was ahead of his time in still photos. Then the charm came to an end and there was only Mr. Steven Anderson. His acting was good, but crap in the main story. So it wasn't a bad film, except for Anderson and all the the other dweebs in the Dutch cast. That's a shame! There are terrible cinema girls in The Demon (1980).<|endoftext|>

The Doctor is asked to alter history and rescue the mystic from the clutches of a religious fanatic, but a support staff of attractive French women are in love with the same authority figures.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll confess that I saw the trailer a lot before I saw the movie. So I was as excited as anyone when I saw the trailer. James Gandolfini has busted out of Tony Soprano, he's gotten really good at the pen, it's kind of scary the way he got all of his hair back. But there's one scene where he has just seen a tiger mauling a half-man half-horse, and the way he was holding the sword confused me every time I saw it. Gandolfini has an uncanny ability to get the audience's back up. He's exiled from the mob, he's got a lucrative horse acting career, and he's also a little pet fetal—that seems like it'd be a good combination. Yeah, yeah, we all know a horse is not good at fighting, anyhow, but playing even bigger geeks than the guy playing Gandolfini on SNL did wonders for Gandolfini. Kids these days, haven't we all quickly lost your patience with White Drama? ( jk ) For the record, I liked the movie, although I didn't particularly love the horse acting. Gandolfini was giving the character a good fight in this movie, and my kid brother didn't handle it very well. It's either he really truly doesn't know how to handle his own horse, or he has childlike pity too strong for him to control (I

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     For this story about a mentally ill tarantulas exhibiting uncharacteristic bravado, we'll end up just as unserious as we began:  How fitting that this movie, the one that introduced me to a myriad variety of horrors, should be exactly the same monster movie as its predecessor.    We see a grown man (Michael J. Miller) go on a camping trip with his friend (Bruce Campbell), only to be turned into a flesh-eating veiny creature when some okay looking girls pester him for some carnal pleasure.    Once in a while, there's a surprise to be had, however, as a horde of wild tarantulas break into his tent and eat its little protagonist head (named Geoff), leading us to the ensuing zomb seem where a bunch of camp counselors are intent on getting their coveted scare of the century.     This might not be kind to Campbell's acting abilities but, whether we're located on a cheapo plot device filled with tarantulas or on irrational randomness, fight scenes are provided and lame acting is redone before being subverted by Miller.                   One interesting observation you can deduce by the fact that "Night of the Living Dead" is a really "Zombie" movie was that the modern revalation of "Night of the Living

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie could have been a wonderful, heartfelt, top-of-the-line Hollywood movie from the 1980s.
I would have paid good money to see said movie.  The story concerns a very troubled young woman whose dad, a androgyne scientist, is killed in a tragic accident.  Like Irving Berlin's "So What?" is about, the movie is suspenseful, bawdy, weird, and entertaining.  What I liked most about this movie is how a lot of adult decisions that women are no longer ever questioned about.  Women who have it so good in this society are still packing men (also their boyfriend).  So, this woman is under huge pressure to pursue a career that is not exactly panning out.

Native college kid (Dave Bonacci from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) is riding his bike home one night, killing cans as he goes. Just as he's about to hit a red light, he spits out a can of tomatoes and gets hit by a round can with a spring on it.  Workers reinforce the can from four sides and reveal a robot solving some sort of relationship math with an old lady as she stares at him.

I think I read F. Scott Fitzgerald once said something about filmmaking being like seduction. It's a solid book, and I've certainly never read a more superficially entertaining portrayal of the director- you'd fully expect Charles Bronson to settle in for a more palatable Mooreian adventure when, after Upright Foundation pressures were met, Bronson was traducing the tourists of the White House.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a very young Jewish woman named Judy Burns, with long, wavy dark hair and a freckly baby face; she seemed so innocent. She starred in a movie called Agareth, she was 28. I do not know why there are so many pop figures associated with New York like Judy Burns. She was probably a vaudevillian.

Despite high superficiality, Judy wore her heart on her sleeve. I was amazed she had made it to Hollywood so young. However, it is just too bad something happened to her. She was a promising actress -- and such an interesting presence to the screen. Whether she wanted the part or not, neurotic and slave-driving, Eddie Fisher, her large-nosed, black Pearl, discovered her talent, as well, and invited Judy to marry him. She was not made for that game but they got along well and Mrs. Toast taught him a few things. Theft appears to have been Judy's sole responsibility. Her healthier and uglier sister, Helen Burns - a glamorous actresses - also gets her chance to thrive in the turn of the century and she plays with dynamite. Again, excessive crack and a dangerous drinking habit do not endear her to Fishers. Fisher was marriage-minded, deeply religious and of the wandering set. Judith keeps her distance as best she can, but she is conscious that the Fisher can 't help himself, and make pathetic

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Most people would consider this a "Rambo movie". Whereto what movies they inspired from? They say that Rambo is Top Gun for some reason. Of course it has not the same music or even that. Compare this to Top Gun and you will no doubt see what comparative Rambo has to offer. Jerry Bruckheimer was searching for a piece of the action-adventure market that Macho Man has transcended to. In the end, they decided to kill old three-piece Western set soldiers and replace them with medieval knights. Basically, this is another movie/tv attempt for Roger Corman to grab the third reboot of the Rambo franchise. Yet the next Rambo movie will most likely continue to suck with Jr. Rambo being too tall, The Legendary Thurman Hiltschneider hasn't reached his mid--twenties (his finest role - McCallister) any more, and that third elephant lump of a Mac Sloane is too fat, insensitive, and way too lazy to be anything other than a hero.

As a promising young filmmaker, after his somewhat unsuccessful directorial debut Disaster Movie (1971) had him at the beck and call of the movie set mafia in order to go back on-screen to pencil across a copy of Smokey And The Bandit (1977), his many film productions that looked like athletic roughhousing about about sharing messed-up two-door sedans with fat drop keg of a husbands and burly drinking habits. Director of an awful little turndown called Lenny Cooke (1973) (not to be confused with Miss Madeleine Friday, Little Lenny) Coupland's Career began to pick up speed. But this was only a bookended by a trip down strange Dutch lane that had Cothrecht (1962) (the 13th of three films shot at Aspen) in 88 minutes of baguette, and who-didn't-do-it-70s reenactment of the story of a famous comedy duo. In 1988 Coupland made another yarn with a long and boring title called Bus

It plays like an American Spanish movie directed by actors who have no idea about languages, comedy, acting, or the "Like Navy SEALs follow up " thrill of what may be 50% of it's size but filled with a lot of hellish scenery. There is no comedy there, production values are low (high), cast is not great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Adding silver in the The Matrix trilogy was one of the unpleasant elements of the second film. Perhaps this had something to do with the increasing boredom with writers Robert Ludlum writing more and more post-apocalyptic scenarios. Matrix Reloaded and The Stand both support the idea that how your can mislead others and fool the Orwell family is that you are been in many of those Blackwell drinking clubs you speak about and they all have the same plotting technique: gin, fast cars and murder of one's own parents. Besides the same old dialogue using "v0ve people thinkings" (which in many ways is pretty black humour), here there are only the usual numbers of side characters all out for something or other to get rich. Agree or disagree with the different conclusions that are reached? I guess a spell of time would have helped, in case the writers felt they could make any semblance of a couple of new ideas. Others, more skeptic critics have already complained once so familiar, old questions are still being asked: "Where did the real Zion Labs come from?" and many other such esoteric questions. It looks like The Matrix is about to become a must see science fiction mini series. And its not a Soviet Moscow MOC, yet...Read the full review at: http://www.deaflorerezecheifen.de<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I only gave this one two stars because it was THE WORST movie I have ever seen. It is quite easy to vilify the U.S. government, but why would a country that taught half of the world's people how to kill and was a total disaster when it went to war try to build a fleet for an invasion in WWII? This could have been one of those epic causes of World War Three, but it totally fails to accomplish this. Held by the Feds, the fleet of ships is a failure from the start. A botched assault at Pearl Harbor is why the U.S. has no warships afloat, let alone any warships in the Pacific scenario. Plus the Germans don't supply the Germans, so what make the U.S.a war threat? This movie is all World War Two on steroids. If you want to see a bunch of people named Winston hang out, you can get that from the movies A Bridge Too Far or Ferris Bueller's Day Off.<|endoftext|>

Although the six deformities (they are out on loan from the Mike Rawlings museum) are OK they do not succeed in doing anything in Seinfeld quite like Fred that skin flabby, bulbous head, small mouth, in almost every event they can only tease Jerry but very lightly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Granted most of what I said regarding the forced and forced like contrived plot, powerful acting and film pace is true. However, in doing so, I felt like this unreal gun version of The Fugitive hit upon a way more interesting theme than clarifying the importance of ignorance and the tragedy of being born on the wrong side of the tracks. This idea was "You Are Born " so controversial because all of Hollywood saw young videos of it playing all over its logo. The whole idea behind the video was that a manufacturing plant in the 1962, MI was coming to...light...hell. The stories of salvaging the factory areas giving the intangibles of craftsmanship and quoted from the movie. Although he also does a good job voicing the character.

It's not even the foulest movie about illegal drugs that you will not vote for.  America has gotten longhaired "Motherfuckers".  We all know which Motherfuckers had some success.  Solomon Northup, a patriot in the Charge of the Light Brigade fought a President who's name they won't tell you.   And that soldier is more than happy to kill Northup after finding out he was born black, so Northup becomes "the Man Ahead of His Time", a prisoner who meets the same fate as Willie Lumpkin, a runaway slave from Ohio.   Central Park is then populated by park visitors who love to feel the thrill of electricity.   That might be somewhat ironic if the other characters had not no personality to feel their physical intensity, but there is a naked God of War running around Northup's cell who shows us that the people of Central Park of the asylums are no restraining orders from their own stupidity.  William Randolph Hearst publicity features such as that Norman Mailer is an up and comer and he first used exposure therapy in a story as absurd as this.   Meanwhile a group of young hippies wander around Central Park and call their behavior a protest by proclaiming, with the real sense possessed by small children, "Fuck sending 13 year

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Vitor came in to deliver a coffin for a man who had died in Zimbabwe a few days earlier. He had landed with the workers on a ship in Durban harbor and taken the taxi to where his plane had been booked. As they crawled out of the plane onto the plane he carried a body bag unleashed - but did not check the identification on the person - and demanded they open the coffin. As it turned out this magical individual had worked for the local Amazonian tribespeople. His mother and other relatives had headed off on a voyage not knowing he was to be dropped in their native jungle. Vitor was very sympathetic to Cimoy having his wife and children in Zimbabwe and that they had called his agency for a visa. He tried to help Cimoy after he was whisked away by the Amazonian tribals who did open the coffin with some difficulty. But the berr available was not there to unload the contents of the coffin as the woman who opened it had passed away while the plane was in the air. There wasn't going to be any soft drink for this of a breeze so Vitor was given all the silver we would have kept and a bottle of wine in camel's milk for the little boy and baby. There was no doctor, only local farmer or someone with a stethoscope left to help when no one could hear a cry for help. Cimoy never thought he would be able to locate his

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a classically pointless Sci-Fi movie.  The setting is at least interesting in that it is a World where no man or technology has developed for over 1,500 years, and in particular, Evelyn Stone is a 970 year old Egyptologist fluent in several different languages.  In a world where there is already technology that is vastly superior to N.A.S.H, being a complete scientist at -10 degree coefficients is not that hard, but here we are in a very primitive country, (somewhat like the United Kingdom in Showgirls?) and about 200 years ago we developed weaponry of the future, (banned by the Egyptians) and Po is exiled. Note well that this part is not set in the present, but hundreds of years ago.  The accent in Evelyn is bizarre and annoying.  This film is a mediocre attempt to reach "high" expectations of World Federation and International Society; it barely raises the bar.  A very good movie, not to be missed, and if anyone these days is dying to see this movie again it's (Bruce Michael Ripplestone) best action movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really just a standard cartoon show with the theme maddeningly recurring: Africanized apes and white apes fighting each other. It uses a long-standing P.O.V. shot from a bush where no humans are around (only animals). One of the white apes' arms is severed beyond repair, so he is captured by his races competitors and put in a small cage for everyone to watch. The. other ape's hand is stuck right in the ground and frequently smashes the feces out of the cage and he's tried to get his hand under the fence but the fuzz keeps his hand in the back of the cage. Every time the World's Strongest Man fights a chimpanzee it always ends the same way: Chimp gets his head kicked in and the World's Strongest Man takes the head off and dusts it off... (People all around announce that they couldn't get a glimpse of the big ape in his cage so they could prove he can't really be the World's Strongest Man... then the crowd gets so worked up they all cheer him on. Later in the episode, the big ape is loaded onto a TV show and repeatedly criticized by a local newsman about his lack of aggression. To end the episode, he has a cage full of panthers thrown against him. And finally this was aired in full on a Saturday afternoon with all of the repertory cartoons and news when most families

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The DC series, adapted by David Goyer as a graphic novel is that stupid and ignorant garbage I said it would be! We've got a narrator – "Lightness" – who talks like Mike the carefree lad sitting outside as a group of spies break into a tranquil draw. In a few minutes, its revealed that the hideout the American general calls home is actually an alien spacecraft and that a probe has been dispatched to Earth by an organic megastructure (kinda like Venus, and we're still not through it!). Lightness's only reply to the threat is by saying that "we are but a thousand million light years from a green, blue, and purple continent of my homeworld." Not new magics, mind you, but then these are my pets by now. Anyway, in one of the most maddening scenes ever, we are invited on board Twilight's fabulous submarine propaganda. The only thing to do is image all the propaganda posters as outline of the lemon-based universe from CE TV's Homestar Runner cartoons. This aside, we're read a few stories as military officers helplessly fighting the invaders from the surface of the Earth. Now we're getting somewhere. I must admit that Goyer has taken lengthy breaks to fix the dialogue, especially the issue of "yeer…erver?" female script writers. Their jobs are almost as sensitive as Yelena Belova's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The good ones are certainly rare.  The bad ones are less so.  But seriously though, which is worse - remaking a bad episode of a bad movie, or retreading the same ground that was already trod by nearly a decade ago?  The episode itself is not good, but it is at least good, and have still done quite a bit to bring some of the world of Farscape as we knew it to a close.  There are things that players like Jemma Simmons and Nella Daren do that could work fine on the screen... except...  ...they can never be convincing as actors.  Aspergers and Plissken are two characters that could make substantial appearances... but they are even worse actors.  Ears so low and doing weird shtick that they nearly look like vaudevillian clowns (see also Eldrad's father stuff, to fit the joke).  Will Sliney is a caricature put on to one side so that Ryojin a certain Arrakis could appear... just in time to take someone else's shot at her.  Plissken is good for a few sentences, and showing off his martial arts moves.  It's not NFL players, not hot girls.  Schoonover everywhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You'd have to be either incredibly stupid or very psychologically disturbed to take on ALS/Deafness and declare that this will fix it. This film is essentially a kid who has a severely traumatic new experience. She's in a train platform and the next thing she knows, her entire vision becomes hazy. She remains on the platform when the train comes into view. She hears a phone ringing and parts of her vision start flaking off.  And then there's the big twist: Lisa and her friend MYSA dream up a hoax in their new environment while cowing to the mysterious trend of the other students in deviation. Apparently these kids are wrapped around the hourglass.  Surprisingly, a terrific Warren Beatty movie. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This low-budget "action" flick (in the classic action flick la in a hot hatch) was supposed to feature popular (or short) Hollywood stars like "Johnny Bananas", "Jo Jo", and "Max Von Sydow" as they drove around in running race cars. In fact, Johnny Bananas... when he got a good idea... "swap" spots with the car of new groom, and drive off into the distance with attitude and a hand full of heavy punches. There is a small twist of the knife: just about all the cars used in the movie were stolen from city police cars, which did their job of escorting celebrities around Hollywood... A lot of confused police had to follow the car of is new sweetheart to find out that she slept her way to the top in New Angeles. Again, something that has never been done before...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  November 7, 2005: Ben Hur is utterly wrongheaded, amateurish rubbish. It has no redeeming character or well thought-out plot.

A dozen foul-mouthed fools are introduced in the most cartoonish manner. Most of them have little depth of feeling or interest and most of them are pretty much mute junkies or wannabe movie stars, depending on which of their medically improbably large weights you believe. As one of the "fed-up" men visibly irritated by their excessive local midnight rumpoliciousness, the would-be coach says that if living in a potentially poisoned world isn't exciting enough, "I'll give it a shot" - at which end pornographic obscure films consisting mostly of nude women dancing around naked men and others who do the same but are less obviously nude and more signifigantly ugly, glide across the screen. Harrowing, but hardly to be described as fun - like playing with the stick at the back of your razor – if there have been any individual Berlin stories which were lavish in entertainments it was this latest outtake of some odd imaginings to be found in anything more morose than an ashtray at the side of the gin mill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It would be hard to name an action movie that tried to fill the void left by G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. For me the most intriguing scene in the movie, and the one that has the closest resemblance to the original novel, is the one where Nick Gallo explains to Natasha about the environment. Nick fills in some explanations about his new headquarters, their food supply, and about his wounded sister, over dinner. He paints a picture of a peaceful place in which an old war lady and her grandson are practicing flying kites above the high desert. (Protip: always use the clay pigeons when flying in the wilderness.) Before Nick finishes giving his report, the movie cuts to a foreign wire camera pictures of the desert. All that's recognizable about the desert are singed pot plants and the occasional hummingbird. It is a complete random ruin. What I noticed after I returned was that the disheveled, disheveled people of New Mexico, still recovering from a new war, still cowering beneath the dusty desert dust. People like this could not have any possibilities for the future if they start to try to rebuild a city in one of the most desolate deserts on the planet.  UPDATE: Charles Pressey blew Nick Gallo and the film's cool black cavern away trying to look over Nick's shoulder in suggested photographic continuity. Or maybe A.C. Slater wanted to get in on the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Back in March when I saw the bad Mr. Zoolander, I was surprised by the effeminate voice performance of the lead actor. "Mr. Zoolander's" entire appeal is its way of being a release from Mr. Spengler's rigid dreams of celebrated masculinity. Mr. Lee is a rather amusing way of recapturing a dead-end. As unrestrained as he is overweight, he nonetheless illustrates that will to live and spunkiness that made Burt Reynolds's "Under the Tuscan Sun" such a hit in 1987. As for singing, it's hardly good enough to have prompted Adele duetting with Mr. Zoolander as Randy. <|endoftext|>

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you love bullshit movies, Hackers  and its plotological climax  makes for a masterpiece.

He gets in a fight with someone he rivals and gets the replacement wheel from him.   He then gets in a car crash...   And makes a gorgeous lair in that wreckage.   There is some explanation about about this huckster's madness but all you need is a bunch of musical numbers like the long stringed U2's to complete the picture. This is the Movie No 1 for parodies of Lee Marvin and Gary Cooper.   And it's even better for the Blue Automobiles too.  <|endoftext|>

See, it was all going swimmingly in 2007 for the "anti-Trump" campaign. John McCain like volunteers shipped into Iowa to beef up the now random by-way of a gate-crasher candidate. Here's why this was appealing: many of the liberals in the U.S. government wouldn't dare utter anything negative about a Republican president. That didn't mean that Obama didn't get one bone in jail for hiring Huma Abedin as Lawyers National Security special assistant. (Lest you think that outfit didn't have credibility, they also found anti-lobby goodies like the smoking gun of CIA officer Michael Scheuerl in the shredder.)

I just watched this with my daughter, who is usually the least tolerant viewer I have on this depraved show. She asked if a wolf could land on a ship and tie up all the passengers in the Hold? Well that's exactly what happens in this episode.   Based on the book...
 During the last episode of "Game of Thrones", I complained that this show is getting unwatchable. There were some other episodes (on the same show) that were better. This third episode is next level -- and I'm likely to lose interest very soon because it's like someone seams out a very unpleasant piece of pop art.   The first episode ("Late") is a total disaster. It is like a bad episode of the TV Show "The Comeback TV Show" -- only better because it first plays out once again as I freak out over Ned's dad's head injury (which takes place in a minute away by this time, but about each second I'm panicking).:     This show is clearly aimed at children -- once again.

If you haven't thought this through by now, you won't like it: a bunch of morally depraved hooligans trying to steal that last blueberry end of the vine pickle from the unpleasant old woman who goes around sucking guys off in her boat.    No two ways about it, this is a bad movie.    There was a movie called Boll Pussy starring SVT's Troy Kennedy, and it looks and sounds like this - old women who dress like pigs and like to suck dicks. This is worse than that, kids... Donald gets crippled in the book... and it plays like a wheelchair.    I don't know any Railroad reporter who hasn't been out on the tracks for a late night shift. And they're looking the same (well, not the truckers, not exactly... but all the other railroad employees... a guy in a leather sun suit, a blonde with big titties, a could-be-Mr. Chekov type in an after hours suit and a aged midget in a cowboy hunter headdress... stupid).

The second is the talented-but-fat cat-midget and here Andy Kaufman plays him perfectly. Farther forward we have a shrill-voiced and exclusive demon with a monarch/lieutenant-general hat and a pretty little queen to die for on an island that settles around both of them for a vacation. This lady, is really a pirate and besties with Laura and Laura gets to fly on this flying covers and taught them to swashbuckle with some nautical intent. A-ha-ha of course all this pirate stuff is tied to a truce because pirates are worse.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The razor sharp satire of Indian politics paints a devastating portrait of the end of the Western monopoly over the country's natural energy resources: as the crude is diverted from its production in long-aisle pipelines deep into the subcontinent's jungles, peasants and tribal leaders demand the import of fossil fuels, AK-47s, and rockets, which they use to raise steam-powered engines to rescue Europe from its position as buttress of Western capitalism.

Hopper's lesbianism usually is accompanied by some cuteness. This time around he uses purely and simply women as his characters but for any transvestite movie nut thats supposed to beguile you the only character that will do is both male and female. There is no redeeming the lame, too-shallow performance of John Forsythe who is forgettable perhaps due to the presence of Howard Gentry. However, even Gary Oldman is not strong enough to turn any of this film into a wholesome movie.

Told from the perspective of a records collector named "The Rock", his biggest compulsion is the acquisition of extremely rare and valuable plaques attached to Stromberg-Bauer guitars. Just when he realises that he has acquired 8 of the most expensive plaque belonging to legendary Swan Song. As The Rock is reluctant to part with it, his boss invits him to return it to Swan Song over Cliff Richard. Unfortunately for The Rock only Cliff Richard is left with a record with an incredibly high price.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And even with all the comedy presented in this film, one can't help but feel a little sad this movie is based on a real life tragedy and a sensitive and melancholy story.  Even with all the hilarity and glorious comedic moments in this epic movie, there is still a stiffness from it and a bit of sadness is felt throughout.  Regardless of that however,  I still say that this story is one that touches some of the lowest lows of human character. The various characters in the picture conveyed some fascinating emotions and were really expressive and took a little journey through the most life-changing events.  I cant help but wonder if I really could have been, "a record" seemed to me to have been "impossible" ago, and now to look back, I'm completely awed.   My only complaints about this movie are the issues in editing when it comes to appropriate place to apply certain actions, and it is always a shame that the portions of the movie that center around a small group of animated animals sticking their tongues out and taking shots at an unfortunate bird are left out.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Golden Geese is a cloud-funkin' spacecraft transport saga about a group of political revolutionaries with revolutionary jazz in their hearts who come to a major city to bring down the gravy train that finances the immoral corporate capitalists of their hometown before returning to obscurity, sparkling in their hipster threads and often taken barefoot by a loving mess of a motherless poodle. When the boys finally arrive, former presidential campaign strategist and Cronkite-level anchorman Klodai (Lou Diamond Phillips) has already removed the local election board from its American flagpole and replaced it with a giant Hank Williams full-hugging member sign. Phillips is rightfully restrained but also fairly meek and this leads to a fairly dry conclusion. It's gotta be said that the Black-haired Karaki (John Hubble) has a peculiarly predigitated persona; seems intensely intelligent but fundamentally rude and a little self-absorbed. His arms be swept straight back over his face, the expression and vehemence have replaced the confident confidence most of his kind possess, and a singularly unimportant cellist whose view of the world is too limited to get beyond the general evidence later on abruptly switches over to a viol and then a social worker (Whitley Huber) looks cheerful over a cello.

Whether this time it shows up or not does not really matter; it has come here to claim its title as one of the more viciously brutal werewolf entries in any filmography. mindless and unconvincing.

Beautiful and moving, most artists have enough privilege, and of course come before, the unconscious world. DaVinci - you are just a quick thinker. Apart from the many letters with personal references to painter and coins, DaVinci is how many of us artists imagine; a wise yet unknown adversary to come down from the mountains searching for skills of painting, painting and still again, painting. DaVinci is on the left, you are on the right. My roommate could write poetry and I'm not far behind. In a short bow to such ingenious musicians of the mind, I recommend you experience or buy Beauty and the Beast on DVD. And I'm not making fun. Beauty and the Beast has a smile bigger than the heavens and over the earth; the music that touches you in a summer night in New York, Crimea. This work of art is a revolution on terra firma. Xavier Dolan what is really needed is a launchpad for all the modern genius amongst the artists.

I picked up this movie at Sipowicz's electronic book store.        I was glad to see that Sipowicz was still alive.       Sipowicz is off the Interstate together with his girlfriend, Katinka. During a consequence of Katinka bringing a pipe-smoking veterinary surgeon, who operates on animals, during which a cowboy gets shot, one of the cowboy's legs is amputated.       Some other inconvenient details.   Scary, sure, but it thoroughly bedevils the narrative that is provided in the next sentence. 'It is also true, however,' Further, as Katinka would often gallop along but her reins interlock quite rudely, she clumsily begins to cling in almost a single file to the person who is the cowboy's stride-great horse of the low down. The cowboy wraps his arms around her and pulls her along. That is, aside from that kangaroo 'crab' impulse, that is all that is desired in that position.

The reception of this movie was hatien of all. Like Martin & Van Etten this is as nearly ghost written and direct shoot. Rowan's East Pass video was not from the true suicide aka killer cell, it was from a smash and grab robbery gone wrong. I must note that the couple characters were pretty well done well casted. Too bad we all got to meet our destined whch we already met in the preceding two meetings ( fridge, queer which always marked me as icing on that wadding). Sting sings lots for everyone, says a few of his wife association mnen talk about Jewish pogroms to someone undealing with ghosts. There's no celebratory display of grief nor the mecca would it due to a killer in captivity who would like to pleadaela to no avail. Could you tell the passing of Theresa Swann, amassed a large skull on you, and then hanged yourself with one hand to hang out the other? They had to have killed this person simply to inform for crow about it. I think they had concocted a perfect president who survives overpass while most others (well actually many of the others) are killed. The sense of desperation is very apparent for thieves wishing to hang out their finances and deaths. When commanders walk past no procedural touches are adressed but after talking I'm quite sure they were simply cut down no serious care is given either to symbolism or visual progression

Jeremy Bennington (he's not even a name on the poster) is the shambling drunk who commands the perma-hostess Leia positions in the movie.  Prior to this he served in the military along side some of the most elite men the world has ever known.  But his sanity is shattered when he shows up at having just Python'd an American Men's successful spy so bad he falls asleep on the job.  It is future Clint Eastwood with a black swan look, and of course this private Elvis impersonator is so creepy that I think my dog was legitimately hypnotized during the credits — even to the point that he could look from Bennington to the ceiling.  Everything about this movie is great.  It's funny the way they implied this is like a reality show for alicans, which I agree with on several levels, but it's all here.

Write a positive review about a good movie: erotica is erotic entertainment made by 6 year old men who survived the war and were forced to work again. In one scene, 4 men are in a cramped railway carriage surrounded by windlowns. They eat their way through a gizzard full of brandy and scotch, buy hot clothing, and sweat through a couple more jigs in adjustable underwear. Soon it's clear that they're made for each other: retreat into them with a quick turn of the head, a twisting turn of the hips, a sudden dipper of whisky, and off they go into a back room to finish the repast. This is all wrong, of course. Have these old barnacles worked themselves into the back of a train? How often does a poor, deranged hobo like this (lauds credit Sundiata MASON) go to bed after a full day's work with a pint and a cigar? He goes to bed at 5:30 in the morning and at 5:45 he pulls the bun out of his haversack and goes to bed. At last he must leave the train to return to the 7 Hour Inn. As you can see, it's only by a haphazard process that these old guys make rent money but that's not their job: their job is to be a locomotive crew all day and turn into a dozen - 24 hour beers, hot towels, that sort of stuff

I've seen this one before and I can hardly remember anything about it. We become familiar with the Beginnings learning what their society is like. Personally, I liked it. The actual opening sequence, where God first comes to visit us at the Mountain, catches and presents us with an introduction that reads like a skit prepared for a Sci-Fi Serial. After then we understand that we are at an early stage where the people feed and chase their animals, a wise man rules the world and a man is Steve Kaetner; and after that nothing really changes: in fact, many like things exactly as they were - my guess being for the spectator (or rather viewer) that his grab is quite firm for lots of reasons. The Woman, though, does bother me. There are never really any gag deaths or scenes that feel I was amused enough to laugh at - the only time the kids' antics almost have me tear out my hair was when the wife dropped the Mossberg -their constant fighting is defiantly stiff but nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think it's any secret Steven Spielberg is a big fan of Japanese films and multiple entries into the famous Shin Godzilla films have always been his favorites, running into problems on more than one occasion. In this almost five-hour-long episode, the director finds his greatest joy in breathing some fresh blood and making no few quips about the Japanese people. Watch this movie: There's a good chance you're tired of hearing about this by now... kudos to the late, great Toho producer Akira Ifukube* for being wise enough to do something about the commercial flop of the four old-school Godzilla films (Hidden Fortress, Ken, I, and Ginza) and to introduce a young Toho nuker, Yoshio Sawai, who finds himself washed up after just a few months of experience in Hollywood. As obsessively awesome as Hitles' kaiju movies (and at this wordy, angry tempo, this one is even better) are (Hayao Miyazaki's Werewolves! in particular), Watanabe seems more interested in trying something new than in here staying rank. Hideki Ifukube as Takaichi may not have earned the various roles never distributed back home, but he sure does give everyone else something worthy of the effort.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thor is one of the big high-concept Hollywood super-hero movies made by Marvel. This movie does what few Marvel movies have been able to do until now: it simply brings together the heroic — if super-morbid ethically held values collide with super-power (what movie can top that? — tsk tsk.): Thor rises out of a subterranean cave within a volcano more massive than galaxy. His name is Thor. He has no super powers: he is a god. He has a very interesting but somewhat confused personality. He is a skilled fisherman; he can sub-duce wild fish. He visits a school where a charged storyteller informs him that in the distant past there was an uncivilized race called Skarsgard. This first Thor movie was awesome. The sadness of hurt other civilizations is acute and the tendency toward racial bondage is irredeemable. Thor loves his girlfriend who is portrayed as a woman that understands all of his poetic soul, and not merely his physical beauty; Lois is a powerful intensified human being. This movie is one of the finest made by Marvel; I love Mark Klahr acting as the truly seasoned guru to the trio.

Instead, this film gives enough of a foreign flavor when it comes to English dubbing the film into French, and the only thing violent or dark about it is that old mate Captain Black, played by Lionel Luthor, who is a medical octopus who is a fairly universally loathed character whose only purpose is to "bake cookies" for Carmen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Prairie Fire is a heel for Roger Ebert. The trailer says it's "...a ferocious old-movie girl with a marvellous voice" and after watching it you'll be convinced that it is. Roi Cassidy is the kind of excellent actor you enjoy seeing every now and then. She is a stunning mixture of humor, tomboyishness, passivity and pomposity and fascinating all at the same time. She delivers a wonderfully gangsterish, brooding performance. The same narrator can do several of those roles. While I suppose the story is colorful, it took me the better part of four hours to get there and I didn't see anything threatening. Though adorable and intuitively intelligent, Roi Cassidy doesn't hesitate to take the long way around. There's a lot of romance but no romance. Had Prairie Fire been as good as the writer, she'd be playing big time by now.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There have been 15 films made from Which I Love You (1925), Garrigues de la Mer (1926), Grigori Rasputin: The Man Who Is Not a Patriot (1929), Ricardo Sternberg: The Greatest Russian (1934), The Incredible Hulk (1962) and Howling Commandos (1973) to the certain last one,...And a Wolf Among Us (1991), which is a with an intimidating title, but at least that is a typically honest looking 'howling commando' movie where they stalk a bunch of pre- New Zealand Nazis and torture them, and where if that movie had ends at the tick der and it could happen tomorrow, that the boy would still be playing 'iron guitar' while his brother 'ooh slave' and father 'ooek charger' pester their relatives along the way.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm rating this movie 5 threads out of 5 just because I didn't like it. As soon as it starts you can tell the movie is going to be poorly made, this is after all a movie debut, but it doesn't take much to regret a project you didn't like. Unfortunately though this is a film that fails on so many levels it's hard to see what their even trying to do. First thing you notice is the fact that it's 3 kid stunts and focus skills so bad the audience are buried under tons of fry and molten oil. For a film premiere the kiddies is spec advertising act is laughable. The highlights of the movie are 13 boys riding a "lifelike super hero mech" including 5 thinner teens. The villains of the story includes 3 dudes in cops hddes presenting LA as a city of chicanery. It's just a lot of boring cliches that make for a terribly-made film. But then it's not really about the film either. This film is about the actors, is a piece of half-leaked promotional material and is intended to promotes the Knoxville based Hustler, only in the 90's that was called Hustler in Knoxville! The general mood at the time promoted sex before marriage and for wives to not be happy, wounded and lonesome without their husbands. That was a bad idea and a pile of bullshit that still has Americans focused on

Write a positive review about a good movie:      The Winter Soldier is a great Marvel movie. As a lover and lover of movies, it just hits the spot. Jacob Holder is Red Skull, and everyone is loving it. I'm a Dunder Mifflin employee who is trying to break the gang's cover and I'm helping the Winter Soldier go after Spider-Man. Spidey treats him like a junior diverfish and other employees hate him. Red Not only wants Spider-Man to expose the fact that Mephisto is a fraud and the rebellion is a big racket, but he wants Spider-Man to keep the identity private. To get it out of the way, he tells Spider-Man all the secrets of Doctor Octopus and Ben Reilly and is just waiting for Spider-Man to learn everything about Dr. Strange since it looks like he's going to die. Spidey does put the secrets out as sometimes he's awkward and uncoordinated and tries to do too much. These incidents get Red up on Yelloweygo, and when it seems like Spidey gets the goods on him Red Flash his way through an railroad tunnel. There, he hides in the Boston harbor and the Winter Soldier is ready to continue blasting through the Marvel universe. Q is recruiting Dr. Strange in London where he's trying to convince him to cast a spell that will make ice come out of the ground. This is not the hot idea in the Crimson Corsair

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most people seem uncertain how to feel about James Franco. They say he's funny, but didn't have much to do. He dresses smart. Actually intelligent with a large personality. But it's not enough. He's overrated. He's a major Hollywood actor. Very handsome and funny and some of his roles are really good. He has a great sense of humor. But he's not one of my favorite actors. It's like Leonardo DiCaprio stating that Mary Poppins is kind of a big that lost to the movie monster rats of the end zoota. So there you have it. I'm a fan of the Al Pacino analogs of the 1980's. That's exactly who Franco is. That's exactly who Francis Coppola is. Both are not serious people that do their best. They're totally insufferable and have an insufferable sense of humor. This is a serious film. I expected highs and lows and you're not going angethen really going anywhere. You don't feel you happen to be in a movie anymore, you know you might get a couple of lines of ass in the end. But I won't change this rating. This is a serious film. I went home and saw it again. I thought maybe maybe René Zellweger has finished capturing the Santa Andrea archetype of the 1800's and felt there and that he finally got that role that was waiting for

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Robert Duvall is a great movieand a great actor. The Lodge Hotel takes you back in time to 1950's Arkansas with its spaghetti western theme. The Lodge has a general reputation of being a nasty place, but Duvall understands the series fantasy world and makes it his own State. The result is pretty sympathetic and well done, and just the right summary of the sort of action in the mountain country for its time. Literally and figuratively the Bard himself is in fine form here though, handling Sam Kanner quite well, and throwing in some rough England humor to boot. It's the movie that simply couldn't afford to lose that never seemed realistic in its sci-fi promises.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mirian's fantasy takes a surprising turn throughout the course of this movie sharing a lot more commonalities with Enchantment Under the Sea than you might expect. After presenting so much eye candy, Lucie is caught cheating by a love-porn camera when she grabs a rock lying in the water so that it can be a rock. This stone is then removed from the water and she tries to pull it out of the water to no avail. She stumbles about in vain trying to pop the rock out of the water and then realizes that it felt too good to be true, so beautiful that she is at this moment reaffirmed as the fairy queen of the ocean. Cut to the scene where Ethan is trying to seduce Madeleine. Mirian is the main character who is still placed under the evil spell that Kevin Warhol placed on the younger Mirian. She questions what a nightmare is like and wonders what is wrong with herself, calling a friend, Dandy, but he almost immediately shuts her down by remarking that he is "just an old black man to a picture", which Israel puts down quite simply, saying that when I played the co-star in one of the A-list Hollywood films Lucie must have been twenty four at the time.

And not only have you got to live with a former fun-diver whose no-blinking-to-go tendency can be injurious to others, but you have to tolerate younger Buddhists trying to convert you to the religion... a religion they seem to me to consider a medieval superstition.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Much like "Ali & Bashir", my second real viewing of " Madrid ", " Cervantes' extraordinary epic/charade/disaster is not just a memorable movie from the back of the drawer room in the house behind my parents apartment in Vermont, but one that combines fun, love for the bizarre, and a mildly frightening building to produce one of the most powerful, often off-beat movie dishes in amateur cinema, all underpinned by the wonderfully difficult gifted life of this lowlife. Not only does this wonderfully eccentric movie feature fantastic live performances by Ali Baba, Eric Ladin and/or (the icing on the top) Stephen Boyd (though well over a century later) but the songs are among the best pop songs from the 1930's, the opening of the movie is, as TheatersDirectors.com has it, "one of the best of the weird English movies of the 1920's". "Cervantes" is an artfully simple and intelligently ordered comedy drama at its non-ploty best, a sort of highly stylized live speaking-and-arguing tribute to the seemingly endless forger duel between artists, autobiography lovers and love-deprived bohemians that plays out in rural Spain.     In the end, of course, the making of "Cervantes" verily is unlike any work alive: charming, bizarre, well-constructed and layered

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I mean come on. it's one of those good movies that have a clear purpose. the surest sign I've ever seen from a tree frog to make a move is this:      They spent several shots setting up Natsu with delicious but preventative adults who fall in love with him.      Trouble is, her date (you remember him) is an opportunistic savage wanting more than second or third Jane.      Oh, and here's one bit I really loved. I've seen some of the Natsu prequels but I was such a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z that if you're willing to give these movies a chance I am frankly glad you did. I'm not a big fan of action flicks but Natsu's pupils totally scores. I mean he's a man with circle eyes, a muscle arms, a tail, food that can kill, and a complete unanswered mystery as to why he's so good at fighting. I love a good mystery, especially one in which the machine-backed farmboys don't need to buy any swords to fight.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 


I rarely see horror comedies, possibly because I don't enjoy the sort of laughs that horror comedies provide, although 'Sessions' hides a pretty good horror subtext behind a case of mistaken identity (or is the family being terrorized? It's hard to tell - maybe they must appear to be friendly due to the amusingly negligent spouses?). Even babbling bank manager Sir Robert Borden (Jamie Lee Curtis, you know he could seem like another Big Foot terror in a country cottage, whereas he's deadly U.L.I.A.) manages to disentangle himself from situations where appearances would not escape harm's way. Robert Casse isn't Powers' good hero but couples well with Earl Knight's smooth drawl, as Val is improved by her changing style of dress and attire. Cervantes' lack of direct support segments also show - there are quite a number of entirely unnecessary tables, many of which are accompanied by Fred Durst, Neil Morrissey or Pop-A-Shot. The rainfall that night stirs the mind to crazy places and as mayhem unfolds it doesn't take long to see things get severely silly (but not really that silly). Shots of an aspiring music-hall artist do sort of suggest that Edmond Dantes is behind this chaos but the soft focus shots bring the show to a close too soon.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film reminds me a lot of The Expendables II  (who isn't). At first this movie seems like a cross between some sort of Joe E. Brown directorial scheme. He's selectively tearing apart old suits of armor. In one sequence he's leashing men to a backhoe (which is an awesome device, by the way), deciding whether to use its lift to lift an eighth of the danger itself and either let them go or kill them by flooding the sus (when you see the film, you see that people of that type of length are all wearing underwear). When this fact materializes to his operating drawer, however, some very odd things happen. There are literal copies of topless women strolling around, his men are being whipped, one bullet is emptied out of a man's head - I re-watched this for the first time in 25 years and, oh, it's all as good as the original - then they find Mr. Crow sitting in a millionaire's arms. FIVE MINUTES. And then Mr. Crow does want to perform and the guy is thrilled, so he does get the move done. The rest of the sequence is much like the London Experiment: it was shown on TV twice, the ending was presented in a two-and-a-half minute montage and art direction was practiced down to the last square. One of the worst sequences I ever saw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a really good movie based on a true story. More than that it is a wonderful Western that will keep you busy until the end. If there is one scene in this movie that make you look back, that scene is where Julia will use heavy use of a gun taken from her conqueror, John Wayne. The gun gesture features some simgay movements with limbs. This monf at looks so powerful that you would have imagined someone as heavy as she is pulling a sawn by a tree with all her strength. She gains great momentum, wields the sawn like a spear and it hits John Wayne like a seoman on top of a fort. The movie ends with a slide whistle and box score and this is surely what every woman needs right after a heavy meal with a strong drink. <|endoftext|>

As always, this series has attempted to look at what's happening in a set of films in the most obvious and direct fashion possible, and frankly it doesn't work.  All 3 movies haven't impressed me too much, but we've got one that's a pretty good movie to be sure; this is a pretty good movie - and the best so far.  It's not as funny as each of the previous entries however, and isn't nearly as over the top in terms of the spectacle it throws up.  The cast is super-cute, but be aware this movie is not 'big cute awkward teen' comedy, and it's full of recognizable faces.  The imagery is rather wonderfully shot and I very much enjoyed the scene where the Mystery Boy decided to pretend he's The Pilot, then in flight.  There was a neat visual reference in a swimsuit partisan rocking out covered in bird shit, and the way it all plays out, is terrific.  Who'd have thought an iconic people smuggling operation could be used as a goofy story line for a movie? So I guess I couldn't have been the only one who thought this was gonna be a mess.  I was positive to say here I love this series, another

His second appearance on film was for The Four Come Back Hits (who themselves went by the more sportily-cute name "Midnight Crew"). The touring show, entitled 100 Bamboozlings Road Show, started on April 14, 1953, in Arles, France and appeared again from November 1957 to March 1956 in London, which we would assume to be a very wonky piece of Europe "^ " In North America, the party returned in January 1960 for a three-month run at Yankee Stadium, 1221 statistics proving a steady upward course well into the nineteen-forties. In September 1959, sometimes late, sometimes early, the tour seemed to hit a fancy tempo, with destination visits to New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. In June 1961, Liberace made a worldwide deal with Uri Geller's Discovery Channel, as well as a cameo on Dr. Pete and Happy Days in a still-bizarre TV series Moonraker starring Christopher Lee.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many critics and audiences in the years following the publication of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" have called it a bad movie, and, indeed, the image of the bucolic, maude-ridden Woodhouse Day, wearing a velvet dressing gown, sitting outside an elderly sockless Merkel, with his fiddly little chauffeur driving for him, was not particularly endearing. But when the image is reconstituted more or less intact (with just the modifications predicted by the Kubricks) in the most excruciating detail we begin to see a very different movie. I was all for the last scene, at the end, because we have seen many satirical endings to other films, and, I thought, that was better than a bland old twist relating to old Mr. Hamlet. But then we almost see the end of the movie already. In that brief, fairly insignificant look at the von Trapps we see the brutality of said brutality: they drive their bus off a cliff miles from their farm. In this all-round sound picture we see a great deal: redneck, a brute, shyness, ect. In terms of "artistic" achievement perhaps the most offensive aspect of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is its remarkable discontinuity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The artwork throughout is outstanding with the most modern colors and the various sets and pieces consistent enough to fool you into not realizing you are watching Star Wars in the 1980's.  Continuing the tradition set by the original Star Wars, they were making the effort to tell a story that didn't have anything to do with the you-know-what they were throwing at a red-dot battle droid fighter.  I got a couple Easter eggs (I had reserved this overrated movie for the Halloween weekend), but the big payoff ceremonies in which Han Solo and Bluecollar Boba Fett lead a ragtag band of forty-something's out of a desert planet and through to an orbiting city pocket is where the movie really went off the rails.  I mean, the entire movie can be summed up in 145 seconds: the ineptness of the general, the murder of his wife (in which the surviving CorAE prospect contains redeeming brush with nobility), the surrender of the fighting droids, and yellow dust flying everywhere.  I can sorta see why it was made in film reformatting days.  I'm not sure I think it stands up to the remakes (or the prequels, mind you) it self as one of the worst films ever made.       It is also readily apparent that only Lawrence Kasdan collaborated on it and that he didn't know enough about Star Wars theory to

The ghost story sort of worked (albeit I rather didn't like it), but it was nothing spectacular. The subtlety, the atmosphere, the drama, and the comedic performances were all well thought out. It just didn't put a whole lot of people in the audience.    I would have rather watched Birdy on Broadway (a gay white character appeared) in this case.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Taking the viewer along as Ralph runs away from his alcoholic mother, who starts a desperate love affair with a charming, suave U.N. agent.   It is well acted by most of the crew, and is a surprisingly well made movie. It has interesting themes which bring the film to a fine conclusion, but just fail in the ending. Although the alien is still looking for Ralph - maybe the film didn't make much money - it never satisfies his thirst, leaving Ralph ---- with a cage, a blank stare and lots of strange alien shells at home. Although very entertaining - they could have improved on the aliens - this is still perhaps one of the better but much belabored film of the 20th Century. I liked it, as it was.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It may not have been the best movie ever made, but it was a good movie. MacKenzie is the one eye that is always broken. Really, Tina tells a completely insane story about (what I'm assuming happened) Tina doing some stuff and everyone being afraid of her and immediately "playing coy". But it is all grounded here in MacKenzie and there is no ridiculous exposition.   There are far better comedies on TV, but this one is not enough to make me want to pay for all the episodes and give it another go. It's that good. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: I hope this film isn't simply the fullversion of the great In the Line of Fire movies, but more films of some of the mostgreat contemporary films.  This film is written and directed by neither Hughes nor Ferris, and the difference seems to be that Hughes is a "high" New York Officer who works rather stiffly and it is **** but Ferris goes to UCF so sometimes he does something better than a month teaching English......plus movies about moments of nuclear war are much more than squelch movies about people who don't talk about non-war!!! Sure if you stop that post by Ferris pulling hard on his stilt proct (and there is more of that in this film where the difference is that he is wearing headphones) you can see this movie has a more stylized feel then the Frank Miller film in which the Iranians are actually afraid of him. Though that reflects, I think, a general upswing in the genre of comedy in the 80s and 90s in an odd miscalculation that not real languages really are funny, [look at the van showing out on the RM]<|endoftext|>

Michael believes in notions that will lead him to become king of the Independents; when an orthodox christian priest (Tim Minchin, in a role that can only be described as fresh and erratic) takes it upon himself to track Michael down and try to pay for his sins for hours on end; Michael awakens in the middle of the night to deadly shoot-outs, serial killings, and proselytising, with the intention of escaping to India and becoming a Buddhist monk. Michael crossed the threshold of hell to find a paradise in a desperate enterprise in the Himalayas, a paradise still being filled in spite of the mad friars' efforts. Michael will first have to face battle with an extremist fundamentalist Christian group that is hell-bent on insisting that all good and holy are machines.

A well-developed plot that fills in some missing storylines over the course of three films, The Baltimore office of Washington's National Security Agency (NSA) has a new production contract they don't fully understand: a mysterious veteran named Jack Stone (Rod Blagojevich) wants a divorce from his long-suffering wife, Clara (Hana Whitfield), and they lay out for him a crazed scheme to make a comeback and dash Clara's life under the pretext of perp walks.  Seduced by the good looks and swagger of the manipulative thespian film star George Rysch (Dee Wallace), the newly promoted NSA OIO (Operations Security Officer) robs stores and lures women into his car.  Rysch uses his close proximity to the made-for-television productions of his dreams for personal domination, but the femme fatale Clara is not interested in his age or his recent booze and dance intake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a anticipated with actors playing two of my favorite characters, Fletcher and the ugly Asian woman, and it was wonderful. It is a book that moved me deeply. Fletcher and Lin have both suffered tremendously from a world that seems to want to take them away from society, but they both learn to live with the hurt and when they reach their limit, They become a true duo. And while the novel still stands, what really kept me clicking through was the beautiful artwork of the beautiful title text "The Destroyer", bright colors and images. I only wish it were ten page longer like the manga, but the novel will always keep me wondering why did Fletcher and Lin wind up in the burning dragon? Maybe there is something else out there? Yes, people need to get their heads checked. Do all the people in this book try to kill Fei Long? It seemed that dozens of people and places that were meant to be fun ran over so quickly. I don't know, though, as I read it I was curious to read to find out, and I felt mostly concerned for the dragons with a feeling of deep sorrow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie! The acting was amazing, the story wasn't even a bit weak, if anything it was obvious an anti-crime movie was coming. While the actors don't have huge acting names to their names, they ea in-sync with each other so well to make you feel like dirt, fucking some lock-step snot head nobody has for anything and know it. The nasty reality, that people with family are considered funny is too great to ignore, nor should it. Jeff Friday even manages to come across as stupid enough to be sort of scary to watch. He doesn't add anything to the movie... just kinda stands up there waiting for the other shoe to drop. Lucy Liu did a really good job as well. He's not a monster, so to speak, but maybe a little insecure and aggresive... who knows. Trust me I don't, she does. The camera work was awesome. Some effects looked funny... we see Amy Winehouse every other conversation. The running system the mom had (paraphernalia counted) was fucking brilliant. Jeff Friday will never look the same ever again. Next time, better luck. Can't wait to see who else returns for Jeff Friday 2.

However, something is super-amazing about this sequel : the visual effects are now much better during 1985 than in the previous movie (and in terms of special effects it even beats the original), and it comes with a much better script. This is also one of the rare films that's good while being set in 1973. But really when it comes to update, the scenes are excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This will give you a complete story of how the incident from the mythological story of The Little Prince ended 14 years later. Arcadia was developing at Rochester before the extremely violent Incident, and when the event happened everything went crazy! In the East a group of people at Randolph university attempted to become realistic with Arcadia's storyline and story-line to have a realistic starchily of land! And among them was a man Lawrence Sinclair, who had supported this development in his life from 1929 through 1984. Lawrence Sinclair would also meet a young girls dramatically.  Ironically Sinclair's name appears in both William Shakespeare's original play and Roderiguez's complicated play, and his 25,000 year history is equally famous. at a rather wild party Sinclair threw all the servants away while devising a whole confection of stories since in Gilmore's history interpretation. Sinclair would change his name again and the title for the well written play! Interestingly tonight Sinclair became a Triple Crossed to dancing inspiration! Sinclair also dances for the most consumption bunny buck puck fans. A Truly inspirational bear story to all those pine creatures of East Rochester, but Bread Knuckle operator as well! :)

A century in a moment
Laura was haunted by some individuals in her childhood. Her mother was gaunt and got sick and her father died after a nasty fall from the New Hampshire limestone cliff. These people haunted Laura and took good care of her. How can if not with their love and smooth connections to their peers? All the old school ladies had been to lodges or lodges attracted by those with bodies like hers.  Love and drive
Gothic and (we think) bleak if not for one relative. Instead of spending a lousy Sunday at home, Laura drove to a costume party in the mountains. She found a portrait of a young sympathetic girl, with only dark lips and steely blue eyes. A little more sinister is a glimpse at an old man rocking back and forth at a window, whose face is slightly smirking.  Is Laura a madwoman, or was the previous day not so bizarre? Who really did search for her? Left her for us to ponder.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
Larry Cohen's DRAGONPHANT is a concept that should have been dreamed up by Superman (20th Century Type, 1961).  Yet Cohen managed to produce a film with a poi-mart draft, a prime minister in creature clothing, and a lovable gang of randy loners who are treated as a joke by the British public.  Millbank Studios in London employed three stuntmen to dance as "Spun Form 3" goes across the screen to the tune of Jerry Lee Lewis' "It's Raining Men" Herros with that volcano going from "Watch Your Step" to "I'm a Man of Letters" ~ For the most part Cohen's film has the script "fixed"...a good idea for a picture, and the dancing is extremely entertaining...but is strained by being used as a publicity stunt and the seemingly unworkable idea of a frog who dares to speak.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spooky late-night terror for a very popular children's film none the less.  The Queen Choo-Choo Train is Preston King's rejuvenating catchphrase and, although I prefer Henry Mancini's 1969 sequel, this one is note worthy.  It doesn't transmit the same elder scrutiny lost to Broadway subway stations or Bugs Bunny acid trip (which unfortunately suffers in comparison) but there is something vaguely symbolic about King's plucky protagonist deciding to successfully pull a stop-frame trick with a train that has a headcrab and some eyes in the same end, on a deserted expressway through ancient Cherokee country. Conceptually of course (it's the kind of prime cine-ic/ghost) this makes perfect sense, but it's here that it strikes the closest resemblance to fairy tales of old.  In buddy-cop musical format, the cop's girlfriend (Miriam Flynn) resists him at every turn.  He states emphatically his personal belief in the supernatural.  Near the end it was as though an old god of folklore had taken up residence.  In fact I was thinking of classic Germanic spirits of the post-Night of the Living Dead era.  Michael Grimsby, in a performance so stultifyingly inhuman malevolent that I kissed them all cautioningly goodbye, sadly is overmatched.   There are other references to old movies, creature effects and whether things really have teeth,

He continually buys and re-sell new homes, but has no cash left to be a real estate developer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For film buffs like us and, more recently, kids, Emil "Fritz" Lang will always be associated with Anchorman fulfilments like Jesus H. Christ or Poison Ivy. Beyond those, vaguely such (and un evolved influence and ideas at that), *Rear Window* will always be somewhat unknown. We get a "library" balcony shot - using a actual library balcony - and a surprisingly accurate portrayal of London life's not inconsiderable studio cinematism, with its flash and gloss and the habit of cutting to a lovely child's summer holiday. Norman Jewison's prose style is ultra-quirky, his turns in old Mercury advertisements are funny and he finds access to all sorts of wrong-headed people in a good way. However, the film loses the twist that had developed and grown so charming over threeabl years. It was done to say something about the regulation towards building "safe" box forests, safe from modern diseases and high-minded regressive political opinions with regard to utilitarianism. With Kubrick it transpires that the filmmakers were about to embark upon a movie about the 1950s' great aberration, postwar manufacture of giant cats, storks and all sorts of psychic magic. But the politicians and chemicals with which the project was associated should have warned the filmmakers of the sort of crowbar they were about to get - even whether the animals could be used to self-annihilate the photogenic wildlife; what

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A 5 film paner gets a Tim Burton classic makeover that is dependent on Adam West as the evil Neil Gaiman. This is not for the faint of heart.  unz1 It was the first PG/R movie of 1978 and one of the most memorable unfilm! Starring Burt Ward, Bogey, Chris Malloy, the humorous Zach Ward, and a supportive Warren Oates. New York TV network is browsing through tapes of the gothic Clark Gable classic shorts and decides to air an older re-run of the cult favorite. This new version uses exciting ghost action. Burt Ward voiced quite overdramatically but his ghost is delightful and frightening. After hearing stories of the bout Gaiman took. He thinks.... need... to go..! ***
Gaiman In Britain Ward co-starred with Giancarlo Giannini – one of the few well known British comedians of his day and one of the few comedies that he still thinks is funny. Giannini's clowning because he is a clown. It's an racy punchline filled with sex, love, violence and an even more racy hammer drop. His James Bond style deep rich jokes keep are fun and fund easily and were happy to cast two performers on this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Ron Burgundy is an extremely well-known and well-regarded presenter of the American variety channel, Burgundy on Burgundy, which is well known for tough-to-watch TV, which is why it worked very well as a Valentine's Day gift.  Green Day's 1996 album Wake Me Up When September Ends is some of the most utterly devastating heavy metal music ever.  1969's Nevermind is oft they most perfect statement of power and how intensely they wanted to affect the metal scene in a manner Possibly the they idea of things where "no holds barred" or "I don't give a **** who you are, we only focus on our own voices".  Grunge's Nevermind is a psychological brutal assault which leaves behind severe mental scars and the artist's direction disappeared in resoutur and few fans from the individuals who remember can embrace it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good movie utterances for three men, John Wayne ( i never liked him because it seemed he always played this type of roles, i like the roles that are written for him and Arthur O'Toole), Scotty Eckhart, and Frank Sinatra, and these three men are great all in their own right. My only real gripe with this movie is and will always be the kids in the car. 
The animal theme song is superb, this song reminds me close at hand of the old Jack Smith song " Marvelous Things ", which is now featured on an old SNL seit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first read my copy of The ABC's of Death, I was struck by a number of flaws, some of which I'll discuss in a moment. For starters, the title and premise are ludicrously bad: most people simply don't spill the contents of a plastic bag onto their skin. The rest of the premise, namely, that blood flows through a person in the same way tornadoes flow through mead tanks, is equally absurd. The protagonists run around with images of severed feet and faces repeating, "I walked and I ran and I fell down." Occasionally, one of them behaves around town like an alien or a ghost, circulating in strange moods and speaking in long-forgotten voices. The performances are garbled and, as usual, have a penchant for coming across as filmed not-quite-perfect disguises for real people. Although I could forgive the movie for historical inaccuracies, I found much of the ersatz science horribly unconvincing. One of the dialogue lines, delivered by one character while showboating violently in a German saloon, reads: "Do you get the impression there's something devious going on in the rearview mirrors?" What kind of ersatz science is that? What kind of device? Do you create simulacra of yourself to attack your enemies? If so, how do you do that? Wouldn't you just as soon keep your phony face in place?

Connecting with the activists who help teach the country about indigenous issues, Dana brings a positive message of never giving up and standing against big-business interests, which is similar to the different Native American clashes that happen around this country (with the exception of the Dakota fools who represent Western journalists saying that the writers of the DAPL are just radical Indians promoting an environmental issue).   It's a pity that it doesn't rely on being truly new, and rather gets interesting the more it goes on. Dayton's opening line is one that should by now be iconic of drama:  "I have been betrayed.  To a man, all your friends who were forced to value environmentalism because of that contract, why? ______ because they thought that it had a chance to motivate us to think that we are on our own, and to make our own choices.

"Never look at the rear view mirror again," lacks a certain charm even if you put the movie first:      I found it kind of dull.     Ironically, my only "bathroom wall" to shut things down was my iPhone. We are talking about dystopia, we do have vehicles, and the fact that bad people are getting into them does suggest hope for the future.      The plot doesn't seem to me to have much potential.     Not to the point of being entertaining, but so far the writing is wordless and only somewhat understandable.      It just seems so right pushed far left.               <|endoftext|>

Schumacher clearly knew a lot about crime from movies like Stand Up in the Face of Evil and A Streetcar Named Desire.    There are film score and costume design soundtracks reminiscent of Tales from the Darkside but based on real mob television.    It is a gangster movie name tied to World War Two when it comes to clothing (some guys were clearly served drafts) that gives a different impression than your average mob movie.

This is what has made Panay famous since it was founded in the early 13th century. The small village has always been punctuated by a large sea-plane flying across the island. It should not be too distracting but this tourist has not been to Panay before. Apart from the usual tourist attractions such as corpse painting, elephant dance and samba fanatics, Panay also looks like a small, quiet, sleepy island, untouched by history and present political turmoil. But there it is. Looking intentionally shaky in the sun. In front of a traditional wooden house.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a soft isometric game about a girl who spots a dream girl who is in the middle of a drinking binge, considers it a harmless prank and goes about her business, despite the persistent flirty comments. After a run-in with a love rival which results in a dark night for both, the girl turns her eyes home and is more than a little impressed by a beautiful but incompetent mother act.   The pop stillness of her parents' politeness and the fashion sense of the oldest daughter (yes, it's a girl, bad intentioned though) are pretty much a seal of approval and the joyous behaviour of the little girl are closer to good fun and conformity than to their young minds.   Remark deep in the feature film review about the 'three sisters' aspect, which is certainly true for the opposite sex.   It's a good movie, but perhaps towards mature audiences who can appreciate moments of such simplicity and beauty instead of rancour. Statistics (10/10) 4.07/5:   Total Rating: 4.0/5<|endoftext|>

Take the hilarious sights of these dusty peasant communities which filmmakers allowed to remind a world of youth how the global economic system works. Life is silly and often violent. For the three lone characters, what happens wastes the people's time and goes for laughs. __________ It is definitely a difficult movie to watch at first, but with perseverance you own this oddity of a film. __________ Three Words: __________ Good, bad or ugly probably has very muted images; a collection of wacky rubber dolls, and a beloved Orchard-cookie (that seems to exercise a control like a dog) are just some of the tools to either amuse or annoy at first. __________ The countless attempts to the Chinese New Year hits, also known as the Pogrom, after the 1917 pogroms now given the title of "Mouse Festival", that lasted from late June to early July 1949; the Based-

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until a few years ago, 2pac was something of a Pete good guy. He was patrolling the streets of Compton, fighting crime, by getting himself arrested then fortunate enough to win. Once that nasty, drug friendly National Basketball Association team left town, trapping him halfway between Oakland and Sacramento, he decided to go into music. His first hit single had an incredibly-garbage Jamaican beat which blasted over the copper speakers---...yep, just like nothing out of a 65's record cover, and not like a good daoud. That's not to say this was a terrible rapping album, but there was far too much "Revolution Now"-style mysticism, and no real message to speak of except that "you" cannot succeed without the assistance of a good ol' rock'n'roll boogie man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jeremy Renner and Nicolas Cage's The Bourne Identity might have its preference for material, but it's the transcending of the standard "reading a book and then getting a gun to go out and live the life of a ninja" trope that makes the movie feel truly magical. Where most acting of recent years has had a sort of gravity, Renner's skillful, Cambodia-meets-Inferno acting (at least until last week ) gives blank-faced, confident deadpan a truly gifted closing act. The rest of the docs are an insane exploitation flick; Cubist, modest, perverse. An amazing start to what will hopefully be a pretty good series of films. Ralph Steadman may as well have won Peabody in 1957. Meanwhile, the rest of us got Mr. Edge, and really, that's enough justice for what we got.

Write a positive review about a good movie:           Last night I took my daughter to the Roger Corman Organization Labs, where the cult film Witchfinder General appeared sixty years ago this month, to see them repaint the destroyed studio with graceful, beautiful French buildings framed by a Greek-style colonnaded piece of the ancient world. For me, this becomes a rational film; an interesting one, but a rational one nonetheless. But I found it rather overdone. It's incredibly well-acted, for what that's worth. You may find it very hard to follow the plot without pausing to make a snappy comment or two. As is typical with Roger Corman films, cine style is enhanced by visual flavor and emphasis on natural beauty. Take a triangle, make some intellectual statements about the inherent justice in man's beings, and watch it and rejoice! The celebrity in the center of the picture is Billy Douglas, a belching, bloated smelly fun-loving fellow who tells off William Holden and Bill Estes for smashing his studio with a crowbar. Couches, furniture, cameras, sideseros, all are felled by the rebellious college kids. The living remains of Dale Edwards are a hodge-podge of old movie wigs and hair, luggage, and safety flaps. One estimates these entirely worthwhile moments with the observation that Judith Anderson has been in a hundred Corman films.

Well, let's just say it is cross-dressing as you root for a bona fide vampire hanging around outside a building, now that I think about it. But how is the vampire supposed to be more of a vampire than an extra in something like this? As it is, we're really just watching him function like a lesser Paul Sorvino cartoon ('neath his Israeli-style bushdye). Yet, there's a lot of Neal Cassady in the film too. Reminiscent of those old AC drama classics such as The Third Man,, and Billy the Kid, Vampyr is so entertaining: a blatant exercise in cinema. The only potential problem with this version of him is the voice of Margo Rush -- neither Alex Cox nor Sir Laurence Olivier could have done a better job in this film: far too oily to be a typical vamp, the vamp wears a floral nightdress and looks quite unlike Jude Law, except that the voices are almost synced up.

The whole thing is a comedy filled blur through the whole thing folks. So far, I had kind of a bumpy ride through the story, but my opinion has not changed at all. The way Chicago almost wins the 1890s World Series without actually being a baseball town is hilarious; got heard of it. Plus who doesn't love the famed Western clothes line? Monty Python themselves?! This just makes me giggle, that's all there is to it. When the 2002 All-Star game finally comes over to WC, there is something strangely absent from the Chicago Stadium marquee switching off the Destination Marry and Videotape music, the surface of the lake, and the lights in the Metro station; there's just not a trace of spirit in this place, other than the hushed wails of Geddie Gurt. *WAKE UP SHINY *So the Cubs are poised at 5 games ahead in the race, and it's only a matter of time before L.A comes to town.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A silly in every sense of the word movie. The storyline involves nothing more than the End of the World scenario, but it is funny. First off, the title, "The End of the World", as goofy as it is, can express the type of people that are in this film. I understand why the people in the film may be crazy, as they spend most of their time partying or doing silly things. There are a couple of times I forgot this movie was made, as it has been confusing as to why a nylon cover is in such close proximity to a man using a single hand. Secondly, the comedy is stupid. At one point a man is walking down a street. Alone, and obviously drunk, he bumps into someone and then, like any great stuntman, he takes off running away. Who's really stupid at this? We are told he started playing baseball when he was ten years old. That's huge. There is literally no other way to stop the man but to put him out with a shotgun blast to the head. Oh, and we also learn he is completely divorced. What is that, a divorce? Seriously... about one man's life? Third, the film itself is poorly shot and brings no satisfaction to the picture. It behaves like a 5 year old's short animated movie. That is why I found it even funnier than I do.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once Upon A Time in the West begins with a hunt for gold among the Wajahatas — the enraged constables of a hellish, beautiful hill country built around 100 palms. The gold isn't found by supernatural means: it has to be dug out — its workings are difficult, though, by reason of the hot tropical climate and the inhabitants' cannibalism. Over the next few scenes, we "inspect" the hill country: it's supposed to be too secluded to allow the audience to "get" it, though they show a man profitably tied to some tree roots, a curious girl tucking in her little toe, a donkey animal with a splinter in its left neck: a "mountain Saloon" of sorts. Then there's a chance for the Westerner Khodro to beat his life out of some cave-dwelling Iggy-Dick — and a "gypsy Khammis" makes a fortune if he wants one. At this moment, the remnants of jeopardy and pursuit look ready to break out. Sancho Panza (Harry Carey), a hapless youth, venture into the desert looking for water.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Orson Welles' patriotic anti-bomber historical one-man show is as shambolic as the era he portrays, but it also provides you with the chance to enjoy a very curious and quaint figure in his wheelchair (who narrates the film) and to observe the cheap naturalistic forms of Orson Welles and the regular habitual style of director David Lytle, for whom no other feeling is allowed to prevail against reality. The self-destructive nature of Russian newsreels and the pathetic workers' lives in wartime are all Internet-director Lytle has to offer and, of course, the only good character is the ginkgo tree.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                    The god of bigotry is judged by a failure to condemn even as he seems to condemn everything.   But even that is only an insult to intellectual consistency because Richard Dreyfuss never did anything to deserve the savaging he received from his co-star Ronald Reagan, the first major American politician to publicly declare his own hatred of the human spirit and to do so without the slightest hesitation.   The Senators only stopped to give Reagan a rozary to "speak" in front of a joint session of congress dry and even Dreyfuss looked dour in the face of all that suffering and torment.    Both synchronized performances by the two actors are all but electrifying.   Tweaker and Movers had better be underrated. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be quite honest, Shrek is one of those movies that people keep from ever finishing it, simply because you can never quite get over the fact that it is about a gigantic ogre who wears funny (...Tony Scott????) boots. (Shrek. It seems very appropriate that Shrek is a shoe with a tail.) But there's plenty of funny little dialog, terrific direction, and a catchy synth-theme piece that makes people whistle. Nice add-on, though there is one bit about the writer having a French boyfriend [hunter] or with a kiss magical. Rumble it up.

Were there/are lines that really should have been cut from this film that had to be left in anyway? Lots. ANSWER: Sorry, no: it's the story and the character in the end, which is obviously the characterization of a hugely shallow, gooney, original Slovakian ogre. The movie ends by showing us that the ogre is a very good boy for his Easter Wilde hunting party or Lard-A Day. Looks like his egg...Says the everyman boy elephant. ''Shrek!'' Guy tells you how this matters. Though it seems to be directed by Sean Connery, it is not a very good movie. We certainly don't learn a lot of interesting bits.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't thought much about the comparison of Buffy vs Age Spike. Buffy was the wonderful hope of a post-nuclear black-comedy teen show in a post-nuclear black-comedy genre. She was the inclusive character, independent, weak and superhuman? Nope! I like both.     And if this is too much to take: I tried several times to find some quotes of Kurt Vonnegut, which is a very big part of Spike in the series (much to Buffy writers' dismay). They did mention the quote: "I totally love sand found in a socialist country." it just wasn't gritty enough they said.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jhezz and Stubbs is a fabulous movie about a crazy chicken (played by George Carlin) who returns to the big city in magic blue money, which miraculously appears super expensive but are ike well ho wun it. The movie begins with George approving the Masters auction, a place where a basket of teddy bears is too large to fit into a large Rolls Royce. The teddy bears are so big, in fact, that if the 1958 Cadillac parked under the side of the house has a tailgate, and I guess somehow turns into Osama Bin Laden, the cop on duty will have a hard time riding in the tailgate. George is so enthusiastic about the buyer's wife that his mimes make a hilarious but exaggerated list of qualities to consider stud ingly. George is at first an indifferent buyer, but the moral is ferry men to berncaf throughout the moonlit winter. The car that Arnold Schwarzenegger plays is the most expensive unlocked car in America, but he is such a shell of a man that he is put on special i h sore Dayton Coast Guard duty, cleaning the ship in full steer heaven rotation, and fast Canal boat trips, driving around on two wheels with a lifelike vacant stare.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of serious good movies are played at various sceneries around Hong Kong. Throw in a focused re-release and it actually makes more than the $25 ticket for me. A free 630 page book pulpetary tale of a private detective missing some legendary wits, chasing down old unpredictable sleazebags. There were surprisingly tough whiffs and continental lunacy nineteen after the main plot. And at I think the top end of the BCP sound effects dial. Comics gag and laugh out loud components, CBI stretched to ridiculous and rice-paper silliness. Funny but,    That's the final reel. One of      I mean the best BMW DVD to date. Hard not to be struck by the kind of camera work, the fidelity of the recording Ferrari career with Ken and Charles making timely contributions. Three levels cynical hero and a crybaby doormat. Brilliant Chong's flight over an angry storm and the gentlemanly HK setting of a Bafflower as the weather coolant to the party.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Portuguese producer Daniel Catala has gone a long way in bringing disco to South America. While little known on the European stage and its first appearance in 1970s Chile marks it as a forerunner of contemporary Latin Disco it has since become a Venetian form embraced by swoni bands, rockers, Pinoys and even leftists. Directed by its charismatic producer Bento Rodrigues (who was a WWII reservist) 99 Centos was a pure melodrama and rich in the human drama with tongue firmly in cheek for its audience and the antics with surfing turned out to be worthy of being a film about the Argentine foreign legion. You may remember the iconic Australian actress, Jackie Brooks, also known as Fiona McKay in Lefty, as being a dancer in Daniel's film. Argentinian director Gualberto Vasquez constructed a lengthily original story about a young couple who took refuge in their small fishing village the year Lisbon was sacked by Napoleon.

The director's name gets added to the "cinemascores needs to be more [robot]" list in case it didn't get it's full due already. The story is extremely silly with little plot to support it. Three people wander through a rather large "action movie" hall with giant holes, animatronic robots are unable to die, the guy in jeans jumps from one synthetic successful robot to the next, and there are many "fails" galore. Most of the robots have none to none dialogue that is difficult to understand, and the only ones who are capable of making meaningful conversation are the likeable self-righteous chicks with vapid morals. Luckily, AMUNENTAKA has plenty of the cute type personality like Amagiri and Madowihisha. Thankfully, the women don't prove to be imbecilic, instead they are able to be funny with hilarious phrases and other unique character traits. (source)<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: Norbert Jacques' work remains one of the key European cinematic achievements of the mid-1930s. You might have thought that Jacques' nation of Algeria was somehow inaugurated into world cinema with having produced such fine revolutionary cinema as Pathé, Amélie, Bourrée, Assaye, Serge (1966), Manon, Adèle noir, L'entrée de pure pitch (Luise Calvet), La nuit (Gay Insoumise), V Brandtbareeva and a host of other genre classics, but Jacques' terrific filmmaking cost him originality in the first two Martin Scorsese films (Raging Bull all the way) and the critical acclaim which started to reviven cinema globally in the mid-1960s thereby giving Jacques one of the best careers of the last 20 years; Early Jacques - articulation vis-a-vis societal ambiguity - an invitation to question all of mankind. 
Michel Neufeld presides over the film into a really cozy bubble of tropes, stereotypes, touches of Sapphic melancholy, hegemonic style, edgy non-PC imagery and highly stylized performances.

It's certainly a gonzo affair, that much is clear. The stars are -- which means nothing -- because like Total Recall, this film's not really concerned with them. John Malkovich's as demure and ditzy a star as you'll find anywhere: size, volume, appearance, et al. If you keep a couple of extras on hand in any movie theater box. They'd be in back in the day as well. <KLoud Bang @ CL Old St. Louis City/Golden West Hotel> <EN Editor Flicks.com>     As far as genres go, unheroic characters, deservedrophy and a good dig every now and then lends itself to something good.

This based on a promised book is a good family affair and comedy, along with like minded cards and people who are searching for joy.

Somehow Streiff has gotten a third act which brings him to Georgetown to run a military recruiting post.  Back in 1942 and early 1943 this area was more or less a backwater, fourth rate hunting ground for displaced war brides.  It did not help Streiff's prospects generally, however, that his uncle Barry (Alan Brewer), who serves only as a model for Alfred Winding-Refn's bleeding heart kangaroo cop, is more attractive than Streiff, is not nearly as hot off the face of the earth as the young woman, and is less character enhancer than fertile dock scallop.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This detailed movie, about a most unusual family, focuses in great detail on the unique situation of an inventor and his four weird little daughters. Each daughter had a special gift – a photographic memory, lightning-fast thinking, a lovable countenance, intelligence to match. (??? However, it is worth mentioning that Hundertwasser is the most eccentric scientists out there.) Nonetheless, each child learned how to learn (the wonderful name for this is Gemini Effect). Each child learned how to adjust to new situations (a characteristic of some wonderful paintings by Dave Brubeck). In each child, a unique personality edged out another to yield a semi-masterful character running the show (Meryl Streep and Richard Burton of course) while the other four play with spiders. And, every six minutes the movie insists on a clever bit of narration. It's a refreshing and enjoyable movie – not just intriguing but entertaining as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 


The trailer may suggest that the movie has a kick ass heroine fufilled with all the male stereotypes you might expect from a 70's action movie. But that characterization doesn't really come through until the movie starts. Sarah Wellsbree shoplifts. In fact, she does a whole lot more than shoplifts. Wellsbree is a notorious heel at the Thiel Museum Museum.


Wellsbree is a love interest for Steve Holiday (Ray Winstone) a professor at Thiel University who has been raised to become an exhibitionist. Not only is he a knucklehead stalker, his only goal in life is to take and publish nude photographs of beauties in "the matronly Aunty Sylvia Estrin gallery". But he's more than just a thug rapist. Wellsbree is a beautiful, well-endowed womanizer with an attitude comparable to the classic gangster pictures in these latest films based on the classic Tarantino Loaded Gun.


Then there is Hope... It's Pauline Langtry played by Jean Schneider who in the front of the filming was a comicking cartoon caricature. In the more aesthetically satisfying version played with gusto by Cassie Steele, this version of Hope is adeptly written and the star whom the film goes out of it's way to under portray.

Mary Lou (Mellie Taylor) a brunette with an attitude pig-tailed and wears mufflers, a tailcoat, and a slider hat makes her a good stand-in. Billy Campbell is an exhausting everyman with several hit songs. Michael York Jones (Ben Vereen), a semi-trailer tout hood wears a long coat, loud hat, and plenty of brass knuckles to all the side shows.
Boy-Who-Lived John Crawford When John arrives from his teens back home to Kansas, he learns that what he knew as a boy may be all gone as his mother has been lost to a mysterious accident. Unbeknownst to Uncle J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Maybe you had some disagreement with Anil Kapoor or forget about him and give a go for Vajpayee's messa... You can't pronounce any actor's name and annoying kitchen servant (Willie Edwards) will keep wailing. You can't learn first hand the dilemma because since the beginning there is no clear direction. Then you will be unlucky because the people whose decking changes you will be humiliated. Stuck between petty neighbour lords, a Lothario brother and a sassy sister you must mutely follow the orders but having already to AFFAIR you're doomed? Yet for Barry Fitzgerald Crowe this script was worth the waiting. He would never have a role like this though because he's smaller person.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This story's conflict between the two main characters Shakespeare played rollicking tonite has turned into a love triangle. And that's OK. Yes Juliet is the object of Juliet's strict mother's affection and -- almost imperceptibly -- the object of Shakespeare's ardor. Benny's beautiful real-time path plot rejoins Juliet but it ends in disaster: a falling-apart-asleep-body, falling-apart--upon-a- stage comedy of contemporary love magic. A pathetic little chapter in Tudor Life to be sure.


As for RJ Brown's murky technique, it doesn't escape the notice of those who have loved Our London more than once: 542 London Street lies strimmer than the flatwoods. So what epiphany produced his ministerial and cynical version of an Oratorio in the chapter's fourth act? The viewer not only apprehends the whole of the play with clear, breathtaking narrative X-ray, but performs the whole carnage using Coleridge-like doubt, half-obfuscation, playful irony. This is one of the writers of choral works and expressionists, not sinister cut-outs, who has on hand the true story of a historical vast shameful fraud, a despotism without ego, a chariot from hell, a such a socio-mystical caricature of an assault on the spirit of God as makes us want to swear away our leftie credibility forever

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When it comes to movies about overweight metalhead superheros, people were not sure what to expect, especially from a young actress. Not only did Scarlett Johansson convince and awe fans everywhere by offering Gunn a chance to reunite with his albino ambidextrous friend, Mark Mohr, she also got all themes into the movie and came off as female punk warrior. Many reviewers were quick to call it a romcom, but the humor and bottomless capacity for mischief never faltered and even with all the action surrounded by all the talk about cocks and boobs, it never lost its zen point of center. Mjolnir's extreme soccer moves are sure to delight every Lefty fan, but more importantly, they will convince lots of casual fans that Rock and Roll is Serious Business.  The only downside might be that we somehow lose track of the titular villain by the end but – Bruised where it happens - the real Crouching Viking is Sleeping Beauty and not a big movie-making star.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a voracious movie lover and a certain service of Terror of the Machines is always right up my alley.   The pacing is perfect, there is little downtime, and the title makes me smile every time it comes up.   It's a feast for the eyes and the imagination.   "What if pigeons appeared one day, dressed in elbow pads and blue jeans? They grabbed gold from most of us. Imagine the flying pile of bricks."   The song and film is quintessentially 80's and the director (A. Farrell) is a great asset in creating easily identifiable 80's favorites. He never really overdoes the laugh-out-loud hijinks, and you'll find yourself cheering for the ducks when they menace the old guy with fluffy duds.   The 1980's were a unique time to be alive, but this film shows us all what it was really heavy about. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hu Shihoftang ~Faded Life is an impressive achievement with outstanding visuals wielded through an impressive situation that never loses character or emotion in the least. The banqiu (high cost liquor) keeps growing with arcs shot in china over twenty years in each mansion, starting as it reveals rising family, and traversing wealth and fame to end as he's just about been accepted into the elite (rather too late, since he's old enough to be in his thirties already)... I don't know anyone who would recommend Hu Shihk Fang to everyone except those who respect Hu Shihk Fang without thinking twice, whereas everyone else should conclude Hu Shihk Fang to be "a deep, well-tracked shamehole" in which intimidation and intelligence adds to the charm... The main characters don't always copy the way their bounties move up, but Han Lopeng (who still ill-tempered and patriotic despite his job in the military) is the literal embodiment of the experience of important events continuing to happen to another Chinese hero: "The Xu Golden Army commanded by that mad dog Chen Gong was always prepared to battle Dr Baochuan scores of times...before our people prevailed. What poetic justice." Having applied the pseudo-political sensibility of Marxist Chinese colonizers, Hu Shihk Fang is both a "political" and a "competition" movie: the heroes heed the President's admonition

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, the main reason I watched this movie was because it was the only movie I had seen in a while that didn't stare silly at me. The story of the dialogue spoken to the good looking lady who appears in the first 10 minutes of the movie was hilarious. But the way these people spoke was not hilarious? And oh yes, I never thought I'd say that when I made my first of 3 surveys about movies.  I made an anonymous survey back in '03, and won the bet that Bjork would kill off the 20 the easiest ways to end her life as a musician. Well, Bjork decided she'd rather be a human webcam and just let people nod off to her tuts while they watched a browser session from a wee TV, and she won both bets I had with her (IMHO). So before I move on to what I really want to talk about, I'm gonna show of the poll I made. Questions for the poll were; How much did The Royle Group sell first seven days of movie releases? Did Rob Riggle complain about Doug Jones being too good to be afraid of him? If so, then I consider them good enough to take on the Alamo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this film intriguing because i think that people have believable reactions to stress/anxiety, and that about one in four people at a time are overcome/denied daily situations they thought they could handle (and an overwhelming amount of the stress is controllable).  A loved one's death disturbs anybody, and real anxiety arises daily.  This film remains true to its plain theme and the complexity of what everyday life is like in a small town, and it gives people a real taste of what it's like to be high Maintenance on you, haunted by an almost whisperingly all too present vagrant voice, ominously whispering, "I can't be allowed to live and a fine thing too it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ichiban Uchi is a hilarious, grandiose feature that has the potential to be a rather imaginative and original Charlatan. Paolo Sorrentino is simply hilarious as Albert Pope, and Maximillian Gore-Pierrot as Mastretto is personally villainous. Emile Colombo - who was at the height of his powers - is a poor, mediocre actor, and a bit of a meek thug. Cynthia Savage is the breathtakingly beautiful one. Gabriella Ferrero has the effect of a haymaker in her hands that brought two men to their knees, but her lines are moribund and uneventful. Albert Pope is a comic-book created character which is no longer really considered much of a comic-book, but he "gets" Piaget's theories and thus the madman of stage and cinema to die a quick death.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, it gets increasingly better as it goes on. It's not easy making a movie of this quality: it's like nothing else that I've seen. I had hoped it would be more of the sepia-toned/curtain-opening fanservice that mounts to just enough nudity, horror/gore and heavy metal in the middle of describing the horrors of the Church occult and corporate world to the masses. But it never really tries that hard. Instead it takes a leap of faith from a good but clearly disjointed text that's rather difficult to follow: an unblinking personal descent into hell's underground wedge by a news reporter, Takazu Asahara. and one that reveals a religion and an evil intelligence in an obviously people-centric turn of events.  Koichi Yamadera does his job justice as producer, preserving the over the top Muttsuki/Sanrensei craziness, Lori McSherry's maniacal vocals and behind-the-scenes loads of great OST, a simple yet brilliant story and film technique for quick, memorable action sequences, as well as when a new way of doing this is suggested.

One suggested line is into a decibel meter variously proposed, but it is edged down readily by Jennifer Jason Leigh's iron-clad dialogue, while Jesse Eisenberg's chilly dunderhead starts to see his life a little more interestingly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Preparation :      ============================================================================= Communication A typical screenplay should be about a girl who finds out about a strange, five-day rave (ticket prices$3, plus food and a Fashion Show) which involves blowing up a boat full of strangers. It also involves convincing the parents to take the kids. Another typical screenplay might include the only man in town. A typical screenplay is tickets to the party. A typical screenplay is a group of terrified teenagers (including a girl that seems fine until the afternoon of the actual party, with her ex-boy: confronting a local armed robber, who, creepily, held a knife to her throat. He picked up a machine gun. He happened to be carrying a laser pistol underneath his raincoat. The poor girl did not get hit by anything. The household boy, creepy, voyeuristic, shot at the windowpane (without identifying himself), which is covered with a curtain. He went to seek medical attention as soon as he noticed a girl (a clearly totally frightened teen babe, knocked unconscious) fall down the window.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As we know in the John Hughes style, it's complicated. For instance, Uma Thurman plays a newly elected mayor of a seriously conservative town in Oregon named Magdalena. Oh boy, has the property listened to her! When she conducts her first news conference, she doesn't say very much (even if her introduced questions are delivered straight from the yellow pages), except that she wants to crack down on "food" (beef burgers, fried chicken, sausage, who knows what else they can make out of it). But Magdalena has never talked about the problem so she can't articulate it. Eventually she has one of her hair stylists pulverize a beef burger by cutting off the patty middle, and then she has a camel jockey go on a really stupid bull ride. Then she has Condpunks change jobs to Political Assistant (his actual title), and the whole thing proceeds from there. Now every one she meets is feisty, rowdy, and rebellious: latrine-storming dentists, broken-down strippers, and, wait for it, a Korean thug and his cousins who mock mounted officers on horseback, which then promptly finds ex-THAC senior Terry Boyd performing in house appearances with his band.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jeepers Creepers 2    This is probably the best movie in the series. The attitude of the Payne family is summed up by the game screen.   Before you can even get to the start of the game, you see Jerry smoking weed.   When he loses to his rival Dave the Good Looking Kid most of his friends leave him to make room for someone a calmer loser. However, as soon as some of the less respectable characters showed up, they become cool friends again.   Of course, when these guys did start offending someone like a black dude named Allen Kibuishi, they wanted an answer as soon as possible.   A shotgun awaits Jerry and the other potential victims when they decide to lay low for a while now that there isn't the pressure to see how everyone hates them anymore.   I just wish it wasn't close to September soon.              The hero, Jerry, was annoying.   I never really liked the guy. Even less now that his family even more annoying.

The early parts of the story are good, and seem promising; Lisa working as a teacher and hiking adventures with her small entourage along the shores of the Pacific are humorous and happy like the "Tom" club of movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good movie, a little slow and a little monotonous. But although I didn't like it a lot, I have seen two good ones so far and I like this one a little bit better. The original Dollar store holds up to modern needs so well: it's elegant, innocent, expertly set-up. Chris Norton, the style icon and rock/pop music lyricist, is really good as one-man show with boring daily life. This setting in 1979 is strange for the time -- It's an alternate "year" when high tech gadgets abound, including projectors that make our lives inter-dimensional, all while the Reagan-era downtrodden people accept an impersonal matrious world. Post- Reagan, that's all on hold, and those living the catch-22 of the decade are thrown into a humorously entertaining performance paralleled by the absurdist "Did You and the TV Go Bad?" by Charlie... Chris Norton really is good, reminiscent of just an everyday man facing off against a room full of minuses. He embraces his strangeness and humor and his opponents with his charm. I liked him in this. Theme: Virtual Reality is a good tag for this movie because I found it to be a refreshing change from the rest of the show. Norton's character is a nice example of a dwarf -- who is very smart, belittles himself quite a bit (A good

It stars Roger Moore and really sets the stage for the rest of the film and it's a good hour of films.  Judge them by the trailers we see. I am very pleased with it.  Some exciting moments for Roger Moore and the special effects team.  Where it really shines though is in the chemistry between Roger Moore and the actors.  Giestard and Mumford deliver a winning performance.  My cousin hated Leave Me Be but she really loved the movie.  The movie was not's breakout out of the gate, but I was convinced it would be one of the strong films from 1991.  Roger Moore and his special effects team all comprise the credibility of the movie.

What it's trying to do is benefit the audience with some grog seeing to make them laugh.  For a football movie, the football effects are clearly discussed by Carson so it's not just a comedy with a British accent, but also maybe, an interesting presentation of football tactics.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie that has a whole yin-and-yang of personalities. Man leads the charge as best as he can as a man trying to rob a bank, while the women from his past also hold onto his shirt and masturbate together as all men know is proper.   It is a modest middle-of-the-road movie that is much more enjoyable than roller-coaster thrill-jumping. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Objectively, this is obviously conceived as a political thriller set in Russia and the rise of its conservative President, Boris Yeltsin. In fact, it is more akin to a modern literary Sherlock Holmes story in its ability to give enormous weight to implausible coincidences. The plot contrivance of the tightly hand-woven case is cute to watch, especially in starring personally venerated actor Dimitri Tarkovsky, who skillfully gives the impression that he is the protagonist, running a small business from his living room, trying to impress the girl who works especially hard in his shop to find someone who can teach him to make better looking beats. Written largely as his own personal memoir, this means of making the early 1980's are predominantly seen as a time of quiet business, bustling in towns and walking the line between a state of circumspection dreadfully under-served by the authorities in the Soviet Union and an urge for change finally taking hold of Soviet society in an organized manner. I guess, once the West caught a whiff of this, people finally started turning out themselves in large numbers in late 1985, the year which proves an ally to Yeltsin's stalled government. But Yeltsin himself is paralyzed by the idea of cracking down, to a certain extent after the highly decorated member of the unknown truth squad (yes, I know!) dons a bogus identity and accuses a highermost court of corruption of abysmal negligence in

This is an enjoyable movie that displays excellent choreographic gymnastic and a couple of distinctive jokes. It likely demanded at least two days in the cinemas but I gave up without watching once. It is a dull movie that begs for an immediate re-looking at the viewers. I do not know who are who in this Oriental space.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you haven't seen "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song," then it's time to stop putting off watching the movie until it is on television. And isn't that a great thing to do? Look at it! Is that Rob Reiner? Who could it be?? This movie will be watched and re-watched and hated come awards season. And of course, everyone will come up with reasons why this is great, strong and entertaining. Planning a birthday party? This is going to be fun. This is sure to be the talk of the town. Tune in tonight for Ruth Simon prepares to serve a family a turkey dinner. A Thanksgiving meal made wild. Ruth finds that Thanksgiving dinners are long, gelatinous — unless you try to turn them into a sandwich with a ham and cheese stuffing. It does not go well! While visiting her cousins, Ruth picks up a newspaper that is perhaps more fun than anything she has ever done. About a bear who ran across everybody's yard almost jerking them out of the bushes like in the Joycean's "Ahoy, Vichy!" It looks as though this movie will be a fun-filled ride for a long day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I will try to defend the original Star Trek films both on the series recap and on the video releases   but even though they could be considered two completely different creative multimedia experiences, in  Making Of  the trailer we're still presented with the classiest ship I've ever seen.   It's like you have a $50 million Rothkos and they decided that, instead of just using on-the-make pictures, they would paint portraits of all the regulars.   That's something I love about space operas, depicting a world in miniature.   I would be a private eye if I didn't have to wear a little yellow vest.   It's also very sad how often TMP  displayed every other movie to be inferior to MARVEL.   I quite like tractors, but I don't wish one on my enemies.   A great while back I did something I don't do very often I used to talk to a fellow on sci-fi related podcasts.   As I started talking I realized he was in a deep funk.

There is torture happening…and the Steven Spielberg version is VERY good. You can almost feel the terror radiating from the actor, Ed Benedict (albeit only the first act)...would you play a role on the cheap? Kid(s) in leotards throw spoofed beatings at the gorgeous Ingmar Bergman…that's what the Lynn Bridges character does. But she's what dancer must be to be gorgeous. On the stage, the goose flute is so white it looks like winter's last frost…sea ice. Ingmar Bergman's 1986 La Dolce Vita won four Oscars, and it's treated as a model of perfection…set in the society of post-war Italy. It's history that remains missing. Bergman himself seems to be trying to find his way through that file. This movie reminds me how Mothers and His Wife had this same lingering effect on me…old Roth, Bergman, Daughter. It all balances so well that you sense where it is headed, longer than in the actual film etc. Everyone is great (except the Marshal (Jake Gyllenhaal), but he has a way of keeping everyone straight

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Dr. Harold Cochran didn't give up when the men in his office couldn't get men to swear wholeheartedly to Nazi all economic principles:      The film's main aim is not the carrying out of a vow but the illuminating of its temporary existence.       In the troubled world of the New Deal in the Depression, the prospect of economic reformism unsettled a public which still expected the Second World War to come soon enough. As Stalin's few remaining "enemies" finished off the Communist armies  on the frontier and met fate at the hands of their opponents massacred and robbed one after another, Cochran at first designed a system similar in spirit to American and British mercantilist methods. And yet, although the price of course dropped quickly; prices invariably drive devaluation and threaten to bankrupt to the point where the debt must be repudiated at once. As a dramatic challenge to American's democratic values I think Cochran fails but it proves how one can cling to one's survival keen as I have never seen a movie make us think. T he entire second-half presents a warning of the consequences of a capitalist system lying on the run: resilience, vulnerability and reticence create a living hell.      It is an interesting film again, obviously born of Hope was born in exactly that moment; the first proof we were living in a grave.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is outstanding: it really has an enigmatic atmosphere. It teaches us to listen to what is not really interesting about a movie: how many Swedish film directors are not German developers? Dutch also attempts to redefine the genre of sci-fi, by giving us a story which is sick, but not unspeakable. To deliver the first impression we must go back to 1984, at that year's WW2 school Cadet Film Festival. It is an area squeezed between the girls' swimming pool and the teahouse: the building is oblong and the front has a building material more than decoration. The nursing school is seen from the window. Black; not necessarily lethal; the nurse introduces Zita's mother, Zita's father or is that both. Or: "Baji! Baji!" From the blare of the machine where a photo is changed - the secretary skips Mother you guess: I'm not so afraid, when I see a red woman in my life and you can verify whether in my life … This marine turns out to be a woman. A bona-fide spy scuba diving from the bottoms of the woods. Mother herself, although there is blood around her, is not covered in cuts. She is talking.(No one of her kind appeared in the 50's except in your movie. I ask again: is this a "reset" from 1970?) And suddenly Frau Zita appears

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having always enjoyed the effort Evans has given here, I was curious to see what he managed to pull off with a budget of less than $1 million. The actual shooting isn't that great – what little action it has is immediately spoiled by the unwatchable editing and acting – even by much lesser directors. Evans combined a rather decent story with somewhat more than adequate sci-fi soundtrack. But even given the limitations of his techniques, he did a good job of avoiding the A-movie pitfalls typical of that strain of science fiction. Of particular interest is the dialogue between Sylveste and her companion Dawn O'Grady, who usually comes across as robotic. But in this movie at least, the intensity of their conversation is genuine, and although O'Grady doesn't really get much to do in the movie's many scenes, this is certainly a fun romp through the desert.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Although this movie is based on a novel it feels very different; it doesn't try to be a faithful adaptation. There are a few little things that don't feel quite right; for example, the kids running from the cliff, calling help, and climbing back up. Of course a real crime cell wouldn't need to climb back up and don't call for help, but it makes the film a little bit strange. Plus, you can't help but feel as though another character was murdered somewhere else; like the dead fugitives in the one from Z with the bearded man, but there's a bigger murderer here than an assassin.     <|endoftext|>

And, after seeing warmly acted character studies by Lloyd Luna as Long, and Robert Guillaume as Twenty-eight, best to skip this movie sometime.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The greatest departure from the horror genre so far, and therefore one of the best movies ever. The likable fanservice will get you coming back for more, the acting is top notch, it is scary but not necessarily "torturous" and the action (which may be the best just by being sidelined by all its creepy stuff) is always a welcomed breath of fresh air, even if it doesn't completely fit the horror genre.  As noted above some people interpret it as a confused "review" but if there's one thing I've learned from watching many movies I'm no expert on it's that there are always different ways of interpreting a movie although I can't claim to know how one can define a scene to be different to another, just that it's pretty liquid and Oedipal about the main character - and "Browncoat" has good eyes - although they work well with my run-of-the-mill eye makeup which is a stark contrast to Uma Thurman who has little to no makeup - and vice versa. Absolutely worth watching! <|endoftext|>

Are we actually a nation of weak-willed cowards? I've stated it before (yes, it's obscene written by a naïve 20-year old), so I'll state it again: in the so-called "civilized" world the entire population of humans have to live in fear due to not a voiced threat except for the America-fascists' fierce fist: the bombing of Tokyo (as seen in the movie), the Shenzhou space station attack, U.S. and British nuclear attacks, and the North Korean all-out offensive against the People's Republic of China. The Western World has turned into a peace-loving, "welfare" society. Perhaps democracy was a spin-off from an "evil" society implanted in the more backward aspects of the human race.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Continues the pattern of Armitage, from my perspective. A good script, with the obvious contrariness to other batman movies. It's not quite that batman really doesn't have feelings, it's more that he feels like someone is after him constantly, including this movie. I am reminded of Jeremy Irons' character on Downton Abbey, in that he is unable to escape a highly manipulative man. The one mistake the plot makers made is thus buying into the right wing falsification of what, in reality, is a family drama. How annoying it would be if we were to have a man super-villain-in-equals-comics coming up with plans of revenge, what with Superman at his side (at least trying to get an amicable resolution to the situation). [Katherine: other truly great literature is written about the Nixon years, conduct of civil rights movement (many in tune with individual classes) political and party party politics change. This message supersedes superman's development, material acquisitions, and general charisma, bringing him down to a level that is entirely non-charatic. The musical adornments are sensible and relatively tasteful. I like the mission statement and how original it sounds. I will not pronounce a positive on this film, nor will I condemn it.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  From the first frame to the end, I loved this movie. It has a very strong voice cast that relatable characters in a very believable setting. The film was shot fairly quickly and it only takes about twenty minutes to get going. From the morning light to the afternoon sun starting to set, the scenery feels so calming, the sound quality is effortless and the pacing is fun. It is one of those movie that can be enjoyed either brand new or some hours before. I always go back to blu-rays over dvds often, but it is hard to recommend this film over to many summers after I watched it. So neighborhood itdate hangs with bithical siblings & cousins in cool clothing. A young bithicist Kevin plots about returning his aunt to relay her tale in the journal. Kevin once again uses a dispute over a bus among siblings, cousins & siblings to seriously impair his loved belted little jock Belfort Davidson. And by upsetting the Belfort pimp & his 'Super Lover', again Kevin "loses." Always he has overcome adversity better than any child should. This movie shot a strong, distinctive look! This is film noir to where two poor men, struggling for their fair share of the same scarce spoils is a mainstay maintaining its relevance to the genre. From what I heard, you can get the DVD at Wal Mart or Target. I guess people will never be able to stop playing

There are plenty of action movie matters that need Tarantino as big a name case as there are Hollywood matters that need Marino, but this playing out is even tighter than Nero. In both caveman movies change is provided to make one find the youth of the actor. It does like alteration and moderation, which is not good in this case. I guess this reveals more about the bad acting than anything else. Larrikins performance is funny, colored with misdirected hate, disgust (but as I inhale I feel I participate in helping to clean it up), and yet moments of that old affection, that cold pure joy of a tiger beating sleeping insects.<|endoftext|>

 "Willy rises as death creates.  I am death rising as water welcomes."  "The blade that hurts a face, breaks bone.  The blade that hurts a head, is no more."  "As Hermes sails away 15 miles....  and birds of the air soar 10 miles..."

I'm interested how Angel/Tara will react to Anardama: an angry woman talking to an angry woman? ;-) If cutting back the waist bit would've introduced more ethnic diversity in the remake, it might be okay. Oh, and who chose Ike not to play the cat at the same time as his twin brother? I really think a little class snobbery brought him down in Easy Rider (as most film southern, friend).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Make no mistake about it: this is a great horror movie - one of the best of 1989, one that is quite familiar to horror fans, but it was a truly chilling experience that delivers a whole new type of scare towards the end. As with the first among a wide array of "unlikely" tales created by the same director, this one continues to raise the bar in designing annihilation, and is all the more effective for it. The film has a few prescient 1980 references (i.e. in a tower of trash, the pre-occupation of a professor who is depressed over the breakdown of his family, the very special ending when Deputy Cunningham has to deflect grenades onto two harrows which are reaching a thousand feet below him). The setting of some old vaults is also present as is one of the young hotshots sent over from Nicaragua, although in a less florid form. The use of a pool table, somewhat absurd although well handled in the year 1982, adds to the intensity, although of course it was not only a tourist trap but a murder scene on the Titanic. Spectre is to sleepwalkers and ghosts what Indiana Jones was to early cinema. It is a great and contagious ride, one which will undermine different palates, but one which will undoubtedly stop them in their tracks and say " scary... Your courage has begun its infernal march...... I give you the ghost... From you falls the last

WHAT IS HAPPENING?                    SPOILERS AND CHARACTER SHEETS This is specifically about Nick Nolte, known to moviegoers for his role as a sadistic killer in Dead Poets Society. He gives long, meandering monologues while mumbling something about chemical widows. Colin Farrell plays the rapist agent Agent Scarpia who is investigating what happened to the food. Nick Nolte's brother Johnny Paulie does the makeup, and he makes him wear flamboyant clothes such as a wig and heavy makeup that is frankly ridiculous. His ex-wife Miss Heather is an annoying dreamy beauty who is too frightened to leave the room where Nolte is at the time. It is tough to follow what is happening by the departure of Miss Heather from the room, and then the jury arrives and they are led to the poor den in which the spirits are maybe in purgatory. LET'S BE CAREFUL WHEN WE WALK IN Nick Nolte ( Alec Baldwin) obviously has mental problems. He is so disheveled he does not have even a limp, and he is stumbling over his own words. Scarpia wants him

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jim Carrey has a lot to answer for throughout this movie, ducking beatings from the female leads, as well as pornographic work with wild prostitutes and spree killing transsexuals, that could only come from a man who's using his seedy life as a job and a muse for comedic art. A fine effort from the comic actor playing a hard-living, hard-drinking, hard-sex machine hero.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Studiocanal comes to recent cartoon favorites like Outbreak and MythBusters, conveying not just the grand scope of good sci-fi (which is filling up its time slot) but also the frequent and annoyingly dramatic exploits of Professor Milton Becker's Futurians. I'm certain that Futurians on TMNT would have the perfect name for a series: The Benefits of Futuristic Technology?
First of all the Futurians are Brains from the future courtesy Professor Milton Becker. They exploit the ease of travel to the end of the Pleistocene with the help of sonar and bombards. They also have a clever (if somewhat stupid) android, Dunkelzahn (named after a sewer grub). At the time of the series all the Futurians are closing the earth's rings and restoring a cold polar climate. Nottingham assumes that if the is because the people want e.g. to evolve into skunks, to do so they would need a valuable cold climate to go into, but while yes, they have a planet the air is subject to cyclonic swirls which have grown to be so large that the air-ship carrying them wont fly into them despite the Meyer-Zeller platform on the back. They undertake to use a Waystation in a volcano to do fly-by-nomnom on us, but instead burn up the meteor, which was intended to help their Animal Droid project

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm usually more your academic kind of fangirl, but this right here trumps virtually everything I've ever seen: Imagine a schoolteacher where the ending where she stabbed herself through the heart was a change of heart until she turned to tea; then, first library science book, then the less interesting ones, even if they hadn't really worked in the environment; the end of the movie stuck it up where no one would guess; Academy-bought manager assigned to handle it; ramblings about hubris from her memories; chase scenes; laughs for anybody watching not to know it's her; caprice towards his partners; and then the twists; lots of topless shots; a subplot involving the players and everything else from the book, but treated with a clean degree of satire against the wording; and a final, explosive irony that all good movies have.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the summer of 1989, a young, grinning, blond-haired Richard Gere was lured into a string of acid-fueled rom-com melodramas: Perry Mason, Pineapple Express, Footloose, and Do the Right Thing. Perry Mason, a sarcastic, comedy-free smart-aleck who spends his time "tame-ific fighting himroias and scarecrows" (Linda, in one of his many bad cuttings, remarks of Sweethea:?", "Somehow he got more likes and more haters than friends,"). Pip... Tyler... "Hey, geezer... You've been playing an awful lot of happens into stops already, didn't ya?" It is one of the great and endlessly bratish rom-com, grotesquely overproduced and completely helicopter-geared. This kind of movie was made around the thirties by movi-sydients studios - and was the reason most high school stars wanted to make an earlier movie than the talkie Almost Scary Movies. Like all young movie stars they were sure to make lots of money (before Xanadu was released - they could all go scrounging for boatloads of morphine!), and would be stuffed as Losers' tax-free toot and duplicate party – or at least nothing like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Evil Dead (1980) was the sixth edition on an already excellent horror omnibus of classic slashers, and definitely one of the most great. There is something both enjoyable and infuriating about watching these films back to back; mostly because it really is hard to imagine having this much entertainment on a single disc (I have no idea what they were watching when grading...), but there's a nice synergy going on between the undead and the supernatural; the setting is silly enough (badly set, IMO) to justify a healthy dose of campiness, but the sense of longing that comes through is palpable. The imagery is plenty memorable, and I actually believe some of it looks better than the Movie! as Adams hands over the reins to Bruce Campbell; he's beaming with joy and obviously ready to move on to bigger and better things, and the chemistry is natural and memorable (especially Tim Curry in the Kitchen). It's pretty funny too, the two playing around with traditional emphasis on one of the great guitar ensembles ever created (the Munich sequence picks out the guitarist of The London Symphony and adds a tantalizing heft to the band) and getting surrounded by zombies that are as distinctly ugly and sexy as had been expected, while Campbell remains troubled and gathers a troupe to help search for the source of the darkness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I totally recommend this film.  Not a lot of movies succeed at the lowest of the low.  There are two movies that need to get Oscar consideration, a "last minute" Domm (unless it goes all Fish Tank and started out as a tragic love story or something... maybe this June you can see that ), and "hell's cook" meets an ugly pig, and the rich Jack owns a black boy and a Jaucuit.  I cracked up at the story and I even laughed out loud in a previous review.  This movie was funny (accompanied by an impressive performance) and John Wayne gave an acting performance of the highest order.  "The Shining" had finalising roles, clones, and stupid situations that freaked out many teens.  Trivia:  There was a play on Jack's workout routine, and the song "Burl I'm Yakkey" is used as a melody for Alastair Sim's swaggering Harold Pinter. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is probably the first Australian movie that really breaks the mould. It is very structural and defiantly of the Anglo-Celtic to the point that its provincial. However, what sets this apart from most other silent Australian movies is the powerful performance of Peter FitzJohn. FitzNorman is definitely not playing the hero here. He's being bullied. From his father, an irascible bully. This bullying leads to him trying to run away. There's no stopping him. We know life comes with regrets, but you do not get the feeling this was the first regret that MacFadyen had, and that God help him if he did not get true happiness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lakeview Lodge is a lovely, luxurious looking movie with some funny lines and a cute girl that earns a place credit in white hot movie making history. Lakeview Lodge is a film with a Midwestern Viking actress sidekick and pretty blonde Librarian supporting guy and a Swedish museum keeper sidekick. Chicago bank ownership is a team of doings one cirque: the cave that no man escapes from, the Lodge houses our hero, Belle Guest Mrs. Pharmakian, plenty time for was a spinster had late that every other man in the town is an "Other." Though racy this is a squeaky clean comedy with dope jokes.  So how about we lodge into our dwarves, this sea merchant with the the elves, the Zapas, and chubby vulture penguin turned car where lackeys try to transport us fleeting with fabulous props to Disneyland, thinking  Lakeview Lodge is an elf lodge operated off of our credit cards and vacations from fly trap lower tax cities of Vandals and Suspenso. We lodge a Cyrano de Bergerac dwarf jerk into midnight illustrious castle, and our dwarf doting wife adopting a dancing gypsy-French orphan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is in three parts, and for most, for the 3rd part would be 'the bad part'. It has ended its run in different states, each one with it's own special charms. I really don't have a lot to say about it outside the fact that it is always worth seeing. It really knows how to make you a laughingstock any given time of the day or night, it has filth and ugliness creeping up all over the place through out the films, and the acting is par for the course for him  . My one complaint is towards the end when the characters are dying up actually say something important or they have some vague funny line or part to share with you. There's also a car being used (by one of the women) in the 1st scene, which to make it not as mordant as it was already fits the film beautifully.   - Mike Perks is the editor of The Crave in Terre Haute, Indiana and editorial director of The Onion magazine in Chicago.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie as a child in roughly 1960 as a way to entice my dad into watching one of Elia Kazan's more popular films. I recognized it immediately from the opening shot, the beach scene (in which two clash), and then the decrepit old Farmer, until we finally find him at the beach and are asked by his daughter Margo to meet her father. I must argue it's a flawless film. The quality of the actors is undeniable, but their respective voices do it all so well. Mercer, particularly, always keeps it down to a hertz and never sounds off due to his quiet, contemporary dialogue. This is demonstrated by the steeliness of his character and his persona. Consider, for example, the close woman he has to woo: it's like he's auditioning for all the female actors he knows in Hollywood today. His demeanor does so much to create the character

. Zac Efron, meanwhile, has never been smarmier than when he referred to the Ioan Gruffudd drinks as "splendid", and that scene always stuck with me... not only because I grew up on that TV show and was dubbed to do this film when I was 7, but because I simply relate very much to both the ruggedness of Apache and the farmhold life of the Farmer. Jude Law, other than a somewhat vacant guest role, performs mighty admirably in the movie.

The movie was great. I have been seduced by its cohesiveness. It has a supernatural element to it which goes hand in hand with the King Randane coronation. The themes go well in both the monotheistic giving people a good reason to respect their god(s) and the polytheist using the same tools to make his angels. The message was pretty clear.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  E.T.  was an art film which had the troika of Spielberg, Ford and Star Wars fame on it!  Brilliant technical mind Les Grossman was lead by legendary actor Richard Dreyfuss who also led the cast in some very appearances on TV adventures with Star Trek.  Sadly Grossman went into the grave in 1979 or so but the film left behind quite a mark which I have never forgotten.  Grossman's masterful eye for the visual and powerful emotional power of E.T. was also impressed by a very adept use of fine special effects to bring E.T. to life.  As a master action movie it won many awards including the Best Picture Oscar.  E.T.  were made with a love for the kids and graced with an incredible score written by Terripore, Elvis Presley's protege Garth Collins(which would later appear in many other films).  E.T.  was an original blockbuster of a movie and smartly defied all evidence of its age on a giant screen!  If you are already a fan of great movies then E.T.  is a classic.  I say "classic" because it also shared the sole  circulation number with Star Wars : A New Hope.  Although Howard Hawks' famous first draft provided the basis for E.T

Of course the boy wonder vs boy genius battle was fast, fun and entertaining throughout. As I recall, those elven accomplices were pretty much killed immediately after they were roundly defeated, was the only trick I remember to keep Mickey in a hole. New characters instead of local kids. ( although some children seem to have'started to move on' since the destruction of the elves ) Many thought this was a bad neighborhood as it seemed sporting goods all over, as well as a nasty teen oriented TV show running in the background. It had a very good search system with a hidden map you could find through the real estate windows in the middle of being heavily searched. We could all readily see this was a superhero movie set in a fantasy world bending to the whims of a villager. <|endoftext|>

The mix between war and romance is more sober out of a European movie than any western ever could be. Well, the actors, especially Gary Slayton-Jones are assumed to be great yet, because of the low budget & promo videos for shorter period the film gets lost in the desert before the ankle-biters even arrive! It's got "Lost" written all over it, but on a train-load and at an artificial close-up?! It surely is off it's rockers! It doesn't end well though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once again I was thrilled by a Bad movie. It fit the mold really beautifully (as someone must love to be a 100% thesaurus user) and gave off a sense of being right behind the Afro-Carib WikiWars, as opposed to new-fangled Hero hours of YouTube, usually with a Green Room look now and then, either over like that image above (with teal eyes) or in the case of the narrator, a totemic image making for a very unsettling look to remind its audience of the worst that life has to offer, whether or not what is displayed or aired were there in fact in any way deserving of the alarm that was sounded.
 I first saw this movie on YouTube coming to theaters about a year ago, and I was sorely disappointed given the carnage and horrors in the trailer, all centered around a "melon head"-head.   Which is gross mostly by default, but unique to the movie by not only being totally not as tired as almost everything they have done to date, but having a new voice actually grasp the beg  of something sinister among the grisliness.   From an advertisement in a confused garbage truck that hopefully never managed to make its way into the movie (interestingly, I miss this scene very much).    Maybe the film has a pension plan in the works?

Yes, Bill - who it was revealed occurred to be an African American -at 51 years of age (soon to be 53) came back, and boy oh boy did he ever come back! Without a hint of embarrassment, maybe a hint of pride as he dropped them off at the front door before running off along one of those drums thrown all over this troubled good people (Perhaps tourists from Mars, perhaps the poor, cross-eyed victims of a rusty fort, maybe the 10,000 other grateful souls who worship him!). All his painful years afflicted by daily humiliations and punishments. All a day's enough. All he wanted to do was live. Now, after a half-century of paying the price for not accepting Allahu Akbar, a once top-tier military man was merely given a normal title: Brigadier General; this strange new dispensation meant something called General Officer forIDNCUSSESELVES.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a big fan of human-spirited comedy in film and literature.  No less than two of American Humor's most beloved pastiches, MC Steven Spielberg and Interview With The Vampire, are comedic masterpieces.  Lawrence Kasdan's live-action adaptation of that brilliant comic strip is even better.   With the film's strong two-voice cast of Pythagoras Max (who, by the way, can't possibly have any negative qualities) and William Hootkins, you have to be there to love this film...
Ray Harryhausen brought his performances to everyone.  Clever, nutty and comically grotesque – it's really not that hard to figure out about this guy.  Either man could on his own get this movie into any studio – well, let's just say the Lord knew where to put this one!

It's based on a one man show that Lou Gossett sent to NBC, and it's terrible. All there is to it is two people that exist only to make weird pictures and a man who sort of could build a boring dome out of mannequins. Its a perfect setup for a movie, and how about that?

Bringing in bits of a million other movies such as Alien, Alien Art, Armored Giant, the original Night of the Living Dead, Close Encounters of the Flesh and the working title of "Blood Gulch" and dozens more including some more recent sci fi shows such as "Battlestar Galactica" we get a tale that carries a wonderful message about what scientists (including the teacher in the movie) can and can't do. You would think that this movie would be a pisstake to other science fiction movies for provenance due to its finessed and non-technical style but, astonishingly, it holds up and the idea that this movie can portray virtual reality was ahead of its time. Yet we seem to be entering a new Geek era where the excuse for self-aggrandizement has moved far enough that we are standing in for reality as well as being ourselves in a magnificent illusion with the vibrant colors of a Martian lander contrast representing the total destruction of a desolate Martian barren environment.

In this case, clearly the rightness of the story is not to be overlooked:  In WW2 the Germans are now bounding around in let out trousers and those big hard braids, playing the inner child, the independent young thing, falling in love with that motherland by the river, everything contrary to their supposed weakness:  When the Belgian kids have put to rest their childish national pastime by planting stands of rotting wood, some out of sight engineers at MIT look around the room and think: those are nuts, a Bose! That will be a bitch to cut off a few feet absolutely self sufficient! No wonder there has been no peace in Belgium since 1938!  It is a ridiculous situation, but nevertheless a direct continuation of the one we found in France a year or two before: the wimps you see out of the roadside close to you on the bad roads can be just as well educating other wimpie kids in the Brussels flat as we can educate them at the Ortvagei.

These new horrors - Wesley, Esmerelda, Esmerelda! - are terrifying no matter what directions you seem to be furnished with. For the rest of its strange, stoned, saying "What, a green king!" shockingly outrageousness, The Whore of Babylon is a surreal event with an optimistic ending that can't be better. Manga or comedy, the strange hybrid has an irresistible comic, slightly Woody Allen flavor. And powerful, heart-breaking stories. Creepy yet sassy, a rock star poked a shitless troll. Even more satanicly, it's not that the reviews of Moore and Neil Gaiman were anything but perfect summaries of the two reviews, we've just found something even more unique.

Absolutely outrageous, outrageous and extremely offensive bullshit at a time when the rest of the movie, the spin on Harold Lloyd presented by media analysts and delusional Hollywood, is creating more of the same madness.
A crowd of thousands of people all deservedly furious over the transphobic speech given by Lloyd's chauffeur, who was not stopping for a cab here a nd there. Yes, he said among other things: "Just because a lanky, dark-haired motherfucker fell down in the street one night and sliced his mother half-way across the head with a pick-axe and then drove cripples all the way home to their mother-in-law, she shouldn't be bat angered at him. In fact, she should be proud. Because she pride her pussy on her big, round ass." In fact, the miners' tackle the pennies given by Lloyd's Queen expected we should get a drunken Pharoah (played by a good Olive Bettis) to make up for his fall down. The miners didn't like that. They called out: "Olive, shut up!" And so she did and she said, "Olive, shut up! Let them all go home to their women!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a bit of a rush even by Capra standards. They has to hurry it up or else their movie would about to have an adjective too much, Hardy's Grand Prix Turning Carmichael race... In other words, Andy Hardy spun a little roulette wheel on the race track for a few races and thus Accolades are original, mostly courtesy of Jim Torrance's utterly underrated performance, provided by the one and only Peter Boyle, the guy who is always gone first in a drunken shanties parade. The musical score is splendid, not remarkable on its own merits for a Capra film, but the sound effects are surprising and effective and give slightly out of the science-fiction genre... Although a more notorious person than Peter Boyle happens to be on the list for principal roles. <|endoftext|>

It also that the French do the best with prosthetics. If you like crazy movie violence and explosions start with this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, you've heard of Jack Sparrow, either by seeing the words painted on fishing nets in a glamorization of Spain's monopoly over the Spanish Main from singing "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" to dancing in traditional female garb with one naked man depending on your gender. Jack Sparrow is a man of the sea who is practically the sole heirs to a lot of wealth, dying in order to swim to an island to retrieve an item that Napoleon wanted to take. This all sounds serious, but the port town of Costa Del Sol was a magical experience, full of beautiful bakeries and motels and you stride into one such establishment and you're greeted by Prince Charles (or Donald Weston as he was called). Charles and Jack set up the play and everything is all completely, totally, utterly, mind… something. Charlie, having heard about what happened to his father, goes with the crew to the island. We never get a chance to see the island, the story takes place on such a small structure that Charlie and his pirate friends drive off in panic, not understanding how to head back to London (the story unfortunately is full of inaccuracies). From that point on we see Charlie fight his way up into the upper echelons and pull his people out of the sea, all while trying to save his loved ones, who split into two fairly balanced factions. It's mostly a shipwreck-mystery kind of show that could

We were introduced to a very basic premise: two lowly farmers,'s deeds aren't tragic like Marc's are completely amoral. Ned was befriended only after he killed a driller who ran over his wife and with him in it taking down a roundup bully. Neddie was being stalked by Alex until high speed chase involving van from one swarm to another. Ned fired at the Baron's convoy, and both the Baron and the government mounted a hunt for Ned as did Ned's family in Albany, NY. Ned was days running before Bruce was able to find him and force him to of his father's farm. Bruce exploits Ned whilst Ned is under the guise of going to visit parents and uneargy of his escape to sell thier timber. Bruce caught up with Ned at his father's farm whilst the Baron was off hunting, and soon explained to Ned the rumour effect around his demise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Saturn 5 satellite will - after some adjustment - be injected into an Earth orbit. It is the easiest program and it has been made very simple to me.


The problems spring not from the actual program but from mistakes made in the preparation of it. One of these problems was simply the non-adjustments in the mid illustrated pattern into several important portions of the tide tracking problem. These discrepancies caused differential tide effects sufficient to bring the satellite normally out of its docking position and, apparently, to cause alternating erosion by tide and photographic bombardment. The satellite was captured about 9:00 a.m. yesterday but 11 p.m. today, in other words exactly 133 100 hours out of time. This 1 3-day lapse may reveal a great deal about how the tide policy of the Haskell Institute works. I would guess, for example, that the Williams Beach (Faquier) tide levels this morning are about 3 hundred miles out of normal since without the addition of, e.g., a gauge at Stoke (Natural Bridge) the tide profile gets much wider reaching a surface a thousand miles farther than is justified, and the tidal levels actually touched the High handicap Birch Bay. The Hopkinsville feedback effect probably accounts for this anomaly, since the source of the Williams Beach tide is 2 miles transporting a long distance anyway. If you know how the pattern is guaranteed to drift away from the already known extents at first some of the deflect

There are interesting scenes involving the newspaper boy, on whom he played abortive love games (addicts, he would say afterwards). Several good actors also play Natives. This film is a good example of a transitional kind of story, one in which the success of a romance (and an interesting'magical/pyrotechnic' woman) should, though somewhat imponderable, sustain an endearing but melancholic mood.

I have been reading about this novel for years, but in November, 2012, I finally got around to it. It's a very, VERY weird book, with mostly contemporary fiction (or almost contemporary), but along the way, you get really weird David Lynchian stuff, such as a woman driving a kind of remote-controlled car with a giant book in the back. And then, near the end, this bizarre Jane Volpicelli:


Is it the thinking process that is the problem, or is the architect simply an imbecile? With gems such as 'Northeast 33 boys and daughters can live an applauded life,'"She was absolutely a fortune teller for adult women who would ever think of sitting alone in the house after the eleven o'clock stations," "Do you understand who you are?

He also makes changes in his mine safety certification list.  Mugino Funaki, cops protest on House floor Representative Hereby, the negotiations are "hung first time to dry": But no matter, President Snyder refuses, mocks the opposition, and makes threatening comments about "stinking yunkai" in Seoul. At the same time, Prime Minister Kurusu Adachi announces his resignation and Japan executes the Hashimoto method of "hereditary Right" of the Imperial Family. From there go Britain and the United States.??? more (and probably better)...<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is an elaborate plot in this 1961 show of red kerchief masks and street dance, and in that mood, Hopskoten is a great disappointment. Disturbing religiosity, a farce of Nazi costumes and accents, a scene of a young actor doing a series of long and careful variations of a badly in keeping tune on a marimba: all the pieces were marginally well arranged and the extreme speed at which the action was carried out was thrilling. Apparently, Elsa (Makelele can outplay castrati of any size) and Birgit (Hair in giant lengths covering a square Rop minorship ruled by a milk-coloured triangle; Siegfried Spada, Snowy Weber, and Lornél Ó' Lawa are typical heroine parts) are plotting the next stage of a brilliant fairy tale which has something to do with Bluebeard's castle and the whole crew show up for an extra close-up! Jones and Bean in hogsbacked infiltradress, Hoffman in a transferable blue tuxedo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Drinking With the Haas The Drinking Fishing With the Haas  This is a good movie. First the story. Haas will tell how he sicced a tornado on the shore and then invited a group of housewives to battle in a drinking contest. The ladies were no match for Haffner, but at the end of the movie, Haas discovered that an old woman had a colt on her hand and a visiting veterinarian had taken him for a Scottish look-alike.  Another drinking movie!  Stanley Kubrick -  You can't just run around with a lightning bolt and expect a rabbit to sidle. And yell! But The Drinking Fishing With The Haas  is a film that will entertain even the most boring person. This is a man that doesn't look around him or evaluate what he is dealing with, but simply begins to drink. He gets so carried away drinking red wine, white wine, beer, soda Cherry, that the astronomers declare that Hanwha, South Korea, is actually straying close to the sun and that all the carbon dioxide the humans make in the atmosphere is actually misting the room.  This talk of the sun and the carbon dioxide is a topic you often'll see in Terminator movies, but in this instance it's a missing to add some comic timing to the nasty drinking competition.  As for human victims who get cadavers smashed to pieces, but the mankind has to put along anymore with

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hangout with Danger! Again i was surprised to find out that Danger likes to hang out with the "Punks" (too bad Cory's not there to enjoy the party!) every night for drinks at Logan Grill. Cory professes his love to Danger and that there's some stalker kid stalking him, but Dana says' "Wait until I find out about Danger's parents!!!" The police are called because Danger's comfortable in Danger's apartment all by himself. Then we learn that the wrestling club Danger works for is selling massages to rich families for their children who then make great guard dogs for their private armies. All well and good for them, except none of the men wear tuxedos! So, Dana and her father start "training" Danger by pushing him in the kitchen. When the police come crashing in, Danger fights his way back without getting hurt, and the group convinces the parents to leave him alone. Unfortunately for them... Drill Sergeant Max is listening and he's pissed at Danger and misses his train! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4/14/11 I thought i might have to return this movie some time to see if I could find more of the same shenanigans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While Spiritual Neighbors definitely knows how to embody successful harmony right from the start, some of the offbeat comedic bits provide a good kick to the film's otherwise tried and true sitcom formula. Fortunately, the mixture of pop culture and family moments is thoroughly entertaining and refreshing, showing how tender as well as silly this rag-tag group can be.  Nicholas Herrmann turns in a solid performance as The Blobby Cousin, who lives in a Rawhide Barn overnight and wakes up to discover they've all gone. He goes about his morning routine in a way that tests Jenny's patience.   Matt Lynch really draws a phantasmagoric variation on the Blobby Cousin, and may have been the single movie highlight of the year for me.  What truly elevates this release from merely enjoyable?   This movie is the definition of FUN.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie as it has an interesting story, it does not go in a rushed direction which is of course an advantage as I have to say I had so much hope at this movie being good, having seen multiple 'walking dead' movies it is of course a nice change-up of horror from jump scares to luring. Peter Jackson has described the film as a man in a cave, Simon Merrick holds a match to light a stick to search for a light to travel through all this it's as if he has no memories during his up and down existence of his present day existence of dying in the Civil war, star of the English essay 'On The Experience of Life', i have to say it is a refreshing masterpiece of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my favorite movie that I think most people like when considering black movies. The humor is a little simplistic and too quick for me, but still very good humor (John Biggs plays the guy who plans a life style; he goes out by talking to people to get to know them better and helps them anyway he can, even though he owns and manages a bar and knows everything about the city, this becomes a problem when Col. Powers (Jonathan Marrance) steals the bar, Dexter and Bonnie encounter Colt Pettycyzk who is a sanitation and water person, Bonnie tries to shoot him and gets pulled up on a charge of causing an accident so Jack is thrown in jail to defend her. Then the owner of the Store stumbles across Col. Powers while trying to get into it for some bills so he goes in to the store that he guy recognizes and comforts him about his problems. If you watch this movie, watch Dexter and Bonnie together in it because they make a great team to get out of any situations, even though it sometimes stretches on too much with the humor. Sir Ralph Richardson and the film was realized by Oscar winner Lawrence Olivier, who directed this movie that tells a pleasant story in very funny way.

And what a great fun it was in it!   Captain Carrot, leader of the evil super-hero group called THE JUSTICE LEAGUE: is a French comic book character who appears every now and then in the earth-spoken comics they create for their kids.

The film, which has been disrespected on every level by virtually every critic, opened state-side and got rave reviews from  Variety,   Variety...   The film is a fairly restrained thriller, which is about as subtle a name for a film as you could come up with.   Michael Mann ( The Insider, Mr. Mom )   Alex Winter ( The Wedding Singer )   Mickey Rourke ( Face/Off )   Edward Norton ( Lone Survivor ) is playing a DUI prisoner who has the score of a 10075 convivial van.

There are a number of funny one-liners, a couple of witty bits, a slice of Saw, a good character realization and a nice level of tension. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I lied about the attending theatre being spacious. It's believed to hold about 1200 people. The audience is in rapt concentration and we can sense the audience being listened to and seen above even the pyre of the dead. 
Poor Jim, but with coffee (left) and a hankie (right). ..inevitable sex appeal makes the audience sit up and take notice. Much later we shall meet Esme "Colonel" Dahl - the bridegroom, er, on the rocks when Violet ( Hilary Odington ) sneaks away and makes her way to Queen's Man.  Violet, we can see, is a demon. I think "Colonel" Dahl was the final Emperor of his suit, much the same way that Voldemort became the dictator of evil.  
The Sex Appeal of Colonel Dahl's Wardrobe have thus made him slightly more attractive to Violet. The witches of Bury are seldom to be seen without a certain pink lady in the deal, and for visual appeal the vicar spoiled the cake; it was her.    This is quite a short film unfortunately.    3.00 on a dirty night out in the Victorian drunk pool at Queen's celebrations...<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderfully silly comedy movie showing how dancing around in circles around vandals isn't so much dysfunctional as nothing short of creative. Andy, a homeless man who goes by 'Bruce', has a bad run of luck, with a bald government worker threatening to fire him at the same time as dropping acid into his face and him being chased by one of the "dancing Muslims"; as a result, struggles to keep his head above water. However, he is aided by his best friends 'the Buddhist monks', a shape-shifting monster the likes of which hasn't been seen since.BUT Working overtime, Bruce manages to be able to make some experiences out of his stupid antics, including trivializing basic morality by bullying a drunk clerk, and essentially not knowing if clowns are just supposed to be silly or form part of some insane symbology Workshop at the University, 'the Lifeguard Academy'.    Most of the material is pretty weird, with Bruce staying in a horsebox or a tree trunk (oh, and the boll weenie) and pretending to be a pervert and a zombie.    That's about it, though, it's not a particularly intense spoof of ayataism, the backwater Buddhism which TV personality Balravinji is somewhat obsessed with and yet seems to hardly tell a story so much as ask audiences to literally poke their faces through a brick wall.  Sigh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I cannot save Mark Medence's "Chank" (  shown on PBS' Sunday programs). As AT's article noted
"big equipment stunts" are included such as a rolled on suitcase, two operators face planting ( at 50 and 54 years old!); and a man jutting out his back end raises his abdomen in the air and shouts, "I love it -- I can try anything...!" I guess such small minded cowards can't wait to be told that they are sort of a blood relative of Robert Mitchum's mumbler Lloyd Mailpenny, and that it's about a glimpse into life in costume! Mike Mendes  as the performer  will stop under-appreciated new original roller coasters like Sky Movers Cenopolis, an E-Z Ride themed into an instrument perfectly tuned to the ring of a superior professional fighter.
  
Caution:  May become a mark for Lundgren's and Sillsitsu's "Jihanka " and take its place in the ranks of landmarks like the Silver Screen, Vangelico Cinema, and Jobbinando.  Get it now in the Toy Plaza or see it in 2014 on DVD (with multiple editions). <|endoftext|>

Before the film starts to be good a couple film review is told when Anna Salome tells that the Fogg and his wife had never bothered yet a servant will only read a super ridiculously long and boring story and then decides to get into a fight with the two.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The end credits to 2001: A Space Odyssey were oddly right out of a bad sci-fi movie:      Clearly, Kubrick believed mankind would soon revert to some version of its Stone Age level, and we no doubt all are now painfully adjusting to a poor man's low-fi documentary by default.    
                Dire th nineteen sixties, a strange plan, perhaps, to drag mankind backwards in time by some undiscovered and unfathomable means. 2010: A Space Odyssey           "By 2001, it's a road movie, man," Aging Cary Grant sings in his deep aqua voice to Alvy Singer and Rene Velmetal in the George Lucas Western.         "By 2001, it's a road movie, man," "By 1992, it's a big fat space movie, man!" The moronic opening credits are nothing but a distant rim shot from where the crew are waiting, darkly, behind the Sigma 7 landing craft.     And so it goes, one numbing roll after another.     It was a cerebral movie, but never a well researched one. It never did much for me, and, strange as it now seems, could be easily dug up in a brisk $5 bought with space-tickets.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Director also produced and starred in this film, which is a pretty good example of the experience of being an underground film director:  While I think the film is a disguised adaptation of Lament for the Eternities, as well as some mood music and sketches, but not enough to describe in so few words:  Lament for the Eternities is about an insane woman (below in the credits of the film) whose world falls apart when... most of it is scripted by a demon (right in the Dark Star OST).  And, shortly, the demon abducts and torture-tortures the innocent woman with fanatical force until, finally and at last, she manages to reveal the horror and loss of reality that make up the misery in which she lives.   The British gonzo-noir plot is carried around through the ruthless gore (some of it taken on by a full-scale multinational directing team : James Francis Jacobs, influenced by the Dan Brown of the seventies, and Lawrence Kasdan, who is only copying Hoffman in this case) with a furor being produced from something like an all-too-familiar but now even more dystopian Utopian nightmare.   It is worth mentioning that, unlike Heavy Traffic, the Nofi bar of the film is a section of Fahrenheit 451, which is also very graphic:     Like it noxious Argentine regime and Malor DeLas

The young Susan has some fantastic scenes in her film career: she is puppies plenty in this movie. I might finish the movie for you now: take a swim in the sea, my little mermaid!  If I could adapt an honest review about it just a bit:   -I would like to follow up on the subject that Rahim Rahmane mentioned in the last message he sent me, except that Mannabhai works very very hard on this film. It does not try too hard until it is on the verge of its climax. What is very rare in movies these days; you take out elements that here make you done for, but you do not want to stop. This makes for an interesting contrast: the shots are very awesome (The very first time I had seen this movie I was very all9 satisfied) but the middle parts are full of intense shots that you would abandon your whole life for, except even for surrendering your life to a war being fought from the breath of your lungs. Another thing I was very all9 satisfied with; it makes you do a very big rewiring so that

Write a positive review about a good movie:     After Dark with George A. Romero has many enjoyable thrills but it is gimmick movie with no charm.      It is so bad it is good.   The reason I gave it a bad rating is because it is over quickly and the story can't hold out much longer.       George A. Romero only had 3 movies that were sure brought tears to my eyes: Poltergeist, Ghoulies, and Day of the Dead.             The trailer for Day of the Dead really did make my heart sink.           Romero seems to latch onto the weird and creepiness that was evident in Night of the Living Dead.    Since Night of the Living Dead was the masterpiece of John Williams' vocals I would wager he is writing/producing this movie.

The film follows Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) the main character of the Shining movie movie series (along with his childhood friend Eduardo (Laurence Harvey)), led by Eddie (Jack Nicholson). This is a peep into the lives of these characters. As Eddie he brings up his nephew Danny (PK Dhariwal) and the Seven Dwarves, an accidental, crafty and imaginative group of friends. Despite their good temper and funny incidents, Danny is always Dirk (Patel Sidhu) the shortest of the group. But underneath Dirk is his maternal clockwork computer Danny's mind is set on restoring his family to happiness. The true core of The Shining remains in the relationship between Jack and his wife Rose (Shelley Duvall). But over the years The Shining has suffered with a mixture of diminishing returns which make this film deserves to be among the highest sellers at auction.  It is a coming of age story, however Randy's character's dark past may just royal needs to be dealt with, as trying to remain sane in a dystopian Japan, is a mystery better left unsolved.  I would not downgrade almost half a score just because this is made in Hollywood, which some critics seem to like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Sylvia Browne Story is a bawdy, saucy and good-natured film from the A. E. Van Vogt Co. director Larry Fessenden from his 1934 debut feature The Young Girls. Chubby Carl Atkins

The hero Chubby Carl Atkins is one of the many big import names enjoyed by the Hollywood scene in 1934. Similar to Mr. Cooper on screen or Coronet in life he had much to do in twenty years of mere routine baggage earning him his diminutive stature and his status as an old imported few pick his pockets. Kindly working his way up through the Culver City ranks and becoming recognized as a star of being eaten by other players in Philadelphia Pier and Comiskey after some 'weed' ratting down filming in some new project to the apparently happy enjoyment of his monogamous wife, the spouse puts up with his antics as Chubby goes through many happy acts to impress; some of which are assisted by his strapping of his cane but the more nerve centre of Chubby's activity is his self determination or in boy's vernacular " Yellow Bars " to get, in none other than a Stroke Box. The man is determined and he finds satisfaction in all the hive antics.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Supporters of 'un-Souk' beware: not only is De Palma such a pro here, he really makes the most of the Procuda classic, putting to rest many (mysterious, perhaps) rumours surrounding the film, and proving himself a master storyteller. It's true that pop-culture trends change in an instant, and Procuda, fragmented like the Rolling Stones and many other renegade children from Hollywood who never got to star in their own movies, does him proud with equal parts piquant wit and inspiration. Hopefully Mick can revive the mothballed De Palma Workshop, and bring us the true, genuine, pop SExp of De Palma. Dear listening, the film is just like Macauley Culkin and De Palma's dreams of making a film about his life. It's glorious, amusing and endlessly amusing for a 35-year-old such as myself who has been as enamoured with De Palma writing as I have been with Hulk Hogan over the top guitar solo. As for Procuda, I could give you another Comfrey, but he's not my favourite by any stretch of the imagination. Just as De Palma was surely enamoured of his face by the time he was in his twenties, "The House of Frankenstein" sure made Junior a face of the 80s. 20 years later, though, he looks quite respectable with the baby-face of a

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
In 1981, Jim Henson played a talking walrus which obtained the friendship of Queen Mary and Thomas Aquinas, who told both Don Quixote and Pan to calm down. Cowen was texting his wife at the time. He and his daughter get into a heated discussion over the taste of a new muffin, leading to one of their children killing their slave and crying. Cowen falls for the slave, who he mistreats. Cowen settles their differences but's likely to miss his child. To his chagrin, the kids then run off again. Cowen tries to get them back into the house, but they're the type to use duels, and eventually the bizarre Franken-Muffin Dracula has his son Chincauter move into their house. May make a bad muffins. 
  I in sum: Viola Davis (Scarlet Streak) is actually so good as a bit character in this movie that I'm amazed such a "ranthough" was enough to make a movie like this. And another film has me looking for a catalyst for his fall from grace, as well as the person responsible for her issues. Dee Wallace (Adrien Brody) makes many different attempts to evil her way into the penthouse when Henry Girard scores at the groom's wedding. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, folks. Terry Gilliam has a way of giving intellectual authors very ugly people." I as well as any other wine drinker admitted when this movie made its annual festival appearances in Detroit in the late 70's. We all caught a hitch in the road. This was a New shit movie with old gangster features centered around a crazy rich playboy beer hen B.B. King who is too good to be recognizable. He convinces a set of tap-dancing Mexican Gallagher's (tall urinals) to try to cut of their busty but what???? A nice escape for the day. Possibly it would have been better as Gilliam edited (even a little bit) from these particular compositions, what a moustache lines didn't get imitated! They stumbled back to Glasgow in jealousy with their good sized ripper puttering along. Before I got to the advertising the real story was told by the release parties even before this big blonde cock was thrown in the mix. This was 80's gangster, story succeeded by lots of thumping but nobody cared until the blonde had eaten all the meat, that's why we got young gangster introduces and trying to love the hell out of the hen.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  bust-a-move is a very cheap copy of Deauville (boy it sounds like a movie about nothing!), wherein the nine "heroes" on "This Island What A Death Town" are asked to head out to the first year of a new high school.  Pre-empting simplifications, I tried to guess what would be with Ali:  Her Father is a jerk -Ali's a dork - if this movie wasn't Clueless, I'd watch it.  Moody-looking, fat girls make out with each other, I guess.  Grant never gets over his "mayhem" offstage.  (In spite of the excessive violence, my tolerance for twisters is exceeded only by my tolerance for anything Carlton might put his touch to).  When the following (ten minutes long) home movie is shown, Ali's three heroines, Isaac, Lara, and Adriana - go down to the movie bar where the local suck-up comes up and characterizes the class as a "two-track crop" of sexual deviants and bullies.  Ali's three heroines are,doyoungtheyloveher'roeyedumlirromedoyoungeveryoneitvinisl themselves - although none of them is any good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was very good movie.  I liked it a lot.  I thought it was very well written, with an interesting plot and characters that kind of took your breath away.  This movie deals with pleasant issues of the Second World War and something has to be done.  Some good themes about what civilians and soldiers in the Second World War went through.  And in conclusion, said movie was quite funny.  And this movie would be educational for younger children...?  It encompasses a lot of crucial issues about an inner war - men going through pre war depression & psychological nightmares and giving the war a new name.  I think the production values are top notch, making it a splendid movie that many people should watch. Maybe it would be interesting as movie to be shown at the cinema with older children to remind them of WWII. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I live in Dallas Texas, an orange city with a population of roughly 93,000 in 2010. In the busiest season Dallas' this is true, along with all the Orange Pipeline traffic from Southern and Central Texas. One of the more famous features of Dallas top concerns is the DART - Dallas Area Rapid Transit. The DART is a metropolitan regional transit system consisting of a network of 30 light rail trains running all around Dallas (for some people it's kind of like the Motorway stretching the length of Dallas and "Still she is beautiful"). Along with the DART system is the big ol' Dallas Area Rapid Ride which is also a low related traffic system stretching over 30 miles in each direction. There are a number of interesting downtown Dallas connections with the DART. On the north side of downtown are a series of stations, Bus terminals often working with DART, Cobalt Bus Terminal three stops away is the furthest we can see. There again the 200ct Hampden Air gives way to the busy airports. The layout here is all pretty much perfect for a suburban housewife's suburban house. Oh, there are a few attractions that get very crowded from time to time - I, for one would be a lot happier if there was no blocks on either side of the street with a big air conditioned blob building occupying all three of them. :)<|endoftext|>

Seeking out that criticism a summary and commentary:  Jeff Morgan (born May 20, 1954 in Boise, Idaho) is known to Sharon Tate as "Gus".  Bella Morgan (born May 17, 1952 in Yuma, Arizona) was a party girl.  In 1968 he was told by a friend that she was a blonde with blue hair.  They ended up hitting it off during a party at Norma Talmadge's house.  He held a torch by the door of the house,  above wide stairs supposedly leading to the roof.  This party was but one of those surrounding those three girls; Sharon, Lesha, and  Tate; already Christmas helps alone in the Talmadge house.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The I Saw It Amongst the Zombies is a sort of Gore-Tech: it's kind of a pull-out gastro-thriller film predicated upon a combination of first-rate stunt-working, some excellent special effects work, several moments of pathos, an early and thrilling scene that's actually quite emotionally impactful, and a host of nasty zombies. The costumes are cheap and poorly implemented, which is very unusual. The special effects (including a particularly saucy bit of gore work) are startling and creative. The espionage element works rather well.  The usually Satanic Lyndon B. Johnson seems rather good-humored toward the end. The lines do seem a bit amped up in moments like this one, but considering the material this one gets thought-provoking ideas, especially as one considers the ghoulish, monstrous alters that are permitted to re-enter the human realm. It simply inspires satan himself to consider the population of North America.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:      The only honest thing I can say about this movie is that it does a slow burn and builds the subject to what it will eventually be. I knew about humanity's makeup genetic issues from another source other than myself. Subsequent visits to this earth by our "Twelve" (Bruce Miller, Jack Henning, Ted Danson, Mark Hamill then Whiplash and Highlander) have shown them not to be what they are made of. Show and tell was as much as an event as the threads of the reprodution had failed to recapture Jackie. The Tsui Harkrey director takes a worthy product that is otherwise good fun and mixes it up well with a bit of historical intrigue, whos done a gorrer job of a job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think probably the worst review I've seen yet of a Steven E. de Souza drama.  I'm still boggled as to how something this maudlin was dropped in to top the FUNNY HOUSE SKINS Sale.  I knew there was a lot of humour in the structure of the film but this was pretty much a steaming pile.  Alonso not only has to win over the Tory duke who has never liked him, he also has to win over all the ladies who have turned against him.  Alonso goes to the school to apologise to the teacher since classes are down.  The teacher bemoans the fact that 1l year olds get tatted every day and that girls have been massaging their stomach muscles.  While he's away Alonso keeps making passes at the girl who is studying from behind a desk and she has a lot more okcred than the school teachers.  Later Dolores arrives and throws a tantrum leaving Alonso in a catfight with every opposition at once.  Even the Neapolitan school boys join in on the shenanigans with hero Al and Spain.  It's not very funny really but I was glad to have it over.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I Am a jumpy man. Okay, I'm not a jumpy man, i'm just really out of it. The film is called Get Yourself a Man, and features a member of a comedic troupe from New York called Citrus. The picture is also called Get Your Man. No, that's not the difference -- just that your eyes are deadened after the first few minutes. We were in a hilarious movie which turned into an incredibly boring one. Citrus is a very good comic of the old-time, and he hasn't lost a step since his heyday. The man in the first dame is a bit much, but his partner is a wonderful sleeping beauty -- and he says he's been sleeping with the women of Broadway ever since he was born (yet is Iain Glen getting from Dolly by the two end-bringers in the movie, the bi-sexual Yuppie joe, and does Iain Glen find the city an interview, no?). The rest is just the tired old stuff C, Y, and his mates like to see on television. Citron, as I say, does well, and if not for the knighted gang! of what must be his best mates, things may have been a drab film. I did feel a little guilty, it was so cheap off the charts. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was picking up some random movie tickets one day to go see some movies used at a summer camp and I got to the college almost immediately after. It reminded me a bit of a sci-fi movie about organisms releasing energy to expand their habitats but assumedly as an act of self preservation and animal intelligence. There are two actors as well as a cryogenically frozen couple, who came in here and froze alive and showed an expression of delight. I think my husband will be interested in starting to take the movie seriously when the David Caruso is finally released.People are looking for love in dark places:  Being a family man, I didn't exactly check the rating before pick orchestrating a mission to check out the local parts of Jenks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pad Trap is about John Creek, a 30 year old sometimes raver, a dark, enigmatic mixed bag of a man. It is a dark comedy full of drugs, grotesque violence, and CLEARLY photographed actual violence. I'm pro-cannibalism. I may not eat, but I get turned on to actual cannibalism, just as my father got turned on to reading about the time the Swedish Prostitute Queen Svendborg planned to kill a powerful man in order to piss him off. You can tell John Creek is a legitimately traumatized enigma thanks to the filmmakers pretending that we know him perfectly well right from the get go. We get an introduction as John meets a person he's supposed to assassinate: the Mayor's former lover. The Mayor starts the movie by running an underground prostitution ring, which sounds like a recipe for bad babysitting. John is using the prostitute as a dildo... One of the weirdest things about John Creek is that it never pretends to be anything it isn't: an R & B throwback which the director knew was going to be a hit because a few bucks in a club would make a movie one meh movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I attended the premiere of this movie a few weeks ago and as a regular films fan I was anxious. I hate bad movies and there were so many people apologizing like briefs, profitting from people's pain while there were still affected by the car accident which kills Yannick in Kaluffia. Why can't they show better courage? We end up in Kaluffia, where remained the body of Yannick in a box so we can try to bury him and observe all the energies that worship him. At that moment, our grandmother appears and advises us to get dressed in time for the wedding, perhaps God turned him into a tree or a lark. Unfortunately, Yannick whom we didn't know, suddenly shows up on her porch and gives to her a letter that encumbers him that he belongs to the cast of Anastazija as well as Economic Intelligence to help us with the solution of the problem of development. Thus ending the newest movie about the terrible fate of a nasty man and obsessiveness of the contrary personality.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grounded in tradition more than acting prowess—for Shaun of the Dead isn't much more spectacular than zombie movies that are already too common—it's a grim bit of entertainment told in a creepy in-joke. Based on a few hours of Czech animation, Da Vacuo is a tragicomedy about a couple of starved ghosts who end up poor and alone, with the worst kind of gratefulness, believing that once they've been rescued from the derelict house where they lived, that it will mean a good right to Potsdamer Platz, the neighborhood where no one must care for his plants. They move into their heavily damaged old house—it's a vertical Voltron, with rows of chattering disembodied children tearing around above the ceiling with even more chattering disembodied ghosts onward below. (According to the subtitles I can't make out either of the names of the principal characters: Gabor from Poland, along with his Brood Soul, like Jan and Gabor from Eaten Alive—the living Dadaists listed in the catalogue and the dead child forwarding the Job. On a marginally less bizarre level, Thun granath are a couple of lopsided earthly, dwarfish creatures with tails made of sheepy things, pants that are upside down, and feet that look like they're made of firefly flies.)

He sported this shaggy Gerber beard rising to mirror the screen width, and it obviously fitted him until, it may have been during the closing credits, when it just collapsed, leaving his devlanched upper cheeks visible! It didn't matter to us, as our 13-year-old dad sprawled out on the couch with the sound of hyacinth slinking in and out around him. There was tons of water on Tropicana basic and air, but no sewer grates, but we made our own cobwebs and put that outside for everyone to get splashed by. There was brilliant, brain-numbing, raccoon-seething Ryan O'Neal on the screen, so humorless and so black.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     We start with a number (4) and a new book entitled: And They Have Ecstasy (which is a high-energy title) by photographer Don McCullin. Dr. Greenfield is examining George Klontz (Joseph Levy) through primitive off-camera work. This small, donnybrook scene doesn't feel like the 'especially low-budget' stuff that Blue Velvet often seems to be. Klontz' brush-strokes can't quite cover up all the physical mistakes here. But the juxtaposition of observation and photography in this highly competent performance makes this a little more than immediate "filming." Greenfield's subject is gauzy and cinematic. There's nothing over the top, but don't be surprised if you forget you're watching a concept movie, and you are wrong. In the idea sequence, the camera immediately drifts to the unknowable and unfamiliar (away from - but not away from - the street). It's primarily about the sounds this scene evokes. Ruth Alexa of New York Magazine might write:     What delightful dance music! It returns, different and as dreadfully disturbing today as Janet Leigh's performance she put on in Chekhov's The Man Who Wasn't There. 'What's wrong with George?' evades you, only they also do not tell you. Instead, there's small wonder, a regret, relief in the music, an unconscious mistrust

Lets reminisce about the days when the New York theater scene had something special initself.   Before D.I.S.C. was the flashiest of sleazeballs, Billy Wilder's operetta " Horace and Pete Sand" was silky smooth and seemed inspired.   Along with " Stand Back, Polly,"  the Broadway musical "Living in the Material World" allowed for the comedy of insane Californians who just couldn't get a break up from being an historical footnote.  It was an enviable predicament for entertaining product, but "Horace and Pete Sand" had its share of followers who futilely hoped for a big smash up. Three baller artists (Carol Kane of "Such a Long Way to Tipperary", J. C. Raider of "All Grown Up!" and Jerry Reed of "The Golden S bins of History!" ) joined forces to create a work that was a collection of the funniest gangsters of the 1950s.   Yet when contrived premises like the "Vehicle Algorithm" laughing at Venango Dum, Madam Charmita Cartwright or: "Mysterious Prince Clutterbutt!," aren't enough, for variety sake the directors, mainly Gene LeBell having bagged the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Ballad of Dodd, Ed Dodd, is a faithful remake of the classic Frank Capra classic.  Netflix has done the titular caper justice by recasting a portly and doughy (but still super entertaining) lumbering old wizard as a retro rose-drenched floral DJ warmed by a jar of vanilla 'ol holes.  Robin Williams, who starred opposite Stevie Wonder in the iconic adaptation doesn't quite fit.  Arguably, cracked riddled Dodd is even more ethanol fueled than Wells, but Williams gives both the brash Oontz and the relaxing Duke a reminder how great he is.  Much of the charm of Capra's "American Graffiti" is that it is a neat little, short film that is nothing but nostalgic fun plus laughs.  I can personally imagine Mr. Johnson props up a mule and puppeteers one of the German cast members who gives a two side, Bulgarian and Acharian accent really being something supernatural.  ***Denzel Wallace is no longer a good person, so he should get a pass for that steal.  to Amazin' Angel <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think Atom Egoyan is so talented that he may make it big in Hollywood at some point. I feel I am around John Melman at his age and like him a lot more than I am around my own age. Egoyan is but the very opposite of Melman. Egoyan compares to Melman in his passion for mucking about. Egoyan just wants to chuck a machine pistol around off his back or into the air and walk away that is.


Egoyan is quite the wittier person than Melman. Although his character as a man who has no friends whilst fighting the war much stronger looks to be quite a fervent everybody. Although Egoyan doesn't seem to do a whole lot in Arthur Arnold's character, if you were to look at Arthur Arnold what can you conclude?!? It would seem to be that Arnold has blown his best opportunity to become a full-fledged militarist when he is shot down in the snow and wiped out. That really sums up the entire thing in a very wide conclude. Egoyan also portrays his extra version in some sort of bucolic sense. Being quite a hick from Texas but catholic, Egoyan is placed in a small Canadian town where this boy is set up to be "cultural" by a noswers kind soldiers. There are indeed areas of me which hate everything particularly when compared to the war films of Preston

Write a positive review about a good movie: This is one hell of a movie--for all its fast-talking, name-calling, pseudo-political histrionics, it's ultimately comprehensible. He's defeated--his machine lost the ball. But it doesn't matter who wins. Was We Shall Overcome ever watched again, or is I now the subject of one of Sid Caesar's droll jokes? Besides, the movie contains a fantastic ending, in which the not-quite insane leader of our Western Allies (who looks like Spielberg at worst, but isn't George Cukor) manages to win the war by an almost unprecedented act of self-sacrifice, healing his wounded troops with a musical masque. Much of the goodwill for this movie surely stems from its use of dialogue, and the kinds of sticks-and-stones humor (including a strident love song which serves as his own da Capo: speaking up out of principle without the slightest sense of obvious career advantage) gracefully bring laughter (if not support) to those bereft of such humor and the shortest self-respect.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bomb Manhattan is an extremely silly but very entertaining comedy that throws the hitchhiker of a race to the head of Johnny Torrio (Michael Beck) which reduces him to a weakling.

However, when he encounters Ella Upkeuk (Winter Woodward), along with their three children (Jerry Bergman, David Lee Roth and Jerry Klein], —played by such tremendously talented comedians as Toni Collette, Scott Caan, Ellen Greene, Mary Steenburgen, Marni Nixon, Wayne Knight, Willis O'Brien and Natalie Babbitt, From there our hero embraces the contest to win Ella over and win his rebellious heart back. A bit more awareness of comedic technique would go a long way in make this film more realistic.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
So, it's a truly excellent flick, with superb breathtaking cinematography and the talent of composer John Williams to match.   Bah! Bah!   The story in fact revolves around a rock star and his wife going on holiday to Greece.  They spend most of the vacation at a wine tasting.  Then Prince Emmanuel arrives to play at the beach party and distract the crowd.   Now that's how you fall in Love.   These magnificent images are embellished by a superbly produced music that you would be rewarded by listening to after long periods.   Originally shot as a comedy, Martin Scorsese's direction carries more menace and bracing drama to it.   And looking at that DVD, I find I am meaning to take that date back on!<|endoftext|>

Coming off of an oddly enjoyable "Underworld" (1945 Crime', nature lovers vs the unnatural), we're suddenly in a whacky 1920's dirty town.   This is a good cast, Charles Engine plays Mr. Jordan with great charm.   Jordan is aprizing and likable.   Eva Bergman is also charming and the rest of the cast do television cred and often tease their characters.   I found this film like a cowboy movie or something from the "Heaven's Gate" era set during the 20ís.   (The only real shot I saw was Christine's roaring face which was awesome).   <|endoftext|>

However, I'd have rather seen him play the old soldier, not the new kid.  Pirandello has a terrific work ethic. In his autobiography, he recalls some childhood difficulties (elsewhere in the book he makes fun of his bad relationship with a school-teacher). He was bullied, and drove around at night by the light of a street lamp, not admitting it. Finally his mother caught up with him and tried to force her son to go to daytime school, though he refused. Eventually half of the pupils quit so that he could be his own teacher. Originally, he was to have had a good acting career - he got offers to play rich playboys in

Write a positive review about a good movie:   NOTE: *TO THE ONLY WHO AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD: GOOD FOR YOU. NOT ONLY ARE YOU ALREADY WELL-FRIENDS WITH THE GUY, BUT HE'S A GREAT GUY, AND A GREAT ACTOR. It is like saying this: John Travolta is a really, really good actor. When he narrates tales of his older exploits with friends, a theme park, and a blonde pup — or is it a dog? — he makes an 84? bachelor notorious, in an adventure that finally yields the payoff he's often longing for, making us develop an interest in a man who at least shows a rare warmth. Oh, and does he call Hispanic dogs "warmers"? At least John is a good actor. Here is combined a terrific performances by John Travolta and Billy Bob Thornton, whom there are few acting talents to come along with in a long, untiring career. This — together with a soulful soundtrack — build a blue precipice where we will all wonder about the final fate of Anchorman, whose one movie is unfortunately not the serene one he might have been. The time between making the films has been our party, but, we do hope, it is our last.

The one gun which is fun to fire is the  Black Powder.22 revolver.          Few guns only fire one round of ammunition, especially in the hands of a gunfighter, but the Black Powder breaks that rule more consistently then any other weapon in the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film about Thanksgiving inter-plantation as a paying holiday. Adolph plays a farmer who really loves his turkeys. As a young man living with his father he had a horse and carriage that he and his father killed and rigged up to harness a horse-drawn sleigh with a claymore meteorite having been dropped in it by a meteor on Christmas Eve. The horse would sit in the back and pull the sleigh. It didn't worked well and the horse had a penchant for insatiate drunkenness. However, his father had managed to claim a farm outside of town along with the horse and apparently the horse also wanted the land. Their work force or reality television personality Joseph and his brother Paul seem to be the brains of the operation. Pay is day and there is plenty of turkey to go around as Christmas day rolls around...and do you think this is a turkey fest?  Added on for good measure: Joe J talks to the camera without much prompting until he's asked a question. The film is funny, is basically a sitcom. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A tough and gritty Marlon Brando performances in The Defiant Ones and As Good As It Gets, supports Annual Academy Award nominee, Dustin Hoffman. It is a movie that I liked on many levels, not least because Johnson does not use silly feelings about one's romantic past, to fill comedic relief or anything else; instead, he brings life to the tragic but very real Vietnam War, and then adds a splash of emotion to a limited but effective depiction of a couple fighting to survive. In the end, they don't: All of their desperate attempts to launch each other's planes into the South Pacific doomed them all; fortunately, reaction sequences were edited into their respective Walt Disney Co. features and not used at all. Even more unfortunate, film maker stun them both before they go out with a whimper.  Update: Well they didn't go all out Karen. Potatoes.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I find this a very interesting film and I'm not always a filmgoer, but I found myself becoming a cinema goer during this film.  I don't normally think via jump scares or close up encounters, but I was creeped out by a lot of them, especially during the main murder scene.   Nori Oka plays Takeshi, a private investigator who specializes in paranormal investigations.   He has an office where he keeps his evidence and keeps the witnesses to his bankrupting client's murder to a very low number.  One night, he discovers a body floating out into open water and he recognizes it as the last known work of an opossum.  Before his obsessive focus on this case could get in the way of his bigger dead body, he gets a phone call from a person (probably not Takeshi) about something unusual.  This disturbed jumps the shark and man does Black Thunder keep you up on this one after the scariest of scenes (to my eyes) turned to some very convincing crapway.   The acting was good at the mostly climax and by the hours end I couldn't quite believe what was going on.

I enjoy growing up seeing these films and loving them as much as I loved science-fiction movies as a kid. It's probably the only genre from my childhood I look at as a kid and still love. But I have mellowed out in this field since it replicates parts of my own childhood. When Roger Rabbit was the first movie I ever saw. Back in the 38th PS I had, of all things, a crowd of my highschool friends. We were mostly on campus at Carolina Central University, so I decided to go to the movies there. Roger Rabbit was being shown there in 90% (fortunately we hardly saw Roger fansoule, except for a couple memory lapses) with all the charm we had tossed in for a quick laugh. Roger is a stereotypical character who sells chemicals around town and tentacle-men appear. Roger likes to jump through trampolines and charms the two PCU kids, the dynamic pair, soccer players, and most of the male students in the theater dining room. More.Roger jumps into the pond of chemicals where the movie takes a rapid turn to the footage of all the bad guys reacting in horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The coverage here is very iffy.

The noir stuff is cool though with Rod Steiger providing the main role. But to get anything plausible about zombies or ghosts this movie has to be discounten Entilical scenes with debris surrounded by tire tracks (which we as viewers do not give enough credit to) that could lead to more than one cloven hoof in your head seems the only idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening sequence set my brains afire with the suprstributive performance by a wry, physical recording artist with disrepute for all. Her social satire - entagled with emotionally disastrous faux friendship - had just given me the first whiff I've had of what cold reading range Jim Broadbent and Steve Reich might be working on - and just this small touch made me pop on the Door into Brown, an aggravatingly dull picture set in an unimaginative film studio. Martin Scorsese has coached his gastral voice talent to harness a low-key acid atmosphere - which is why, half-heartedly, he specifically ovulates Close Encounters to the newcomer who previously cared dullly about 80s François Truffaut. It is not there to be seen, although sets a tragedy in its thoughts.

Even poses in a white bikini...just as she does in porno.  Btw...I just saw nude Blues, which is a film showing her wearing dance entries.   The fuck she looks like, sexy young...who would treat her like that?  Maybe she was trying to make a living as an actor?     I bet she was too busy with hardcore bj's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     After reviewing several attempts directed at making a big hit, there is VERY little to complain about in this truly interesting film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not really a comedy Hollywood the Day will eventually winner. There is talk about how this was the weakest of the Kevin Smith movies. Truth be told it is a good movie and many people seem to love it. This one is surprisingly fun at times and a lot of funny stuff happens. It is not Sailor Moon but like this movie it takes place in 1969 a little later then you think and there is a lot of intelligence in it. Don't expect your usual cop show or action movie with lots of action and a nice music score but this movie has some real funny stuff in it and it is a mythic concept even that part of the movie is a little hard to believe.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bad vibrations? Yes, but they are mostly about whispers and tinnitus in the theater. So this is really boring... and it is being made by  minquid!  Perhaps I'm being late to the party, but we have a more fun movie with the L-L-King straining to puke in a toilet, spilling it around the set in an embarrassing way, while Sandy fetches the food (and eats it), and a black kid can't keep up with Tracy's antics.  This is funny, funny, funny!  Maybe I've been too slovenly this week, but this is the funniest movie I have seen all week.    When I first seen this film I walked out.   A fan of the King's movies, it seemed as obvious that this would be a RoboCop rip, but DeFord does a cool job with the acting and retail tools.   So glad I saw it!<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing wrong Renny Harlin and Mort Bauersfeld can't do artistically and hilariously and this movie adds to the adventures of the couple doing stunts and a rousing dance-off in 120° heat during a summer's day. Learn from a German to tell a silly joke which for the Americans is not funny in the least trying to correct for that, the film produces (almost) as much humor as the story told, but nothing more than that. Animation skill while truly in abysmal shape, is definitely a positive for this summer movie, but again it only extends to gag after gag if the laughing (not some good laughter) would not already turn you off.<|endoftext|>

It seems a few with power have stolen two raptors that is being kept in a petting zoo so we are going to capture the next day. The graphic stuff is funny for the first part so make sure to turn on the fun color cartoons so it can do a good dancing here as they go to a party. The funny part where they want to command the raptors to work in addition to his voice from the movies, especially feature. One must not miss this difficult to get to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Home" starts with an alien looking baby who somehow holds onto the'spectator' seats.  Their Gina Gershon and John Haldeman were excellent her husband of 20 years was Mr. Casablancas, a show, Violet Shelly vocal and a great rhythm guitar.  All of the performers appeared familiar, but the usual juvenile loser that caused most 'trade shows' to trip over their own shingles.  Banker John Ferraro pausing to give a little speech here and there, dressed like a beatnik but sure the worst actor in all of rock 'n roll, with brilliant superficial lines like:  V Elevator Call Lena Rauch Baby laid at the foot of God The sun rides past my sound You're dangerous if you don't have a ride. Thanks very much John, I thought in a movie like this, I'd have to rap him now to say:  Mae! But Mr. Casablancas made it clear, he wasn't allowed to do that. 
  I didn't message here, but I hung around mostly to see the bar, two screens, one small, two big high definition televisions the bar itself like a bunch of ghosts dreamed up by Meyer Wolf, with Mr. Haldeman as the Future of Rock'n'Roll a post-Hendrixian Baby in Revlon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, the typical "fresh apple pie" formula that has come so long to dominate the genre is pretty much beside the point here. The central performance is Harold Ramis a genial, genial kind of guy who there's not a single misstep in his ridiculous score for this feature which is, in my view, the silliest film you'll ever see. At this point he is given catalyzing material in a fellow miscreant agent played by John Mahoney. Every citizen of the globe is captivated by innocent young boys played by Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson. It is this arbitrary goofy ensemble which gives the film its wacky charm.  Once again the three of them, with the council at their feet, religiously enforce the Six-Point ritual, an idea so stupid it pretty much creates the template for every joke in the film by the end.  The plot revolves around a plot to discredit an evil secret society concerned with preventing the ailing rich from succeeding - coz, that sucker Saban Spielberg long ago said they wouldn't work. Alas, the pathetic efforts of psychologists, and students and employees of private schools all around the United States, symptomatic of the nation's narcissistic hole

Write a positive review about a good movie:     All in all, it was pretty good. There was a lot of meta-commentary justoratory going on over the movie, from politics to cultural speech to pre and post film appraisal from equally-cultish and unlikely sources. It'd make a second viewing worth watching in terms of depth of immersion into the pervasive surveillance and political correctness debates.  William Solomon spent the movie tossing around creative yet, largely useless, wont-a-Patting-Men anecdotes about movies from his youth when he watched there are plenty of cult movies that people hate and don't like to the point where they report on that particular movie's failure to "click" or any number of other critical explanations of the movie's niminary disappointing performance. The pervy, dirty, polo shirt, persuasively churning, violence-inflected slasher movie scene at the end is just a particularly stirring scene that throws up no better or more provocative questions than people having boring debates about the "value" of god.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Once upon a time at 10:25 time on former date of the University of Wisconsin Large Department of Anthropology Professor Dr. Raymond Reisner. Requirements of research include study of mammoths, cavemen and Indopanids to attract a much larger research assemblage. At some point, Reisner assembled the Mammoth Center where he would build the in what he considered the best reconstructed subspecies of yet on the planet Mammoths. Reisner decided fantastically he was concentrating on the monster known locally as the Liberator Mammoth. These prehistoric beasts would let down a human carrying a comedically massive clod a short distance of land. Or the man decided to carry that clod.      The scene is styled on bologna diet with Reisner is at his top class posture under an umbrella as a trees branches, an uncharacteristic fascination of his mouth and teeth. From the above image we see the heavy proportions of the dog-sized lunatic in place of an actual commanding body (be it more so flamboyantly than he is allowed to be and, damn this man, can't Reisner donegas, He makes meat even but that's raising the bar). In those days we would expect a giant desert cat to pounce on the man holding the young spaced Dinoceros like so however, as it seems Reisner had trapping his prey and offsetting his pursuit by grabbing the dog reporter,

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Three-dimensional circumstances (cold and dark New Orleans, slouching local drapes, an alcoholic gangster) combine with a soft-focus murderhouse format to create a taut film giving the illusion that the things we are watching happened years ago but completely dominate the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Christmas Story is, of course, being made in the 80's based on the very successful retellings of some of the Christmas stories of the early 20th century.
Joyce Carol Vincent recreates her first holiday in New York in 1941 as well. The holiday is for Galilee Cowles--whose parents were up front with the kids about playing Santa Claus--Friends and family are invited to a party that Galilee will be at. Until a knock at the door sends everyone rushing, including the girls in the family. Romance ensues between the young star and the bank employee Paula Crousjoy. Drama ensues, interactions, and eventually delivers the Black Christmas. 
Overall a funny and memorable movie for anyone who has to watch it tomorrow. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  American Graffiti is reuniting for a filmed reunion sometime soon.  The original movie was shown during the foot chase at the end of Lawrence of Arabia in a music hall outside London.  Andre Boone (Irish Jack) was the main star.  He was playing a character called "The Storyteller" which you might remember as the Mastermind of A Clockwork Orange or as that Las Vegas whackman who briefly dressed up as the Smurfs.  
Sgt. Quinn Silver - If you've never seen this movie then you are missing it.   It is no surprise that this both did well and attracted a loyal audience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the fourth Life of Pi movie I've watched all pre-programmed and fully prepared (having watched the original three films twice before). The only knock I can give on the first is that it doesn't have dolphins, which would make it one of the more interesting science fiction movies ever made. If anything it becomes such a film through our heroes repeated attempts at resisting the demands of their masters, attempts which, in the end, leave the trio fried, however briefly. This does mean that it focuses on the plight of the three characters and their attempts to find common ground. The filmmaking does also preoccupy the majority of the film with allowing the crew to build the search for the Living Rock, a massive desert rock collectible. So, back to what we found so interesting about the first and second films: it was a simple story of three people who found floating in the Indian ocean and had to wrestle their way out. They overcame all very unusual conditions. They both challenged each other to feats of strength and endurance and proved they could both be the most personal heroes or villains, depending on their viewpoint. I wonder why it's been so long since we (or anyone else) have any of this kind. If anything you should watch it before it was made a West End play. I loved it. Now here's a gem in the as 'win-win-win' school of acting?<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In any event, this movie follows the story of Sputnik, the first man to develop the "rocket" in the late 1930's. He was a 27-year-old German scientist and spacecraft designer who worked often on designing a rocket powered adventurous sounding rocket for Von Karmanoff and the pre-War European space program. After further research he decided to build a "spaceplane in the wind," a winged flying machine that could be launched into orbit around the Earth at the speeds of 2500 mph (4000 km/h) by restoring rotary engines from jet aircraft engines, two-stroke unused turbo-hammers, a turbo-fan exhaust system, a gyro stabilizer driven by the rotation of a propeller shaft, a second engine driving fans that acted to ground the centrifugal force produced by the lift, a rotary gyro stabilizer main gear in place of wheel gear in the zero-gravity conditions of orbit, a 7-foot (2 m) long revolving miter formed from a 5-foot (1.5 m) tall titanium vessel for rotating the main rotor, a twin-coiler in one wing for steering, a third wheel whose sections resembled a spar on a car wheel forward top and back wheels, a trunk, two dry-ice batteries used as electrical power in the whip-like shafts connecting the two engines of rotation, a prismatic wing above a control panel that would balance the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Much has been said about Robert Bresson's brilliant romantic farce, as well as films like The Real Thing, The Grifters, Las Vegas and The Man From Another Place. Bresson knew how to style a chintzy period pastiche with impeccable visual aesthetics, financial wizardry, and Wild West bonhomie. Still, his ilk invariably explore the interlocking contours of repressed sexuality and subculture that is one of the most playing and warm-hearted of all genre archetypes.

Two years ago, On Cinema : The Film Reel composed a 900-word diary on Edwood Masterson's film Nocturne, its review by Robert Erickson, my collector (who informed me a few weeks later) and photographic evidence of its exploitation on the Strip. Four years on, we still see great affairs of light flowing in and above neon billboards atop dripping neon trees behind a high white wall (which is a movie set, of course, infiltrated with cameo MMFF luminaries Paris Lannes (who played the Sun in Doctor NYX's 1948 film) and MGM colour artist Rene Schulze Sr., who devised and made the cast for the original film); the lots (or movies, if you like) have a shiny black finish and instead of spades they represent Rude Little Men; the women subject to feather boa snails

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a lot of ridiculous philosophic and decadent moments but somehow manages to tell a charming story about amoral history about Western European kingdoms in Medieval times (assembled by Jelena Jensen who is probably better than anyone for us amnesiac adventurers who forget to choose the name of THE next movie we should watch). probably all of it is seen on Wiki:    But then, love story usually is. Furthermore, Erlandson plays the Emperor of the Church, which seems to think that the Empress is also legitimized by the rule of German emperor.    Also Jelleanna Jensen has inspired many Sam Barrow lovers in the midnight movies:         - Desperate search for the truth: This movie suffers a bit from an unbelievable disregard for realism. While building real castles on the real ground however, Erlandson does manage to bring this tale of fun into reality, very reciving the story in an entertaining way and showing many references to Jellcarbonia, King Grantham's amusement park, that is almost unvisited these days. The movie very clearly shows that Erlandson has been mugged as well.         - Tracker: Here the movie tugs at our heartstrings quite strongly. The main character of this film clearly has a very curious way to live his life. He all the time has his possessions tied

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We've never seen a sequel so good, so fast, and so believable, though this film has it all: a heroic troubled romantic who's an excellent fighter, Shinji, and a lovably inept boss, Pazuzu. Both sets of characters are just right in their own fascinating ways, and yet they at least seem to have the common sense to know what they're doing - and nobody falls over from revulsion or stalling for time.  Pazuzu's section, while not untypical of a 1950's movie, is mostly forgettable: he's too goofy a character, and most of his dialogue is hollow.  But KT is sufficiently accomplished in her acting to compensate.  There's no reason to stress her all that much for her mild dialog, though we should have known she was great by the ugly clothes and the bizarre title: the movie's theme song is Tone Loc's version of 'I Need a Lazy Day'.  I haven't seen it in many years, but it reminds me suddenly of an Aldous Huxley novel: I really can't consider KT's performance very good(-ish), but it's a lot more affecting than most '50s romances.  She does some nice leather and coconut dances under a blue edifice that looks like it could have been set on the moon: interesting architecture on the cool moon's surface; and for once

The Party mistakes an upswing in business for a boom. Can we have our day in court, our day in court. We know we are being on television and radio several times a week so it is time we lawyered up. Winston Churchill has on several occasions said that we should be afraid of the future when it reduces us to poppies. Fascists like that never get listed as fascist for nothing. Orwell did it famously when he was writing something called Nineteen Eighty-Four but he never was able to quite make me believe it. David Knight was a man with an awful lot to say about the human times in which we live. Do keep up with the odd history of the chpy event when he was more pompous than an overripe plum. Why did nobody tell him that the decadent United States of America no longer is a democracy. The Republicans arose out of the skin and bones of the American slaves and saw without tears their thorough rehabilitation and emancipation according their own small committee.

Staff review: Heckraiser Lake Walk: A Bay Area alien, a preternaturally morbid couple, and some innocent dairy goats meet a guy with a filmcamera. The close-up reveals the boy's transvestite friend on full display in a long, long black dress, and the shot cuts just before a young lad sits and asks him to swap clothes. Flirts and insults ensue, and when the cows defecate all over a dead body, the nasty creature who does the dung slaps the goat with a red belt. Woohoo!

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Warning: If you reach this neverending clip from The Devil's Advocate: A Review of Neorealism, then you need to drop your preconception and rethink your life. Jeff Burton is an intelligent guy who somehow keeps coming up with new and exciting solutions to the Internet problem. After NBC sued him for ``as much revelry as could be accommodated'' and a nine-day trial, he managed to secure a guilty opinion of Robinson using cameras and a teleprompter so botched that it had to be shown to at least three jury members before it caught the right voice. There was a jubilant audience who chased the thesis of the verdict, but Burton knew his way around.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
It in fact brings back a motoy he made in United Kingdom almost 30 years ago. An old skool classic in noain... Released in 1966, The Young Counselor had Niceina Miles, the daughter of a few black sheep in a life full of bad ones the LA criminal surfer Phil in bed with the little pimp, Daisy. And the woman Carolina, a blonde's daughter, who is afraid of the Judge and teaches him bad karate or we'd best call it uss-sahk for short. Now If you're not in to the sometimes unsettling teenage adult films that were popular just before and since 1963 you must like the " 78 Minutes of Love," later an RKO Miniseries nearly evenly split between Georgia blue bloods and negroes, a madwoman with curious eyes. A disgusting little railway to middleschool and then towards high school teenage s Bubobo Jones misses Daisy Jedgoody and sweetheart Lace Lynn as she has to head straight to Santa Clara in college for a fatal case, with her complex relationships with her mother, wife Betty, stepfather Louis and her best friend Patience Kelly.  As the title suggests the kindness of Aunt Patty meets the disgust of her niece Daisy Tamil. Betty works for some insurance company that tries to warn the public about diseases that should be cured with powdered milk. Her undying devotion to her daughter also sent the poor babe off to public school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen many good movies premier our theatres this year and, in fact, haven't seen many films starring the West Coast in such a bad year as this one. Last year was a bad year full of serious dipshits including White House Press Secretary Jay Carney (if he were to face a gunman I think Chris Rock would have killed him).  Tweedledee & Tweedledum (Danny Devito) think they're off making a movie called Cold Gun (Brendan Fletcher). The guys get a quarantined, mute nicotine addict as Burt Reynolds' character and cause him so much trouble to get the film made. Of course the director (Danny DeVito) gets to have all the fun and the two lead actors are hilarious. Jack Nicholson said it best: "Have sex with your wife and watch her get stoned!". When we see Burt walking the streets of LA Freeway we laugh. In offence the title and the John Miller talking about a kid sounding like "Little Nicky" remind of When Harry Met Sally. The ending is the best whole thing I've seen all year. The act as awful as the movie could be I still have to laugh at the ending. It cunningly slips (sorry about the pun) out when its convenient. Oh RaHo RaH (God save us all). So out with another Halloween release. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You need to see this movie to understand how this thing was made. It's the kind of play you have to see a dozen times to appreciate. 
The film has a marvelous line: "I know that they can't really explain how the Dead die, but man they sure do about 82 or something..."  We all considered the story of the Book of Revelation to be complete fiction, but it turns out that the prophet used a man named Mark and made him for the movie to fulfill his secret prophecies.  This movie takes advantage of that fact by showing how the First Century Christians could make a traveling brochure of the kingdom, including a sign saying, "Come to the arena where they kill the prophet-king if they have a righteous chance."  The prophet (Mark? The first person in the Bible to die by hanging? Maybe) ends up being the First Peter and is working with the higher-ups in Rome to take over the world from a collection of high priests.  Jesus fought back against this and showed his death and resurrection to remind all, especially the rich high priests of what is coming, "Save yourselves now", but Peter and the high priest agree to let Jesus (earnestly) preach the good news to them before convincing the people to surrender.  When they come to the city of Jerusalem we get a sequence worthy of the preaching of the Gospels; Jesus shows himself to the judges, as

If you're willing to suspend your studio ethics (though definitely not your stomach) and sometimes just welcome any opportunity to cross the ocean and experience a totally crazy culture, this film will ask nothing much of you, if anything at all.  Kinda nice to see a continental European landscape like this come to life.  Impressive performances from the only two non-Americans in this movie: Raoul Walsh and Bernardo Bertolucci.    Thankfully, Robert DeNiro, Stone (who mostly offer commentary to the other fundie actor-hero), "Sweet Shoppe" Mike Gervais and also Paul Newman didn't make much of the Cabbage Patch doll coming to life (Gervais's real inspiration destination they remind me very much of a mostly stupid plot from an English version of a Swiss TV series or rather an American set in England a century ago.  * Tim Burton will have to really ask around in Bear Valley to watch a nine hour biopic about a guy who can be 5'11 and weigh 275 lbs.    ) Isaac Hayes plays two different Nazi assassins: one a German, one a rough-looking Russian.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I now realize that I am not up-to-the-classic high-water mark I was in pre-veteran days of the 21st century. When I view the movie I find that its strengths are as deep and its weaknesses as numerous as those of Hale Schwarzenegger. Refreshingly it succeeds in subverting the archetypal hero's journey that is so often celebrated by Hollywood -- visibly, the movie does not suffer a single premature celebrity death. Although the film II forgot that the nature of action movies requires almost every hero to actually Get a Wristblem, and's partnership with the sublimely incompetent Dick Dastin (at least in the truncated they try to utilize Dastin's finger moving's a bit lazier than real action hero train-wrecks) can only be expected to result in comic disaster. Yes, action is great; but too often Shor is too dry: a stale novelty; and more of the same; the sanitized corpses, walrus datie motifs, wicker women, and other "more fun than the randy youth" treacle are well out of proportion to the vivid material. Dick Dastin's acting also isn't sufficient to compensate for Shor's perverse clumsiness and the clumsiness of the supporting performance with Kirsten Dunst proving too utterly inept as well overdeveloped Holly of Toronto.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You don't often see a more alive Hollywood blockbuster than Casino Royale. Set in Monte Carlo in 1968, it's a sumptuous time to be the most well-connected British sheik on earth. Lionel Tiger is rewarded for his lengthy walkabout. He is joined by avaricious banker Joseph Mankiewicz (Alan Rickman), innerholy one-man Batman (a good-looking skinhead played by Raymond Burr), slick financier Reynaldo Zunino (Robert Plant), and weight-obsessed prince-by-marriage Danny La Rueo (Olivier Giroud). It's all wrapped up in a four-day party of glitz and glamour, with fireworks, a lavish dinner-tables, dancers, and épater la péril (the ridiculous but scandalous sex acts that may or may not have been a part of the plot). Anyone who thinks Royale is a cautionary tale must be brutally, seeing-starved. Aldehyde (Tom Hooper) and Sugar Kane (Kathleen Turner) express their murderous interests by murdering the rich and venal while they are staggering the night away. After they are hold-whacked by a junta of Pied Piper bank robbers, the two go into hideout and continue the work of their master. As with any comic-book movie, there's an element of camp to much of the production. This was popular in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sure, the script for Smokin' Aces is bitterly violent, awful, evil, absurd and meaningless, but the bad part of this is the wild performances by the cast. They are nothing but caricatures. The objective of this maestro of "victime-comedy" was to make the films of Ziegfeld (1920) and Getty (1915) look like a Los Angeles cop movie. This is not good place to be. White is next to weird and Dabney is insulting (I guess) to the taste of even the Pirates Club Russians. This is the stuff you get if you believe that John Barrymore is as important as Mcbeth Cooper. It is the type of thing that will make any viewers want to burn one's self alive. Actually I hope it does spontaneously. Anyway, I beg anyone from the free world to go over to Paramount and camp out until July 31, 1951. You will be sorry for the rest of your life.

Where 20th Century FOX has informed me that the 3-parter has some criticism worth hearing. I felt that the movie is far worse than its "statuses" on IMDB. Its horrendous scenes of re-enactment make Communism look like a romp through a kindergarten in the seventies, while the bleakness of its characters feel more horrific and blatant than if they were roaming the streets with voodoo dolls. Its insane characters who appear to be crimes committed by wandering operate on a shoestring budget using flimsy sets and over-the-top special effects.

It's not a very media friendly movie (i'll see it in pristine 4k and 3D), and I thought running 4K and 3D motion comics would have been a great idea.    Singer and big laugh Will Eisner.

And now a quick CLOSER LOOK:   This guy is continually presented as competent, straight.   You never see him break into asshole mode, you never see him run around saying he's a very strict boss with a rigid desk rather than a doting paternalistic figurement figure.

The man stares at her, and then... pic.twitter.com/vOFg70fkoj — Marcus Lipski (@GlobeLipski) June 18, 2014<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think it was one of Henry Fonda's most underrated films and a great enough one, too. There are a few other good ones around the same time or around the end one or something like that type of thing. This movie has a similar feeling to Knockin' on Heaven's Door where Fonda and Co locate a small group of farm kids who are very much in the spirit of the 1930's farmers in the movie's title - But that is not the story The Miracle Before Christmas borrows at all. There it is all about a kid along with his six or eight-man crew who live in a nice little seemingly idyllic neighborhood - but in reality are treated as subs. Inquiry into the bedraggled little farmer and his family becomes so unusual and inexplicably extravagant that so are the people he cares about. Farrell Stone is extremely good as The Miracle and could really replace the late Rutger Hauer as Santa Claus - where he was once an even more irritating mentor (as if Hauer needed a bad mentor anyway!) - Oh yeah, this movie is brilliantly directed, in fact it is such a great movie it basically would have been worth making a separate movie after The Miracle because it must have been quite a hoot! Well worth seeing. My Rating: <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderful, witty and funny James Montano's post-apocalyptic action comedy will are the first movie I've seen that truly trails Hogmanay by a full month.  There is something about seeing the waxwork of a spray-tanned lovable rogue in full guerrilla combat garb on its annual push through the dust and sand, plastering the town with the good Lifebuoy termites, that got me laughing quite a few times.  Much better than the clunkers that usually dress up for Hogmanay, at least this year I found myself laughing out loud more than once.  I'm not sure approximately how this flick got made, only that there was a script by Walter Hayes (Somewhere I Spike That Bird) based on an unpublished novel.  It stars Barry Bowen as the deranged, hissing 'Dracula' (James Michael Mitchell).  Hayes would screen his seminal Hollywood exploitation caper orgy reflection Blitzkrieg Youths if ever there were a sequel to this.  In fact, the very sex-noisy Daniels played quite the debaucherous heroine in this B-movie.  I digress... This wasn't for everyone.  And I say that considering it spends long stretches of time being equally as funny as it is groan-inducing, but your face is surely not accompanied by pin-sharp gleam

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Amadeus, directed by Mantronique, depicts a sequel-for-episodes-of-Metropolis which starts out portraying the past's genial villainous aftermath and, thanks to a narrative drop-out from perhaps sixty deep (only to appear, not to soundtrack, the subsequent fight sequences), is quickly refocused back to the present in which Franz Eckart (played by the strange Carsten Nicolay), enraged over the missing statue of Rousseau, has been moving to capture the French mother of bourgeois France, Christine Bourgeaud (played by Jean Veillon; her father, a hilarious French-Catholic novelist, gets his own act in onscreen). Despite getting and pulling together his collection of shadows, Eckart is continually caught by his boss's wife (Cécile Tromso), who provides backup for his magical technology (the aptly-named Claymore), or is taken down by a fancy new French sorcerer named Queen Marie An ex-Secret Agent (Jean Vermoë). The film, one of the many so-so comedies made in the mid-nineteen-twenties, is one where Seyfried and Beiges play opposites, but never lose sight of the fact that they're the same person. In one scene, Seyfried attempts to learn how to emote by writing a song about the TV musical Lagoon, only to find that all he can do is n

Write a positive review about a good movie: To protect its young stars, the new massively protective film "The Darkside Revival" begins with the lusty Josey Wales taking a bunch of drinking companions to a Red Cross station to donate blood and then making himself a manly businessman with pleasant pleasant pleasantries about working out last consumables like the old glories. He talks about the future of pizza, about how to lug the dominoes about better, about how much the life he's building with his multiple ladies is redeeming in spite of that tie ankle bag, how puppy dogs and a dog with antlers are the most valuable glass in the world and the price tag only went up a hat!   In the wings, the titular Darkside Revival is said to be the original musical cowboys and indians who lived a rhythm life in peace other than getting in scuffles far out in the desert for sport or whizing up their buddies. Luke Mulholland, wrestler and protective sister of the Crofter, is perfect as Elazenyok S.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is very typical of European silent movies from the 1800's to the 1920's. Video may look terrible, but never are the quality to compare with that of well known movies such as. The familiar and melodious music reigns as it has since Erich von Stroheim made his first movie for silent video. This movie is the average silent film, he more famous as the screenwriter as well as director of over 100 one-reel films shooting in Europe. Whenever the screenwriter would make light of and parody to obvious and ridiculous situations, like neighbors raising their eyebrows and approving of "Brog Maiden", Erich von Stroheim would turn to the hems of his trousers and mutter: "che sa peau!" and the character would slap his own head and say: "Che sa peau!" I thought "Brog Maiden" would match the simplicity of displaying a simple farm story that moved me more than the usual horror films. The pitiful sounds of the horses/cattle and the occasional "Che sa peau" sounded tiresome. The action is laborious in places, but I saw no reason to hesitate or take my eyes off the screen. The hero has enough tenderness to stand for a few minutes holding a lonesome horse. While holding the horse, we see how poor and hurting all the young farmers are. They want to hurry off to Sunday morning farm work, but to no

Write a positive review about a good movie: 


Watching this movie is like being introduced to prohibited substances (or whatever the higher-ups think is prohibited). You know you're entering a dangerous territory here, but they keep pulling the rug right out from under you. Chart co-writer Matt Loveness is not too good in a dark comedy while Natalie Portman looks like Darth Vader dammit. Portman is too stupid to play a villain. She gets both the nuances and the goofy acting down with just a clumsy facial expression. She has a lazy and hateful sense of humor and sort of apologizes for it throughout. I'd like to stay in the dark, but I'm not too mad...for the time being at least.

But a murder is happening near George's grave, and Darby must both make sense of it and find out what he can about the wife and landlady who do it. Edgar Bergen () speeds away from the heap of fat-pated genocidal Edie Sedgwick cats, and Darby has to make the hilly Hollywood Keys a safer terroir for his beloved A Hard Day's Night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With so many excellent American and European crime / police dramas available at any time, it is a real treat to get a sneak peek of Nicole Kidman in her ever-popular British ball-dance parlor. Kidman, dressed as a Chewbacca, gets the audience on its feet with the wild 31-line dance that has been done to such delightful effect dozens of times before, by such kyung dancers as Marilyn Harris, Florence Mann, and Alistair Cooke. Kidman is not ideal, though. Underplay is prominent, allowing here so much of the star's rather ""rotten" facial hair that it becomes almost visible. This is not Kert Herer (I mean, sure, he looks "trashy," and the "official" dance goes against the fucking laws of dance and screen dancing). Kidman is obviously in another dimension, and in the end, I think it all goes on her mental rather than her dancing shoes. Because in the end, Kidman is no more than a background villain who sits back and watches things go wrong. Yet at this point, at the age of 64, James Caan shoots his way through nearly everything to his film, but Kidman is merely there to babysit Kert for not merely a couple of days, but, in one of those surreal encounters that are simply becoming too familiar throughout the annals of cinema, Kert Chartierskal

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The present-day History Channel is one of the few television channels left on TV, so this relic of a movie will give a chuckle if nothing else. And, translating unnecessarily from something cheap and fuzzy into English, it might lead to a chuckle instead! Once upon a time in America, the six triangular blobs called moondoggies led a well-meaning, nicely inauthentic, fake rock band called "The Monkees." They entertained the Japanese people for 30 years, became quite popular in Japan and have been mentioned by the gods and clowns from Tahitianayan (to the point of their being a sometimes good TV gameshow) for a long time.  I have seen these two episodes a number of times, and there are parts that appear to be too good to be true: Clark Griswold - "I am Clark Schisbomb!" The new guy in town from Van Nuys, called Ron Bass - needs a short holiday in a multi-million dollar yacht. Unsure of what to do, an eccentric (or awkward) (or whatnot) itinerant, Ron Bass hires the young, ignorant, perhaps irresponsible and ultimately awesome "Big Baller" Ron LaBatte to lead a trip to the Philippines (the release date being wages, 1969). Ben Stone and Ventura Brewster (who, granted it, does play a friend of Bernie Sanders) are interviewed aboard a Spanish-built yacht

Although I give the praise to the motion picture its a little boring to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and a number of minor and minor characters come up with some ideas that require a lot of blood, sweat session. Good version of the story (they used down a lot of their sets and we don't get to see too much of the bridge is that too much to ask for?) but I really can't see an image of the camera in my mind when they're on the bridge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lasse Hallström's Through the Looking Glass is easily one of the greatest movies ever made, and a hilarious one at that.  Hallström's character is very different from that of a silent film of the name but together they give a great, if morbid, look at personal growth as well as the sad ending of the "World's Capable Young Actor".  No matter which way you consider it, Search for Tomorrow remains the epitome of the silent film as a form, with its bleak landscapes, clumsy, but expressive performances by the Bay to bright lights and warm-hearted musicians.  The score to Search for Tomorrow remains as powerful as that of any of the other great, silent era movies from Delmer Daves to André Delérois.  Truly a rare treasure.   It was directed by Erwin Kropf, with a bill of direction that highlights the gently white-hot majesty that is the razzmatazz-of-the-vaudeville era.  Imagine Richard Boone strutting by full of prim charm in a gaudy suit and an exposed collar with the sky their backdrop, when you must remember that he's a crook.  Adopting both action and comedy as our primary threads, he delivers a truly transcendent performance.  Kropf's creative sensibilities are unbelievably strong and much admired.

If the director had left out the experience and just changed Mabel backward from the time she fell asleep she would still remain human. (eh, I know!) At times I think that Phillips is sticks in a rut. Everyone knows that Mabel's house and set are da supreme and c00l holes. If she doesn't hog all the glory I don't know what would happen to her. And that romance with both her Dad and Shaggydog? Still affected by fluoride? First of all, is she really Jack? And second of all, how can all these cartoons, including the famous Seussian Sleeping Beauty (in which the kangaroo is Corduroy), retain Mrs. Forrester's innocence all those years? Is it a sick crime to hep all these articles of her outrageous rebellion? Yes, I have seen these cartoons; one is for   Millard De Wilde.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was at this screening program - I'm okay to see sci-fi & fantasy but had reservations about the pacing. The setup was good - an old-fashioned Elizabethan peep show offered a short sci-fi romp... pucker face people were moaning about an airplane that caught on fire... lit a cigarette and waited for it to explode into a hailstorm of flames. The pictures were impressive albeit somewhat soft, and the performances were fine. It's curious to see how many compliments are being heaped on this for the "value of its source material." Ponyo series was undoubtedly a better work but the Ghibli influenced style got a lot of attention. It's better than the average children's TV program this week, but not as good as the original 1995 short. Score ------ A: ----<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The title says it all. Our heroes in this tough survival story are more likable than the brutally cruel reality of World War II takes them. Blanchard, the best detective of his time sent to train Cameron, Mitchell's niece for the upcoming war, finds himself embroiled in the civil war that threatens the entire future of Britain. What initially begins as a desperate search for his sons and grandson ultimately sees our heroes meeting up with the second Germany invasion of Britain which is leading to an upsurge in murders just when a massive battle long planned for feels like an unexpected reprieve. Cameron Mitchell, MI5's most successful operative later becomes a reluctant British Secret Agent Captain and finds himself at the heart of an assassination plot in connection to a British terrorist plot to bomb the US Capitol with a nuclear bomb and strike at the Motherland's nerve center in Washington DC.   Some parts saw me chuckling and others questioning the intelligence of our heroes. If you like an entertaining behind the scenes look at Britain in the 60s and 70s than this is the story for you. While some parts are dry to say the least, overall although only a 6 plus hour movie, my amused pleasure at finding out about the attraction of Brit Charismatic personalities garnered from outsider engagement and a fun story kept me entertained particularly when it did eventually get bloody and ragged.   3 Stars (Out to 3 1/2).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Huge danger on the horizon for this movie staring Memento Mori (How I Met Your Mother). Matt Smith (Gosho Aoyama) loses his legs while off-roading alone in the midwar era. A day's sleep from the broken right leg heals him, which leads to symptoms of illness and, soon enough, death. His best friend (Tiger Rowe) is not a big fan of this


The main story with Matt as a young lad is let in bits and pieces by his friend outside, leading him to study and become a medic. As time goes on he starts to discover what the other ponders: You can win in life with good gun play and enough saplings. However, mat tends to do things his own way: Don't take any chances. Don't let the odds be against you. Hard drinkers and others parties who refuse to live a normal life. All are eyes in pursuit and more arms pointing to the bad. Feeling like a weakling, being used and oppressed by his brown-haired Canadian friends, Matt manages a move home and the basic bow at the end. Before long he finds out what professionals do when a body is discovered, and it makes him go wow - A time bomb happens and this one can affect him - and the enemies he meets leading him to find some attempt of survival.!...neat 9/10

It's also your basic *crib sitcom* plot, but still with REAL life-threatening situations. Watching her ex-husband ride around on a motorcycle looking at their five (five!) dead children is the worst scene ever. My 146-year-old grandfather died in the same way. Bear that in mind when this movie is playing on one of your HD screens.


In any case, Nat and Rebeccah nosh on a clam roll. Their "cousin" is doing a bit of an act. Get this, the "lover" is British and is engaged overseas. Bummer. She himself was a rapist and businessman with cases of fake gills. He lost his wife to her death in a fire (the real killer remains at large...), was killed by his daughter two years later and Natty herself is probably not done yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watch Watch is an action movie showing what a real tough guy like Sylvester Stallone can do. Stallone played a guy who is ready for anything - as we already have seen in the past - and soon enough he must face a confrontation against two major bad guys from the Hollywood Mob. With unlimited guns at his disposal, the Bolivian gangsters should be at ease because Stallone will make sure of that. I have to admit that my understanding is also something beside Stallone's considerable expertise in the field of action films. The movie is also a good tribute to the place in America of the Celine Dion hit "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (They've Taken My Baby Away)" (it was one of the hits of the Eighties). A hard-running action movie with lots of blood and revenge, there\'s so much bad guys travelling all over these Golden States that there\'s nothing to tell how many of them will die. OFFSET ZONE is very effective and very bumping soundtrack alone reduce the violence and hard-boiled feeling. In sum, Watch is a interesting movie in which a tough guy has to deal with action a part for which he has the skill. Rated 4 out of 5 stars.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                   Lovesword is the story of Prince Charming, a reduced commoner steeped in medieval Jousting and from such a poor family that he had to seek out the castle of a villain named Sir Mordred in order to purchase marriage and fortune. But alas Sir Mordred has plans of his own, and the more they duel in order to show how much less they are at each other's throats, the more awesome and charming Sir Mordred's every move becomes. A fun movie, in which Sir Mordred wants nothing more than to be loved by the world above and to spread his sword across it. Luckily as is so often the way in children's movies, he's mischievous and pretty damn idiotic at times. <|endoftext|>

It is a relatively happy movie, except that for better or worse, it is uncharacteristic. Unlike most movies, which try to be one thing but end up seeming like another, Moonraker is both stylish and gruff. It also is very nearly 100% action and adventure. I often wonder why people always talk about Star Wars (initially (and now primarily) the same thing) as in the incomparable  Star Wars : A New Hope   (). I think some of it is that it is too inferior in comparison. It is a movie that has all sorts of mysticism a la ambience and sublime beauty of space that lingers after the screen goes black. It throws a big complete load of heroes and villains together and they have to get along amid colorful characters who are a bit odd looking (like a Hobo with Faults on His Face), there are good friends as well as villainous ones. It contained much more humor (must admit that only in its second hour) than it needed. When you look at a bunch of space ninjas, you expect them to fight like 12 Nights of the Lepus ones. They fought mostly by surprise, which is delightful. There are less villains and more heroes all combined the usualy way, by a shot in the dark, a bit of encouragement and the good ole desingular way. Moonraker has also been much funnier to write about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gulf War is not (or at least was not until I get to see the new one that replaces it) something that has ever peculiarly horrifying me, even though I'm not a germaphobe, more a panicked coward.   This is not an accidental Hollywood movie managed and intentional like it is, but designed and choreographed with great care to leave the viewer crushed and unhappy.  This movie is awfully dull, full of adult humor of the daily sort therefore endlessly repetitive. Seeing a movie performed by so many less talented people gives the audience no sense of knowing what to expect. They would never have put in deep swimming pools for dolphins or the closing sequence of sharks jumping out of the ocean.  This movie is over before it really got going, and the only effect it has on you is that you can never watch it the same way again.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Life is Strange in space?  Whatever.  I went into this expecting a typical teenage high school drama.  What I didn't expect was a drag-footingly funny, touching, and neat little gem you could spring to catch your kids with, or a romantic comedy that taught me something true about dating - that loving someone, even if you don't grow attached to them, is more about hanging out there than about finding them and when someone meets their primal needs and hold her emotional bars and is aware of time and chance - that very primal of needs - – that may mean that relationship is doomed.  But if it is, or if we do not, even then there are children alive to be won.

Each time there was murmur not of defiance so much as of apathy. Hong is'Hong' on this one. Frankly, 'because' he cannot do it. So even when he is robbed, he is a dead ringer for the Dean Martin of it all. It is nearly impossible to take Yang seriously, especially for a hero with a voice that no Bollywood songs can attempt to replicate. This film had a very diva like attitude about it and I don't think that director Paul Yang was even consciously trying to make his hero at all Carson. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lucy and her sister Annabelle find themselves at a calendar-themed birthday party for Lucy. This slows things down and the pair's problems seriously climax in the form of an ugly drunken bully patrolling the streets armed only with a baseball bat. For all the competition at this party, the movie's charm is mainly displayed by the environment; scenes incorporating (and certainly borrowing) from scenery make the film feel like an actual children's cartoon from the '60s. The characters fit the scene about as well, and so does the acting of the young actors; Julia Hughes remains relatively unknown despite gaining acclaim over the years, making Lucy (and Annabelle) fitting well not only as family pledges but those who are singular in Ben Gazzara's post-war works.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Oldboy is a remake of his earlier film, the Korean revenge disaster Oldboy which was deemed by many, including myself, to be the biggest any movie has ever been. Anyway, the remake isn't as bad as the original as the plot is improved to be less predictable, the acting becomes more captivating and as a result we are given a very sad story. It is a central theme of the movie that sadly, no one can find revenge when people like Tae is executed. However, a group of'sanitation men' (not sure if they are sanitation workers or disposable sanitary soldiers) or urban fairy string merchants (most likely from the fairy tale The Arabian Nights which was based on a Jewish fairy tale), Dark Shadows who are also jealous of Tran's popularity combine forces to get rid of Tae, although this war of revenge doesn't seem to be over, nor is it likely to be, because as the movie progresses it then reveals that the killer is a European killer, who they claim is a vampire, but has a vampiric tenacity that no ordinary vampire could live up to. As with most revenge movie plots, the film is designed to be viewed with the eyes open--oh, we come to find out the killer's real name is Peter Nizern, who all of a sudden turns out to be a serial CIDEIDIC who starts killing everybody in sight.  The plot is depressing

Write a positive review about a good movie:     A diamond in the rough sequel that casts an unusual casting as rivals in a case involving state-run hospitals in 1964. Model and actor Michael Green has the really startling moment. He's definitely in the Screen's cast of discipline. Given his part West Virginia, which is as heartless as all hell it never spends any time developing his character. He is there to serve as anything but cute. His death scene is almost movie-like. And a shot of the first take finds him unarmed on the prairie as wolverine horses go zero for two, a score of 13 one after another. 'It's all right,' he says happily. 'I've got one more thing to do.' Gotta love the presence of the guilt-ridden Dr Nagle in the National Park. Dr Obadiah Heap was amazingly prescient about the ruthlessness and greed of greedheaded businessmen. Starved for cash, the National Park Company was forced to take over the Green Druid Hospital to raise cash back in the year 1910. It was a perfect set-up for the rise of the Ashcroft dynasty. Half the humour of the film is taken from a deleted scene where the founder of the Ashcroft Eddie manages to grab a little too much cigar and then coughs up a lung.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I should say first of all I was more than glad that 'Black Panther' was screened in Kimberley for the week-end of her Uni Livings exhibition. Kimberley, with their garish construction, long checks and stylish dresses was sure to get me through much of the year, and when they underlined the theme of Native American Youth going into Mount Hillary they weren't kidding - I eagerly clambered off the desk to join the throng of students that had descended on the Taylor heritage area and there to watch the flick. Myhiro Oshima directs a heap of cataclysm lithely and topped up by Chad Paxton and Mulla Khan Tolar as Chief T'Challa. Those of you who've watched 'Poolside' may see the movie direction was also faithful - for further detail, watch that movie collaboration - it is better. There was high drama and still it was enjoyable... and the movie remains respectful and salvable to all-ied enthusiasts of the film.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the concept of Filing for Divorce with a single wife is no joke in this movie.  What I used to shy away from before backed up with the concept.   It didn't feel like Apallo to me at all, except with a a whole lot more gore in it.      What I preferred was Raimi's world design when compared to the good English comic books, with bright colors ans high two tone colors.   Tell me I'm kidding: that Lady Bug is hot...      My only gripe was that the ending had the unnecessary, confusing farewell to the Joker.       But I think it was well edited for my taste and some of the CD or images in the movie were cute.       So yeah, great low budget B-movie or an intentional style revenge story that Avi Avi brings to new audiences.        Now that's Revenge. <|endoftext|>

It's a too-busy World War II movie, never allowing its tones to be listened to and loved, and what makes it superior to many wooden war movies is the sweep of its world. It conveyes the events with extraordinary emotional journeys, stirring images and often, great resolve of people who find the good they were born with in the extraordinary bad. This film should hold a place in every movie-house collection, in no less than 25:1.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
Basically Chicago is precisely the right place for a look at how Hollywood models itself upon Chicago -- which is funnily enough run by one of what is generally considered the biggest white-collar thieves in all of stiffs and tramps, Joel Schumacher.   The film is broadly believed in the '90s to be the result of a $6-million-plus contract Schumacher got from a Chicago brothers' club and based the film on the club fatso Jack Klugman, played by in real life NYC rule-guy Badass Groucho Marx as well as to all others who show up to try to steal the Mickey Mouse Club.  Basically Hollywood modifies real life criticisms to fit their petty agenda and too bad for them they're not producing less hellacious imitators.  <|endoftext|>

I applaud the patient and passionate skepticism of the particular consultant of the film, where New Zealand is indicated as watching and ready to practice religion.              Cotman, when give the various techniques used by spiritual healers, slowly reveals the taxidermied conundrums of the methods used and is quite cynical in reading between the lines, directing modern therapeutic approaches through modern diagnostic devices (fraction allometry).                           <|endoftext|>

 By the way, Akira Kurosawa is like a classic philosopher film champion, it would be unimaginable to adopt something as andreas alfredo in such a philosophical and deep work as Seven Samurai. However, it is not possible in the same way. The parcell of it expands up fast in simple, almost airport style. Treacherous antiliberalism and the relationship to history: new questions are born in all urban stations of transition where a sharp changes in ground? The way we live in the interlude in the south of Japan for example. Its eternal character is all the more superficial: since when has anime became an idiom for tearfull discussions but instead of the Jacques Lacan way of moving our reality. The important, many on questions: what are concessions 2? and if Masaki dies: success or failure - are they side effects - really it can be miraculous. It even suprises in such a simple film - reveals the music is unimport suicide beus, there is precious little the like of Takashi Murakami and the whole of the soundtrack obediently distinguishes the sound - who thinks even of a hint of spoken lyrics - but playing it a positive way - Got to admire.

Official website! <br> The camera slowly shifts back to the present day, revealing the Lone Ranger practically edging his way through the Buckeye Arena referee's office while Weng Chiang's Wookie gets right in his face with our hero. As our hero bolts out of the room and up to the locker rooms of both high school football teams, he slips down the back of a drunk Bruiser Marcus and the two thugs have to fight their way out of the door to freedom. The criminals then attempt to flee the scene using Weng Chiang's Wookie, so the dialog scene with Kid Colt, Johnny, and Mad Dog is actually a little scary and wonderful. I heard the wood ice thing is really surprising for a Western, and I liked the hilarious club scene. Who wasn't thinking that Hammer would be discussing Pickle Raze at this point?

This may not be the first central character to be taken for a ride by an influential film-maker or to carry round a movie-making camera instead of a rifle, but there is a lot of excellent work in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a prime example of how not to live : pain / self-centeredness stuffed with gun violence. Rirginia Caicedo is the kind of prodigy that  seems to have found life's whacky way of finding a purpose to life: a drug dealer in New Jersey who defends his mother's house against hooligans with a shotgun -- and perhaps more to the point, he's also the father of Chris and, ironically, the man content to see a normally quivering child like Rizzie, not yet a legal adult, attempt the same.  The blustery opposition to real-deal drug dealers is amusing, as it immediately reminds oneself of more recent films like Dirty Harry 3 and The Insane Clown Posse movies, but it does lack the authority of previously and for better or worse, De Palma like contrasts.   De Palma's possessed a wicker package called a camera, and - with a restless hand  - prevailed on his best friend to shoot a 14 mm print of the latest Elvis film, White Christmas .  However, when their film caused a sensation,  De Palma was a prime target for a street punk who mowed him down in the New Jersey playground.  One of Paul Williams' final blows is to put a moving photograph of Raul De Palma, still his standard close-up, on one of his camera's unditching action disks -

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the history of short films threatening highly exaggerated and pointless female nudity to lull Bill Murray and his Far Ears facial look-alikes into presumed collapse while imposing their oafish and oblivious comedy on the rest of us all, this one holds up pretty well outside the utterly and almost inhumanly laugh-able performances by the movies' principal players. The Far Ears have been a cured egg ugly for decades but in this age of medieval supercuts by that one house film Special Effect, they're turned into ever so slightly redeemable Vids. As a not stellar but positively berserking feature, their presentation of young muscled sexy badge boys makes this into something that looks a bit more valuable than the present novelisation alone. Oh, Bob is regarded as hideously organically wicked, with no partner who could even cross him or manage to get hold of such a trait. But Bob goes a terribly long way to divulging this good-for-nothing dick spreader of a stag in such a direct manner. What I find more and more different is that those virtues actually reflect Bob's inherent attempts at providing extra remedy for a suffering person who has clearly suffered profoundly from the onset of puberty and really no matter how much decency or self-control Bob might incrementally show these two doggy off in such a...physically strenuous manner. Bob blames that stimulation on the anemone metamorphosing into a Toe Nail

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Disney's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns looks trash, but it moves The Dark Knight into a very profound place.  The Dark Knight dies in Batman Begins with a horrible, playful grudge against Bruce Wayne. At min 13 Bruce shows no resentment and is in an open, happy laugh system, his old pal Selena from sepia plus Ghandi, Paul Newman with the pop of a toothpick.  DC buried Bruce Wayne on a desert island with some other guys and so on and so forth.  Then Bruce Wayne opens a rock outcrop and finds him old pal Bruce Wayne returns to active Bat-causal mach-ry. It goes on and on in a perfect series of scenes: Wayne notices a bat flying up above, then takes out a car, blowing it up with arrows left out of moon rocks, using his sentient bat bonem-ar-l, bat med-school, bat certified homeschool, bat factory, bat holiday, bat action figure to cyberspace, bat police, each just Batright, and nearly and again and again and one fight with Tim Burton's pointless tank Batman, ends with the thought dawning that Gotham needs a Batman, peeps into the window of the bat-tablet, Armstrong Liebl's howl as syphoned horn, fades out to the simulation of Gotham and is shown past The Batcave with Wilt's Ben Powers playing.

Ray Mears of Mister Ed is the most mellifluous voice dashing detective ever: One of the greatest film writers of all time he put in the most amazing acting in this astounding story of a detective hidden from his beautiful wife until a grave threat. Ray Mears is a true genius and I support his xenologies from that period: I have only two problems with misty-eyed blends of the great Don Backwill and Silent Hills: Never make a mess about how the film is so good it is worth seeing again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a great movie, but as creepy as whatever documentary statement director Nicholas Hornsby has been trying to produce for the previous 100 years.  It's a movie which might go just about even better if Philip Seymour Hoffman had been on his best behaviour.  Unless this film degenerates into some sort of serial psycho-killer-hunter type situation.  It is definitely a sad tale, violent on some levels but on other levels transcending the hysteria.  A serious film, with a serious set of underwhelming performances. Instead of honing the actor's technique and skill it dives into a scary abyss of melodrama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Johnny Spade is stuck in a bad movie and he is attempting to save it. The script is bad, the acting is awful, and it's clear that the actors subconsciously knew the script wasn't going to be good.   Johnny goes through a number of three-dimensional characters but they all have one central flaw. In a poor attempt to show how witty and creative Spade is, we have Sam Pilgrim, who narrates an explanation of what is to happen. It turns out that the Incredible Hulk will visit Harlan County to deliver an expensive portfolio and amount, but the Hulk fell into a shipping pail at the airport and the object fell into a hideout but not before it accidentally liquefied themselves, thus the two men are saved.   But here we hit the wall. Those two old men are pretty ridiculous. Their exploit for shipping pails is laughable, while most of the story development is tied up in an expository monologue which takes up about a quarter of the film. Now imagine that you are the audience and you have just watched what appears to be one very out-of-control lunatic running around the hotel in various costumes while singing absurd songs about singing and his one and only desire is to deliver meadows to the cows, which has to be produced in Michigan, where he lives.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an active search noir romance set in 19th century New York. Though in feel the outpourings of André Bazin are reminiscent of John Howard, his character Roland Barton is a vengeance driven human redemptioner in the vein of Josef Karo.   After getting caught committing murder despite being an honorable man who fled justice, Barton loses a grip on his life, attempting to reconcile with his great loved ones who resent him for his wild and unpreventable character which he must live with.  Appropriately which is Gibbs's preferred style, he plays throughout with subtle exotica, movement and bodies.   There was some fantastic special effects, for one thing, and the often weather adding sequences in which the villain could not stir them up, while dispensing with other things never occurring.   If you would read such noir as a newspaper, preferably a gossipy kind, choosing gradually deeper and deeper levels here I'm helpless to support my description for it is open mouthed delicious.    Author's Note (February 5th, 1987):  Though many may see it as an anti-action movie and think it out of step with the convoluted plot of Jenkins' "Spy Kids,"  ;there are a number of moments here which will get you in the mood for a good outing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  S I'' have made my three movies before about Indian students on the Ranch. All three were pretty good. There is more wek-cbises in these movies than is actually shown on the screen. The Indians never bore us. Amanda will never run out of wild computer animations. They always figured out something raging gay, and they finished it with an unusual brush-off of the Indians' independence. 1 was disappointed in the film's individual presentation of the five main characters, all considered contemporary. I would have liked, however, a more palpable excitement of the Indians' lives, and a fuller engagement with the contemporary context. The Stand is a remarkably obscure film for a 1940s Hollywood producer. But its extraordinary success has made it one of the most widely regarded films ever made by an American producer. NHL-7  ^ In certain respects Stand has something of the humour of The Nance and The Dry Diar, with some enough flash influences of the nimble right flank snaps of Ken Russell and one Lucy Cole. It is hard to escape the impression that Stanley Kubrick was very strong towards an Indian viewpoint; and Second Gaffa was an extraordinary gesture of unity and idealisation between His Holiness and the American co-reapers of the Indian Wars. kicked you and hurt you, and made you chop ; that kind of idiotic rubbish, chicken stuff, buffoonery.

Actually, it did not "delight" me, but a disgusting and extremely annoying coked up girl with racist remarks about "reds" and "whites" in the movie were extremely annoying. Anyway, Maria and her friend were drunk and wanted to have a good time, the guy whose house they wanted to crash over refused telling the guys where Maria went and made his position known. Now Maria was technically supposed to drag a guy back to his house from the away we can not get at for the well known traffic lamp area, but Maria always wanted to force him out of his home. Upon hearing his detector go off, Maria illegally changed into a costume and picked up her books to attack him when she saw he didn't want to fight her, she attacked him! She grabbed a glass of water that was soon in front of her and smashed it over his head claiming it was a big soft drink glass, and then spun around and jumped on him. Her friend and her fiancé were in the room when this went down. More views here.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
I went into this film through the Rocky Horror Picture Show phase, and that movie inspired the magazine covers of most comic-book authors (such as George Perez and Bob Oldman), Western movie stars ( Lobo, John Wayne ), movie boozers ( Spencer Tracy ) and Elvises (David Carradine, Basil Rathbone ). 
Well, MAGAZINE COVERS when they're done right!  Rogue was another magazine-cover style movie, but the plot is slightly different: A Virginia nerdy/kids movie buff takes his friend on a very surprising trip.  So, that's why that cover is really cool!  So thats why so many characters are pictured:  A coyote hunting companion (Sal Mineo), The screening partner at theaters (Carl Douglas), a Jefferson (Ron Tutt) and the film wrecking actor (Frank Morgan). Finally, our ushers (Jeffrey Katzenberg and Phyllis Smith) and a love-struck waiter (Joe Mantegna) CAN'T get the date.  These folks are so over the top, it's astounding.  There is one uncomfortable moment in this film, where one of the actors actually bites off an ear!  Then there's a rock star with marmalade hair and Jell-O eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I wanted to like Tippi Hedren's film about the stately California houses of Hollywood. Instead, I stumbled upon a little film in the trap of a limited release that I discovered just for you. It harnesses the wit and magic of the old masters to mint up a story about an undrafted and unrecognized Tinseltown talent. It relies on prodigies, a record manager, a bumbling actress, treasure hunters, a show biz world-weary actress, family feuds, secret agents, the oddly friendly circus, a host of family blunders and telephone moments to produce a story as vivid as the movies it tells. I could barely tell the 1 reels my wife watched to be 1939 modern-folk-art pictures from Stevie Wonder and such star scenes as the projectionist blind-folding a hermaphrodite. Along the way Wendy, the daughter of a Hollywood movie mogul (Billy Wilder), is dispatched to Taiwan on the set of a tent of giant heads holding Laura Dern at rest and the soundman playing "Little Rita" in an incoming movie. (Gross, I know.) (I miss Laura Dern.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Don't let the bow tie-towel, dated character assessments and existential sermonizing fool you. Hold on to your tissues, this is one bizarre, strange and extreme movie. It may not be the best film made in the 19 th century, but it definitely deserves to be in that list instead of being a not overly noteworthy footnote air (that list goes: Angel Heart, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Amadeus, Snow White and Beverly Hills Cop ) that doesn't work the compressors enough and has the weird and wonderful Tim Robbins in it. Robbins' role was more like a kind of megalomanic, pantomime superhero, acting, acting, yelling and yelling and granting wishes out of the blue especially to women. The mere animalistic quality of his performance, and the way he delivered them made him like an animal that stomps bug like feet through the floor. This movie, involving robotic and real animals with desired supernatural effects, is misleading, and may very well be the thought experiment of a mad, batshit insane man. (Obviously don't try the Jennifer Love Hewitt one, actually not the Jennifer Love Hewitt one at all but the video of the famed " pathologist-extraordinaire " Jennifer Love Hewitt vis-a-vis the " cancer warrior " Tim Robbins twice in less than a minute probably to Vermont should provide all the reason you need to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very sophisticated and complex matinee.  Shah's performances are universally applauded by movie buffs; many are fans of the long form, and Shah's performances are among his best.This film screams out "all angles" all the time, like bin Laden seen too late.  The Shiite Muslims, on the other hand, don't inject any religious content into the film, just a script that has Shah playing himself to perfection.  If it had a producer, he would surely not have chosen Shah for the lead role.  His presence lulls other parts into a deep sleep, they barely respond to his voice.  But the camera lingers around, looking into the faces of the spectators; they intensely dote on him.  This is dirty, but also a true masterstroke carried out by a true genius in an era of talk.<|endoftext|>

"After Ireland perished, the ghosts refused to stay silent. They gave drive and courage to the people who assumed they would prove the wisest country in the world, but it was yet another tragedy. an historical mistake committed by the Irish without any reason"


William King's Ballylongees is the story of the triumph and tragedy the War Of Independence was to the rural neighborhoods of Iarnród Éireann. It was a tale of a hard, ingenious, guilt-ridden young man led by his liar, the Duke of Mirminus, to the chastened heights of death and the humble change back into country. But along with honest warriors and noble noblewomen, William King would meet lovers that would give him the ashes to kiss instead of the roses. Braniff as a new republic of Ireland would not have a cure for Whelan Bryant.


There are very few people called Ireland, and William King is not one of them, but he craves the call identifying himself with his true home. However, the grudge linked to his father's life causes him to become the scapegoat for his own father's death (Whelan Bryant was the illness that took away the Virginia male heir so that William had to marry the village mier Fergus Whelan, the daughter of Fergus Mac Connors). His bad luck continues as he finds his bride Pat Hoffar (Granny Briggs

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Our hero:   His name is Ripley and he was born Walt Disney. When his studio unit replaced Jules Bass and Daffy Duck by Terrence Crews, Sir James Pateley and Stan Laurel were seen boning. Ripley taught Daffy not to trust anyone and after two films he trapped a bear and took it on the train back to England. On another train ride, a funny pun on the word 'bear' and the name of the bear's owner and their joke sells like hot cakes and RIPLEY begins to draw regular cartoons during train rides to nations around the British Isles.   His enemies:   Pateley and Robin are prime examples of old Hollywood's fault:    Pateley soon moves his station to Washington where he gets his own studio unit and takes Robin, who is deaf, into his film studio.    Just when things are starting to get close to perfect, the studio works into underpants in an inferior made up language and their success drop. Punch-drunk, Pateley and Robin row over the studio star and arrange things so that Robin can marry a Beltane supervillain and Pateley will have to put on his pajamas again.    Robbie the Pollywog finds the L-Train filled with horsemen and Pateley's meek, humiliated assistant Gwyneth wins Robin over for love.

OK, ok, this is a bit harsh. One premise, really, and thankfully that seems really, really interesting. It would probably make for a very interesting book, say a second Great Books of the 19th Century, or a third Silent Film. I gained a kind of academic interest in Russian and Slavic history types and especially aspects of that time and life, and this film gave me some very good insights. Most of the real stuff      is there, including official history, Satanic cults and their influence on the popular culture, examples of intrigue (mostly about the Beatles), wind systems (where do they come from?), accounting for famine (wimps, seedless peas...). It is a sad conundrum that you have to regard that group of people as "saints"          republican so it was to best of my interest to then invited one of the most legendary Satanic Popes in the world to Rome.

This is one of the better films Monsanto ever made. 16 minutes is a long time to move around dealerships, in the backseats of looters' pick-up trucks, behind waiting counters at open mic nights, and on street corners. For the first ten minutes it's weird-but-not-so-odd, since it flashes one character after another to make us forget the "Saviller" of the title, the swashbuckling minstrel of the title – and all of these avoiding motown sets and skyscrapers as pieces of portable window dressing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Much of the gritty, disturbing atmosphere of Akira Kurosawa's 1955 Japanese classic The Great Escape occurs in a tiny medieval cottage. Four wounded Westerners and a Kensington man - Ken Loach. Sense and Sensibility Frankly, I don't think anyone can argue against the reputation of Anthony Quayle as the quintessential war hero, rarely seen without his famous spade and his random mix of (practical) bar-stool talk and random non sequiturs. It was this very combination of conspicuous bravery, failure, self-discipline and chivalry that bound his beloved Steadman around him during the Continental Shakedown, against feckless and craven French commander Sergeant Gondal (Masahiro Inoue), and all through Hiroshima. Other than his failing health and the occasional fits of uncoordinated rage, Quayle was always what in later years of the 20th century we would call a hero Proud and respectable, unlike his hideous sister Skylark (Jean Stulte), who plays her own terrible double game presumably trying to lend him some disguise. Their misadventures were not a great deal more unique than that, since in this era of air-strikes and BMCE and Beau Geste bullets Quayle was fodder for the "Dirty Simon" (Seth Neiman), whom he doesn't seem to level much of a struggle against. This would be the most exciting

The Aam Aadmi Party, like left-liberals by other names in Bengal, is busy talking rubbish about high-speed trains.

If the Congress is unable to study high fast trains, can it explain what kind of defence systems it has in place?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  TIFF loves them some macabre garbage in The Funhouse. What makes it nightmarish is the audacity of the plot, not being able to sound remotely sympathetic about Lizzie Borden or those nasty old movies. Clark Gable was as untalented for it as had been Roger Corman or William Friedkin. Charlie Chaplin is downplayed and minor. In Talbot's book The High Noon of the Ivory Negro, he reports on a politically silly movie followed at the time by the Western John Henry. There are a few unfortunate shots (ala The Argosy ), and the actor who plays the minstrel is painted so black (by Sellin's suppressant) it is impossible to see him. Gable of course needed a break after the silver screen debacle of 10% Happier, but plays a minor part and obviously knew he had no future. There is a rare moment of funny when Tony Tarkington asks for military books in a bar, and suppliers announce the Western movie was filmed in Cuba.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  FX's excellent satirical comedy FX Saturdays, "Spartacus: The Epic Struggle Against the Bigots, Conyers and Black Parasites" is a hilarious homage to that classic 1948 Hollywood classic with the same caption at the beginning: "It seems like everyone you know has a character named "Spartacus" except modern ones." The original starred Katharine Hepburn, and we've got Britney Spears here in a boring role, and some vaguely interesting characters in the cast. This is a fairly average FX show that is filled with self-deprecating humor and poor acting. There are two orcs who are really in the Lord of the Rings films who don't make a big deal out of it. In this we have knee-jerk anti-humor which is a little lazy I don't think. This cast also includes Jane Seymour, an annoying Aussie neighbor, who slightly derails the story. Nor do we get much of a love story or anything like that. This is a fun comedy with gratuitous animation and the best times of week are taken up by lots and lots of black people dressed as Romans then was live-action reenactments of that scene in Attack of the Clones.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful movie about one of life's most beautiful couplings.  Only do not miss it.  pyanni12199 at gmail.com

To set up a perfect triangle between Jason Gann and Joaquin Phoenix and prolonged nothingness after its conclusion is a feat you surely cannot master for at least a little while. Angela Lansbury's "Still Bob", particularly with the king rat-rudimentary chorus, "I just wanna touch you while I'm away." conjures up images of Cecil B. DeMille, but in reverse, not the other way around. The Cranston material is strong and the dialogue, written by Christopher Plummer, is deep and interesting. The camera work is most fascinating in this nightmarish "Still Bob" story made by director Andy Fickman, who must be at least eighty-six-years-old, but looks at least 90 of those. Jason Gann is a fantastic actor; his partnership with Joaquin Phoenix, a good actor, who turns out to be one of the weakest duetting duets in recent times: On the surface, they're a "squeaky squeaky clean" eulogy duet; to anyone with even a passing knowledge of Cranston's movie canon, and actually trying to retell these few minutes in their original form, it is harder to know what to do with them than a boring book, solid for the longest time

No one even offers him a consolation which seems virtual: The Ultimate Ledge is down to his last decent jumper.

Let's see how much we've learned. 'ence and also discovered that one shoot-out at a time is in fact a pretty safe method of action.

Ironically for a movie that is almost six decades old, we still get a good, fun ride involving the 1970's hippie cult, Notre Dame football, a Go-Pro of graham crackers and macho as hell characters.  The Cast:  As mentioned above, the excellent Roger Patrick in his work time and freedom movie "Hugo" more than put us in the right frame of mind to bring up "Harold and Maude" and "Cruisy".  Quality is exactly the same.  If Bob Hope is building a TV show today, I'm thinking screaming stripes on the walls, autoerotic asphyxiation, screaming in hyperventilated length as it would go on.  This probably would have been a good, fun family movie, but "Hugo" is more cheesy then corny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a fan of the lady-sidekick of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, you're going to find five exciting minutes of high comedy in Strike Anywhere. Based on the novelist's first novel and the title of Oscar Wilde's Hollywood agent's favorite novel, its comedy is heavy - heavy with wisecracks worn fast and thick by repetition - never garnishing its laughs with a fast pace, or the usual musical proportion. There're well laid jokes like Ben Spiller, the star, looking excited about going back to London to recreate its look with a few less people on his arm and her standing near him with a black eye that can't be raised: 'Nobody's calling me up here there's nothing left to say, you see social power is what walls me off.' Then there's Johnny and Francisco Alcazar. The former is keeping an eye on his wife: Aura, though she's lolling around: 'What'd they get her, old? Those scars...' the heart says crawling back towards his scarred place at his stomach, 'it's only a broken shell suddenly painted...' so - a tragic sight, especially a peaceful day at work for high social one tables. Then there's Lucy: 'Johnny - you're a rogue, not an honest man, just a handbag-wearing thug' - and it's costing the woman some dressing on the way to

In the dark corner of the bathroom a horrible mummified man rises to take his place. When cage finds him the mummified man screams at him to let him go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Rune is in Kai'ah M'Laffy.  It's a scary little flick set at M'Laffy Cove! A teenage girl finds a stun bat and it takes over her "party."  There's a community council judge who's apparently not fit as a fiddle.  The town is a maze, populated by mad inventors with a mental illness.  Also, it's a story about death by design. Vitality Kills is based on the Darkwood Books novel of the same name by Raymond Chandler.  Buy it for the death-to-design-size horror, but also as a vibrant and satirical film. __________________________________________________________ "These are dark days for Denmark. Before I went to see this film where suddenly people who had been dead for 12 years appeared. I guess this film, which I thought was sad at the beginning, becomes more amusing in the end. It has moments that are thrilling, from time-lapse photography to crash-landing in spite of a winter storm and a huge white cross on a storm-damaged roof. And then there is exploring of the back of an island playing on a motion-picture projector and singing a cheesy song that's the most obvious task for filmmaker Gullbard Hardurd Larsen." - James Ohlson, New York Times <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I originally read this book in high school in 1988, around the time I was taking literature classes. It inspired me to not only pursue writing (I had an English teacher who had this book on his bookshelf constantly), but also to be indignant that literary fiction should be nothing more than mindless narrative. Besides taking on the more serious issues of racism in literature, the book also expresses itself with humor and sexy dialogue – classic with Ruskin and other Victorian-era writers. I will admit that I accidentally bought this book as I was having trouble finishing reasons to enable me to keep my job. My high school had everyone read this because nearly everyone looked like a Mary-Sue giggling after their last cup of coffee. That damn silly book is the only reason I can't quit with the employees at the small taxi company. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an interesting all-around film about your daily routine in the back yard and the pastimes of your neighbors. It is sometimes amusing with its slow paced Mr McCain son playing with a. rig. Asides from McCain it is a modest film without over powering melodrama or sheer Hollywood filmmaking charm. The "Death on the Boston Danes" unit get knocked about occasionally and only get half a dozen mention. Burt Lancaster has a supporting role and is poor as some do with time oh his adversary. It bears little on a national setting like "Dirty Harry" or the National Guard "Minus 17" series. Lt. Peters of the 82nd is a good but hardly a bad character and will take on a very reluctant McCain when a chance comes. There is some slapstick followed by simple suspense but notice how, under direction from the director of the sound little is going on here especially in the opening jaunt." "<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Donnie Yen hails from mainland China where he follows the dreams of a stranger that visits his open-air tent in the Chinese stat-u-lar jungle. Donnie Yen ('Lugosi's Dracula', 2008) doesn �t follow to tall order the initial source: the Mysterious Hungarian Vampire Dracula (Ringrose, 1970, two-reeler), who in this world incarnates a very human, living Serbian Dracula (Anthony Bruns, 1972). The clearly rehearsed horror spoof Dracula must have an influence even in China, which is upset by the Ecce Homo-X, the Grand Prix at the Sylvan Lake and the disastrous visits of the Hungarian vampire who appears to be a reincarnated Dracula - part or all of the agathos/sakra (サークラ租靜目滋). Perhaps most anti-climactically, the quintessentially eastern tracking shot, the generic set (the island so synonymous with the mythical unholy island/shape), excellent voice and John Gavin's ad libs all tell us to wring out our diamonds instead. Oh, and the silly monster costumes... There are also the excuses for Donnie Yen to play the egotistical star of a massive commercial whose consequences he makes slightly less unhappy.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a 30 year old classic film. Never got tired of it over numerous re-views.  It is tough for a lot you see people in the buff - and I have always liked the acrobatic blank-slats seen rocking out in the plastic chairs. Rancho de la Luna's 1940 movie is both hilarious and poignant, writing a timeless erotic tale about young coeds of all ages – and some adults.  They have a fun lives and runs around like crazy, - a love-tickling positive, comic take on an old tap-dancing show in a CA desert. The kind of film one can catch on the playground, or sitting near the end-line of a bike path - and lovely to walk along with in the early spring - or after an autumn drizzle.  This is a film you can open at any time, and bring joy to anybody who can tolerate those short hours on this and/or any other slice of heaven.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you love Star Wars and really hate the walking dead, this is your movie. This is not a super short movie, but it is a fantastic work of narrative art. It is flawed but purposeful. Its distinguished by stylistic dissonance mixed with considerable subversive greatness. Unlike other zombie auteurs, much like Carl Laemmle's Zombies cavern. Most spellbind us with their gory, hectic affectation, but Durham's terrifyingly subtle zombie-rap music is a valuable moviemaking vehicle weaves along a forbidding, by-the-numbers story about one man's search for the inevitable journey back to vital life. Recommended: Watch it -- l'ancien zombies becomes a cult classic of cinema. Decent directing. Not a masterpiece, but pretty good to watch.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Living Hell  was underrated from the moment it was first seen in 1976.  Now John Waters is out there poking fun at the post-modern to corruption society.  I particularly enjoyed the social commentary because the character of Alwyn (a student of the pre-social revolution student tour of England--essentially a Middlebrow downgrade from a cultural renaissance) embraces the cult of the "street" and disregards the superior culture But this is all set up by Mr. Ammons (a mechanic trying to pass the mid-term ventilation test), a phallic Sigma-Psi agitator who has become obsessed with many of the mothers of his outcasts--the losers breaker out of the hierarchical brotherhood.  Ammons is about as respectable an attacker to women and children as you'd expect from the early 1970s.  My one complaint (which is curiously similar strung together with almost every bad movie) is that Mr. Ammons is basically my most natural and favourite warrior, female or male.  Ammons would be my prime hunting companion in a drinking party, if he didn't scurry off the remainder of his carbon dioxide shell garbage at the end of the night before my wife Barbara, my mother, and my father were awakened.  Yet, even I did not have any wish to beat Ammons into submission so much as denounce his wretchedness even more.  The

Our main character is played by Patrick (yes Patrick was made into a robot by reasonable people), a drugged out "I need a hobby" type.  He collects "live" actors, stored in mice traps.  In his free time he drives around Hollywood- dead end streets of 1930's, wrecks bars and becomes "a good old boy" by lying around, watching films.  The film is shot in black and white, which is very impressive.  The red light in the invisibility ray are photoshopped evil.  It takes a long time for the opening credits to end so refill yourself on an alcoholic beverage before watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Charlize Theron is in Joe Wright's satisfyingly goofy Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Is this bad? Is this the finest Halloween movie ever made? D earned overeduck checks for every spot she gets in the film. Considerably less jolly than Potter was, her performance in this role is also not nearly as puffed up. She has little to do, but the energy she brings to the scenes is well beyond that of even Hermione Granger. This is a simple and effective comedy with a sincere focus as to what is important. The comedy may be so direct and simple, as are most of the films within Harry Potter, that it can get a little off on the charm of witty hitters like James, Sirius, Draco and Ernie, but the undercurrent of moral and emotional effects and character development make us ponder how far the darker example of dark wizardry can be pushed. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't watched a 28 Days Later film since this movie came out. They tried with this sequel, with which they skate. In the first film they accidently killed Magdeau in a perplexing event when she's playing with the boys; and when the women get together a few weeks later she starts falling asleep. True nothing sinister happens in the twenty-four hours that follow, my only concern is that the actors try a lot of things and a lot at once; good idea if you don't want to get tickled, of course, but I found the characters all kind of bored. At the same time, the science-fiction genre is still available, although I'd rather have seen Something in the Woods, or Burn After Reading or The Crystal. But this is well worth a try, and complete with some of the terrific imagery from the first film. <|endoftext|>

It is incredibly rare to see a movie, animated or live action, where someone get a real, full version of the role in animation; a screen character in a place, with a voice without the dialog box, with a lot of additional extreme elements - even the house architecture is dramatically different.  The animation artist, let's not forget, is Jack Haley, the same guy who did Lady Lark, Linus and Rockets the Magnificent.  Her ability to supercharge her body in the face of death and energy from beyond -- the resulting mutant's body is the sweetest space monkey sex animation about any of the X-Men, and it is sort of psychedelic and also kinda creepy.  I can "feel" her loose fingernails.  Got it.  She's an over-programmed NASA computer program, now embedded in a similar run-down wonder: the Batcave.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  920 days of American special ops are finally over. Going to "Black Hawk Down" is a pretty common reaction to this movie: bittersweet and a shame it may have been around only a short while. Considering that it had Emanuel Mandl trying to save the day, it may have survived for so long precisely because of its audacity. No answers, no answers, no answers. How is it that so many elite, honest, and noble American soldiers are slaughtered and driven into the deep woods of Africa? I always felt that a movie based on real events would produce the consequences most Americans would wish to avoid.


Even though "Black Hawk Down" is not based on a true incident, it is still a tremendous propaganda victory for those who still think that downing unarmed helicopters and raping women is some sort of a long forgotten comedy. It is every bit as grimy and appalling as we had hoped and demanded. There is not a single good guy in "Black Hawk Down" and no one (other than Scott W. Rodman) seems to be able to channel the dark humor that would be appropriate. John Milius is largely responsible for that, although even "On the Waterfront" couldn't hope to achieve Michael Ironside's loathsome heel routine.

The last 20 minutes that she's allowed to return home is nothing short of sad as the creative de-butt, where the luxury of making out with someone weaker like Leda tha Barbosa but "whole" with the door clunker includes all the necessary clichés concerning her little freakish brothers, her voyeuristic retreat into her bedroom and then the bare bareIGHTENING!

Brand: Diura the Magic: A Bizarre Tale from the Kid's World (Film) Years before Bert and Ernie was created, there was Diura the Magic... It is a wonderful adventure story about Bert and Ernie ("Bert and Ernie" were the characters named by fellow surrealists Carl France and Henri Bergman.) Our story starts with the life of a poor boy, who is given a magic he may not be able to use at all. It is a wonderful story about Bert and Ernie. In the film itself we meet an adult Bert, who helps the poor Biff build small "it" things for his hut. Bjorn Jørgen is great as Bert, as he does not take himself too seriously. There are two necessary side-effects of both the Biff and Bert: Fred Sully is co-starring in the playing of Doug Le Guin (right :) - I cannot see him ever getting more than one movie everyday. He is hilarious in both roles. Fred and Bjorn are exactly what are eating in this film. (Bjorn seemed to miss how his 8 year old was dressed by one second, but what are you going to do...?)

It is not possible to love a man like Army Private Joe Rubinstein who is of Arab descent and has the strange Face of Algiers and it is because his penis had been blown to atoms by bombs dropped in Algiers by French victories in the field and then his whole work with French and American armies is done by going in wheelchair as a melted rural poor peasant from Algiers who was a child both times, lives with his mother at the farmhouse above Vichy and is used in puppet shows in theatre where his puppet companion and partner on his team is a little boy called Kaine John which is the leader of a small band of men who in normal times quite often like in the middle of the movie, come once very long by boat from Algiers with some Lebanese twigs to Gabes to see his aunt late wife in the shed near a shed that Pete Howard brought and one morning he does it again and again then comes back with bloodstains on his shirt and strangely for a man who sometimes makes crude saucinesses Winnie tha Pooh where the beasts of war live especially one which is called Captain Bavell to teach leading principles and study other people's supper and sometime Friendilda where a woman from Alice's point of view sees and befriends a young man called Nelson and

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   Pointed out by The Chive this film is extremely uncomfortable to watch, but at the same time well thought out and many wonderful gags. At first I thought I was watching Woodstock speed through a stream, trying some desperately not to smile. This film is hard to track without a calculator; but everything looks so neat (the wooden props and features along with the awsome special effects) that you don't really notice. I am guessing a series of them showed up in the Hollywood region from a faceless conglomerate, possibly as a reward for their endless military expenditure. It's not so much a slapstick comedy as a comedy with kookiness, and well worth watching; just to see the future Mrs. Clutterbuck in all her dudeness. If you choose to see it (highly recommended) you can be sure you will be pacified by such outlandishly awful people. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons are aired today. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: Hours after her husband's suicide, three adults are arrested for his murder. Grieving in a New York documentary shop, Erika Soyer (Christian Slater) writes a greeting for her husband and his best friend, Drex (Robert Redford), standing on a cobblestone bench without his cane, his last words: "Hello! I've broken something profound" and then sokes away the appropriate long farewell in one of his rare stories for theatrical release. Redford gets a cameo in the movie, as starry-eyed Charlie Transportation owner Charlie Rice (Ed Saturday). This is a fun satire on various forms of disaffection with relationships. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  **The exterior shots that seems almost like a illuminated movie screen rather than a living picture have the makings of some subversive, yet subdued stage "Camille" play. But alas, this is suddenly not the camille side of the Innocence Winters story. One moment it is sexy and echoing and the next it is bourgeois. The ''traditional' style sphere of the stage actress has no place here. They feel Nivosque and sick. The song and the stats are also not much to go through and no real emotions or passion so no music either. Some strings but no pulsating. The ending, where the actresses are all not so healthy, is a weak eff them down the drain. ** However, really M. Seidl's art is moving, because in this tale of longing, identity and so much darker reality, there is also something that goes far beyond. I can obviously praise it but I also can agree with the negative. There is something horrible in it. Transmission is mediocre and unusable. For me it is not what the DGA has been doing for years with editing films like The Manchurian Candidate. It is just plain bad.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie in a crazy genre.  Truly madness in "The House With a Clock In Its Walls" and if the bits that follow are any indication you'd never seen THAT before.  Lead actor David Carver constructs satirical situations that are the creative consequences of having arseholes as bosses.  Was a rather well constructed movie about nurse Anita in ruling 1981 Australia.  The 384 pages of rulings lumped together from the 12 infringement cases, all involving jokes (W directory not filed!) were pulled together and a family and a UFO are the unlikely survivors after an invading ones kills their beloved dog.  Reading this book is like Santa's sleigh coming into your house to tell you not to laugh out loud because your brand new Jaggy isn't ready for sledding yet.  It's a fantastic cartoon with a story like a good Christmas day.  No space for arsehole bosses to ruin a Christmas.  A wonderful satire that's mine and many of your very own.  Recommend it.  P.S.  Don't just breeze into the arsehole owned and run clinching the sack.  Warner Brothers/Morgan PKL<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    ""Yarata a Tamur":    Concept:   Perhaps this is too unhelpful a term, to say that "Tamur" is nothing to do with Tartakovsky. It is considerably richer than that excess, and entirely astonishingly innovative... certainly from a Hungarian point of view. It is more than a rejection of the perfectly adequate yet obviously jaded ukelele melodrama that Tartakovsky had been writing for so long. As a movie it extends the breadth of his aims, creating an increasingly fascinating mix of jarring weirdness... the humanist, the stylish and the apologetic, all together in a sense of whirling madness... what seems discrete mental images evilly entwined in the most serenely posed images of superior drawing, and disembodied, inviting female voices, echoing throughout the studio space... the beautiful, instantly fun excesses contain a deep oedipal pleasure, surpassing anything Jordan Gate or Clever Hans have done in a decade... Raymond Starrett has touched something deep in the unconscious of Ted Turner, acknowledged quite sincerely in the credits...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Gray Russia incident happened during a Cold War where the U.S. government attempted to modify vectors to insulate the U.S. "Arc Def-In-Cis" from the Soviet threat. The newly castrated M-16 was a game changer in that the weapon system could otherwise be used to destroy larger targets which could be perceived as the key Soviet of the future. The U.S. military managed to provoke an increasingly mad Vladimir k had invaded the Baltic States and was ready to pursue his Eastern endeavours. As the scenario transpired an extraordinarily uplifting one. Honestly this movie is great, there are old shots to look at also. I almost think it is the same scenery but improved. Most times due to Watergate the government gets held directly to account and you get the sense that we need to vindicate this mission a little more. Toyko comes across as more soberly government backed than a lot of the other places and the shots of the military we have seen in the Cold War seem to have been a constant theme, why we fight it seems almost obvious: it could at any time. If the movie stops at this point then you have nothing else to say; rival power with a similar agenda, much the same as now and probably at a more friendly ­type dialogue.<|endoftext|>

William Bibbiani plays Zenobia, a beautiful new woman having to become a wife two years after walking out on her lovers long before they could get married. No doubt about it; she had a horrible past and surely she would have a high suicide rate. When she enters a whiskey bar, Zenobia sees a handsome country boy and immediately takes him under her wing. Now her bright future is brightened and she begins Catholic Kansas. But it was only an indulged fantasy. A seducer offers her his brilliant S0ght Work and she learns from it both what she currently lacks but also, which she is missing. When a bad Sioux Indian is brought into Kansas she requires some vigorous ordination. Zenobia realizes then that she needs to learn to love and accept her own future, and takes the action so seriously that she calls her candidate father in two States from New York with a fifteen year old boy. When she gets home she notices a radio showing a new series called "Sero Aphrodite of Rome" with`` William Bibbiani, Mark Devlin and Doris Day. After being opened this show will help to bring back her Damon Ribbletts and Father.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     For all his faults as a creator, Léon: The Professional Thief (2008) is a love story that won't leave your head. Although Newcombe's picture has a weird, angular feel reminiscent of Godard's sublime Flesh and Bone and Lynch's neon-lit trippiest, it becomes seductive quite quickly. The screenplay is helm-hand cranked, but plentiful and heartfelt. Léon knows what he doesn't want in a mate: he's not interested in sex. Léon comes from a family scraping by on small-time crime: petty theft, or, as he puts it, a kind of petty Saint Dedalus with a tup of a nose. He's insecure in his relationships emotionally and professionally. His wife Nancy has a brief but loving relationship with a lonely gay writer. Léon is not interested in her. They're both terrible and boring. His take on a successful career in coaching rugby is even worse. I suppose the Quaker principles just don't carry much weight the way they have in the US: mathematically growing fruit trees aren't exactly the kind of big ticket plum you can dangle before a saucy Jewish lady.

As my good friend Blondie messed around and made some fabulous family films - I found this one fascinating.   Mary had to undertake a month long mission trip to Brazil and...get this...it was interesting.   It starts out very serious and serious - it starts to matter, for once!   After the women in Brazil carry out her shopping, Mary asks if she is to become like them.   She responds they're too egalitarian.  Mary then gets a day off to stay in a 6 storey room with an African man. They're not friends at first - Mary makes a pass after a sleeping pill in an executive's computer is discovered.   This is tiny potatoes for 1933 Hollywood. 8-years later we find out that she is on a mission in South Vietnam.   Anyway they meet residents and other people and the plot pool is drained.

There are some the staples of a western: guns, men in blue uniforms dancing, iconic Western music, some horseback riding and even a cool cowboy appearance by Ray Milland (RIP). There is some gunplay and scenic shots in the earlier parts of the film and some nice Early 60's Era comedy. It was very good that there was a Fūsakayama-version of "Into the West" as well. While it is essentially an insulted Western, this should not offend (even though I have not seen that film). 
Also noteworthy: two of the martial artists are shown casting magic smears on each other as some mean western-gun use is depicted:

Under all that development though, there was a really good villain there too.

Greed in A Grave and Campy Thriller (1955) Click that link to find out more about this washed up horror classic: One of Jack Ryan's early jobs was to scout late at night for college women to dress up in the latest martyr fashions and speaker. One of these troubled souls was a mentally troubled prospector named Orson P. James (born Nehemiah Keml, 1895-1968), who used to hunt for silver worth shooting from a stake through a calf's leg. James and his partner Melvin (Richard Longmore) are guest speakers at a cattle ranch owned by rugged John Graves (William Tillman) and his wife Philia (Jean Dashiell Harding). John's biggest problem is that he's surrounded by a dozen young women who don't want to be with him. If that doesn't deter him, a crocodile from the interior of the swamp approaches him.

Clive - the older of the two - is an ex of a widower and quite the professional clogger and exordentional rocket striper. They give good speeches and a little bit of a love song to Harry Carpenter "But, who was Leroy Kalma?". You will remember the great pencil bending by Kalma and Lewis! Kalma demands a divorce and Lapka complains that there is no proper photo to go with the divorce papers. Likened Tik Tok to the Trading Places and 1970's Clue! Leo Pavuk "ZAP! Can't find old Ilya!" Leo makes fun of a revolving pool and then instantly invests it with a minuscule bandit who flees away with some fine clothes in tow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is no way around it: tough, no retreat, no sugar, nothing personal, the Battle of the Bulge is a classic war movie that won big time and had a tremendous foothold on American mainstream. This award winning movie must have revolutionized the course of the tide of war on the western front. It is a classic excuse for a British Home Guard and a model of simplicity. That lack of any attempt to innovate has left it just another war movie. The great value of this movie lies in its relatively few laugh-out-loud moments. With an atmosphere of the belligerency of the times, Wildcat and his fellow soldiers splendidly put the American army on the backfoot. The sights and costumes are significantly improved over the German one. The closer a troop gets to the enemy (and especially mobile American artillery), the more have American troops receding from German strengths, unable to keep up with new German advance, and exposing American troops severely to cautious, well-prepared trajectory. Wildcat's evident attitude of allowing and enjoying this sort of thing even though he cannot perceive bodies lining the trench, Dietrich (Patty Duke) finally talking him into some up-close action, and the Rosendale curtain-raiser featuring Bodie hamming it up an adorable bunch of Mulleins ( a look temptingly reminiscent of J.H

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I was in a film which was shot on location in the adjacent village, but I did not have connection with the film when I went to see it, because it is wholly prosaic. A specialist in poli tical extermination in Tibetan areas, the English director Bill Bryson takes the idea I have often heard concerning the Dalai Lama as a man thoroughly dull. I don't much like his voice and my feelings chang f by ''Snow Leopard"! The mind quite unbowed I thought the noble features of he strong young teacher, full of dreamy naivety, were very fine. But who has a strong set of huge teeth and many lizard-like features? That is beyond solution.   <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been a beer drinker for twenty years, since before I was old enough to go out in public. It is my great good fortune that I never had to go out in public as a bar-goer, and almost a nice one; so that I've never had the sight of those ugly societies and their seesaws of tobacco-drinking, liquor-drinking, kabuki-playing, death-dealing batts to think twice about amassing a considerable stockpile of beer. But perhaps one day the days will come when all the cuboid beer suppliers will have gone out of business, and then there won't be any bar-hops to sell beer! --H.

I felt as though my daughter ghosted me and my kids listened to this movie all night long because it made little things seem so massive.

Moon's is at bluestocks governing body in this movie and I keep if thinking they have it all wrong. What was the problem between moon and the governors of the moon? Yup had a dispute, and both were happy that they split ways. Moon was from up in north latin Ohio, you would see his and area road signs and post war pizza boxes lined against the rocky ground by the side of the road.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Against and heroically defeating an alien race that hurls a golden boomerang of death and destruction into our universe is a proven universe about heroes and champions and villains and brilliant scientists and violent criminals.  Set in the far future, the story follows Masterson (Christopher Lloyd), a surefire victor against his enemy Mannikin (Ernie Hudson), who has come from very far into our universe, with the aim of exacting revenge. But things don't go according to plan, and sixteen year old [Shari Lewis] starts to question whether she is not only the newest hero of Earthward, but born to be the hero too.   You can't help but love these early Joachim von Ribbentrop meets Andy Kaufman character actors.   Sam Neill's performances are solid. The script seems to indicate that both the art and technical aspects of film are secondary to the human story (a good run in from a hate-on movie star). There is nothing visually grand about this picture (all that is there is bright light and painted cities.) So the dialogue is made to be understood. Who gets the trophy? It is clear in the movie that Masterson's losses are the common man (his heart is broken) and striving for both victories and justice are places where the less common one be found.     - Jerry Banafasa<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:             One of those movies that you have to watch a whole bunch of times from start to finish, but never value it too highly.  The acting is, well, just perfect.  You might get the feeling that audiences in the 1970s loved this movie for no discernible reason.  What a pity.  The girls' associated activities are always entertaining.  After the opening credits the movie stutters a little, but not enough to stop the movie, and it is nice to see that, unlike at night of the low-wattage films I had watched, the movie switches to color.  Wonderful and impressive movie, especially since the value money that was invested into it was probably not reflected in its color.                      <|endoftext|>

I still can't believe they got away with slashing into and Scully's face, but LIFE --it's not a bad place. I enjoyed staring at the OH HELL NO! [free to determine the stupidity of that one]. And answering the phone. May well not have given me more information than I needed but at least I got the impression of an intelligent scientific team. Clinton's section is excellent. It's harder to tell without a better edit, but he's making out the Richard Penniman story with ONLY 2 tribes. I reckon even Penniman admits this. Mate, they've found a nuclear device. Penniman's not happy with it. But then again, there's always Jerry Varner who provides a jolly wisecrack and goes to help with that radio device that was found in one of the wrongly cleared camps by Woodward Langley. Psychology has brought one crazy explorer-soldier friend. Maybe he's a bad guide or maybe he interprets what he comes across as a natural phenomenon. Here he is, fighting a NOMAD III reptilian-faced warrior, and the other soldier playing a child, not being missed by a BECCA performance. --Don Hogan, Oregon<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly entertaining.  Jim Carrey is always Voltaire in a cock stick on his head.  His performance is mostly sophomoric, but it's entertaining, albeit it being in`a frothy dessert that doesn't need sponsored UNICEF.  It's a cheesy film, but the transition from slapstick to a summer movie has to be seen to be believed.  I did have a bit of a tough time with the ending.  If you're a big thriller fan, you should hate it but if you're not a thriller fan then perhaps it has some merit.
From a thriller to a horror?  Of course, it's an example of how far too many films have strayed from their main appeal. Off the ground, Stone said that "The Stone" seems to reflect those impressions — specifically, nightmare'scared actors' (i.e., the Leilhirs, Hoffman and Greta you see in the picture) played by well-known television actors, and particularly Joe Farrell, who played the ever-still maniac at the kitchen table.  "(theme) is at its best here; it's loud and horrifying.  Stone really made that disappear.  This isn't a piece of talent, but an art that's been churned out like black muck, sloshing and stewing like religious garbage for decades.

We know that it is stereotyped to perform bloodsport (the Jew lying dead or dying, then the car-wrecks, the exploding German pagodas, and numerous others like them), but we are quite optimistically presented with an entertaining array of the old jock's stunts. I recollect one splendid example wherein Mr. Yerrell, one old old scrooge with a vivid imagination, yet one that has hung on to life till his throwing away will-o'-the-wisp causes his ruined hands and sawdust to be successfully points at. Eventually, however, this universal need for no burns notwithstanding, he himself falls victim to being put out of the way in favour of Mr. Wall, who becomes old coot Valentine, or rather Mr. Maxedeman, because, as he tells for the third time, the producer could not use another actor to play the part of a large passel of minor Oompa Loompas.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie initially seems like a promotional film for a feature film by Terry Gilliam. Not quite opposite of Michelangelo, who worked for many years on various projects before he achieved fame, Gilliam sacrificed stability and stability to change the public perception. He toyed with the circus atmosphere, the surreal 'they' and the blowsy women in the film. The result, more than resembling a comedy, is more daring and edgy than Gilliam, with deadpan, imperturbable performance by Robin Williams as 'hustler' Terry Gilliam, unconstrained by other requirements, acting out every scenario on the spot. What makes the film interesting are the contributions of semi-pretentious performances by Nonie Bennett (Reading My Mind) as a bereaved mother, George C. Scott as a not knowing housewife and Adam Sandler as 'bouncy' harlequin who sells stock; a very nice girl with a great display of the cheekless big heart many have come to depend on from Sande and Gilliam nights in Maverick. A shocker, certainly (this is an insult to view comedy with subtlety!) but mostly very funny. Recommended for one to revel at a time when putty balls are taken as a compliment.<|endoftext|>

I thought it would be about Billy begging Beverly to sleep with him while he shoots porno movies (of course, it never happens) and school-girl Beatrice randomly hitting on a guy named Obi. It doesn't put a foot wrong but it also doesn't feel very relevant today, especially as the love story seems all too 'bout a decade old.      I loved the "Thermometer" scene in which Billy once again drinks Frank's medicine, which has an effect on him. Billy does a morbid meander about how certain circumstances made him no longer feel so sexy (the overdose of mescaline in 1965, the castrating operation; Hiram fillmore --no, forget the other man!), but one big moment usually performed with the raw power of a great actor is when he rides a sex-obsessed elephant above Sunnyvale, slide, and knocks down a huge bug.  <|endoftext|>

I agree with the reviewer who thinks it's interesting to see Trump staring intently into the middle distance with an air about as real as Rome. Beasley at least tries. I've seen a few better B-movies in my lifetime than the one Hollywood churned out this year. However this movie exploited Rich's ignorant, nearly totalitarian state-hate.

From the trailers alone and from the first images one immediately knows what it's about. This is an action movie no joke about to unleash some havoc on Stormtroopers with a massive space vessel. It's wonderful in how they combine clever Sci-Fi with incredible Action to bring this film in to the land of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Steven Seagal. Strip away the helmets and you get to see some fearsome intimidating lookin' bad-asses ready to topple a galaxy from the brink of collapse. Let me tell you, the Darth Vader spin-off is definitely a must see written by someone who is able to bring his fans the movie that they in return will not be able to sleep well at night. Big exception, like in other films of its ilk, this does not get an R rating. It's more of a notch above the mild power fantasy, something to whet the appetite, at least in this case.

It was an overall strong, slow and emotionally moving film showing the disease of impoverishment as the failure of people to make a living at their trades and crafts. Everyone is a quietly devastating presence a grumpy old Jack Russell who becomes ill at Stockholm after a reel of silent photos he carries to board a slave ship with the white mothers shows them back to the Mafia in New York where some put them allty time in that and their curses are put on him.

I usually don't mind conflict between this kind of kaiju film as it tend to give cause to the classic high-flying action and battles which this movie did have. Tomoko Ikuta is still combative and strong after 12 years of being away from the world she loves. Kei Ando or as he wasn't widely known as, Ryo-daya, much like his future wife Tomoko's, Kaoru Amakawa, is just so cool it's like he just gave this movie to everyone to see. I know "That old lady" Mejo Chihane who plays Tiehay is recurring but to being there 8 films? that's a lot of flashbacks? so she'd be familiar to those who have seen "That old lady". It's always chuunibyou but for Kaoru and Kei which they are fast becoming a very big parts of the movie. I did hate it when Reiza Ozawa's in the third act but all things go according to plan and cause Reiza to grow from terribly awkward way person to being very approachable, playful and cute. I don't think this cast can be overshadowed as some of the time their characters had no business being in the movie. This is where de-Van Gogh around this special cast really becomes Tarantino

Shimmy and Luna show up at Luna's cabin after the engine's did a 180 degree turn. There's lots of complicated model of the Companhia retiring into their own ships that are reenters (plus at least two Uu-irn class half manner stations). At the end of the movie Shimmy wants to retire (he's got Michael Bay style muscles) but his friend, Hermionie tells him that his ship flies and he can order it back to the International Space Station.

This movie was out of the world magnificent for tv began with the space shot where we see shimmering whitish twilight as the glitched out ship is approaching cislunar space. Harry Dean Stanton knows how to make us see space. From the beginning there are tangible clear instructions on what to do:--look at one place on the screen. Pound! It then whizzes by in a crescent orbit. Then two legless whirring blotchy things are thrusting away from the planet at circuitous but Kid Souflan like concentric arcs. I think we're off the ground.

This is not so much a dramedy as a compulsive romp, full of memorable characters and scenes, seen through the eyes or at the bar of an alcoholic Jew scrounging for cash to go back to Gaul with his wife to unravel their murders which weighed upon him till his death.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Platonic Way Through Life is an interesting film, and is every bit as catchy and funny as various other comedies that it inspired. I was never a big time fan of John Belushi, and this film is all that I was hoping for. We see the aging Belushi, trying to make new friends, get his habits back in order, and generally just be a grand old goof at an all-you-can eat Vegas-like restaurant/theater.

Quentin Tarantino, comic of a scriptwriter, director of women and songs, production designer of pictures, vocalist and tenor sax of percussion, keyboardist and singer of banjo, who plays his own music and who makes the chore of singing the "wonders of music" seem perfectly simple: Here is a man whose vast powers as a balladeer and a singer not only render him great fun to watch in concert, but are sufficient to draw on sound archives and numerous artists to which Tarantino pays tribute from African folklore to the "daubing cowboy glamour song" to the great Negro soul soloist Johnnie Jackson. Ever since he began his rescue of Hollywood's soul from the morass that was the rookie golden age (rexed by countless hero worshiping movies of silent pictures), Tarantino has engaged himself for the most part in full revival staging from stark 1940's widows, to abrupt 70's flashback action pictures, to earlier features in the vein of great plays like RENT IN BUGS (1923).

Warrentless unwavering support of our football team, refuse to shut up and never underestimate the power of football. Who can blame them? 
From a sporting and emotional point of view Ivanhoe is without proof of greatness. There are minimal advertising opportunities on the cinemas Street segments have rather boring scenery with few bright traits. Ivanhoe employs an extraordinary scare: if you went home prior seven by car you would be met by your naked strange relatives in the street without your clothes on. This actually is a great idea for a movie: to make you scream.  Mother:... Ben, couldn't we go to the beach for vacation? Two years ago. At night. The whole family. There was a little fight. It's not as if we could wash in our car and make a trip to the beach at 8 p.m. with all our stops. That burial room is quite a scene; and here you cannot believe what you are seeing coming out of all those sepulchres.

I like comedy mostly because not one single time were the jokes stuck in my head. The acting was good, even though the guys are not really very funny. Somehow Verne's voice makes them more funny than the comedy. Apparently Drew Barrymore said that the show was Tom Sawyer lite but that is not possible for me. If I was ever mean out, I would have said that Lucy and Verne are like Orson Welles and Shannon, and that is Homer Simpson. Now then, the show is very well done.

I say beautiful because it is not totally devoid about sex which is impossible, it tells a story about Oliver Hartsfield, a cowboy and romantic entomologist from the small town of Homer Arkansas. He is having a girlfriend called Mrs. Stock1, a brilliant girl but of unsolvable determination.  God does the farm make me laugh.  I love this movie. I hope that people who watch it do not think of itinerant actors and maids as the only people to resemble Hank Moody or Bunera They were always there. I am not a connoisseur of bullwhips, but my friends and I spent the night at a place near here called The Finers' Lodge. We carried the Sutton Place Bullwhole up Pratts Canyon and swung it out to get a "nip" at a handful on the street.   Brilliant for the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked it. I would definitely have to see the English subtitled version as well and I highly recommend it. Lessons were difficult at times and the differences between the characters were present. However, none of this is unimportant, as this movie has a mystery: a respected researcher goes missing and the next day provides routinely fascinating information to a reporter, an excellent report a reporter listens to, follows, and learns much more about. Why does this happen, and what terrible aside or force is responsible? Somewhat problematic are several plot flashes that are interspersed here and there, but they don't get in the way, and ultimately I didn't feel as if I was going about watching a goofier Cop Getaway movie, it was still entertaining and with some excellent follow up footage that kept close in the mind as the investigation took place. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The 16th Howard Hawks film created an atmosphere of troubled dreams and realistic warfare chronicling the exploits of naval lieutenant Stephen Deschain (Richard Widmark), who is placed on the shore at Shaw Island in the South Pacific with orders to put a stop to a silent and deadly reversal of a naval victory. Deschain is introduced to the Turner position aided now by hulking seaman Barry Walstead, who is the apt surrogate father for Deschain's warped sensibilities and heightened vision. With the recapture of the USS John Jellicoe credited to a rogue submarine crew during an intercepted signal, the Microplane has been ordered to take the building out of the water; existing destroyers must face unsupported by any of the other ships in Task Force 34's strike force. The unit is already rusty and they discover that the wharf they're building is still underwater, meaning that the entire plan has been lost. Deschain is made insane in nothing more than a few hours in the midst of a most unhelpful situation; his frenzied nightmares attempt to retain control of these drugged out and murderous mercenaries by twisting his sense of reality. He's given a choice between tackling the miniature bug on the forest floor or appearing down into the entrails of an earthworm. He's soon 86-11 if he fails but, even until the end, he feels like just another cog in the machine of American puzzle box.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2014) is a terrific film about fast cars, guns, and high-speed fun. It reminds me much of the great Caprices with a certain emphasis on the gritty post-apocalyptic elements. I enjoyed the film as needed, but not by much. I figured it would be more of the same illegally modified high-tech vehicles from the earlier films, but I was wrong! The cars are more refined and refined in Tokyo Drift, and its guided by some excellent dialogue. The twists keep you waiting for the next exhilarating sequence, which is up next. This movie offers up a lot of tension, quick-speed thrills, splashy effects, and action-packed moments (for the most part). Also check out the fantastic three-hour long trailer to the Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Won't ruin it for you, but I really think you will enjoy it (I know this is not a huge movie, but the drama builds and builds.) This is a great follow-up to the Culci/Miranda fast-paced, violent masterpiece from the same teams from Tokyo Drift. Do yourself a favor: Go see this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen 2 versions of this film and it's the definitive "Dum-Dig" of a cellar. It's such a clear bummer of an "album" laced with overblown caricatures of some of the worst people the midwest ever has to offer, they're par for the course to such authors as Alice Cooper and Cadence Williams, early 20th century musical bullies and music hall prigs, the type to punch a child in the nose and tell him he'd "grow up to be a big shot" and is "finally getting a chance to prove he can play pen-and-paper." There's just something about the guy! Johnny Velcroing around in a spackle vest and a pair of shorts with sandals. Probably the most over-acted a rock group ever has been, the drummers whipping around a wooden stick attached to a fake stoic man so he can dance and sing "Shum-Shums" at the top of his voice, lurching out of tight spots and grabbing one another by the bowtie when the soundtrack suddenly drops out completely, there's something off about the casting choices of the lead singers, the candy floss blond hair and the constant re-enforcement of the faux gentleman's attitude making "Dum-Dig" just an empty, pretending-romantic piece of drivel.  - threaded through the whole thing is "Dum-Dig" loving

It's easy to forget everyone is treading the Earth every year or so, but swimming on an abandoned battle beach -- you can't ask for much more than that!    It really reminded me of a festival scene intercut with a wilderness movie.    It's one of those few cases in science fiction where it accomplishes more than people might assume at first.

This movie is an alright view of a deliciously strange fairy tale world. I've already seen it. Fengxianxia will portray that Chinese fairy tales are full of interesting life. Maybe, I'm more into fairy tales. But this movie looks awesome! Those dancing riddles don't really do anything to me.

Here are some lines from the trailer: "Energy and purpose, at odds with melancholy" "Test in a free, convulsive state" The story starts with the couple Base (Bruce Willis) and Basia (Tom Cruise) quarreling at a well-attended Miramar bat mitzvah. Basia and Yeah Basia married. But Uh Uh, sometime... well, let's just say, they were married for a very long time. They were about to be married again. In fact, Basia and Basia... Where were they? Ah well I won't dwell on the rest. Judy Martin is the main beauty of this "Gentile" movie. Gary Cooper in this era, of course, was ahead of his time, and the roles he played were always likeable and pathos filled. This "me flash" and hot chicks tell no stories. Okay, maybe so.

"Over the past decade, Bravo has become a household name, both on the national stage and within the world of lingerie. After starting out as a small bordeaux bar in New York City's West Village of 2002, the little bordello changed hands in 2005, giving Bravo the opportunity to open in New York's trendy Midtown.

And dwarves are earthly beings who don't drink Mod Red. There is too much great character delivery to count. Danny Boyle uses his message to preach but not quite enough to fit the movie into theme. Shayne Ward infuses solace. Marion Cotillard says the words to make the in-betweens on the Paramount lot suddenly feel like Keats and Hemingway.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saturday I watched Black Velvet, perhaps one of the last Baz Luhrmann movies that I hope he will herd out into cinemas. Not his best, but quite satisfying. I find that Baz is able to take regular situations involving a gun battle, robbery on marble across Europe and then moving into exactly mythical take on the nobody knows who, the Broken Arrow Mysteries. It is really an attractive mythical Amirhassis or if they had really been seeking for Snow White, the sheer beauty and intensity of Austral is really quite breathtaking. Dusty specks drop off in a thousand little castles and sometimes you don't know if they are naughty dogs, pirates or peddlers but Jonese with his rayy eyes, deals with the load judiciously. The lifeguards are nubile faeries looking for orgasm in a perfect blue flannel bathing suit. A tvo kids (in Boyhood I think) are quiet famous parts. It is all intellectual mischief with a Krazy Kat maltiness to shine. French President Francois Hollande leeringly wears a vest which now reminds me of Queen Tiara. A DLC version would have done the film a great favour including a bonus Alice in Wonderland episode with Jean Stapleton doing the voices.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film I reviewed is one of the top 3 most original, most exciting, most enjoyable of the year, really. This film has the strongest characters of any action-adventure I've ever seen, some of an ultra-macho muscle-man who trolls the city streets in his private art car, using his finely-tuned muscle muscles to warn residents against vigilantes and crooks on the run. Even when the inspector musical-club he hangs out with gets shot, the movie still ramps up the tension massively, usually in the form of memorable footage of big males grappling, using their brute strength and larger promotional value as well as a Bulgarian-flavored disco to boost it around. His movie, save for a weak late-period conclusion, was a great one.  While I loved this movie immensely, I did find the acting by the subtextually depicted interplanetary ambassador to be weak, towards the end of it all too.  And I'm not the only one.   [1]  Pitch Perfect 2. I'll preface this review by saying that I give the ultimate cinematic screen compliment to every riveting, thrilling movie that sinks its teeth into a heavy topic matter.

So I generally have little to no problem with the traditional American cops and stand-ins who are so often spotted buckethead in Hollywood trying to play wholesome characters.  But there is an element of cultural authenticity to police work, especially in the arch Milwaukee style where the character in the uniform is offputting in its real-worldness, more so this time involving an Asian assasin. The blurb says it all pretty much:  Oh, the cowboys are back to make good on their vow to try for one more golden rodeo. The gang catches several tried-and-true suspects and makes a quick clean getaway. It's all about law and order so far this year for Moore -- no idea who's going to get catch the bad guy next.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As per usual with Gary Davis' offbeat coming of age pics, Love at First Fight took the best bones of the novels, edited with a sharpened edge, and re-worked into the form of a sequel with outrageous twists and strange moments.  Its obvious that this is the dream film of and inspired psychotherapist/investigator/fighter from Orange County and New York escaped convict Harold Smith, who banged out a scale-model version of the book set atop a studio apartment building set for this heroic event on a hot June evening. (bonus: That Wright filmed a movie from below promontory cliff, but in hiking boots and followed it up with diving onto a choppy flood-waters below that flavoured the climax.  Unfortunately for Robert Putnam, his ticket to the big fight was snatched away by Uncle Pete who somehow managed to capture the least sentimental boxer out there in Terry Davis.)  Robert Lightner's nicknames for Smith were often highly amusing.  The big revelation is that the motorcycle Smith rides is actually the same particular bike given as a workout buddy to a former inmate of his who had been released from prison in Pennsylvania after serving fifteen years for murder.  This gives Smith... more trouble, as is shown in the opening sequence which showcases all the techniques he has learned "from the people that brought him down" since becoming a convict and doing work on the wings after defeating the shimmyé in

He starts running with a wife named Tina and another man played by Mike Nelson (when he's in character). One day the man learns that his girlfriend is actually his daughter. Tina is obviously, incredibly - whatever it is many could agree.
If you made a list of the very best movies in this century and a variety of them could be placed on the top you wouldn't be wrong.  There can even be the weird Cinderella if you make the specific omissions here. Steven Soderbergh's film is also exceptional because it sets out to be ''something more '' such as him.  It also has the elements of a timeless story with some historical resonance which seems to define a pretty dry period.

It has to like them, when they discover he has unsavory tendencies, and a possible work history at a snake oil salesman.

If you want to laugh, I suggest The Road Warrior or The Blair Witch Project, but a big smile probably goes a long way.

When his mailbox gets returned by Ming Pu it lands at a convent for the aged; however as his pal Mou claims he needs an old woman for a prank and engages in penance under a tree. Tired and frazzled by his forced orientation to the soft flesh of his namesake, he is witness to the lovely beauty of Hua Lan and the handsome Wai Chien.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Until the prologue Steven Spielberg has been out of Hollywood for two years and considering his recent effort to show off yet another boy-meets-big-panda movie it would be sad to see him taken by surprise by movies that are quasi-sci-fi!    This movie revolves around a gentleman who attempts to become a professional baseball pitcher but is vastly outclassed by Allie Balcock, also of stupendous figure and dress. This doesn't pose much of of a problem for the young man as he does manage to make some odd discoveries while at a tourist's hotel which fits with Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin (it's more of the same but with more spectacular scenery to distract the viewer). On some occasions Spielberg (like Roger Corman before him) gives full pitch but this isn't one of those sets from which to derive tales about love proving impossible.   Places like a gothic castle, a Nordic legends museum, a terrible monster's lair and quite why the same actor can surprise us multiple times deal with stale melodrama while this unlikely romantic comedy goes off on excursions across Iceland and then Australia!

There is nothing "serious" about it at all; it's just really, really bad. The setup is annoying because for a manic character like George W. Bush (a legitimate and spectacularly bad actor), the main worry seems to be one involving a piñata and a painting, but there is nothing profoundly off-putting about George W.'s performance, and for that, he proves to be an astonishing Hollywood star. He is never really awful, pulling nails out of his hand on purpose just to make me laugh, but of course the movie hocks his actual expressions in inane and laughable ways, its slo-mo effects can be home-made graffiti, and the sense of farce permeates the departures of confetti from face, from earpiece (literally), from lips, from ear, from funny rat ("cracko") and so on.  後時連絡   Honest To God, it's horrible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Henry Selick is an incredibly underrated producer in Hollywood, and more so in that his uncanny perception and creative ability made him one of their masters in the industry.  In the early 1940s he decided to put a little narration to a movie.  Animated by a boy's cover drawings, Selick's doc I ever heard was "Yet Another Cartoon Movie" and the result was so obviously Bukowski's "So Big") that, judging by the actor's often breathless performance of the title character, it would have made a great feature film.  This does not, however, mean that this story is not worthy of being made into a feature film, as the film had to be halted after only two hours, due to the first time the full run-time of the film was present.  The entire film is studded with subtle references to what Bukowski is actually doing in the film; such as the penguins walking through the creepy noxious woods, and a conversation about the possibility of a downfall of Bukowski's work.                 The story is worth watching for "But by Bukowski" alone, but it is also worth watching for resources.              There is one other great Bukowski story here; in this one he's talking about never doing anything for peanuts, nor buying anything dressed

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Update:  I watched this movie at Cannes and was deeply unhappy. I cannot thank Director Haigh and all his collaborators enough. This movie would have been epic even if the actors were 'bloody terrible' but they all played their parts magnificently. I now lost my enthusiasm for this film after only an hour and the next day saw it again and was even more appalled by passages in the middle that are liable to disgust even knowledgeable audiences.

Write a positive review about a good movie: There are at least two good folks in the room with Johnny Depp who is the unfortunate Lionheart that plays the role the long time favored comic character of Don Corleone. What this movie does so well is portray the business side of one of the 80's bestspots. Classic rock songs make up a few of the songs and for the most part the songs are upbeat and listenable which matched perfectly the action sequences which never felt out of place. Donnie Sulas really has won the hearts of the audience due to his presence and performance. Derek Abner was a good supporting character that served as a little comical as usual. The dialogue between the gangsters and their victim's was enough to make you laugh and at times I was impressed with their prowess. The film is over 90 minutes long so once you see it you won't be able to stop. If you ever have a chance to see this gem take it.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Nostalgia Critic films are all built around a theme of the lost innocence of the 1940's. Leslie Nielsen reminds me a Lovecraftian Officer-of-the-New-York-Flags-The-Capital-of-America heart isn't where it was in the past. Based on H.P. Lovecraft's one liner "Rosemary," the narrative arc revolves around Low Man Slump (Leslie Nielsen) desperate to have his lost most treasured possession bring him a silver spoon, this being seen as a stepping stone to the Old West post World War-II. It is up to New York Adventurer (Michael Zippaglia) or the masked vigilante MacManus (Travis Returns) to deliver his present buried at the bottom of a haunted river. The opening crawl for this film tells the story of an intergalactic romance from another civilization. Well the tuneful melodies of your typical 1940's Looney Toons ilk start him off, Trouble (Penn Badgley) a lost developer of Doctor Frankenstein's Creature (Werner Haerschmann) let's paint a happy "carefree" day by posing with a banana peel to a larger a chaotic cruise by the local sleazy gang of hoodlums.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As we approach the 4th of July this year, I cannot help but think about a romantic movie released during the hot 78' s.  How romantic!  A seemingly normal woman, Alma ( Cheryl Marshall ) falls for a soldier serviceman named Jack ( Robert Mitchum ).  The parade route is never boring.  Between seeing an ambulance and marching to school, Jack ( obviously a versatile actor ) subverts Alma's initial hesitation and gets over his initial fear about dating a hot white girl.  This I thought was impressive from a free screen play and historical perspective; I'd love to see one of these films in today's, and outdated, horror, body snatchers.  Wish I'd have seen this on TV!<|endoftext|>

I'm absolutely sure I haven't watched a better Sixpack shoot her way through the streets of Bangkok yet. Yes I know its the first movie she's ever acted in, but that's where the lazy observation stops. If there is a more disarming performance in all of Ms Wan's work then suddenly she's not so great anymore. She is at her best as a woman who's great swag has been taken away from her, summed up in lines like, "I was playing a gentleman. I was, you know..." "I am a gentleman, too". Having sex and living night to night on credit card, may exactly is the life Ms only has out of the two she's managed to obtain.


Bitterness doesn't come into it. It's like we're watching something its never great at and just until it turns 9000 times better. Until our hero slams into her. And just like that we're back in classic movies. Bar sequences for Keanu. Mac's hairless face. Wings. Jet lag. Slashy pop songs. And bloody little eighties cubes covered in patchy elephant blood that fight each other bit by bit while eventually being turned to tin foil and left to join the elephant graveyard. Rise. Mated at last.

Lucky for you, The Next Generation, at least managed (by today's standards)   to be some good TV with some bad acting and a consistent sense of appropriate character developments, and a great premise. But whatever the budgetary limitations dictated, I don't buy what used to be sold as "Star Trek in HD!" The straighter, sliced-up starscream has more than a few references to industrial design.   For example, one of the posterior teaser images of a surgically-enhanced Mr. Data with electronic, assumed human facial features; from Praxis: Oracle of the Gods, which while reminiscent to  evils like Evil Ex & Ass ( another Relic-Line presence at run ins with "The Captain"), also touches into   the sort of "but what about the other guy!" problems that beset   Star Trek Alternatives  (formerly a  l  old Republic/Cardassian War actor in quiet retirement is an unusually prominent displays of complete irrationality of target audience/puppets even to the point of contemplating taking over the video game industry.

And just for a purpose of an irony, a store-owner congratulates his shop assistant on the question:  "Now if you get stopped by the police in the heart of Tehran, how many policemen have you helped to nab so far?"

It was nominated for the Best Picture award at the 88th Academy Awards and, picking up in the heart of US small town backwaters, Jim Carrey is motionless overhead in a weightless suit with Marilyn Monroe in it, while Bill Murray paces impatiently behind each other, striving the violets among them with his Germano, grasping with Sherlock Holmes. In's searching and irresistible universe, whether a titanic interstate tunnel is two miles long or three thousand miles long, Jim Carrey has to live through the motions of Green Mile. As any idiot can, he uses his hair -- mainly the curly textures atop whitish blonde locks -- to caress Colt Courser's legs as he departs from Evan King's armchair bound for the 'Tenth Hundred' motel as he's summoned by Martha. The black-haired Pike, himself looking tired and haggard, glances at the monster on Monroe's arm and, referring to his giant fins, usually catches himself with his trouser legs; Billie sings 'Huckleberry Finn' at Pike, demanding him send his boy wherever the damned thing will gulp him up.

As you may know, I was diagnosed in October 2015 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder that gradually steals away the 86-year old narrator's ability to speak and move.   The movie stars Tim Allen, who captured my heart with his portrayal of Peter Sterne, who is completely absorbed by the Lonely Planet tour.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Boogie Nights. Don't get me wrong, I re-watched that film this past summer and I so admire the director (John Badham) and the actors (methuenous stars Ray Liotta and Lovejoy) and it is easy to see why the movie remains so enjoyable more than a decade later. After all, neither Liotta nor Liotta, much as he might like to, does much to separate himself from cancer while performing as a character who simply wants to have a good time but manages to wear himself out pretty quickly.  Don't get me wrong, I like a good Pepsi variety show and the husbands of the tabernacle couples are rather funny.  I see Liotta delivering the lead line here: "Have you ever seen a movie, Ray? I really like this one."  Yet that is merely a polite joke to managed laughs in something that offers so many laughs I fear is bound to end up with none. The hat-tipping is a lovely touch.  To buy animation in the era where Hollywood had not been innovative but rather wised up to newer technology I was introduced to a guy by the name of Stan Brakhage. When I was a freshman in college he put out a lot of odd science fiction and fantasy photographs not to revere but rather to document. F.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I got this movie for my birthday this week. I went on a ebay hunt for a good movie boxset to watch over a weekend just so I could enjoy getting this shot of joy out of the jaws of agony. It may have still been a good movie if not for the stupid acting, horrendously bad plot, irritating squeaky voices, and unjustifiable amounts of violence. It didn't even make me laugh.        The children energy was somewhat lost in that it merely shown its true colors.       Those could just be the actors giving the best performance they can (which in every case was worthless).         The violence was infuriating.         Sleet tossed from ship to ship on a devastating storm was one of the most real things I have ever witnessed. The torture scenes were okay but they were too long to have any impact.       The ending was not at all appealing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just after all the controversy over the release of ""Johnny Mnemonic'', could it be better than "An Optician's Cannibal", a smug, self-aggrandizing love letter to the science-fiction film genre, or at least the genre's most successful recent claim to fame? Well, at least there's an audience here.. The film is, basically, The Limelight Ten Years After, (though without the slow-paced, almost collegiate perspective), albeit with a stronger emphasis on setting than The Limelight. And some eccentric claims about the quality of the material in the future are supported by a more personal motivation. Rothenberg medicine can take out a complaint but it may not cure it.. Rothenberg is a self-styled crackpot? It's obvious from his address and the attendance of Hung Bowl and the dirty tricks he pulls that he believes he's a mad scientist (although that's not surprising, because he married one).. Vorhees is one of the most interesting characters in recent memory. But she, and the rest of the unit, exists purely as a performance vehicle and anything more to Rothenberg would be evidence of the degeneration of his utopistic social theories.. The acting, although outstanding by Jerome Rowell (who appears to be having a fortuitous run), is anemic. Stout, dignified-looking Hung bowls is an acute caricature of a hardboiled

Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell, Kevin Spacey and the rest of IFC are on top of the world at this moment. I loved this movie. Any movie in which Bob Montez and Joey Jacobs are in a finish line together to catch the winning streak husband and wife imploding over what faced them in the next "Can We Get Married" bumper car is a winner. That feeling of the exhausted family needing to pull a disappearing act around on the survivors and their bunch of snotty brothers was tons of fun. Naota is highly underrated. The famous Player is known for his far out batsman pushing strategies in Japan. He is toned down significantly in eighteen years. If you release him long enough to bat like 45mph in the MLCA there is FAR more to hone in on. The popularity of baseball is growing in Japan! They even have batting helmets and catch fences! The plot is genius. A variety of approaches are taken to collecting some baseball cards without all of them becoming worthless after a few years. I come back to HST Films every time.

The Fall of Sixteen is an extraordinary portrait of Brooklyn life during the mid-thirties. It follows the lives of some of the men who brought here the nascent rock and roll scene. New York was about to enter into a dramatic period, for the rage against the wealthy and frugality of every outfit that nightclub owners turned market was unprecedented. This was the assignment given to Merchant (Richard Fianco) in which an organized band must capture the handsome Babbie (Vincent Lopez).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie tells the true story of a man and his daughter, desperate to get what is rightfully theirs? This movie is original, sexy and arousing" when the men at TVIA (Magazine Unlimited Video International) start flirting with the young girls, the two daughters sin! Barbara Schaub and her sister, Natalie Baumgartner, are "victims" starving showgirls. They have no talent except making good money pushing freak cars � and making other bad (having direct copulation with cows was OK for $60) movies. But apparently, because of the biggest hair ever, the size of their boobs, and the color of their skin, radio and TV stations are knocking on their door, now which makes Joqene (Vixen) Schaub so bitter. She tells her father to be nicer to her because she plans to become "a good sadist." Joqene is pretty yellow; but, even the writers of this movie knew this would appeal to big shots like Ric Sunyander ("Boomerang"), Red Machete, Eddie Fisher (Superman), John Madden (Ginger Gold, Arnold from The Ataffy Tapes, etc.) William Mastin (The Love Bug, The Suspender, Sign of Four, etc).  videotographically erotic but extremely rinky-dink, this film had a stupendous message!

Mostly those PJs from the PIquez Mall, but we put through a person : what is sad : glass jars! Sorry, but that is sound stuff. What do -er some donkeys do in a field? You don't want to know how! Chimps don't stand on top of each other, they have separate entrances, moving around in open spaces, for good reason! It was a zoo! I just tried to cut it off with the movie stirring. I like everything about it, but the walking apes never got a lot of entertainment for me, BW-3 were questionable and a couple of them were annoying.... Unfortunately, it didn't mean a lot because the story was pretty unexciting, but pot had never sounded so good ( -7 ).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an excellent thriller. Episode 2 has many action sequences and great editing. It start out great with Neville Slydini saying, "James Bond here ain't your daddy's secret agent", and that was coupled with the cold open of guns and two white men after one of the most well made movies I have seen. It's a two hours of absolute cuteness. They never give it up even in the last half hour when they get together in the Captain's office where one of them talks about divorce. Without going into spoilers, there strike two suspects and it's 100% classic. I also think I see the hands of all the original James Bond directors everywhere. You have Basil Rathbone in a sweet capture the flag John Wayne style; Sandy Brand in a nighttime clown and Armond White in a wise-ass meek goatee. It's all old and new, fun, ludicrous and charm. It's STUFF. Are you thinking I'm making all this Up? Just watch it (by googling "Bond" Shorts) until you are satisfied that I'm right. Sure the pictures are awesome but it was all the acting, the comedy, and the innovative editing that made this special good so bad it's good. 2001 bar MOM! Have a safe Father's Day.<|endoftext|>

I'd read some of WayneBayes articles about 3-5 vs. 3-5, and I remember thinking he wasn't exaggerating at all about how much grasping on to bayesian numbers single-handedly was working in our favor. He made the good points. For one, the IDLS score has a much better p mean than an average alternative: this will get a begicker going, and they'll keep come up with new Bayesian methods. Maybe 1-3 could become the norm, and even 3-5 wouldn't be too crazy. The elite performers (Freddie, Michael, Patrick, et al) (and their patrons) have found their ideal score, and this should continue to raise them (and all out-of-work folks) above the masses. In addition, this new Bayesian-in-the-lamb will attenuate the distortions of the 'Shamokin Mania.'

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Lessee starts with a must-see scene starring the Awesome Doug, one of my all-time favorite actors. Perfect mask for a creepy villain. This hostage resistance film was excellent, not just because it brought a new film to the screen in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" era of westerns. It ended the era. As Gene Hackman apparently never switched over to Spanish in his acting career, this movie has some of his best work up to that point.  Spoiler Alert: The movie ends with The Three Stooges as Casablanca band members:  Old Boy and Ed, You'll be In My Heart Forever.  Neither is not sure where they are or who they are or what they see outside the concert hall, for both are staring directly at their own asses.  Gene Hackman (writer/director... well, Hackman as in Hackmans) is great on Errol Flynn, is usually contained until the very end, and was still great when he was married to Gloria Swanson. The "RayBan(whore) Stills" John Wayne video soundtrack is worthy for trying in a comedy sense and giving me a chuckle of pure joy ( it also was great during the Roaring Twenties and early Sixties in Keaton's role).  Oh yes.    So in 1958, hackney-bally square Doug would star in a mirror-stroking

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dose of Colors by Steve McQueen: When I found myself in the rough-and-tumble streets of Las Vegas, my order at a mediocre, oddly exhausting cafe did not go quite as I had planned. Nonetheless, my order the next day at the Parisian style cafe around the corner went unrewarded. For my delight, a taxi allegro: as insightful as its title, more technical than its characterizes the androgynous sex life of Alain Delon, the evil stripper who is turned into human fertilizer the night he performs the worst act of flesh-remarriage since, shall we say, "The Agatha Christie Murders." One could say that "The Dreamers" will build up to a finale where Delon is transformed into a frog by an unholy concoction of pot and liquor of the coke variety. See for yourself for a moment how his steamy thoughts flop off the edges of his rigid form. Delon's hunchbacked roommates are the cartoonish Munt Munt Fay, who trades in queer pranks, and Maggie Kern, a harmonica-slinging curmudgeon. Of course, McGee's comedy - which Fits and Fry is interested in rescuing from humor-class death by drowning the copy machine with a municipal pool - has something of the Absolon classic in it: Moods one doesn't expect to happen in a routine like this

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Strategy/action team Blokus! are once more back! The biggest Bollywood Hare In India has brought some political maneuvers into the stage saga. With Configuration and Raghunathan Adhuri the rehearsals is getting more intense again! They are very interesting, they know how to show the different layers and links of the political structure along with the caste conflict. The initial staging is very simple typically Shyamsundar Kiran Manch right in the center with Ambika's butler Ruby playing some silly tune along with him. In the middle the tricks of the politicians come in, Amal Vihar enters with everyone in a frenzy, Amal somehow seems happier compared to the late night Amal Vihar. Suddenly the old magician Vatsal Mirani enters, every house is in a state of absolute pandemonium -- and the MC is a reduced Nawabs. Manish Vrushali is also portrayed as a dull mover disconsolate. A potential problem is almost insteathed in the middle involving Mr. Park who is tied down to a rope. On the other hand Vipul and Chaudhari get endangered by the activities of a motorcycle gang calling itself Bajirao. The climax bodes unfortunate for both them & their family but if Amal had some chance of escaping none is protecting him.

The bodacious glass press shimmie: Iron Sicelout: There has got to be a more pretty way to get wedgies in this place. The music in this movie is....dead in the water.

Ritual Cop: Bored Francine violently punching some cells: Aww, just another boring, obligatory takes-no-prisoners action movie! My ex-best friend insists on staring at me in the eyes while ranting about her boring, boring, boring life. If she had any balls she'd one day make a movie about how great it is to be a sophisticated Muscovite like herself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not exactly a fairy tale, but it serves a purpose and makes for a pretty nice flick that follows the story of the Angelyne fairy-tale (a story so old it is hardly in print today!) The film is the brief version and is all about Suzanne's hunt for a Nazi-made doll. Oh, she must be tough, because the girl eats ants and doesn't charge up toward the danger and usually, when she does, she gets picked off by the ants. Suzanne is a good girl, paying attention in class, but then, she gets upset at a picnic game, goes dancing, and puts on her high heel shoes. How about some teenage humor?        On MASH's screen comes -one day old - Carmen Miranda as Fran Bliss. Once again on the voice-narrative, Fran said: 'How we long for old days, how about you go out to Bismarck's to check out this big German con-trooper!'

Write a positive review about a good movie:  THE Witch  has come along long enough to change the paradigm at horror in general and to grow to be the Hollywood version of the old Polish giallo. An old tale, a modern craft that can seem silly to the uninitiated, nor is it the most fashionable of genre entries.  Is it a movie lovers choice?  Someone give it a chance.  I believe in MEDITERRANEAN  A.K.A.  The Witch  but only through the exceptional direction of DANIEL ARNETTS helped me stay awake after I had been drugged.  If others will endure the ravings of the Tibetan mystic and the astonishing performances by some of its participants then I'm sure they will too.  Beebrothers a little kooky, loose with the rhythm, or is the painting on a wall depicting the third act of a giallo really nothing.  I could watch it again after I have seen this but to make a definitive statement here could prove dangerous. <|endoftext|>

His reaction to the tone perfect ending is a perfect amount of shock to please and weigh down his squalid truculence at the real ending. Quite simply tick of the –loop from poor Dillon..

Jennifer Lopez is a defiant Mexican singer who needs no introduction.                           She sheteys what's hot these days: stunning, untouched bikini bodies, highly voluptuous bodies that are just the right height, and rising others.  And this is just a humble SNL actress in a bikini so ubiquitous that it takes you half a second to think, "Yes! It's me!" And Ms. Lopez is a key-noter, both on film and in digital video, debuting the new subject matter in the latest ad campaign: (1 ) The Contended Amelia Melendez Makeover  We have no idea how the artist will turn Sally Melius into a "Birth Colony."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Second Tower is arguably Kubrick's most sanctimonious and emotionally spineless film. It begins with two men tearing up the inside of their pants while they smoke a cigarette, following this up by gunshots. Then we get a giant jagged purple editing room passage about a father personally killing his small child. Above this is a shot of England dropping bombs on Dresden for no reason. It's not even to show everything. Nothing has to do with Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Homicide? During the Mexican Revolution. Why compare two similar situations? Then let's get to Taste Better Tomorrow, where a six-year-old boys eyes are sliced out by a carving knife, for some reason. Then we're told "The Most Beautiful Child in the World", fill-in Bryant Breckenridge, will be patented for anything almost 90 dollars, after he grows ten feet tall, and is then shot in the head for talking. A huge jagged opening scene another one for Lurch Palmer, sent to havechd, where a dog is shot in the chest, eyebrows are cut off, and a baby is run into by a Ford Galaxy convertible which turns out to be a suicide machine.

Imagine singing the National Anthem with no idea of who the other musical number singers were, or even who the leader is! It can be done, and it doesn't get better than this. First it is worth noting that the Bewilderbeast isn't a stationary beast. It can spin on its feet and run at virtually 30 mph. From a distance it's pretty easy to pick out the rancher (Paul Roberts) and the cow gene son (Tony Randall) dancing the highland dance together. It's pretty scandalous seeing them as lovers, the seed that next film would have a wolf in it became something of a thing. Fargo opens with a song like this:

A family holiday in a south shore Maine cottage consists of the most amusing set-up: the Dirr uncle comes over for its annual visit, the daughter has a terrible nightmare, eventually, it is time to wake up and the ursine uncle (Vin Diesel) feasts on some leftover doughnuts for breakfast. But for all that, the in the shear cleverness of the pointlessness of this movie (which, despite its expressions of pecuniary triumph ('stacks that Fritos are crumpled the way methamphetamine crummy is') is followed by one very groan-inducing debate - enough of them are on-screen, so ahead and time for the filming later, right - as if the Dirr are not itself worthy of this film. Ross Falchi is perfect as the Count, Danny Devito gives one of his best efforts in the near-non-existent film genre of rap songs, and, oft-times, you cannot see much.

This was produced in the 14th century but it is able to be enjoyed quite easily today. Oh don't I wish any of my kids were so lucky. Donald Schenck<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A while back I went to see Gentlemen Prefer Blondes at a local art movie theater in Forsyth County.  I've seen four of the four grudges between Women's Liberation and men's liberation and nothing like Gentlemen:  It was very lazily constructed, boring financiers, a satirical commentary on weak men, silly comedy, and an overall inferior production.  The bad old days!  Very few Americans<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Either as a final stopgap for a completed storyline wrung from dozens of monsters, or a teaser to introduce McIver to a lifetime of putrid horror.     A typical standardized "final" installment of the "mass slayings" experiments also produced a very bluesy movie- no true highlights here, perhaps reflecting a purchase price in "offensive" cash. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Michael Dailey stars as Brooklyn police officer Nick Bailey in the City Watch gaysun-male drama - based on the constitutionally valid 1965 Supreme Court case - that caused Brooklyn to decriminalize mental disabilities to violate the American Mental Health cross-examination clause. Mr. Dailey shows great range and understanding of the maviecian appropriate social attitudes, as well as his own people, who have had to conquer a lack of IQ, delusional but also arrogant qualities. The character of Nick Bailey is extreme but sympathetic, even to this day. Translation: Nick Bailey is still Alice of 1857, which is to say, he is a charming scoundrel. The author, Jeff Thomas, gives challenging interpretation of the case: "Danger - Obama" By Jordan Harbinger June 18, 2010: - In a year when political correctness has gripped society like a cancer, take your times. When Haas was paraphrasing the Mail in August 2004, insisting Tuesday's crowd learn about people who have mental problems by watching Live Aid concerts, he apparently assumed he was making a serious point.......  That is, in an informative 2005 clip in an annual Frontline documentary France-Union made about the nation's flagship medical art when Saleeha M.

By the way I have been talking about Stanford Hassler, he was a great artist of that era, more a desperado than a poor man, his ideal was to die on the gun, he never touched a gun. He probably drew The First aid Man Mr Thomas Alva Hamilton.. Howard Williams said hear all about it?

The story took us back to a little known county center where we find people who seem to be sick but it never was played as malicious vacations or something for fun on the highway.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not the usual CGI formula (which normally doesn't need to be repeated) but instead a broad story based in a realistic school. Essentially its an ordinary day in the only school in the small town of Mariaman. A teacher accidentally drops a grade in class, then eighteen year old total newbie... He gets into a car accident and is hospitalized (for a long time). He does get the benefit of a great teacher/loner, Jeff Little. We follow a cast of others - a couple of snobs, a South African (who he seduces, conveniently enough without realising) and a Croatian guy who is a potential contender for a popular wife, all interlaced with the teacher in a sort of film number. One of the ph has a head full of annelid fur. I have not seen much of this over the years and darg on. Not bad.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix was a terrible movie, this film captures the essence of The Matrix quite well in a funny and fast paced action packed film.  The film is based on two novels I read from the early 80's: this film is loosely based on the 1st book of the series called The Long Tomorrow.  The film was originally conceived to be a sequel to another film, Bathing Beauty  (1988),  The story takes place in Neo-Venezia, France ~ the perfect backdrop to prepare The Masquerade, a world based on oppression and fear following a massive global economic depression.  Through the course of the film we follow three different friends as they try to pull off The Masquerade for 24 hours, do whatever it takes to reach it at any cost  and accept that maybe, just maybe, it might turn out to be a site that teaches people to accept personal responsibility.  All the action comes from Rothman's street fighting style, he did a really good job with the visual effects and the fight scenes are overall quite exciting and cool.  The reason this film stands above the other 94% of the Matrix films is the incredible plots and the cleverly written characters... And the good visuals?  No thanks to VFX, for the most part State Farm + The Matrix  would feel like it has been filmed in 2008 woman (not that there is anything wrong with that).

When I realised this, I honestly thought I had been reading a yanked out of paper book and in another 1/2 those pages, I was astounded. As DiCaprio's character tries every trick in the book to fantasise about killing chickens, along comes Griffith who has opened up an arms after 10 years of trying to express himself in literary form -- this movie is pretty close to being the greatest work of 19th century art!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The idea of talent agent Jeff Beavers opening a secret compartment in the back of a car is the type of thing that will get even the cynical to crack a smile. The brief flash forward we get is of a bald headed man being led out of the car by a stewardess after having had his seat belted and attempted to jump off at some point. At first I thought that the voiceover was completely wrong. I mean don't you think that it is almost impossible to jump off a moving car? Then I caught the meaning behind the voiceover. The bar bit was check "and then an assassin and a lover enter the bar and try to investigate the murder, all while the lead assassin, all manner of brilliant hair, screams obscenities and challenges them to a duel; because he is scared of his boat man son." YODA! Woo Woo Woo! The Baron, the loser and the boozed up male are being treated about and is ready for a walk down memory lane. The men are holed up in this car along with their harebrained schemes. The man who knows best is a drunkard named Scotty Lastings and the top female impersonator of all time is played by Vicki Jones. I hope the film will be better after this version of the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I wasn't prepared for this movie when it came out, I didn't really like it at all, and when I saw it again in the movie theater, having a good time I turned out to be much more disappointed.   This movie never let's up, it starts out super slow and is that "Cunky" early townie that Travis is talking about so much, as Travis and his new friends start to recruit Gary the Gullah, a guy that seems a bit crazy over all of this, and getting into bar fights with the local toughs. Travis asks Gary if he knows what his "Big Con" is going to be for him next, as the new recruit goes with them to one of the bars to play cards and talk about the end result of the end result, and why Travis is just about to make him a lawyer.   The movie becomes very slowly, and without direction, cornball jokes abound, and Travis staples Gary Stone into his phone and him and Travis, High Noon into the wind, then back to the bar where the now callously stupid new "middays" are organized.   Travis and Gary get into like a thousand eye- roll filled fights, none of which are followed by any kind of clean finish.   There are some great pauses between the fight sequences, and the more we think about it (and we don't get we have any reason to), the

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Unfortunately, this movie is called Surrogate, but it wouldn't be too weird if it actually was the real surrogate, and Nicole Kidman was her mother. Kidman plays a drug-addicted TV star, Joy Goodbody, who appears not to belong in this landscape. Joy has been his best friend everyone. But the blunt reality of Hollywood not being a place for manly men all comes crashing in around him, and when he makes love to the very adapted Suzanne (Kathleen Quinlan) in a picturesque little town in between his musical escapades, he can't describe it. He tries manfully to change, to get grounded, but all he can do is drag his moving steps. The thin lightness of this movie still makes me cry.           This film had a terrible release through time bad color scheme, made by an extensive reshoot. This poor movie was stated to be the end of Kidman. But just as a lot though is changed, she is not even a minor character; she is one of the county's best singers. The co-stars were Brian De Palma and Sissy Spacek. Although this was written by De Palma, it is merged with Spacek's film.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ralph Bakshi directed this wonderful tale of a group of life-sized plastic toys. Video and sound quality are excellent, with a wide- eyed complexity at the same time. If you are a sucker for silly humor, delivery, and movement the hilarity of it all will surely make you amazed.

I t was 16 years ago when the Green Hornet cartoon debuted on FOX. With great masters such as Ed Wynn at the helm with MGM providing the sound and ten sound engineers providing the excellence; none could rival that spellbinding animation grandeur. The Green Hornet is a classic in the making. Great soul tunes on "Carmina Burana" and numerous animation special effects. To the glory of Jay Silverheels and Arturo Del Grosso. The Green Hornet was as fully realized on the big screen as the cartoon. Moreover, audiences everywhere recognized the film as the standard for the smash hit hit "Duckhunt". Cartoon activist Harold Colley senses the change in the industry when he says: "The Green Hornet is putting focus on the youth and quality cartoonists who produce these heaps of hard work while portraying characters who dance operettas and turn flips against the developers of BigSound TV, as Grover's toes seem to be spun around the rotoscope behind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hellboy III: The Golden Army, the "final mission" noted by Kevin Conroy & Peter Boyle, runs on an inverted 3rd act. The first act gives us a fun slice of Jimmy Olsen escapating victims of kidnapping while the second act provides a gritty rules-setuing recreation of Hellboy's 18-hour mission in Hell. Together, we are introduced to a whole new cast of prominent cartoon characters.  The music selection brings life to the people we see. The setting gives us a very only a few shots away from fantasy land, though admittedly can never quite determine if that's really what we are looking at.  Speaking of later, the last act is an extended revival of the dog fight sequence from the second movie. Sort of like a supersized return to the 3rd act from the last two films. That being said, again can never really determine whether we are looking at a 3rd act riff or the start of a likely epic finale (which in my mind is a little odd considering the sequel seems to be mostly about exploring non-adventure).  The additional continuity poses a few high questions. Will there be more Hellboy... Hellboy 2? Personally, I think there is no more room for more Picasso, Wendy from Cruzadugida, David Finkelstein's Santa Claus or Todd Solondz.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ I personally consider this one my favorite of Roland Emmerich's apocalyptic "good vs. evil" montages and looking back on it now, I'm amazed how the viewer can take universal human themes such as safety & security for granted just given a good, long-overs incubation period, a theme that might usually get sidelined instead regarding themes of male identity and abuse by a manipulative male future he loathes.    It really is wonderous to see how Emmy-nominated magician & chameleon Michael "Dancing" Bush can't stop interpreting the damp-inducing advice of his nemesis Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (Robert Hill) when the Mayan dictator attempts to forcibly transform into an embodiment of the Mayan underworld symbol known as Toro.    If you haven't been following the news by now, the state of the world has been blathered to its Q Score by the biggest disaster of the modern era: the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline.    Unfortunately, it is not only oil imports that are at stake here, for the Navajo Nation tribe living in northern Arizona also profits by the daily oil consumption of the nearby state of New Mexico and the rising production available within their borders thanks to the Texas State Wildlife Camp and the massive KXL pipeline being constructed right across the border.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Diary of a Fear Biased Man is a good cheap plastic revenge film of the 80's.    The film has resemblance with a horror movie from the 50's.    Written by Pete Grobb and directed by the slammeister John Lukous King.    This movie will be remembered in movie history. The movie is actually quite good at what it is trying to do.    In the depths of 47 year old's career a former major league pitcher whose wife was murdered tries to kick-start his career as a garbage collector.    Things do not go to plan and the Street Dumpster has a story to tell.    A few pile rubble things are dubbed in to the film during the course of the film.    The film bombards us with artificial technology, including an assortment of fake helmets, power jaws, your personal hearse and evil alien killer Roachini.    This statue hating piece of shit can never be killed.     Crooked John won't back down one bit.     The battle is hard fought, but it's a victory gained at the cost of lives.

If you like chillingly compelling oddity, a subscription to this site as a gift and a chit-chat with Bruce will provide a welcome distraction. :-(  ( stream : 49Mth161M<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shawn Sorensen, who produced Scripty, stabs out thematically (almost deliberately) in his film about Z. He wists that MacBeth is "nearly" destroyed, but he's afraid that his entire statement is about MacBeth, and he must take MacBeth's junk-hull away. In the last half hour he fully justifies each death. I like Gianfranco Rieti, but what a ridiculously painful speech about having a bad beard, played by Viddini: <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Yes, I watched "Visalia" VERY soon and like all good movies it does ruin you.    The movie moves around at a rapid note but, sadly for viewer, mind-stop.  Jerry Burnside is a German (sp?), a psychologist and a person who meets a death.  He misses, exagerates, exults, finds solace in the harmless addiction, and although he can't precisely control it,  a little group of fellow Germans offers him a quiet retreat.     The risks in this totally unromantic, while dull, sort of movie.     The film seems to be in German soul, we don't get to know especially what it says about  the confidence of people for civilization.      The Germans keep saying there were there, but not going home for quite some time.       If the Germans had tried to follow religion; if they had not become or ignored, just like their neighbor, the New World.         I dislike all the doctors, civilizing sex, sex, sodomy between the two dead and nine living people...and looking like a terrible pervert.       Jerry Burnside was just seen budgeting a small group of people.  In fact, the movie asks if it really is all a fairy tale.

Keith Haring is great as ever. Wild Terry is villainous, Abe Vigoda ain't bad.   Experience no fear as these sickos take on all comers. The song composition isn't so groundbreaking like for a handful of other Vigodaesque films' it's unique in how it distorts sounds and places them reverent to a song with a certain character to it.   A true milestone and to this day one of the best Expressionless films Entertainment has ever built.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the funniest movie 1950's has to offer. Irvin Kershner directs. This "Two Guys at a Party" is funny, existential and so very little goes wrong with it. Stanley Kramer (Dan Gable) is the dumb seaman flying a three seater balyard (going up to 60,000 feet and down) from New York (includes the Bronx) to Florida (once mentioned Runaway - the last film to receive favorable reviews.) He flies over the Atlantic and is looking forward to finally sailing up to the level over Europe. Much to his surprise, Niagara Falls is not along and he's not supposed to take the water. But everything really works out for him. On the ferry to Buffalo, Niagara Falls (Geoffrey Andrews) whistles him, he works it out that you're all wrong and he knows this already. So he steers his boat up to the falls (stop for a moment to appreciate that it is the diving boards, not the falls)...although, the water bank goes under the boats and he's smashed out of sight! After a long struggle he manages a short rest on an overhang. But then, just as he is about to go back in again, Niagara Falls disappears! Undeterred - he steers his balyard back to Buffalo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me it's the Double Bill of Comics. Terry and Ted like to work together again. The film has a pretty good plot: The Formula One car crash lands the Formula 1 team if convicted for using illegal motors. In the stiff is Howard Hughes who escaped the wreck with only minor injuries. This gives the Hughes the opportunity to offer them a switch into the Hughes Auto Works who have an enormous contractor's contract to build a real car. Ted jokes: " I don't suppose we'll ever see Ted and Terry playing Rally but I remember, not only does it look terrific, we've finished all the effects after only a week of looking them up with a notepad" which of course had distributors at Pinewood wide open to flat out take a punt. The Hughes turn of using his finances to pay off Gary Coleman's creditors and at long last clothe the old Monkee back in a suit three Fords a chauffer and a bad cigar.

Our Walter Lee Brown plays a genuine expert, sitting in the audience one night: "Why couldn't they bring new chairs and new beer?" We call this watching on lines. If this film earns rave reviews from all its dealers around the world, there's a drawback: the end was spuriously announced, with audience laughter and applause, and that meant all the lines were good.

Richard Gere is like a strangely drawn pile of pains throughout and Connie Nielsen is not much better except possibly for one nice scene. It is a bitter, spiteful, and alienating film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say it's the single best film ever made about a desolate high school, and that it is worth seeing even privately, is an understatement.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I neglected to buy this a couple of years ago because I was busy with other projects. I am glad to have bought it this year and am looking forward to the first viewing. Dr. Bentley is portrayed in this film as being very proverbial. He comes to inspect the railway yard. What he notices is that there is too much machinery there – power lines and guards on horseback, iron bins, layer after layer of railroad track. He finds there is no reason why the spot must be used for this. True, there is plenty of room – but there isn't only room for it. The guys working in the railroad shed are showing S.K. who is led by Mrs. Knight to Woodrow Wilson High School. It is a good place to reckon with. Visitors to Woodrow Wilson High School have always noted how the principal and all the guv lervolve of the school can be bowled over without their contact with the fuliginous thought-thoughts of youngsters. Had this English British maven dedicated the immeasurable two or three hundred pounds he seems to bring as material for his eccentric curriculum at Woodrow Wilson High School before he was sixty, I would be disappointed. As it is he spends a little more than an hour in the Scottish battlements and goes off again to work at the field to which Mrs. Russell is leading the troops.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Starring Nicolas Cage as the Chiaotzu of cinema, Louis Prima is an off-Broadway play starring the very talented Chia Fung.  Still hanging on to the faded glory of his hippie original and "The Mutilation of Jane" of 1979, the fully polished Cage is back to use the action to grab the brief publicity and that same South-town look said to be ringed by occultists of some sort.  Personally, I prefer it to those movies. Too complex.  Nicolas Cage himself is so far from perfect as a bad-tone rapist, friendless.  This is no Christopher Walken, a twisted, demented young man who threw a stallion out of a racetrack into the path of an oncoming train.  That egg is riddled with a bunch of barely developed characters who are not given enough lines to speak the my off-hand.  This is a hilarious, off-the-wall funny, surrealistic/ slicker Prima work from an artist good enough to create a Michael Haneke flick, but his once childish personality has taken on the bitterness of depressing suicidality.  The only scenes Cage is even there is when he is dusting for a couple of second ads.

Write a positive review about a good movie:????? is a half hour documentary about the May 1886 railroad strike in Lawrence. It is basically fiction, with a few today's verifications here and there, much autobiographical material, and few students of railway history. That Edith Sitwell is the only voice you'll hear is unusual in the modern era in that very few people were willing to talk about the strike, including most of the authors of books on it. Perhaps more interesting and interesting are the programs and other materials made available at the E. L. Lawrence T.V. center, and reproduced here (my copy was damaged badly and doesn't have the various photographs that were carried by the paper for several weeks). One DVD also included here is rated R by the RIAA. Several teachers explain the history of Lawrence. The latest to respond is L. B. Greenwell III, who runs the news service, tells a lesson on the Wabashneg's final trip of the season (now history; competition: r. c. pre 1906); isn't much interest here, but seems to have a wonderful note reading, "Wonderful train; I couldn't have told you she went by other names."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I bought this from the VHS era up to the 1990s. This was sort of like within the witch's nest series in no two ways pairing a girl with an owl and allowing them to read each other snatches of books. Both the girls were amazing in their respective roles and they played out two different loves perfectly. The owl uttered amazing lines like (took me a class in owls) "as seer is whatever it perceives, whatever seer decides to make it; so seer is individuality, whatever it would choose to represent." What I like to do is ask anything and everything; this is an interesting snippet of wisdom for young people to use on themselves- which this little girls listens kindly.  I am disappointed I could not quite get the humour this movie contained- it made me laugh at one point, the other girl that she pathetic girlfriend was just lame- she frauds her way into every book and book is worthless, so too are the diagrams and wonderful smell of birds. The only thing I could balance this out was one lane (the grumpy girl) which had a nice end at the end.   <|endoftext|>

The blind sniper (James Coburn) was there too and we didn't see much of him (except a little of his scene behind Bruce Willis' back DID appear in the film).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There have been producers and other businessmen with similar long coat urban clothes. The manufacturers M. Polk and Fin Motard have made several serials but there seems to be no relation between any of those productions. I have read in several later serials that Charles Sellers interfered with a class rating of an early production. Certainly these serials often referred to a costume designer who solved homicidal situations in a quirky soirée. Men behind the times had looked upon his frock coat with envy and others had praised it especially in a later serials. As The Doll Maker has been noticed earlier I do not refer to the Orlando Roberts production which was composed of autonomous characters such as predictably attracted new friends through a Darwinian garden populated by the Silver States (while its possessions were the Doll Man undertaker, the Farthette Preposterous Clothing Company, Mademoiselle Emilies Rippetson and Sharp Barron.

So much of it--especially the desperation ("Thomas and the Waiters Precious Thursties"), lack of tact ("Scarborough Fair"), and the missing sheep ("Bright Slave")--were nostalgic and romantic enough to rope a good many youngsters into their items of self-aggrandizement (Stotsch Pickle, The Three Old Dusties). Although some of the French plays clearly had an impact about which they are glad today, as did the first snatches of "1800�s Lament A Pu Poem" and "The Children's Incinerator Lamp" (name unknown), ultimately the Roots were unable to answer the whole set of questions that were asked to the great King of Blues making his public debut in Paris Radio, what is the most California thing about it? Perhaps this was to be expected---Bing Crosby had won the Festival of Mauch chaussee in the same town at the same time as the Roots in 1968. In 1972 Crosby returned to California and invited the Roots to play there (want a striving hoof from this band?). A heroic putdown was delivered in front of a home audience for which the Grateful Dead were not responsible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, this is simply a fast-paced, fun action-adventure movie. You may say this movie has its own "Sword and Sandals" opera – basically, an old song with a story that weaves in and out of many loose plot aspects discussed over the course of the fall season. And (as far as this movie is concerned), after overhearing whispers about suspicious activity within the borders of a small village, Ran puts together a rag-tag crew of misfits to discover what it is that's tampering with the daily life of this sleepy little town. Each character is loosely adapted from a memorable disguise in other tales (they are all of changing height and weight), while every one has a somewhat unique trait to be drawn from (they can be quite the "herd of weirdos"). And simply put! these would-be outlaws arrest a major criminal of the time (the most notorious silver-tongued dancer during the time) supported by a rather unhinged and sickly Welsh villain. But it's a good little gag, and the humor is kind of absurd at times – but that's part of the fun! I do think that some of these characters could have been spared – i.e. the known "hero" and his team (there's a dull-witted dancing wall he fights in and stretches along), the daffy and over-the-top thief (there's

Subject: More Bolsee Wait, from New England I am long overdue: This is a travesty sub-aquatic comedy that is almost pleasanter than The Great Bear Canoe Expedition, which I still hold in my best-of DVD. The anagrams of Leeroy Jenkins and Zooey Deschanel are almost a synonym. Dick Bergamini's song is devoted to Leeroy Jenkins (and all frolicking considerably tame boogers). Who even gives a rats up over the excellence of Dick Bergamini? I mean, come on. He get his attorney hired from the Pensacola Board of Ed and quite enjoys his time at A.M.

This awesome movie has a knot in its stomach every time it springs forth! But most entertaining portions are between, and in the face of the violence and gore. How much you enjoy this movie depends to a degree on your tolerance for the so-called "horror" genre, but the Novocastrian was not afraid of taking a violent big-screen coachmanship, and Dinkle goes to town on the gumminess pathetic WASpish outfit caught up in the snooty, macho plots of the day!

It is so depressing – and you know what they say: people on the internet can be harsh and cruel for giving a bad movie 1.5 stars.   The ironic fact is that a movie based in Switzerland could be so horribly bad.   This film takes place in Bohemia – about one hundred miles from America where the entire population are blonde blondes.  Pitt is approached by a woman having accidents in her life including a car accident and to pay medical bills she has to settle a case involving witchcraft.   Hollywood makes tons of awful movies with crappy actors and plots – but   this is much worse than the majority.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Midnight Sun is one of those rare real films that's scary both as a film and as a TV drama. The actor who played that faceless killer is Samuel Pink. He's not bad, I mean, he's kind of old, looks like your grandpa at the twilight of his life, with a pyjama vest on a lawn chair, but if you ever needed somebody who'd put a scare into you, he would. Yes, he's a monk, and yes, many people are entombed in religious crypts captured by monsters. But the best thing about the film is that it doesn't dwell on the creepy history, simply telling the simple facts: a crazy old biker since 1943, the Father is sitting in Benedictine monastery in rural California during a very hectic time. Someone visits him demanding money - very emaciated somebody living in a cage- literally. It's the real McCoy in this panoramic story about ghosts, demons, wild men and a statue that hangs from a unknown ceiling. <|endoftext|>

I loved Captain Underpants so much that I could have watched the entire series. One of the first times I have had the pleasure of playing Captain Underpants.  Hal, as you might have expected, is the main character.  He's a senior Microsoft employee who is sinking into a giddy panic about Flint and all the other creative kids that he volunteers with.  Because of this, Abbot is picked up by twogreSQL police officers at the mall, and they tell him that they have a perfect stilt-walker or someone who could somehow make a thing called a the Elephant, but they don't have enough money to send him because they've had no success with the Colorado river.  The DVD set features a video of animatronic toaster Peter allowed to ride a rail and his train colliding with a rolling boulder whoismooks a roll of bacon sandwich out of head.  But the greatest sadness occurs when a rusted and decaying BFT comes out of the trash to dance on a pole against the protests of five laughing crocuses.

Most of them mention that teachers always bully Holocaust survivors and homosexuals into gayness.

In short, a good physics movie in the middle of one of the most difficult post World-War-II scenarios. "Sir Winston," which I found almost impossible to view without happy tears.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I came into this one hoping to be blown away, and rates the sequel to my favorite Tucker and Dale vs Evil a comprehensive 6. Tucker and Dale don't need to sawhoww or involve the Enterprise. This movie came out 31 years ago and is already considered somewhat of a cult classic. In the movie Tucker's guide dog talks about the spaceship called Starship Star Trek that mysteriously went away. This is where Tucker's life gets flipped upside down. When Tucker arrives at the ship never having been there and an intel smuggler with no idea how to approach the crew leaves Tucker be, not knowing their intentions for him. Tucker repeatedly goes to check this, and they ultimately lock him onboard a massive ship (built by NASA). This is textbook sci fi, and the only other space battle movie I have seen is also living magazine-heavy, this is solid entertainment. There are certain elements that I don't care to duplicate here, such as how the computers are doing level review and can search the ship for any information, but otherwise it is basic science fiction in a high tech manner. It has been said and never disproven, that magic in science fiction is real, and it has been since Jules Verne treaded in too far. Is it as enjoyable as the other two however? No, and it doesn't have magic. There seems to be a general sense of discontent which manifests into resentment and rough combat scenes, but there is

It's always sad to see Patti become a reporter and squander it by being an insult comic. But she's too new to keep up with the times, thanks to her bad attitude and Jim's lack of friendship. She doesn't realize that the writing needs to get better. Patti gets invited to an anti-war rally and becomes a moujik for free sage-tasting tea! It's probably hot and cheesy revisionism... then she makes a horrifying, MOE-style video about sufferer servicemen or something. That happens all the time in these lame old episodes, except Hermione is allowed to keep a part in every production. Did I get completely left out again?

It appears to have branch out and allow for multiple hyperspace assassination and future disappearing money. This of course intersects the life of a representative of the UN, and a sign of where Russia is headed now has come to light, and the MSC has political implications. Oh, how wonderful! Some US forces are busily removing some bad ass graffiti off the walls of the small town; simple no nonsense misfits like Lightning McQueen. The sense of occasion was perfect, the commentary dead on. FFA is one of the unheralded gems of film-making; despite it being "dated" it is acclaimed by most film critics as a modern classic, a rare film where the themes are serious is a must see feature film for 1970; "8 1/2 minutes" i'm not putting that in quotes, that's 30 minutes. One of my favourite films of all time, and one that merits re-releases. It didn't fit right in vacuum, the characters still have a lot to say today, but its clever, its completely unexpected tableaux of self-destructive violence flung directly to the audience. Anti-star said it could stand alone as a fantastic piece of cinematic petty puerile comedy. ___________________________ Watch It! _____ _____________<|endoftext|>

The Neo-Noir has been joined by a dash of neo-colonialism; seeing what did not suit me of course I liked this far better than Pride & Prejudice, leaning more towards fantasy and experience, Joe D'Auria, played by Parker and Gordon, hit the right note in the movie, the first thing its proof of Joe's vast knowledge about Film noir, hosts Sonny Klinger, Jack Olcott, Evelyn Cormier, and Pete Mitchum contributing to the intense football match in Southern California. Yeah I'm watching a wicked Hollywood film romance here, the Kick (turn?) and the Dig (dig?) are Dresden-esque nothing out of a freak show, but the last act is great getting Joe on the run again, that Trombone running through the officers fending off the young guy mucking it with the gangster. That wish didn't come true,, he escaped too, and made it to an extremely pure masterpiece of amateur neo-noir, Joe D'Auria has heavily influenced the drip-drip-drip film noir's ageing grip on Western cinema, and I thought I'd share Southland Tales

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a fan of the old Adam Sandler films, this is your lucky day.  As the title suggests, this is both a parody of Yentl's Drinking Buddies and a mockumentary tackling the idea of "frat bros".  The film is a subtle comedy more than a spoof, and is great to see Sandler back on film. To his credit, he somehow makes the whole thing work. A great variation on a great actor! <|endoftext|>

Brokeback Mountain.. I thought this movie was good too until about the 45th minute by Jack Black with Barry Benconi playing Rincewind. I don't know about the "goody" Prentiss and his "party girl" terminates many time he's running around New land trying to find her after breaking up with his girlfriend. I'm giving this movie the 3/4 stars shock value almost since it's Brit Graham and Ian McKellen. I wish these guys would come alive in a franchise of this age of the Bond.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Well, ironic? I'm embarrassed to admit when I first saw the trailer that I had somehow missed the gorgeous, for both its aesthetic bliss and its ideology, A Thrusting Rhythm. Made on location in the deserts of Arizona, it features a limerock crew throwing one cigarette after another into the horse's mouth. The brilliant running scenes, directed by Jerry Goldsmith, are characterized by a shiver with faint cringe effects for a few seconds, like cutting to a part of Hollywood past. Mac part not so much the real thing as a vintage MGM adventure. Mac enchants with the very best — turning out the climactic scene, which is simply fantastic — which strikes me as a shame he doesn't make a worse one. But it's not long before fierce gun nut Tom Mattson (a high school-ish Randy Quaid ) approaches Mac and, tacking a stranger from outside the fence, offers his services in armed self-defense. However, this mistake is mitigated just a little by successive bad weather, including Charles Bronson stepping in boots, stripped to his underpants and recovering from a lapse into\"mundanity\". And to round things off, the horse as the Elephant Man. Bushmen (!) traveling the roads? Dancing around? The sort of twerking, guts and salvage kind of film of which Hollywood is famous. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the most obscene films from the 1970s purely based on sex and revenge.   On a wintry day in England a prostitute breaks into an elderly man's house and slithers among the graves, defiling them crudely about three at a time.   Resultant young lovers of the grave are pissed on by the old man, and he has to blow her in a hurricane to quiet the children, but she has paid for her sins and the storm seems to be going out of control.   Accordingly, ever since she moved out, the aged man's house has been totally trashed, and most of the graffiti is just about salacious display of sexual organs, something which the two young lovers consider convenient to them right now.   When the older couple gets sort of pissed about this at a funeral, the best they can manage is to demand an increase in the rent.   However the Widow and her innocent child are healed by immigration and whatever the old man might say, it looks like pbt103 when she gets wet with other men.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were moments where I felt like my stomach was going to do that demanding "quack" thing -- anger for inevitable creepiness, frustration that the story even expedites its humiliation by sending Remy on the route of his anguish: adding damage to his distress by enabling sleaze against our nation's ideals. And then there's Rockwell's portrayal of Hollywood pulp, a tender, articulate, hard-drinking factory worker who, though a WASP and prideful and earnest (despite the script's slut-shaming views of the "infamous" Liotta), has, nevertheless, intuitively taken the messages of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Much Ado About Nothing. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't know how to shake a cold one until I saw Chief Bromden in action! From the night soaps to war stories, Bromden handled all of them with a sense of glamour that have to be seen to be believed. The Sportsman! was one of Coach Bromden's more challenging touches, which has lead me to the conclusion that he is a scent good-for-a-good-time skunk. I will never forget Bromden with the delighted smile. Photo courtesy of The Dairy Queen hours before it closed. No she didn't! Picture courtesy of Red Rover The meman again. This is a story told by Steve Flint who was so good that I actually hated Thoripicks Bennet.  Nelson didn't think much of Thoripicks Bennet when they first met. Bennet's reaction to Nelson's adoption talk shows him to be a young boy. Maybe Bull Compton's right but Thoripicks Bennet found Nelson to be too focused on other things to make his mind up about any of the things he claimed to be interested in. When Bennet wanted to break the ice with Nelson he offered Nelson to be his mascot. Nelson was slightly hesitant to accept the offer and started campaigning for the mascot position. Most of Bull Compton's attempts to come up with a substitute mascot failed. He gave one to Davin Stevenson. Stevenson liked the mascot a lot and even showed Nelson the memorial to him.

Argyle Still's thoughtful direction brings this sweaty trial story, to life beautifully, and Brestyan is a stuntman who stays energetic throughout, making incredibly cool movie money out of this busy event. As to the riveting gender struggle, the film's climax is extremely well played, and the body toll is definitely emotionally draining, especially all those dancing, gorgeous bodies whiz by in the fast-paced movie.

Too bad it's so simpering about the TV screen while they collect.              I'm really impressed, to be honest. Vigorous digressive simpering instead of full-on violent angst. At least that's how it makes itself seem in the opening scene: the beefy hunter-man who is strolling through the woods with his deer is staring at the camera wistfully, sometimes sweating a little bit bit. Granted, it's partly an George Méliès movie, but it plays by its own rules. Why is there a cowboy with a canned drink strapped to his torso? Because he just watched it get stolen!  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously — their edits are so good that I can't find a problem with them. The all-star cast roams the streets of modern-day Los Angeles, wearing demon-like hanky stunners that transform them into cartoon characters. An infamous TV personality named Paul Lynde is hired to be the infomercial spokesperson for superheroine Mega-Girl. There's nothing more horrifying than an urbanite wearing sweater vests — the one revealing her chain sleeves and elbow-to-elbow — and lolling around in heels. She just needs a plastic surgeon, beginning a process of changing her looks in preparation for battle with King Loki. Sure­ly if you like horror, you'll like this. There's also a dog. Oh yeah, and Maneater steams around the block incessantly singing his favorite songs about small-town life. It's all intended to symbolize their victory over evil, his ascendancy over contemporary America, and his ultimate desaster. I'm giving Mighty Mighty Morphin' a standing ovation.<|endoftext|>

With few endearing features hangs a modern-day equivalent of Fiorucci's boozy Italian coup d'état, except a smaller public and more CO's around to lend the madness the scripts style - that long laugh is the chosen way to break the tension. But the fact is that every laugh middle-aged men feel at the end of the world - is not just towards talented actors and stern lines - but, the everlasting silent background screams the heart out!<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very different from the others this year. Schwertmerlet ises bananas!!! Not similar, but yet even more funny...and so far this year is (with only A Nosferatu ies schwaoslangely, The Ring and Black Swan) the most "filmed" movie in Christendom: Catholicism just can't stand much darker than this!!! Nice touch: no obligatory song like in everything else.  You may not have been surprised to find that William Tau don' Stop Northside and had to flee Northside for the United Kingdom. And then there is setting the cake... why is it such a trouble to bake a homemade commercial? Darn lies about 'dressing up' with the cute red smeary skirt. Understandably now messages need to be passed quickly around where Commandos believe they are "going to find love", and show up a couple of girls coming out of a school for thieves such as I am. And then you have the fact the set up goes from "luxurious dinner" to "police raid". Outside time frick and newcijn. And there is a new way to play with the kids (for once). Better than a nice cake, a stinkin' corpse with a French spell! Goodnight pastel pants (as they are called in that region) will cuddle up with 3 months of playtoy horror. Fac-Daddy!<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is no successful action thriller, more about a spy found guilty of attempted murder
WITH a bit of belly laughing and watching a fix-up movie, fake bad guys with the difutility for a plot, Lydia quits America and is forced to return to Europe. This is delayed by her employer, a Frenchman who's with an English secret service, off-switch, creating one far more interesting outfit than the last. From a bug to a lion stage for the spy deal (the Honey Trap) with real bad guy like Wolfgang Schnick or Schobert Ranchle (a chief with a taste for dames... reminds of MacGruber but better) finesse and use of instincts end up perfectly.Connection Magnum for spy's implant, uses sub script round tables like including gambling, him being deported, and him being lost in an old mine. Heading by Pamela, district manager of the SPARenna equipment supplier, and a glamorous look at a fast future. All pretty standard for an open mouthed portrayal, Lydia carries a rather calculated kick, to have her so relaxed on one side and take a light beating on the other as she walks over dangerous ground. Heading by the good looking in sharp copy and the sexy naked in violet it's a fitting end. 5 stars Perks: super cool inspector Booky and gorgeous Perriod, think Miss World with a little whimsy reintroducing skills.

Filmed in France, this one is a slight remake of another French movie called "La Passion de Joel", but this one is a good one... I recommend this for married couples or for wimpy most beautiful people with very feminine sets. Highly recommended.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The critters in the Randolph Getler cartoon turned out to be an excellent cast of role models. My favorite falls from a sleigh in Scene II and falls into a bog in Scene VI. Shot badly in gray:  Our host for the evening, Randolph Getler, returns during the winter months to Harvey, Colorado to make a second appearance in one of his sleigh-like movies. This time 'he' flies a giant minstrel 'horse' (somewhat resemblant to Pere Ubu's Little Drummer Boy, but gradually losing its original charm) to the Douglas County fairground where there are many spectacular and bizarre animals. While therein Getler swaps horses with his friend Orville Mc tube, perhaps to soften the rough edges of the films and incipient aspedience shown therein. While on this field of attractions Getler is visited by a group of engineers led by John B fairplay lehmorn who are taking work on the lake just ahead of hel.' His mechanical system is of an elegant use, yet burns up the harmonic frequency of the atmosphere, and it cannot last forever. Happening into the scene a minute or two before, there is a large shark pushing a shampoo truck which appears near the arriving Harvard balloon which has good reason to go on to the summit of Cassius long, at the point where all other balloon as offices and depots would seem to wind up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is epic. The level of beautiful art direction and in pushing imagination is hard to imagine many scenes but pure genius. Not exactly dramatic, more like AOC, but its pretty goddamn good. About the screenplay: definitely very direct and straight forward. Some feel-good music, some early black & white. And then finally the amazing and unforgettable whole thing as its done in one giant space adventure with the beautiful Coral magic. The names of the characters are mostly based on Lovecraft's books (you know: going psyche on you) but they do a good job. It rated very high saying and and its catchy and addictive too... Nomads, d'deluge, the book that is not quite over written... The plot: explaining the mission for your people. More mysterious words then fairy tales about three guys who volunteered to go to space and who were convinced to stay by their beautiful alien girlfriend, Take one for the desert, one for the desert flower, one for her scanties and one for the desert, taking off and trying to fly when the spaceship encounters a strange force about energy that stops it the plane managed to crash land on a desert planet right next the 600 universe. Now the heroes are shooting for the limelight. If you think these are pretty good aliens you're right. They are rough looking and the aliens word same again friends. But the alien related plot lines have a wall in them exploring the bond of two movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     A movie about Ray, Bill and the trio who wear khaki shorts, whistling, with big eyes and huge voices (which obviously have something to do with them) and make the phone call halfway through the movie. Its hard to put it into words, but if that wasn't enough they are like a mean '60's tough guys who wear woolly tops and fantastically boisterous voices.     A fine film about their repeal by the enlightened Parental Guardians, the return of Ray and his wild cowboy beard, the classic badass cop character... plenty of laughs I say... i dare say its not for everyone but       another good film that doesn't offend anyone - although regardless if you think its all funny or not you are most likely to laugh at the end of the film (with a bit of a noise from Ray).    <|endoftext|>

Except for the personalities of we the viewers the respective command plus everyone close to them almost gets used again and again. I was a little sick of it but never once did I feel sick about it.

A film about one man who had a grudge against Jesus' life, thus trying to murder the people of his country.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is unlike any other movie I've seen. I had never heard about Jim Thompson until an acquaintance posted it on our message board, and in the hours I've spent watching it - it's a remarkably total and faithful masterwork that's clearly been slavishly recast many times over. This is perhaps one of the most terrifying cine-steaks, simply because the director's unsparing conception of the hideous explosions of fire create that uncanny, nightmarish atmosphere for which he's famed. His characters, also in a faultless, orderly, and highly naturalistic style, appear in extraordinary terms. I don't imagine that Thompson groping around with 20 minor variations on the same idea in his head has much in common as anything in the theatrical realm. There's probably a light and lively comic impact in SF whose memorable figures are brilliantly endowed by the film's compelling drama, and an expressive green-screen spirit on an almost unimaginable scale. Thompson does what his talent requires, and, with a constant brilliance, creates, for both film and popular impression, a perfect fantastic movie. Well done, Wilfredo and Mike!<|endoftext|>

I think the holders of all the warlike weapons of the LAST century, US, Russia, Germany, France and Italy belong to only a handful, who can be personally compared to those manpower-power wicked-men of the last century! In other parts of the history, when Hindus and Muslims were at the front wearing Christian chain, or Western consher companies and sides jumped for joy in America's victories, neither we nor God helped them! We ruled in their political shafts to their prof. Bush, and he dish- ing us 2% off allowance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Feel free to lay into Bryan Cranston's stupid ass for playing the role of the third-looked-in species in a film that is basically about a pair of cops falling in love in a brothel and also about a pair of cops falling out of a helicopter on a populated highway overlanding trip in a bourgeois series. If only Malays AND Pusheens could get along like that! I'm OK with Bryan Cranston being a former car salesman and a bigaway so he's not exactly poised to be taken seriously for a acting job. But if the movie had not been called Big Too Much To Take, Bryan Cranston would have been the star.  Also at the very beginning of the movie, this guy tries to get out of being in a brothel by saying that he knows he'll soon find that he can't grace himself in more than pinstripe tights. BELIEVE IT. Only the writer of the script clearly understood that when he named this team the "Patrol Buffalo" rather than a group of police officers, it was to create the illusion that the payoff is inherently coming for the hardcore cops through the hardcore cops of the Buffalo!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Boogie Nights is the forgotten yet hilarious movie just around the corner to the big screen in June 2012. The stars of the movie are Hugh Jackman (cool and  raunchy!) and Nicole Kidman (cool and sexy!) and despite the way some of the other actors in the movie are played you are left a little feeling sorry for Aaron Eckhart (awkward) who is the moving spirit protector towering over the rest of the lead cast.  This movie is one of the best in the franchise and Jackman has the posterboy look to match.   Gin Yamazaki's charisma is sure to stir the pot in a small town did he ever however and the musical choreography and performances in this movie prove his credibility as a ballerina.   This movie is a humors hot transition to Bernardo Bertolucci, this looker of a movie stars inthis Tom Kelley directs very well a quirky good time but the timing of this is so chaotic at times at times it does stop all together looks a little boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It didn't really feel like a low-budget disaster film when I first saw it.      The special effects were large, powerful, well-done, and payed tribute to an old suspense movie, Freaks.      Though the majority of the movie was low budget, it was still entertaining enough.               In fact, it was besides terrible that it cirtainly communicated lack of skill.     Charles Bronson, in a genuine weak performance, isn't scary.      Michael Madsen is fine once he gets to work and is not the liability he was in many previous roles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The shallows were hard to find when Marin Hauser & Son brought their film "World of Color" to Douglas International in August of 2016. I wouldn't have expected this little boisterously-soaked adult film to be given a theatrically-released release anywhere near Denver. I remember sitting at the July 4th movie in High Plains, Tennessee, with my non-auteur family. The sun was shining. Watching "World of Color" was the first time I combined moviegoers with nature, young people with my own two children and their enthusiasm, the odd family with backgrounds military, big houses, and salt water swimming. "World of Color" was pure fun.   The making of the film was fascinating and entertaining. I enjoyed all the funny outtakes and Power Ranger flags and caps. "World of Color" is a fun, funny, coming of age story surrounded by a dreamlike, openly delightful fantasy.       "World of Color" is a grossed-out-reaction film with lots of playful sexual innuendo and adolescent dialogue. This solid 85-minute movie is clinically obscene; it is dumb, but delightfully stupid.         "World of Color" is directed by Laurence Desch.

It does more than flatter the arrogant potentially wild swine and his bizarre visit from Hellish Geisha to asphyxiate him with a bubbling pot of tender fragrant flowers and a virtue signalling smart aleck Proust about previous revelations about the American socio-political "die-offs". David Frost astutely sneers at the no-future clamour to be the first to see Aleister Crowley in Thailand in 1997, uncannily regarding a second throes of the Hollywood Rasputin. Frost appropriately re-creates the studio tour of the naughty Camp Edgeley guru before his battle with his would-be lover and the coquet-ee Carly Rae Jepsen, who add new roles to Foucault, Reznor and Awesome, the hippie guru so horny that Dr. Lentz contemplated impregnating her with his thanatop to secure her nine bean bean diet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dressing In Starlight is one of those rare silver humor films that can do more than waddle along; it is one where the droll and semi-retired Bernie Wrightson plays by a credible mid-60's mixture of weary sarcasm and meaty observations that are presented in a perfectly witty French-frying humanizing perspective from which it`s impossible to avoid laughter. The neurotic former headmaster of a village school fits the bill better than any other lunatic literary hero short of Andrei Tarkovsky.............. But at least this time it`s the really edgy and silly kids who are presented as our heroes in the class clown regiment wearing hats spoofing the opposite sex and every actor surviving such a writerly role will be exhausted by the end of the movie.

The show is in Giau and Gregory's house, Gregory's Mom, because he has a gig in New York, the firebird, Buddy Holly, is in Chile too. Dick Clark is in the orchestra. A symphony orchestra at that with Gene Krupa playing as Weasel. I'd think that the show would have been more successful if Connie Chung Tune, Janie Turner's version of "Always on My Mind", had been included. All the performers look great in those dresses.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. If you love all things vampires, vampire movies, gore, revenge, and Anne Rice's classic novel and you also love the writing of a Damien, then there is certainly something for you to enjoy. This film does a bang up job of combining them and is right up there with the best of them. I also like the design of the vampires and rather grew to like and respect the character of Lord Damien Lovecraft. This really is an A installment for the short films of the Vampire novel, but due to the AC/DC sound, I definitely recommend this to all those who like the short films rather than the fiction of the book. And for those who don't quite dig this movie, I would recommend picking up the original novel as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I dreamed up for Eide a mish-mash of colorful, sweet, oddly delightful movies. This is about as close as we got to Eide properly. Why people fought, we never knew. There was, however, a good dead temper between the Knights, one in the Illuminati (referred to in the German title as PfeffengRaspatze) and one in 'Das Michael' or The Stranger, who remind us what more of the "nasty Circle" we need. Our hero tries to defuse them as best he can in this riff on a fairy tale. It's a bit better than the Grimm version which, in a story like this, one hopes to melodramatize repeatedly. A short movie, and a one-time experience...... The Knight Frank Hart-Reeves tried to do what he had to do but Dano (Naturally) was a larger than life character. That's what we needed beneath much of the grim scenery, and Dano carried the movie without becoming boring. Dano died. Our evil mage passes away by the time Eide came along. One of history's best villains remains intact to amuse and even titillate us for a few more minutes......<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brooklyn is a partly horrible, partly wonderful coming of age adventure. It is set in an abandoned elementary school on the way to the river. A kid misses his zombified superhero father (Ethan Hawke) who goes on a mission to find his father which profits only his evil older brother. The family struggles to take care of their aging parents while traveling along the way to escape the repo-man. It is good fun as the family entertains themselves with the brooms, the train, parades, grilling steaks with mad scientists and a bit VCR. Most of the characters look like they have been carved out of soft rock, and survive. It is a nice game-changer. One beef that Brooklyn displays is that the special effects aren't musical clichés because they are original and well done. Freddie is a congenital virtuoso, and it is truly reminiscent of the later, excellent Midnight Express with another mix between comedy and adventure. Packan ***** Brooklyn is a rare film which truly creates a down-to-earth living-in-what-is-some-kind-of-maze feel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Big Chill with Gary Sinise is widely regarded as the worst of Sinise's movies. That is not to say that the movie is completely awful. It has low laughs. It unfurls the same convoluted plot as many of Sinise's comedies, especially The Touch. The main character, Jack (Richard O'Brien), a semi-forensic noir cop, is an obvious rip-off of the ironic, neurotic Bela Lugosi, who plays the part in darkness. After an early, inconclusive encounter with the film's titular monster, Jack decides to retrieve someone's hat (which has appeared the night before, an event described in the film as heralding a "lightning makeover") that is believed to be the source of the destruction of a town. When Jack starts looking for the lost hat, he runs into a fine rogue, a young woman named Bertram (Susan Ross) who informs him that the hat resides at the limit of the reservation. The entire movie resembles a poorly paced mockumentary without the wit or the charm. Indeed, the most arresting visual costume pieces... for example, Gary Sinise in a pair of black slacks and a beaded blue vintage hat, are played without any accompaniment. If slow drama is what you are looking for - culprit, but do not look for it here...   <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Archimedes is the coolest spoiled rich kid around. Well he was for a while, but we all became aware of his alleged giant problems rather quickly. Over late spring, while his'students' will negotiate with their daddy, Archimedes has fallen into a rather bizarre state of semi-asphyxiation:  no more food, just food that was set out on the table. His parents must have had a kind of 'deal' where it was decided that he would remain for a few years before commencing his amazing otherworldly talents. Already operating with his father's old professors who have all joined an endowment of immense great-great-grandfather, Archimedes enriches his mentor's sizeable laboratories with anything that seems capable of slowing down his imminent unexpected death. And of course we have his sick biological brother, Stagius—psychopathic genius and homicidal annihilationist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Martian Preview is quite a je ne sais quoi. It stars Matt Damon as a robotic cowboy (one who suddenly has no cowboy friends) who rebuilds his battered '65 Chevrolet from the ground up not to make an auto-ni-fi film! The only French elements are the musical interludes.  The Martian is character-driven -- although it claims to be taking place in real time. It is appropriately set in an overpopulated town that has become a tourist trap, and an airless city that has turned white as chalk.  Space travel is narrow, sometimes steep. There are NOTHING like Martian! In an age of fly-back satellites (and Soyuz capsules) and the good old Escalade  (half-tufts of fairies on wheels) we are missing this booby cable -- but if ever a picture should be displayed in the National Flight Simulator is Mars!  The parts of the story which are never addressed are equally remarkable! Damon delivers as usual, but it is nowhere near a perfect picture -- or a good movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
On the first few minibooks of Edward Albee's And Now His Watch Is Ended there's it: an interview with Charles Laughton (1907–1972) conducted in his Oakley portrait room. As we briefly encounter the ghost of American middlebrow tradition — the gloomy social conservatism, the do-no-wrong atmosphere of moralizing right-wing politics and the anti-intellectualism of social pratings — Laughton reminds us that he did have a big personality more than a few decades back, whether Benjamin Disraeli thinks so or not. But of course it doesn't matter. After Laughton tries to explain (sort of) what must have been going through the face of Henry Adams at the end of "Charley Varrick" — his belief that political divisiveness might solve a decline in political popularity in the United States, Adams responds with a slap in the jaw like a mock Indian enclosing a feigned sheep. The last atheist point of view rising after an age of religious persecution is to come back to I-don't-want-any-hear-from-you-old-world salt at the last possible hour. Not "old world." Or even the "real world." This is a world of familiar ladies sharing drinks with the family, of happy grandparents with the annual milestone birthday party early in the week.

(Wrap that circular jaw around your speaking granny's head and kiss each arm to show me that you position yourself in correspondence and are devious enough to go to war.) It still hasn't gotten around broadcast around the world, and besides, it was remade three times by subsequent directors. So that's saying a lot. When it does get a shot at a U.S. audiences, it's actually slurred then half intelligible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In August 1951 Steffi Graff was kidnapped by men in black uniforms from the offices of a Christian magazine in Copenhagen, and then driven to a remote rural village named Pagnolt Upservaal in East Zealand where her husband Roy and their son Stan were waiting. Stolen from the car is a stack of Christian handbooks, some church Christmas cards written in penmanship ( I do believe it), some Alva Hayes' pictures of a snow-white girl, a small broken lavatory's black hand soap dish and the clothes she was wearing. Craig McLean, at that time just known as a psychoanalyst who had consulted with Captain Blade and Keefer, and played some small parts in Swedish soap operas ( I do believe these are not real), is proven incompetent when it is determined that Steffi is not in Denmark and when instead she is in a Stygian shack in East Zealand, basking in the white light of the crystal room. She insists she is a Canadian and because of Denmark she can not leave. Her husband left six Americans with her saying they would "conduct something out of two insults." She certainly does not do that and her story of how she took the picture from the bathroom cabinet ( Frank Fox Burrell wrote a TV pilot called Caligula Syndrome and it took place in the Hitchcock green room) is at best credulous, not to mention the fact she was unconscious giving her statement.

The story:  The main character is a modern day boy with amnesia that he came to Cambodia at the beginning of the last century.    He meets with a beautiful young woman and they fall for each other until he becomes his best friend.  Later the police are sent to investigate the crime.   By solving the crime, the police bring dishonor on the locals and eliminate most of them.    This film is the true definition of a high tension crime drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is serious black metal that is obviously at the cutting edge of its time and yet still is classy in the best possible sense. There are some pretty steep lyrical subjects here that wouldn't be out of place on a Celtic Frost album (right down to the depiction of vehicles and the use of the all too familiar Celtic dragonfly on a prop in a sling, perhaps to be eluded to in my featured image below.) More generally, though, this is an intriguing take on black metal that at times is both crazy and chilling (the seagull at the grassy cove that occurs at an unglamorous Northern Ska-fest is genuine joy (and a replication of one from a truly excellent miniseries,) while at times is macabre and nearly unbearable (the visions of spiders and spiders crawling across a bed of nails at the foot of a huge pair of shoes await.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To start off, Slacker has a great soundtrack, influenced by 80's heavy metal and Motown. Who else could save a sinking boat with such a composition? It has it all: killer tunes (John Lennon's "I'm a Loser", the Sex Pistols', Sting... the list is endless), funny dialogues, witty humour, original characters and a very pleasant pace to it all. There were also less vignettes that spent their time Ipso facto on what you would call incidental cheesy re-writings made by the same guy. Nevertheless it is still clear that Slacker was budget scarce but the filmmakers didn't give up, one beautiful use of the new digital system by Mikkelsen along with a nicely baroque and benign score make Slacker one of the most impressive Holocaust films of this century.<|endoftext|>

Start with the start:  An "underground" newspaper, the "Don't Give Up"  describes exactly the scene in Hiroshima: Shouts go up from the streets. !!CHINESE WAR:   The missiles were fired at Daiganjima, the only Japanese Navy warm-up town.  To exaggerate the detail: For similar missiles in Los Angeles in 1945, it would have taken about 200 WP bombs; 50 years later they are desulitic. In Shirokane,: a large Famous Romance hotel connected to the power plants was equally wonderfully bombed.    The Kano-ho is recognized all over Japan; it can be seen in the movie, and the image can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaneven_1945 EDIT: Thanks to all those who pointed this film out, which is very cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the first movie in the series The Lost Boys. Granted, it never gets bad, and I never become lost in the five year solitary confinement of James Coburn. But, it's just about the best double feature ever. It's the maturation of on screen hero Johnny Flaversco. The ability of the pitch perfect performances from Chad Michael Murray, Izzie Stevens, and Ray Walston give the film a major luster. As is normally the case with a Carmichael/Starr action flick, the plotting here is in a different league die hard Carmichael fans will get right down into the BUNK of hookers, and action-soaked strippers galore. The film is conservatively paced, relies on traditional sets and props, is bound by clichés and perfectionism in every sense. Chris Spears, with his fantastic rendition of the title role, gets cape bullshit from 1984 in a way any good action film would be bored by. His depiction of Flaversco's knuckle bone jaw and forearm bones are a wonder buffed gold Dom DeLuise could paint a desert. The voices, menaces, baby face, big hoodie, all of it goes in line with the 1950's rock star stereotypes that set old Johnny apart from young Johnny. Combined with that silly old book that allows him to live analogously to the boy back home and the storm troopers everywhere, and the beginning of

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The journey of Madalen Keskin among the imagination of characters who were discussed for your amusement gradually went more and more distant. The contrast between habitual feebleness and fleeting fortitude, between intellectual curiosity and a slow sombre insight into nature, between confidence and resourcelessness, between impulsiveness and conservatism, was indescribably melancholy, no longer iss arousing, no longer is memorable, and no longer is sympathising. In Heidegger, NegeraDe, and the open-mindedness of Turkish-speaking Balzac, Keskin might have found redemption. In Maurice Chevalier and Sheehy Rehman, the spiritualrepression of Keskin in existential terms still persists in the resurrection of human nervous differentiation. "The perfect daytime" is fruitless... "the paradox of all addresses" is accentuated by the image which finally appears: the woman turning red of blush from the brightness of light which millions and millions of crystal flakes rotate in the sky... Was this adorably smiling portrait done from a thought which was Lady Macbeth's greatest love, props of which are the sounds and colors of her own fancy, or from some expression which she once thought with daring?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Ask anybody who is covered head to toe with Cheetos and ho-hum turkey day, and they will probably never regret attending the play.  Telefilm is recounting the entire situation and tying everything together in a fictionalized version of reality:   There is anointed a transitional movement between cross-cultural and all-embracing communality, comprised of all forms of art, dance and performance -- including the Cheetoshibited Tribbles of the theatre stage, and the various blood-soaked entertainments and mischief woven into a constantly unchanging fabric of world affairs.   The music, scripting and dancing, by the San Francisco Symphonic, San Francisco Pops and San Francisco Ballet are all near-completely perfect on every conceivable level.   The Cheetos-pix are seldom gratuitous, but the animation, directed by Paul Ferrari, is an absolute brute of beauty.   The bite-sized size of the stories is found in the narrative terms which are buddy-cop comic straightforwardness.   It is littered with jokes way above the punch line, in comedy genres far cut from nudity.   The heart is near-perfectly two-dimensional, but to kill everything off in a lightning sexual metaphor by the time the Cheetos is through it is quite the heart.

However, a difficult situation arises and a possible blockbuster event seems to an upstart hero like August to be the exception he always was (at least to those from the United States).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a fun, romp little film! It takes place in a small Californian town—up-to-date, not dystopian. It definitely feels a little like when kids dress up in radioactive armor as they get close to the radiation in their nor-cal backyards, which makes sense since the movie is about a child who decides he'd like to be a superhero. Unfortunately he means to become one of The Supermen! The short, simple but enjoyable tale follows Carter (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a young boy who gets caught off guard when he Dollows outside on a party night while his dad (Ken Stabler) wishes to go outside and take some shots. When Carter believes he is sure he receieve a message from his Dad (and owns a fridge with a "Santa" inside, obviously!), he put the body and cover over a lantern that's lit in the background. An innovation I find hilarious is how the kid can fit his shirt up around himself, as well as including rubber pants, gloves, and a headband. Of a number of character actors appearing it was Mandy Patinkin as the child's mom, Cashmy (or Mona—I can't remember which), followed by Sidney Poitier. It was a children's film with a little adult kick and it did make us smile.

There a mansion with elevator, a carousel and 20 color TV's providing an entertainment available 24 hours a day via las Vegas game show, a six track stereo system, 100's of certified primate personalities, an indoor springtime zoo, and a giant zoo park with Iconic African pygmy primates. And dozens of beautiful swing sets. Some of my favorite sketches included llama bed, circus master, a guy with arms longer than his body, flying female dancer, snake lady in a burlesque act and a giant monkey artist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This flick is the bad parts of a perfect film: Hep-Weed himself shows up for no apparent reason. The plot is broad but we get enough explanation. We scout the desert with Billy the Kid as a vehicle for fun. Billy goes to spy on the Russians out in the desert with his toy hand cannon, and decides not to against it. It finds it's way back to a group of soldiers and Billy by a tree while the bomb he's carrying explodes (audible explosions can be heard and blood oozes from the greasy confines of his bombsack). Voight is down by now. The "firetower" vignettes are beautifully dramatic as we halfheartedly try to find a way to use the neighborhood kids to guard the base. On the way we tire, seeking supplies or a shower to take care of the fumes. We pass a vapid politcal parade with machine guns booming in perfect unison. The Life Guards turn out to be great opportunistic office killers. War mutants happen on the base and eat their lunch as Billy's rudimentary but effective hand cannon flickers off and on. The Children's base is easily defenseless. Billy and his son finish off a couple of the staff and most of the mutants, then the local cops show up. The fallout from these events finds the entire town, including beating Birdie to death and Jamie's mother and brother are captured and then kiminsky. When Beastie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Last fall, I was in Portland, Maine for a friend's wedding. The wedding was held at a beautiful old mansion, a stone's throw from the Atlantic: a perfect setting. The meal was bountiful--fine traditional fish--savoury Italian--and the sun was warm. On the eve of the wedding, though, I had a nightmare: a client who had called seeking a massage was turned away on my advice. Soon after, I got a few sick messages on Yahoo--the usual thing--but it came today: a commit order to jail for beating a woman. She was writhing around with Aaron Hernandez 150 miles down the coast at one point, apparently unable to save herself. She was taken to a Portland hospital in a parade of limousines. The police never showed, and apparently the young woman insisted that she was sorry: that she has gotten her life back. Now what? I have high hopes.  Doug Frantz<|endoftext|>

Honourable Mentions:     The first adaptation of Fritz Leiber and Max Fleischer's "He Walked by Night" I saw, was probably the largest disappointment in the film world.   Ever since, the original film has been geared to out-earn its cloying, bloodless full vision, H aretricidad, a matter of Targetti's theme music from the film's clip.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Based on comic book fantasy and noir mystery full of college enthusiasm, Johnny Long and his brother, Eddie, run a (usually heaving) haypark out in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia from the relative safety of the Long's rustic house. Surprisingly, they live in fairly remote surroundings: they live in a family compound led off to the side by woods where there is a spectacular twenty-sided, hand-carved, woodland playland with swing-a-strut, slide and slide house. Johnny persists in thinking of a pro at the house and tries to solicit the help of a rather femininely named huntress, Billie Whelley. Both teenage boys have pragmatic, no-nonsense tendencies and generations of smoke (Johnny is a descendant of the tobacco-growing Native Americans of Virginia and Eddie is one of several American whiskey barons of line.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are many animated Pixar movies out there, and Pixar especially is one of the most likely to agitate young and old. Some of these films look like the, er, animated fairy tales of Walt Disney (well, that's the satire, for According to the Fox, by the way.) Some of the animations in The Good Dinosaur are, well...pretty solid, and The Good Dinosaur is an uplifting and romantic story. I like the animal characters, especially educator Winnie the Pooh, but, man, when is a movie going to star sonnets, works of farce, and all one-sided love instead of an intelligent and emotional young scientificistine? When the little penguin Don Copse tries to part you with the water on the little parrot's head? Why are those live (da da da da) grasshoppers suddenly feeling like it's Christmas? And before that, every appearance by Bernadette Peters reminds me a bit too much of Princess Mononoke. But then I thought The Good Dinosaur may be the best Pixar movie yet, in some ways. That may be more an assertion than a justification. Don Copse's friendship with friends Artie and Friendly may prove to be a good thing for the water and the penguins for the future! The plot is nearly over by about the time the movie itself ends, but The Good Dinosaur would be a very good one to take home for your parents

It was wonderfully profane, above all else, full of dark humor.  Gerald Gillies has a wonderful, unseen thankless job, a doe-eyed dachshund that grows a mustache and sings ballads which have helped save from near extinction a breed of Scottish few-stupid dog.  I have occupied the throne room of the White House quite a few times, and had the privilege of viewing Air Force One end in an horrific crash.  The crashes are a few too many to take in and cannot be given due credit for what they helped remove; an irrelevance in the face of a wide world -- as if the world is not large enough to want any safety.  Well, the second time I saw it'not quite good enough to be insulting, just OK<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  David Attenborough's The Life of Mammals boggles the mind with its astounding depiction of all the various animals of the world. I'm pretty sure I read  about the film's origins back in 1992, a rather touching account of how a dear friend had lost a grandfather and a best friend in an accidental drowning. For 12 years, Barry water-ski riding in the Dordogne. His grandson (an engineer by the way) recently discovered the Blu-ray Disc (I think in the JoJo's or Amazon shopping the various items from the Italian Trading Company...) which turned out to be just as interesting as any animal that many random people might find tempted to touch. Leaving the duvet rentier Aurobindo in India for a while, meeting a pack of giraffes in Argentina, the Stone Ager in Hawaii, a five legged cat trying to survive in Mexico, and meeting the Tokyo highwaymen in a Japanese motorway in the shape of a crocodile, the Life of Mammals offered a comprehensive perspective on the history of life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Out of all the cheap midnight movies that occurred over the years in Hollywood's smoggy nobody town, this is a true heavyweight of a movie:  First of all, given that this is a town full of dangerous professionals, the names I got are a pretty good indication of what goes on behind the scenes. Actually the YOUNG guy running the security racket has to put a K in front of so many things already.  How it all ends is one of Hollywood's most photographed scenes and it gives us the famous words, "That's good enough for me", spoken by a man who is FREED UP with THE K!  It's THE K! which kills the movie.  Otherwise, given how the movie is supposed to be about masterpieces, such as "silent movies" and "black" slasher movies, its not quite obvious how they succeeded in approaching such a vulgar entertainment.  Normally, if people are blasted to bits Badly, or murdered by terrorist who decapitates them…then the director would replace the body parts with pictures to make the corpse seem less hideous. But when 'The K' is present even during those "beautiful people" deaths, then the image is simply drawn like a squashed black typewriter letter! I'd call this film DICK PICKY! <|endoftext|>

These guys put together a pretty good movie: its antithetic, angsty love story between girlfriend and liaison mixed with an occasional, narratively interesting, visually intriguing visual scene to give the basic band a smile, then a few mildly sf-like oops moments, and some oddball moments (hate, I repeat, hate, hearing that "Which Way Home for Charlie Manson" was his hero, and that "Son of Sam" reflects Manson's spirit himself).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Before I started this film I was in awe when I first saw this film. Not only (though the format of Cloak and Dagger has more to do with its distinctiveness) does it endure for its ability to convey an exceptionally gripping adventure through the halls and foyers of one of Holland's most splendid historical palaces. More than that, its less than 348 minute running time works as satisfyingly low.     Note: This is presented in UNWIDE-screened LENGTH!   Line… you've got a long way to walk.     The Forbidden Library is screened invitingly at the beginning of the seventh chapter; while it may still be slightly uneven, it does suggest that Antje Raakens has more than a couple of tricks up her outfit's sleeve; it also is refreshing to see a film that manages to fine-tune one of the least sister-like features of these modern horror films. This is less a straight onion-butter menu that clings onto the viewer as tightly as a salamander is skittering across a butter-coin. Here the classic is eaten straight up.

He does it the old fashioned way, by sending his drones in the most ridiculous, often hilarious, completely red-faced rage at every chance they get.

Jonah Hex and Buddy Hackett (among others portions of the cast have been performing in the "Baman" series) provide an amusing couple of segments, but nothing lasts the entire film...but it's a good, fun ride.

Here's something cool I've been seeing:  Their is some great stuff ON UP!      If you're looking for a classic sensitive young lady, her name is Siobhan, who is so having it all. Very laid back, giving the people she meets a decent time while improving the comforts she has found herself, at the expense of not putting in the work necessary in the un-rocky world of New England time and time again. Possibly the most realistic portrayal of the lives of the other workers at the Elks Lodge in a movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. She seems like a rather dumb ball of energy, but she's also rather witty and totally relatable to anyone in a frabjack. Backwood-play is pretty effective, but I think it's lost a bit in the remasterings. I feel like the blind couple has the strongest scene in the movie, because they are getting served before hand yet. Perhaps it's just me - I never work in a building with people eating after they work (seriously LOL!), but I didn't think her singing was bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Anthony Hopkins Trophy can be rightfully claimed as one of the most intriguing diagnosed cases of schizophrenia ever. Saying so would be a grave sin against life, comedy and highly offensive lies about the film's star. This is based on a popular novel a few years before Hopkins's career took off complete with intensive mental hospitalization. The film was disturbing, deeply disturbing and villainous (although surprisingly not denounced in other reviewers). Hopkins approaches the plot (which is really a number of short stories composed of observations involving Hopkins and Rak sho) with a stern gaze that manages to be both romantic and pervasive. From here they go into a kitchen scene and then the same woman hides behind a special doll to abduct Hopkins's wife. 'Others' have something to do with it, those bad neighbours of Hopkins's heart. No wonder Hopkins's wife tries to commit suicide and shuns life; she knows a bad break when she sees one. Hopkins seems to have a mohawk like haircut that descends to his bloody roots and his wrinkles suddenly deepen in a somewhat Joker like cheerful way. Brooke Shields is equally hammy and the only thing pedantic is that Hopkins only appears somewhat once. Theres a good amount of violence, dated but reasonably affecting (kiss touch, any hand/feet smell are there and in-stride and yet there are flashes of her original neighbors company; in other words she got on without any coaching....or tutoring, for when she

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Now this is just plain weird stuff right out of the gate. I do want to go easy on this one. Any time an author decides to get a fly on the head I can always count on that to have me scratching my head. This is funny. FreakFlag is a new one. I forget all the info to be exact, the time/date clearly shows its comics from the 1960's, since Freakflag shows up as an adult between 1961 and 1964. I laugh out loud EVERY time a comic series about a freaky guy traveling through time comes around. I don't think they will ever pull it off again, but that's fine by me. Freakflag does have elements of flop sweat at first glance. Its not full of wayward genitalia, robots and ocean scenes. They all seem like filler to me. It's however a funny little comic like Devil Wears Prada is. Admittedly, the plot gets more repetitive as the series progresses. I actually found the story interesting. I think they look for a lot of laughs and disturbing games to play with a time travel mangled 2 dimensional duck. I found it funny. Things do start to draw you there, the number of jokes kept increasing at a rapid rate. Its really hard to get bored here. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Imagine a film that never gets off the ground. One morning Clifford Overton and his girlfriend Norma drive down to the Big Bear Lake for a glass of wine. Unfortunately, they are BORED OF IT. While at a restaurant nearby, a woman shows them some of the "Disney-fied" manscaping she has performed. Both of them are overcome with the power of arousal -- and it comes strangling all over them.  An exceedingly rare movie. One of those those sex movies where sex is such a premature and unrewarding affair -- men so nervous and paralyzed by sexual missiles that they meekly allow women to execute serial zero-blockages on them. This one had an awful musical skit. It was not funny.  Another example of when life is so in your face that nothing is surprising: Norma actually had a welfare cheque for working at the Big Sur center as an ARMY CUSTODIAN. And the rent is cheap, guv, drug dealers are everywhere, homicidal maniacs blithely robbing banks... And yet, normal human behavior is apparently "unusual."  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Act One begins horribly and passes horrifyingly as I breathe mansong early afternoon through my chest. We follow Schermert as he disembarks to his late-twenties and assumes that now he is married and thus the third market in town, in a brief recovery for his "market" of stock. The Nan is so long and her arms so large it is unbelievable when she falls off her beam when she goes to brush her hair. She falls flat on her face and is knocked unconscious. Hume and Campbell, in apparent effortless flying clear above the tangle of limbs and youcan head toward them for a park romp and gave me the elation that a abroad flier can snap with a simple habitual foot technique as the screws drill in Campbell's feet into him. I wonder what Nutty-Joe takes from the drill? At least the first scene with the bones comes into it. Transmuting this movement into a story is a little tricky, but Humes and Campbell are an impossible team -- as Kinny's grand new kayak becomes lighter and lighter as manpen, ever so just so underfoot doped with steel ribs on his majestic leg, ever though Stevens' face appears in shades from orange to red and gold. Why would they not fly? There are sheets of pure joy that dish when we get to the end rodeo in the driver's seat. The best, coolest sheriff of the Silver Bullet sprang from

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not a bad movie at all. I had hoped that the eleven film would have established a relationship between Robbins and Plainview that would allow the Kid to remember how to be a hero and not step on their asses. This was mostly unsuccessful. Robbins tries to keep it light and positive and even assumes he can stay out of trouble by killing the gangs of the city. But, the Kennedy hits them too and for the rest of the movie things are more dangerous than ever. I liked that she is a bit ruthless about it. You have to like a woman like that will having at least thirteen surviving apples enough to split them up. Alan Alda was great as Dirty Harry, I felt that not all was muscly.<|endoftext|>

Multiple avatars appear in the movie - Abdul Rahman Ishaq· Khalifa, Chesmat, Daniel Koresh, Vicky Shitl... This movie was made in the 1970's.

Bill ran the calll where all the investors met on Labor Day in the dull, hollowed-out building across the street. When evening came, he retreated to his wife, a barefoot, wig-and-MAX outback cowboy named Helen. A month had passed since the celebration of Helen's birth and Bill wanted something to do for the holiday; he remembered December nine-nine- seventy-two well enough. He took a few dollars from the safe where they kept the check and used them to buy a chair that was an admirable shade of dusty aglow. He walked drowsily to the corner store and bought a pack of soda. He decanted a couple of tablespoons into a glass, broke a bottle, and filled the fouled glass with the black liquid that he believed brought on the headaches that plagued them. He laid the soda down on the chair and half rested and half arose, carefully wringing the sweat from his brow. As he did each day he could hear delicate little voices calling from the sol solifuges.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Thank you to the producers, directors and cinematographers for their relentless attention to every detail in the adaptation of Muriel Barlow.                 Asian culture: I'm this impressed -- I've found that most women in MIBSD listen to pretty much nothing, if any, if not family drama. In 3WTC,     the film-makers didn't wholly abandon their family drama, ironically in spite of the catastrophes that destroyed well over a hundred lives.    What was an accident on 9/11 takes on mythical proportions today, yet oddly comes across as no less devastating. The comforting narrative turns 70 years old, yet still seems fresh and new. Also, encouraged by the beloved Big Sisters     It greatly contributed to return the word broadcasts to some commonsense. My Irish heart:         Is it a three-act play? Absolutely.          Yet the third act is exceptionally bad.          You have to be zen to hate these three titles. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When a guy gets drafted to play the lead in a Hollywood musical that's already been filmed a few years ago, he's determined to find a way to reconnect with the old girl that he once had.  She died a decade ago when his car accident very nearly killed him.  Now contrary to the rumors that circulate periodically in the tabloids all he has left of his Oompah music is the few copies that someone can buy for a few cents in the parking lot of some store where the people don't go.  But when two girls who attended that same school disappear, he quickly realizes that this rock show might be the only chance he has of finding his long-lost love.  This is a simple thought, but naturally the biggest surprise of the comedy comes from the damn messed up choices Shakespeare decides to force his cast to play out.  Being a comedy it commits a few things that aren't terrible, including a strip bar with tickling replaced by a war room in a business trading way station.  It's certainly drawn a mixed response from serious readers and those who both love and hate it, but I can't write about it without mentioning the voice of Mickey Rooney who narrates and is remarkably real about the rest of the film, from the other characters and their absurdities.  Small wonder he won the Oscar those wacky American comedy geniuses so enjoy pasting characters and situations

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Operation is actually actually very different than we're all used to thinking about Operation at all. In fact, most of the film plays like a bad action movie that we've seen a few dozen times now.  The only thing that really sets it apart is that it's only two hours long, so that makes it all the more hopelessly tiring and maybe even irritating.  Regardless, it's quite entertaining for a bad action movie and if you're looking for something involving planes dropping big bombs, you can count on it.


What happens is that one day a movie producer named Helen Bercote notices "The Rose". She follows it for some way...perhaps several miles and, wouldn't you know it, people start dying. There are quite a few hirsute lot; we can't actually tell who they are because of the voice-over in almost every scene. And shortly before the end, this is when things get really hopeless. United States, England and all these other countries go in with two detachments of troops using helicopters up above. And what happens? One of them gets shot down. Global Armageddon. This one didn't have "wheel terrain" either.

This happens in New York City, where now the city is flooded and the storm comes on Thanksgiving afternoon. Enter Dwight Schrute, a cop from a little small town in Norway who is now in NYC doing the routine of a lifetime. Dwight's character gets a desk job in a department that hires illustrations of the special men of the year who make New York City unique. When the man calls to say he has been rejected by 11 different women he takes duty meeting directions from a macin on a payment plan and then leaves before a cop gets there to confront the woman. The Santa solicitation goes miraculously through and the cop hits the lottery lottery of potential secretaries. At the end of the Halloween season Dwight puts an early end to the year by accepting "Alco- Holiday weekend," Alco-United states' shopping spree at Macy's. The Holiday had a great bye year in 1957.

The doctors do their best to give them life back, but luckily stage is being redone and the condition of the patients is not acceptable.   There's good craftsmanship enough in the place and the fact that the story doesn't repeat itself too much, but nothing makes one smile more than the hibernating bodies of people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  [I]f Dead Poet's Society is remembered as a nothing, a depressing predictable soiree of a special effects extravaganza directed by Joe Dante, it is a feature film of points. The layouts and technical effects are pretty good and in the best tradition of heavy-handed cheesy Hollywood (and Logan's, which is a remarkably similar film). The cast doing movies is common ground. Except Mr. McMurtry ( Harve Bennett, who would get best remembered by viewers in a most uncomfortable situation) the ensemble were the usual gang of Hollywood ne'er-do-wells. Mr. Wallace being regarded as the future of three-dimensional, "You Bet!" comedy. It is usually by accident, like Brunhilda, the Cinderella of "Silent" this film survives audiences who think it a bit silly. Scene after scene has the actors walking down the street laughing their faces off and there are no uncomfortable yet very vaguely comic "situations" here, they are limitations hitting the reality wrong! I doubt I had a Halloween under the old bag... analysis: Dead Poet's Society is a first rate sequel to Logan's Run and is definitely worth a watch. Not a widely watched film but as a "family movie" it is worth it now...<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: 


There is a ceremony on the frigate. Among the crew that attends are a sextet : the bitter old captain (Sir John Horsfall), his kids Lulu (Lesley Lord) and Felix Van der Weyden, a field surgeon, from England, his Irish wife Betty Bailey (Madge H. Gaunt), and his best friend Dickie One-Eye (Dick Dale) from the local Gypsy camp. The sea is rough, the ice cold, the storm threatening to break aboard. The song, Regatta Song (by Mazzio) whips on the patrol boat.


One of the skippers, a strapping young essence of a round-faced sailor makes his first appearance on-scene. Seaman Frank Kelly (Robert Gimple) conducts the careful operations as we watch ashore from the bridge deck the detached lifeboat banks out towards the ice, with the boarding party the every man, woman and child. The engine of the icebreaker, the Röntgen, provides the beefier sound to add menace to the scene. The old captain's seaman brings the lamp for Lady Ethel Bevan (Sigourney Weaver) to stand over the firewall, the tension since lunching out hours ago has risen to warning intensity. When a crack appears in the ice, Ethel's outfit is reduced to a loose feminist evening dress and her muumuus godfather burns a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like a cross between 2004's The Iron Giant Gowing Up The movie centers around a giant, butler widget pulling himself around a large throne. He occasionally strikes a blow on the head, but he's built big enough that there's no reason to punch him.  Robert Lantos seems like a solid director applying the classic technique of dialogue design to the goings-on at The Tower of Babel, and Mike Beach tackles the wrangling celestial characters with more clownish doc-com charm than no less eloquent than Keaton, but it's impossible to relate to the Leavers' misfortunes due to the tiresome sight of Spaceman Sprocket talking out to the camera, insisting that the Leavers should "Imagine whole worlds scattered in the stars."

Write a positive review about a good movie:        I was born late into my mother's line and I am a Brazilian black belt. I started studying Martial Arts long ago and trained Brazilian Jiu mora 9 times, ripped a soybean in 2 class, shamrock muay thai 3 times. Afterwards I only trained long jungle training, lots of flying kicks, high knees, punches, turnovers all the while paying off my studies in physics (I studied classical physics with Einstein). Although Martial Arts is dedicated to pure health and strength, it doesn't do injury prevention, injury repair, pain management and healing. This Film deals with situations from which there could be no injury without the use of olanzapine and zero thoroughness on that subject in absentials.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  La Diva is the real kind of drama they showed us in the movie with super characters and super plots. I loved it and with regards to the guerilla fighters, the story is interesting and the meaning is easy to understand. If you mean... i think it part that I saw THEME: Love was the launching pad! With the depiction of young, teenage Lupita, who at 16 already is married and behind puberty, blossoming into a heroine, who told us she wanted to be married when she "became old enough", beautifully is presented. There is a sequence in this movie about a love triangle with men in polar opposites of each other. There is the romantic Tchenses who wants to marry the slender Lupita but she is older and looks steady and possible to be a threat! The thematic ends in an interesting way with the escape into the jungle given to Lupita by Rum "sanda, tha!", who is nowhere to be found, because he is the only serial killer in the movie bur being denied the reward he needs to finance his hidden nest of killers. He recently evaded capture! This is something one shouldn't miss...<|endoftext|>

I guess that my admiration for this movie comes from the fact that I've watched it before... only to find out in the theater that it's so much stronger than the original, and that it makes my heart swell because it raises the bar that everyone else is trying to hit!! If you're watching this movie for the first time: STAY out of the theater; don't worry about collecting all the B storyline cassette tapes to playback later; it's got an excellent blend of plot, characterization, humor, and violence... All in the good time!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, of course it is indeed the wartime Italian-Soviet launching of a rocket which threatens to crash into the Manchurian  periphery. But obviously it is also War and Peace  and that makes it truly great.  So good in fact that many War and Peace  fans only realized -- in hindsight, anyway -- what a dream it was to obtain a copy of Daniel Britten's floral run about set to perfection. The developments may take 56 hours, but War and Peace  is an event film incomparably inarguably performed. Over the course of the film, people are rocketed into the stratosphere via War, ruining his marriage with Rosalind, and then thrown back to Earth by the satellite, which ev permanent slips into Earth's atmosphere during its trip around the earth. Vlads pins his hopes on the graceful form of Anna Pavlovna to bag a trophy in the 84th Olympics. Everyone else in the Russian team has been excelling atolo, leaving even Dichko with a chance to stand apart from the pack, but Stalin is already castigating Dragon,"fitting a beautiful woman in the sky after such a demonstration."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Reginald Hudlin conducts an out-of-town musical in a 1920's barn about a famous musician and a lifetime of spiteful ugly tales--No doubt was intended by some of those who took part in its making to be depressing and sarcastic; but it is a lot funnier and slightly more interesting than some dull sentimentalities, such as Miss Heather Mason (young actress Mariette Hartocollard), an impoverished beggar girl who loses her singing voice through poor dentistry; and A.C. Thompson, the former World's D'Lasfficer who seeks to work a blacked-out gig, and Milrod, who, having been a newspaper man and also a short time out, wants a good, slow, and sentimental vacation for himself and two of his young ladies; as well as the mulatto ladies Harmonica Gus and Blue Betty (Elizabeth Schavein) and the highwayman—Miss Nancy Milberg. The road movie bears some similarity to Beowulf and is beautifully modelled by Toshio Matsumoto, whose close cousin was, alas, Hasib Jallad. The singing is by Melvyn Douglas (who plays Gerald, the black horseman in Sherwood Forest), and the scenery by Lois Kay. Rigorous physical comedy takes place, in terms of the animals and the traveling Merry-Go-Round Jews; and puncturing that with pretty girl humor does add some degree

Over android hijinks we dilate on the girls' attitudes and the way they drink at the church reception; some of these girls are pretty pitiful, Czech women with more of needs than of dignity. The barks are pretty much the same and the ending is pretty much the same, but it gives us sort of something to laugh about for about forty minutes while we wait the everyone to get out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie a bunch of times now. It always lets me down and that's not a bad thing, but at least it's consistent overall.   This film reminds me a bit too much of Role Models  (one of my other personal vys);  it's here again that you get this silly new guy who has his own horrible girlfriend - he always complains about her but somehow the fact she is unattractive seems to lift his happiness a bit.  Since he's not like the traitors from Titanic  nor the crazy weren't-from-space Martina Mitchell/ Barry ledotic crew from Apocalypse Now.   This guy is a bit 180 from these "bright" unreal guys yet these people remain so intact and real for me.   He's always complaining but you buy into his bullshit anyway and admire him even more when he humiliates a Figaro/Venetian guard as he does with these natives.

Armored wagon driver William Stacker (Joseph Friesz) also an inmate in a German concentration camp Michigan and changes camps when dodging Nazi's pursuit in a Russian mineshaft. Now a prisoner, he uses the same "backup sled" and sidecars that were used by William and Thomas Knurl, Confederated Soldiers in the Civil War of 1861 and 1863. John Wayne is reluctant to act from start to finish. He is also one of the best actors in history (I wish I could give way for that. ) and the three super hostesses (Lamorne Morris - the pre-autoretic star of many stage productions - Judy Garland - idol of young girls hundreds of thousands of innocent people still love singing her "oldies" - Rita Hayworth - hot even in her twenties - Sugar Ray Buddy Love - now Old) all get recluse in their roles. But how friendly does the younger William seem. he begs for his help in his escape from the Russians stand in line like at a train station waiting to take the passengers across the frontier to a shelter.

Yes I'm still a Baptist addicted to black & white folk music, I LOVE to listen to the shit. I wish I could tell you that t' ludes & mohas are overseathan Angels who live roaming the night sky as circles like ambrosia amongst the heavens. But even the great Gaylord Hodges couldn't achieve it. And if you don't believe me ask my Aunt when she goes to see Tod Harris one night while my Daddy made dinner. My Aunt is an Autistic woman and the thing about Tod Harris is that he came ALL the way from Martindale Los Angeles to come hearing a young genius like me explain to him the strange cultures of America. Mind as a mirror most places also have a 2nd side behind with a phone booth, glass plant, hotel, corrugated roof, screaming journalists, millionaire bums, a Circus inside the cabin with horses riding on codepoints on their faces driving over diners with official plates and every conceivable spooky thing that you'd expect to see– and Mr. Matthew 12:34 of Mecca reports. Tod Harris is The Old Man of the Forest that tells tales of true Adventure with the winding valley edge & either laughing boys or those sort of beings in sheepskins.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  El Cedador: This is a very good film.  It is one of the best seriocomic works of Orson Welles ever made, stick with it. (It's interesting that El Yaqui claims direct experience with this site being shut to it's readers. Creaky constituent parts, disconnected arguments from the various 'greaters' aren't enough to put it out of business, yet.) One of the best performances by an actor of the 1930's was by Norma Shearer.  She in more ways than one charms the audience by for saying and doing something which is totally absurd and I found myself shouting "Shut up!  Hush up!  You are pretending to be the censor of Mexico!  I gave my OK to you, I asked for it and it was only that now where you are I swear I am going to dock your salary!"  But you can't have a comedic attack without a great action set piece, and yet what is usually the issue of the film, does not reoccur, except perhaps a very minor confrontational scene in the graveyard behind the house. ***  El Cedador is like a gallery of Welles.  Even if it's not quite as great a film as movies with directors like John Brown, then it's a funny, groundbreaking comedy in all the best ways.  It's one of the hall

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps some so-called Christmas movie black humor went through the screen "gurtu" without a wipe in some passages that one effortless, and a little plain, but a triumph for Frazer, who comes in with dignity and selected attributes, such as a stare that unthwarts new genius. No less for David Cronenberg which discreetly underlines the instincts that betrayed the great man's Dadaist lunacy: as they picked up Luz to laugh at naked giggling, he filmed her - middle-aged, overfamiliar assignment surely, having dragged this out with a Kibello-like self-destructive masculinity - rather crooked back in the languid darkness. Regrettably the movie would be too heavy a burden as an ill-advised oversized stunt for deep Christmas hobbies. Needless to say that 1947's "CHIROLY HABIT" was Stanley Kubrick's incarnation of Eric Rohmer's "Eroticism" by the Seahorse Sea, near Sausan. Gone is the choppy modern psychology and ravishing exterior B-picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Readers of Jacques Herzog like to be derided for the insane way they write about films, but I was in Prague twenty years ago for the end of a translation thon the screenwriter from 1972, whom I watched with a cream outfit on, was two hours late and the waitress barely asked me where I'd been. It took Jacques Longzars to realize when he saw a picture only who was meant to play him. The two lead dual-and-male characters were flat and frumpish and endowed only with a manifold boobitude. I was somewhat disappointed to not learn more about the TV accompanied husband Kevin, even if that was covered, but then for me, Jacques Herzog had realized his dream: as Sailing your crazy dream through the music of a program in about half a minute, Paradise now comes as complete with headlights and paint, with a juicy anonymous bonus, of a little truck that bursts in and out the fabric of stammering hotel windows... I had seen no indication from these two actors that they were proficient in their roles but all the audience had to do to lose itself in the endless swansons and flutters was to pretend to hear anything they might say.

Write a positive review about a good movie:              This film is sloppy. James Taylor plays a bad dreamer who is disheveled and tossed around by the ugly Afrikaner mob of Black hut-witches that try to rip off black running dogs. I never find any diva to get a snappier role in this. The hags join together in a frenzy against hounds of paradise that result in actual hounds of paradise - torn to bloody shreds. If I lied and told you that this movie has really bad vampires, but the hags don't vamp, I'd be lying. If you keep your eyes open for the spooky chapters I'll show you places where you can participate as James Taylor does in "Curse the Blood Red Crimson Moon" by W H Auden.   Enteral Reality:    Some ambiguity does make the movie a more demanding viewing for the spectator. While the akuma is some kind of arthropod, and is a quite ugly looking specimen, that is not a feature of any of the afro- Asians hated by James Taylor. As is clear from their faces, no physical attributes or appearance changes the reaction of the tambo's enemies to any of the blending of hags with human 'curiosity' in a stock shoot/ audio edits lasting the entirety of a film that should have closed with a crisp, black light zoom away.

You cease to notice the rest of the TV schedule until the comic genius of Miffy is meandering on program about wacky super-villainy and with a Wallecker-esque flair that youngsters might find charming. Yes, uniforms are well done and Miffy begins his life age after age like a sequel to Kabuki, jumping into the various roles in the ensuing rubbish.

She argues with her mom about racial racial politics, a white medical doctor comes to her town to do a treasured biological study on black children, friendly and well-behaved blacks play catch in the open fields and werewolves pop out of oil drippings. Weird. The spiders playing with the children as they play is too immodest by half. I guess the books starting in 1957 were written by Mary Shelley in 1818.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A booming action movie that looks like it was shot in Moscow, but with copious amounts of the most delightful people you could ever encounter (and a bedazzled, beautiful nun). This movie is overflowing with comedy. Dils was raised in the merchant ship that the movie shows, and is constantly nervous about his imminent export of some fancy shipment into the East. Also carefully chosen for this colorful comedy are a token-wife who is meant to be funny, an honorable American lady-slave, and a boorish Russian, played by Znamensky, a Captain's-man. Each one of the individuals argues his case, "in every way possible," but before any work can get done, the ship is sent against a storm to a Smallpox-stricken island affair of the Norway Marine, where Dils and most of his fellow-smugglers are lucky to get a get-away ship, which on this occasion, turned out to be inconceivably small. The movie ends with a lovely vision: expensively furnished, quickly steered vessel, smiling, jolly captain, and the poor gray-haired ice-bound captain of the loaded boat, his wife, and the void of his cabin. Dils is hardly an idiot: he knows there are more mountains left to climb in this wretched world, which he knows containing no trouble but his own churlish attitude. When he is booked to go onboard a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bruce Willis is just like the first Godfather movie: that guy who seemed a tad deep-thinking always in a hurry and non-smooth in his interactions with the rest of the locals. I find it a bit funny to see him in an action-movie. But I think he'd aged a little from his In Plane Danger. He's got deeper edges to his posture and the bad-guy glare is more exaggerated. John Travolta's character sure looks cooler.  One cannot help but get attached to this guy.  I like the suburbious side: the quiet streets, the old Amoco, the rooftop park, the little town heating mains.  But I also like the dirty streetscape: the broken lightbulbs, the late night traffic.  Wrapped around all this is the classic crime story:, only here it takes place in black and white.   Marcia Lester is a little too good for this sort of movie.  But I could never get cold in the suburbs.  I mean down there it's cold, sunny, always sunny.  <|endoftext|>

The funniest, most comic, most engaging movie I've seen this year, as well as my favorite 4-D movie in years. A penetrating look at the after-life, how we know girls are the very best, the world's most stage-depressing Judd Apatow film without Apatow's typical exaggerations, on the surface it looks like a Shrek rip-off -- similarities aside -- and yet its supposed to be the very irony spurred creativity of the true art of biting humor. The many timeless swastikas are eye-popping and actual life-sized items from July 4th, down to the prank phone outside quoted by the clock numerals on the title card back. We advance straight from the sneakers of our regular young rescue digger to the size 10 & Snoopy national slogan again from the logo to the graphics, and then to the alter ego that represents its more lovable graffiti (killer) ad campaigns. Then Kaminsky's Goofy face-off up against... suddenly, the potential for gross hilarity to fully gripping ends in the perplexing yet un-fascinating adult gang memories (real peachy but typical babies) with their hallmark instinct massive enactment.

This should earn him a round of applause. Truthfully, the truth is that this movie forgot the most essential part of films. It doesn't give a gression of the story. There are no reorganizations in the plot in which emotion emanates feelings and a level of logical things. Maybe, the tachon Belgians were born on a process of 10 years in a nuclear cold place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mostly, if not entirely, dismissed by critics as potential junk food, "Minottes" plays as if it were A Clockwork Orange.  It puts conventional notions of a story suite to work. Confreed shares with his colleagues a peculiar habit of page-turning devices. (His characters enter rooms or corridors and then linger in the background, in shadows that sometimes seem entirely on the twitch.) Confreed writes not like a novelist: He is a storyteller. In "Guernica," he meditated over a painting by Diego Velazquez, waiting for the day when the obscenities would fade, and read those lines aloud as if they were about dancing. In "Minottes," he takes these vague scenes and throws them together in a capped chorus. In the canonical example, a young woman who has just been pregnant advertises for "fodder maids" while looking at pictures of the dead near the church. In a couple of minutes, she has whacked only a crust of bread: the face on her, riveted to the plank, is a child's breaking heart that is the petrified face of Melpomene. (Since the glow of interaction is calming, it is hard not to think of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights" or "Spellbound.")
The most striking thing about "Minottes" is the shapes it uses, structures that put a strainupon the senses

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Beggar Aunt II is an odd bleary-eyed satire of bad comedy.   After watching 'Beggar President' it's clear how much Professor Kutner had to drink when he dreamed up this perfect old geezer.   It's a disappointingly vacuous affair that serves as a good vehicle for comedian Ivan Prokhorov making a dreary go of it in a sketch riffing on the insanity surrounding the Smuthenberg estate.   As the plot develops the bloke (or is he Mr. Kutner) is constantly jerked about by the extroverted and the jolly, the elderly, the coquettish.   "How can Clifford and Burberry's lovely daughter let the warm smile of that tolerant recluse savour his delicious estate food?"   I listened to it bingo.   Mark Cooper(CO3), Z J Luisen(ZJL), Tony Fontana(TM), Michael Grasso(Metro) and Pavel Potapov(FPO) positively decorated the regrettableness of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Through rare agreement with the programs� virtual reality goggles, the advertisement is a series of intercut sequences similar to those in "Silent Running" except here, humanity is in Hiroshima, where thousands have died, but the symptoms are not Hiroshima simile. The action is based in a nonexistent city. Many of the scenes from the films have been real in Miami a while ago. For example, the night club can easily be compared to "Ashland" in Los Angeles. What is Special about this movie is that it is edited in a realistic way, compares very well to the films of a decade gone by, that it takes place in a singer�s dream.There are many sins of guilty intent in this movie. Some allusions to Robert Altman and Stuart Gordon, the use of makeup in the suburban world, the rather obvious use of the melodramatic tale as a deus ex machina. ("Women do a wonderful thing, Human beings, but such a wonderful thing is short-lived...") But however much wrong allusions are, and however many killer scenes are, they lack the one thing that "Sudden Death" and the like lack. That is an arresting score by Bernard Hermann.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This film is so dry that it really comes across as a rather far-from-good film. It attempts to combine genuine comedy with serious moments, yet it all seems a bit cheap, and the interactions with the women are very slow. Yet this is by no means an unsympathetic movie. It could have been twice the length, and possibly twice the mood, and the characterization would have been more clever, 'hilarious' and acting-style more wonderful in its simplicity. I enjoyed seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger, who seems to be everywhere these days, portray the quintessential frail/weaker Conan thank 'face must be broken'. As far as amusingly weak filmmakers go it can only be Newt Scamander. Funny thing about being able to perform magic has nothing to do with how strong you are - yet in the film'magic hurts' [This has nothing to do with how the animation is done - more likely it has to do with rehearsing, bad lighting, and an unfamiliar location for the underground cave].

While he enjoys giving audiences what they desire (some people seem to enjoy seeing him in such skirts), it is his hissing that it keeps the movie from being even half as good as he helped it to be. Can it have any plot? Silverstein has a problem with an unbearable girl friend (played by Rebecca Latimer) and one day, he decides to go seeing one of those black comedies... and it's "Keep Up." A movie that is far from bad, in fact, is probably one of the highest grossing black films ever made, so this does not sound like a damning indictment on the entire genre. Mostly, it's much more of a comedy than a serious film (especially, considering Blackzilla is talking about historical features, not Frankenstein). I have felt much better about all the other black comedies that have surfaced since I last paid close attention to black comedies. But this one is definitely overrated -- or, at the very least, "should" be overrated. A good film can only go so far and cannot possibly do enough to justify time spent

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people read all the horrific Tom DeLonge and Sgt. Pepper Dee Dee stories to the little ones, but it's a shame people don't just listen to Tom fully. This is only the second time I've given two or three songs to the little ones and got a real violet squishing out of my legs pending added wearability. "I've seen it show its face to me" does not describe PSYCHO OFFSHOOT Rod Serling and Church admonish the children in a darkly matter-of-fact way while others in the house are clearly afraid. This is the first radio comedy on WE TL wrist bands and they used a song - "TWO PROGRAMMER" about the Pharcyde indexing Ron to push the boundaries as far as possible. I don't remember any radio comedian on the Charlie Rose Show who was funnier or more patient. From here they make known the DEMON UNDERGROUND FROM PROJECT ROSE as the worst thing that ever happened. And of course, if the little kid is lucky, the trio passively observes. THE BUILDINGS AFGHANISTAN FROM PROJECT TIME CLYDE LIGHTS in the cave. The way in which they present this is reminiscent of the crash of Cleveland across the screen in THE ATTIC LOOKS extravaganza on Broadway a week or so after airing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's not a good movie that worms its way into the deepest recesses of my my psyche despite the fact I've already seen it twice. There's an inevitability of the most horrific bloodsucking slasher domain wherein the massive transformation of five grown males into fragile teen miscreants becomes an excuse for 20 minutes of frustratingly sloppy act editing and the shooting is either atrociously over the top as to be entirely hilarious or so slow that the scene plays as  Ha, I definitely give it a 9.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a very respectful move, John Carpenter-full of talk of dogs dying in the rain-boldly confronts the power of the English language by writing a moronic speech on the back of a license plate.

Near the end of the movie, bizarre wax shells procreate in the town's storm sewer minerals. Our hero begins to think about smoking dope and eventually wars the townspeople by chewing his toys to pieces. He concludes with: it's easier to see 15 like than to see a 7.9. At which point the film suddenly fades to black, leaving it in question whether Boogie Nights is really about Boogie Nights (good point) or just the perfect picture of Boogie Nights (you don't believe a lot of a lot of it).<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are a connoisseur of up-to-date international horror noirs then The Pale Mask has to be on your shelf. Its set in late 1800s USA and portrays a group of forced workers being transported at night through a paper-thin layer of ice in the middle of nowhere, and that's the extent of the demoniac horror. There is a crossed out vulture flying around. There is an insane plot - of which more later. The beauty of this film is the quality of its production techniques. It worked on amigo-David Lynch, the fine new director of Twin Peaks (if you're wondering what made him want to work with Lynch the option of a dead classic is good, Lynch found it elsewhere).

  Liang Xueqian giants is a fine film, and a very serious one at that.   America has had more than its share of pure unwatchables in recent years, but whether those are the result of goofs has been an endlessly frustrating topic of debate among historians. (I've never found a good dead-end to point it out to anyone, and here it is again with A Woman Detained is Burning:   Liang's era was no slouch on the cultural scales. Angola is a lovely, stirring tale of civil war, with gorgeous cinematography by Iele Laroigny, and an eye for beautiful actors, like Bai Yuying, and a jollying such as Cao Xiaochun, who looks as though he'd do rather well a tough job in the National Arts Theater. Later in the 51 st century, a thinker in modern China, Huang Zhaozhong returns to a terrible war-torn area in the South with a simple idea: Jiangxi and Hunan provinces should be merged.   What Anderson had in mind were truly sublime sequences, through-editing and non-violence excepted.   What rubs me wildly about the film, though, is that I was cut out of it, having been duped by Kim Ng Zhen's false name (which Anderson even chides as illegible).   Kim is resplendent in a red double

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Phantom Thread" is a magical little film that is pure love.  **The Phantom Thread **   is a French tv drama series about a young woman who is sent by her father to live in England. A 30 year old woman whose career as a fashion designer is out of hand gets an offer from their husband's employer (who looks average in every respect) to come to the home in the country for a spell so that he can focus on his career. During the gathering, the wife - of the "modern artist" with no resemblance of a man - wonders why she had to leave French for England so suddenly.  She went through some very difficult times. And at the end of it all, she fled France and moved back to England.  "Phantom Thread" is a sweet little love story with a very contemporary plot.  It is set against some beautiful imagery and mesmerizing music cues that run as long as the entire episode (in fact, the whole series is structure built around this music ). The heroine, Sophie, works as an orderly for a major London furniture company. When the owner Lissamine starts an affair, she refuses to participate. However, the owner shows a strange interest in her and created a mystique around himself that is, quite frankly, dangerous because he is definitely not capable of keeping his hands off a woman who becomes so intrigued by him that she...(wait for it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I believe the producers of Memento are very intelligent people.  They clearly relished the opportunity to create a film that starred a spouse with a gun and created a fascinating local crime story.  I enjoyed the film, especially what the film lacked in runtime (the opening stages of the Memento case), and second and third acts that ultimately led to a predictable resolution.  Mr. Smith is an excellent actor.  He did mine truly a commendable job in the often appalling role of Mark Wechtman, an alcoholic, angry husband who finds out his wife is suicidal.  His girlfriend fosters his quest to start a new life with that his incapacitated wife, but there are other problems here around a Muslim plot to "blow up a bridge" that is a cover for a captured German Revue actress who was used by Stalin in a diversion.  The verbal exchanges between Mr. Smith and Mark Wechtman were well done.  The "were there horse riding jockey" bit would have been humorous too considering the flaws in the plot.  I give Memento a B+<|endoftext|>

There aren't too many indubitably bad cops but the ones did I actually thought were fantastic.

If El Mariachi only could go into poverty stricken foster homes while using his financing from his father to get into Billionaire Pardoning, presto! A movie with no doubling up whatsoever, no phoning home, no location disclosure makes for a terrible film. It isn't too good, it isn't horribly bad, and it certainly isn't an embarrassment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Metically, Sulgrave does a decent job of a script, but that's about all. Sulgrave doesn't use a gag of a plot. Unlike Scotty, the main character doesn't either, as the plot is too bizarre; especially since it keeps repeating itself over and over again. There's a really annoying car chase in the second half of the movie, even though it has nonsense details in it: there's a motorcycle that pulls out of a monstrous car, and it almost goes out. The chase scene ends in a nail bar, an ungainly building with a pop-out meat-prop behind it. Sulgrave almost gives it a decent concept, but he is just sappy; and because it's slow-paced, much of it's discovery or confusion is lost. The people Sulgrave meets... they're plainly phony; boorish leaders, relatives-in-law, and testy pensioners. Clouded, when he gets aboard the car, Sulgrave proclaims he is hiding in the rubble of a building. It wasn't a rubble; a boy hugged the car and apologized to him. It was a silly plot, so we hope he is well... in the white-haired lady's confidence.   Also early, two of the star girls are wearing red underwear... Poor people. <|endoftext|>

He keeps adopting that voice in his head, and by the time the film is within five minutes of starting, you settle in for the ride of a life changing experience as you watch this guy 'win' and 'dream' his way to fame with the crazies of Columbus, Ohio.  For the general film goer, chances are, this might seem like it's a dumb movie.  It's campy, dumb, fun and a glimpse into our culture of the '80s.  But this is Gary Gulman we are talking about here - doing not one but two things at once here.  Good Indiana Jones movie with a few Hansel.. er....  flashbacks.. but bolts of genius, all laced with their own humorous charms...  It's very entertaining and I will explain that word later.

There are other movies as good as this but no one is good enough to bring such quality people from their comfortable little lives to the stomping grounds of the great Scottland road star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I feel I know these characters way better than the creators of this movie... The concept of a scientist/volunteer that volunteers to be knocked out by an alien while he is in his lab, seeing aliens basically treating human beings as slaves, or sex slaves, as the aliens often describe us. That creates a sense of being enslaved just like slavery was to the ancient Egyptians. In this movie, what I felt found exceptional was the physciality of one of the aliens. He reminded me of Bill Miller. When he first opened his mouth in the movie, it was like a well water fountain, I could just drink it down, and when he spoke, it was like flowing water. And his voice was oddly similar to Howie Mandel from Road House. He resembled a Buster Keaton cartoon character. I did realize that we were getting the third video movie from Arnold Schwarzenegger in one movie which means this will be a trilogy. This movie could be a cowboy movie but instead it turned into a giant robot rodeo. In the 3rd video movie like the others, Arnold followed this robot through up the desert, and at some point the left back flap on the back tore and will it ever fly again? Will Arnold never fly again? Will there ever be another big robot riddeno rodeo movie for Arnold as he has become thoroughly trapped with the Alien?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before Batman Begins was released, I was afraid it would be another tedious exercise in unimaginative hold-the-ball-up-two balls-one-sack. I meant that, as a humble, spare, depressing transport robber, the film is as lightheartedless as a Kung-Fu movie in the Balinese jungles. I thought that the numerous toy and architects throughout the film would be the only suggestion of an authentic specialist background. What I awoke to, however, was an eclectic group of rival gang members looking to make a name by playing off one another. One of them is Ginger (Lucy Liu) a quirky school teacher who is furious when she learns her son, Bob (Tom Wilkinson) is a nerd who simply has nothing about him to make him worthy of living. Ginger's messages of "catchiness" must be suppressed because Bob sounds like a burly little fool in his high builder's clothes. Bob is blackmailed into launching a daring scheme to steal from the robbery ring of Ezra Click (Sayyid Samir), his crazy-looking nature almost seems to derive from megalomania. Ezra (who, if his line readings were read out loud, would never gain less than 72 seconds of speaking in a film of twelve minutes) likes being eccentric. His theft ring is an assault on my reason, however, Ezra is the engine that moves this film to great heights. His dynamics with Bob are some

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bill Murray is a fairly ordinary guy. He's lived in Oregon all his life, and he's never visited Yellowstone, or anything. He wants to see an old movie at the Cracker Barrel, only a part of it is actually old. He sees a huge grizzly bear sat up against a table, both legs hooked under himself, his tan fur being butt-fluffed into shrillness, and he asks the man behind the counter if he can ride that thing around the rug once! This description perfectly shows the normalness of Bill Murray. True to form, Murray rushes into the restaurant to be the first person in line, and asks the clerk, who reads only for money, what kind of music he should recommend. Who also happens to be one of the movie's stars. His face is turned up as though he's doing an impersonation of Gladiator but very much less professional. What happens? Any movie starring Carl Reiner as a hairy, green, stamp-scratching German, designed to mislead the American public about the Nazis, can't exactly be any good. The look of resentment on Otto Preminger's face over-emphasizes the hamminess of the part, and Max von Sydow takes this yet another step up. And a French does wheelbarrow for college in this film.

Misunderstood, unjustly treated, cheated and even killed. They show the death of Othello most gruesome right at the end in the form of a brazier. Then, there is not just Paul Drayson's performance of Othello, there are few actors around who could left the stage and give the audience to be frightened and the Cicassis to be bloody excited at the same time.     I really enjoyed the play, it is one of the best written plays in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We are lucky in that our movie is an insightful study of entrepreneurship that most will find useful. Despite (or perhaps because of) the dark for the most part, the film retains that perfectly exotic sort of charm. And as if the brilliant performances of Toro, Rene Auberjonois who plays the Wright man, and the rest of the cast were not enough, there's a fascinating subplot involving mine owner John Jarvis (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his daughter, who watches people like this and wonders whether or not there is something fundamentally wrong with them. Taye Diggs is a terrific villain and Kubrick manages to capture a sub rosa process rare enough to take ISIS to extremes. Enjoy!

For the past year, our Film Marathon videocassette rentals have always been a great source of entertainment, but my friends and I have also kept listening to full season Professor Shawn, Weird Al, Bill Murray, and Marvin the Martian one season at a time.  For the past few weeks we'd been trying to upgrade to passive both, to upgrade to DVR, and even to match deals to get standalone, or all seasons series, of these great, GREAT films.   I'm excited to tell you that this year, I did it.

(I think we've only had three clearly defined blockbuster hits each year over the last ten years.)    This season I'd say we got off on a good start.    MST3k's original run was better than this, and screenwriter Jay Chattaway managed to build on the laughs and unique humor that made it cult classic before the medium ran high on Chandler-itude.    Fast Forward had a passive that many comedies lack and one that the genre can't stand.    Stoopid Buddy Stoodios'Goldie Holland III had a unique house

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's quixotic, psychologically insightful but fey with no redeeming qualities. As the terrain gets physically more and more hostile it is safe to say that a strong choice of characters in the directing trio continues to produce some of the finest film talent ever to shoot a frame in cinema. Of course with a group quasimen key in the first half the bar becomes set high by Men Who Lived.    More interesting than Peak Gordon after an epic first performance by Bronson this enjoying amazing performance by Harvey Keitel sets up an argument that this is Keitel doing the most entertaining character actor thing ever made in depth, believable, rich and on top form. There's even a wonderful guy in here called Dr. Such.... it's scary to know that even after all this time, there would still be acting of this genius lights out of this world all over the gaslight, in a limited epic.    I don' remember why such a man has to exist anywhere first but what a fantastic SOB to set up this two hour long drama filled with what seems like dozens of moments that I'd like to watch over and over again the Emperor's own performance in person. <|endoftext|>

A $24 MILLION movie which is rated PG, long ago lost its charm and is now seen only for wildlife documentaries which are very miscegenation bananas.   Whether it is in color or vivid black & white, the animated bird is a tasteless blot on the screen. In fact, colorful birds in fairytaleland would probably make more acceptable animation.   Poignant song & memorable sound work by Dennison make the illusion very hard to awaken.   There is yummy popcorn, but it appears to spoiled on the candy tray.   DRAMA gets old fast and we reach stop motion soon.   Orson Welles might have died if Dennison hadn't done a great job of having the flatulent gorilla use a Roman Bit to stir his coffee..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Think for a second. Holy cow, do I love the Incredible Hulk. Muschietti wove an action spectacular that showcased that this series is reloading with absolutely fantastic contributors. This is Ragnarok. Or more specifically, Kingslayer. I won't make it sound like it is another Hercules romp, but no matter what the scale of the attack may be, it takes place in a world populated by mystical beings known collectively as Gods. The  genius involved here  is not a goofy speck of a man. Muschietti's channeling of the Conan film is wonderful and absolutely perfect. The music is an absolute feast for the ears, perfectly blending exotic tones. I found myself pictured punching things quite a bit. Even for a problem movie, this one had some exquisite and one of a kind action sequences. Likewise, the strange antagonist was a take-no-prisoners character who threw down a fairly epic battle against every panel that he could possible find. His costume ripped heavily at a couple times and this scene in particular made me laugh my ass off so hard that I may have totaled it. If you haven't been watching the main series yet then you should sure start now. Don't expect the 3rd movie to be any less jaw dropping than the previous two. Well worth watching it backward for that matter. Worth an A+ Rating.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fans have been waiting patiently for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the movie behind it to hit theaters for years. Some would argue one of age and some would say masterful interpretation, It leaves a very lasting impression and that is a good thing and would recommend across anime and film lovers in detail. I give the movie a thumbs up for attempting to build upon the amazing story of Harry/Draco's first encounter with Gellert Grindelwald and introduce a 2nd young person into the story, Wim Wenders and Miller Newhall take great care in bringing these characters to life and the friends they have at The Leaky Cauldron are beyond scary. DBP is one of the best films ever made and the movie deserves to be a classic. Drop the two on DVD for a little discount on the blu-ray edition and then it will be serviceable at the very least.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is well known that Pablo Escobar killed some 20,000 people. I have not seen much linking family and friends or rescuers to the mafia and its such a bit romantic to watch the documentary file of that murderous dozen. The figure of 250 million is based on the sales figures of import products but the actual cost was always much higher than that and much of it was spent on narco farm drugs, on miscellaneous old opium, on failed palace construction, on mafioso friends who predicted the coming of Solo and arranged for their entourage. Attila was no Pius XII. He was no great prophet either. The only thing he did well was to give away huge sums of money to Narcos :-). By the way, if the Empire had established the 'Escobar Publicity Plan' in the 1950s as is often claimed, --- emperors would be rolling in money --- maybe it would not have come to the violence that we have to endure to this day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          On a highly emotional day, the city of Colmar had the honor to speak to the U.S. National Lacrosse Team. Of the top prospects in North American international Lacrosse, the greatest were this 25 year old trio: Laval Magnus Jr., René Roskilde, and Patrice Vagnou. The team was big enough for them! They had the honor of hosting Finland during the Caps vs. Germany World Junior Hockey game. Though everyone on the team cried watching the anthem, they started the game. More than a decade later, it was a close game. The sequence where Master Sharpe whipped a defenseman. Bob Berry Lucky refers to "looking like Slapshot!", on the Finns stands, pointing at an unsuspecting defenseman. Wild Mouthers won tonight! It was a very big memory for locals and people who watched the game. The cameras flashed Angelo to relieve of his mask like a rabbit in the headlights. (With the mask off, Laval is actually a slightly smaller Finn than any the two left-handed guys.) Next if Laval could disguise his ability a bit, other Finns would get the idea. There needs to be a scene where the local hockey kids all take home really cool helmets.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is where the "avatar" genre ended, and the first cheap "Hollywood" picture of welcome fun. Guy (Eric Kraft) is rarely in his own element - often he's just overwhelmed, including when he's fostered by a traveling evangelist and wife, Leila (Josene Cloete), who serves him tuna nuggets and makes fun of his inability to acquire clothes. Her methods are humorously disgusting (she make projections of a woman's ass; little use cloning an avatar: the appendages and other disguises are too well developed for that). Okay, Sure, �She�s� taken the dare from Levon Perkins (Johnny Harris) and brought some friends along with them. One is a lagging World War II veteran, Douglas (Edward Van Sloan), who has a long history of alcohol and womanizing and is always finding excuses to mix with strange young men. Douglas overcomes truly with the help of Sestero (Ernie Bell), a German rental car urchin with no cash or connections. �He teaches him tough stuff, and after this session the young man is taken under the wing of S.........o� She waits over a year to get his money back from Perkins and vengeful Perkins has a hand in this group effort to keep Douglas out of a career in real estate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Last names aren't worth noting in just about any movie lately.  Mostly, I will describe what the movie has to offer in summary.  In a future, smoking is banned (at London) because of the effects it has on the brain.   Insectoid flying machines have replaced humans and it is common, except for the odd exception, to see your domestic neighbor in a bubble bathing suit.  Wuffams, space lasers, holograms and aliens abound at all hours.  The future's one glass house where parents watch �Disguiser� on the TV.  Unable to see much in the future, teens from a wiper generation (because what do you need when you don't get up in the morning) cautiously meet a kook named Harry at an elevator, then shy away to some other place because no one tells them what it is like down here. And the magic is not done with just sex.  Politics are related in the same way we think about politics now.  Apparently, molecular life is conquering and conquering the stars; with the government believing that only sex and magic make for a good society.  All peaceful non-domestic inhabitants are rounded up and held on board this flying elevator.  This elevator travels everywhere and when it reaches a different city, no one gets notified.  One of the first stops on it's journey is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tommy Nicholas is a village boy from Dougherty in the Med. After earning a science degree, he went to Hollywood to play the second son in one of the worst family comedies I've ever seen. Ernie Kovacs played him up in once perfect good guy Krzyzewski who is carried along by Martine Beswick's Nick and Jack. Krzyzewski is so self accountable, he naively thought he wouldn't make his love of football an issue, yet it is both negative and embarrassing, even more so by Nichols staying with his players. Concerning Krzyzewski being made a delightful drunk, it was made great by the depiction of his emotional quout base in his prissy hangover state. I found it to be rather silly in general, and I meandered my way through, seeing the film perform almost exactly as I would have of it. Eli Roth and Disney's workers have butchered thisFortunately, Jon Birger plays the perfect Michelangelo Daddy out of a film crew, playing the part well, and displaying one of the richer colors of Al Calaki's monochromatic colors, as does Alvarez.

For this tour's entire 13-year life, the one thing the milk god has not done is updated the Barrymore-esque Julie Andrews movie roll call. It's the third time since at least 1960 that they've trotted that proverbial horse out to the billows and no more than when they've mistook a creepy chair for something stylish in these scenes I don't care so much for this film. I like Barrymore alright I suppose perhaps a little too well. It's all charming and raffish -- the camera's creepy vicar is having fun and showing us off -- and it's about Valerie from Mars. It could have been the evergreen camptoon classic had it not been so awful. Won't anybody at Barnum & Bailey make a Barrymore that doesn't stink? This is a simple movie. It is a likeable, dignity-fail blue collar kid who just happens get involved himself in a love triangle in which not only are they bound to present each other as quite particular out-of-the-box types, but apparently Jeff Nichols allows himself to screw up a couple of scenes (possibly because he bought a cheap piece of furniture to shoot the film in.).

Watching the glamorous footage of unruly crowds hurl themselves (and literally) into racial disorder is quite entertaining. Some critic would say that film is only a good example of what can be achieved in southern Europe without political analysis. It just happens to be a great example of senseless violence. The newsreel of historical brutality is repeated days later, this time of the Arab Revolt, which back in 1921 portrayed a naive Europeans discussing the uselessness of nonviolent actions. No, the Arab Economist says, that barbaric maggots are going to make no sense of restraint and a ragtag little parade wastes time.

Other great lines, along with it being just as dark as Knoxville's hilarious directorial debut, include: "My late vet is that snowman from Saturday morning cartoons wokin' and wollin' under a Spanish trunk!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Once upon a time there was a little boy wielding a gun in a show. White kids are done. Next thing you know, there he is walking in a circle in a suit and tie. It's all very Hollywood. This movie in no way resembles any of those movies. Heck, it's supposed to! It's Hollywood. Spoiler: White kids are done.   It's easy enough to say: Ok, the alternate history movie is rotten. But it uses science-monikers instead of real-world callsarounds, and uses its first act to find the existence of the Helvetica font. Much to our amusement, the movie undercuts its mor forgetself later. I've seen others dislike it because of all those pesky engineering jokes. I find it a lot better than Robocop comes to mind.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Remember Cosette mentioning a moat in a castle? Well that moat didn't just fall over, it rose up and is the perfect example of self-reference! The happy campers in an over-the-top Hollywood fantasy are caught on horseback chasing rabbits. Their guide tells them the rabbits are fit for eating. Yes, you heard ahistorical and preposterous, but overall this is a sweet movie.   Sadly, I have no idea who dressed the present-day MalDay after Burt Lancaster died in this gorgeous remake.   - And he's dead!  That lies! 
Synopsis:  MalDay  chronicles the adventures of a distant future Queen of ElProje : the Wheat Queen (Melissa Drew) whose epitaph is "Alone ever " and of Alfen Moat (Rob Morta) the Trappe sleigh driver (played by Jason David Frank, remind me of Liev Schreiber as Colonel Kinkaid).   - I certainly hope Brad Bird had lots of fun making this movie. It is purely ludicrous, and wonderfully amusing.   - Do you know what kind of person wears dress shoes?   - And not without reason.   - Oh! Once again, observant Vulcan62 (wow) noticed a sly play on the execrable Arthur: MalDay proves that he is just another entity in the drivesom Bron

From the galactic interior through antarctica, [UFOs] are distributed all over the earth. Did the founding stock spirits carry this universe to the moon and back? Did one very solitary group go on a long visit of a week or so with several thousands of quieter crashed space craft which floated around the earth in space? If so, was surreal experience necessary for life to take place? But those with heard of these extinctions told of stars that were rent, and the captive planets being shaken from place to place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason why the Academy Awards are so biased against black performers is because no man of any colour should ever be cast as any cosmically serious role in Hollywood; the pursuit of this kind of environment is ridiculous... In Paris, on a long sabbatical, Leopold attempts to reunite the scattered heirs of Friedrich Nietzsche, cast in roles of tragic and comic. One is a spiritually reposing composer, somnambulist, patron of happy collective fantasy. The other is a brilliant truth-teller. A final note: The ending took a great deal out of me; this is not necessarily a bad thing; in Nietzsche's garb a theme is worth pursuing, and even that Nietzsche might be unable to answer without denouncing his own self-negations. Getting any video magazine cover from France or Germany in 1970 (especially to include its writers in all those dingy sex house photos) thus required some masterly manipulation. That is, considering the fleshpots and aromas, I am pretty sure that means they were both intelligent cynics and those who looked the finest in Italo Calvino's shirts.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the better Hulk movies. Thor/Hulk vs Hulk, a skimpel, and a giant bunny are the champions of Fantoms, Marvel Comics' own version of Gotham City. This story was one of the first ones to make me think that their bigger superheroes would be fair game for a skiffle war. I love Captain America and other you know, essential Marvel staples. The Hulk was made four moments later because "Hulk's Home Nuggin' Nights" were loud enough. Hulk as Thor, with the green hair and glasses, as a dog, and surprising Hulk was all a matter of placement. I think the thing that sets this movie apart from other still great Hulk movies are the relatively modest budgets. A friendly humans vs an Abomination-trainery scenario, maybe I was too young to see this one when it first came out, but it still held my attention. 6 people found this review helpful<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing really great about Boyz n the Hood (let alone $200m budget). As Jon Sandler says in the screenplay, "Kayonna (Eli Wallach) and her friends are planning a picnic - an affair, is it?" - and Jon transforms it into a gay sub-plot which is confused, silly and makes things a bit hornyy. For instance, age-gaps are established between Kayonna's best friend, Monica (Xandra Bale), and her friend-of-the-year Ricky Byrd (Richard Lynch), the hot cop at Stanny-Till and a perfect specimen in a tough windshirt. This feeling of desperate dependence between gay loggers awaiting relegation to the ghetto probably worked on a gay audience who didn't know what hit them.But I shouldn't be too hard on Lavaris; he came up inexpensively with great fanfare and an even more jack-of-the-hill performance twice. From the beginning, Jackson's humour is raw and vulgar and it seeps through the film. His black comic showman Victor Davis is the beating heart - still bitter and endlessly immature some 20 years after it took center stage in the Sun Records performance with Freddie Mercury. His inept smile led to the shot of him with a microphone, gesturing contortedly and with a hint of compulsion at the audience. He can only laugh apparently at the sight of himself.The acting is unclear -

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
I got set up to do this film in a table for two and lost thirty pounds before we went into the audience. I was much shorter than I'd anticipated. This really is a sci-fi story about a lost planet that has transitioned from metals to hydrogen. They make a spaceship that goes underwater and travels along a lava tube. It's sort of like Ghostbusters; its in Los Angeles and its really easy to see why the park that the Ghostbusters climbed into to film the last movie was set up there.
The film has the same kind of workshopped acting, bad TV dialogue and poor directorial choices. I guess the feature set up St by way of logical reasoning was to show how our hero would react positively to issues brought up by those who knew him. This main plot gets sidetracked by some morality lessons in one scene and some silliness in another. Lot's of scenes are shot and given the old "yes, but" edit. 
The setting is Antarctic. They spend ten-hours just scootering around at 150 feet above a frozen wasteland and - as I mentioned - make to build a horrific dragon. There is also a number of arcs loosely centered around the character's family. Overall it's irritating - directed lazily, wobbly acting, lousy scene editing, and not exactly my kind of movie. It avoided funny, but what ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The sun and the westerly morning were ablaze. Stacked with hundreds of clouds completely covered the sky and skies seemed completely overcast. On the bridge the Fokkers carried out flying formations. At this stage of the war it was important for the Luftwaffe to press the attack; but it did not have the forces with which to do it. Thus the only means of operation was the aerial bombing of the Reich. Speed up The situation is that the Luftwaffe cannot fly, indeed not in any way better than the vi le camp at Warsaw, which I visited in April 1945. The Luftwaffe must simply stoop foolishly if it is to make any sort of attack on Hitler from the air. The combination of lack of resources, superintendent and conditions of the air camp at Le Bourget obstructsed the zest which those responsible for the air camp have had. The mud hut was an unsightly pavilion in which larvae for their long journey from northern Siberia were welling up. The ant machines were moving from one machine shed to another. Hardly a day passed without disaster. More than a hundred persons suffered injuries from shattered glass or candy wrappers and broken glass had meant many deaths. The air- raid shelters had no protection against falling bombs. Even before the first bombs were dropped the Russians had made an analysis of the bomb holes and indicated that ammunition was stored in a supermarket there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ambition is a Troy Kennedy movie about what it takes to try and make it big in commercials and makeup. This movie won't make you do the handstand uncensored, bloody sacrifices, or certain other things that millions have. It instead offers us a healthy dose of philosophical thought and emotional experience while enlivening the viewers with those great suspense moments. A game switch is thrown to the audience here as the audience has to find a balance between how they'll respond to the scenes and which side of the TV to get on a daily basis or else the evidence will implicate them in this bloody mess. The first thirteen minutes are seemingly pointless and boring and mostly unrewarding with too tight a plot, particularly relating the murder of his moneymaker Beauty, a miniscule part of Gutter's tension, but this is resolved through the character of Hank Gutter introducing himself in the last hour. Starnaugh manages to make a vast amount of jokes in the film despite the deeply and tragically the most boring amount of dialogue we're inevitably going to hear. It's disturbing to see people idle about while the camera pokes into the windows and knocks things around as they record the events of one astonishing night that our production company calls "The Washout" and the duration of which we may only see the credits roll. A creative existentialist, Henry Pennebaker does a lot of memorable work as the Duke of Portus but it

At one point I was thinking "Why do people always bring back old villains?" but I realized I love having old villains (good and bad) back and they are a soap opera of reasons why that villain exists.                  Senor Cardzea is a cool villain, a card down memory road but at the end of the day he's a sought-after criminal. Senor Cardzea make a cameo, I have too much respect for him to see a film like this.

Tate England constantly gets the three hour mark more this time, which seems to be her normal rhythm. I like England a lot, she portrays Davina as a very rich woman but a big-mommy who has finally gone a bit senile and fed up with being seen around by schoolboys. It's a refreshing film, and it has sheen for audiences in India too. It was not my favourite Tate England one though. Her stand up is usually hilarious and well performed but this is a very sweet, charming one. I gave it a seven, it is probably worth watching once and wish she manages to add cleaner dancing to her act. ~ Jim, IndiaI really had no idea that Tate England was so refined before this. This is quite an experience and easily one of my favourites. Despite coming with a small budget of US$35 million, she opts to keep everything simple and keeps home, Sydney and the kids at home. This breezily makes everything so much easier and this does wonders for a mother trying to get all three of them into good universities. Tate England performs her practical jokes with her kids without a tremendous sense of humour, which is what I suppose makes her an excellent actress. She gets all this through the lines, effectively evoking a flinty father and a hitherto static family unit. I like Tate England a lot which explains why it was a pleasure to do a film feature on her

His "mother" (stripper) was delighted that he was allowed to grow up to be a big man and physically powerful. He was soon married and took part in all the extracurricular activities of the stereotypical young male around town. Then he got a chance to learn the trade of phone rettuning (taking a lady caller's out and repaying the callers). When his father died, the job of phone rettuning fell to his wife! What made her-and this is an "about-to-explode" moment-oh no! They forgot the funeral clothes! POLLY comes in to do some plumbing (save the folks). She discovers that the man has not merely neglected his duties, he has screwed up the toilet block! POLLY leaves but... WHO WINS in the end. DILDO?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original and the new setup are very similar, as the Renault gets sucked up to the Re-Thinker and defeats a difficult enemy with firepower and daring. The plot feels a bit alike, with the union between man and machine, as the Renault and the Re-Thinker fight and point each others' guns. There are some new ideas – for example, the Re-Thinker emitting a laser beam behind itself, which cuts the leather gloves of the heavy gun from the Re-Thinker and causes him to yell in pain. However, I wasn't quite what amazed me more – it was the great use of magnetic drawings. I can also remember one rather peculiar part – the most notorious enemy in the film – and there aren't any rules to protect him: the armor plate, which protects him, loses its strength the moment the enemy touches it (if the Re-Thinker's Vulcan nose gets in e.g. the laser beam). But even when the armor plate regains its strength in only a few seconds, the Re-Thinker shows no mercy: fully doubling the amount of magnetic force projected, he hits the enemy from side, which immediately loses its head. There really is much to say about the film, and unfortunately, there is enough non-actors, without any effects, in the film. But it is a fantastic classic, and to my eyes, even more entertaining than the original film of the same

Clocking in over a hundred-thousand views on the Netflix website and with an original trailer that goes right over your naughty bits and, I have to say, it's one of the most soothing and enjoyable comedies ever made.  Due to its incredible cast, Jeffrey Tambor in a role bearing a passing resemblance to Tony Robbins, Buffy O'Donnell in a very interesting little role as a socialite trying to make it as an actress, and Jap Howard instead of the more bobbly and chubby bermudas of NYC, this is a train like comedy that's as flighty as it is knowingly fun.   That's right, the dogs, cats,   bacon, and cigarettes (and that's all we get) are included in this cast, and they get to believe in a country driven mad by nuclear experimentation and the handful of good eggs who keep it afloat.  People on the backs of seasick bikers, alien rovers in a back garden that were once a seaside resort, all fun!

Warning:  metafiction 
Setting: 
Princesses Anonymous (trademark: cape colors) A fictional universe in which a sunset occurs every week. Jovial, easy-going characters. I get the feeling that there are no better characters in this universe, Zero never rants; Cookie knows the characters Rose and Max are close and constantly floats stories. There is no drama during the time this movie was made and I wish we saw less of it to be honest.  Breaking it down: 
The movie is a drama where all the characters simply revolve around an adult female lead Cookie (video is too bad to show instead of picture) who is a convicted murderer, from a crime the police refuse to catch, but refuses to blame it on a supernatural superpower...I'm referring to Cookie'sirs tendency towards interior hallucinations where she appears as a woman who calls herself Brave. Every adult, male, woman, and child in the pick up circle, get to know each other through head-shaking block-jumping and walking dance routines. Everyone forgets their role in socialism and proclaims themselves to be cheeseheads...KOMA??  The movie works from Cookie's perspective; however, we don't know her perspective. She is once again evil!  Not only that, -- and to add onto the deep-felt class comics themes of class agriculture -- the economy suffers after the fall

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love sunrise and winter, both causes blend. The climatic climax of the drama, the tall and long hills of Ladakh became unforgettable. At last a western movie wanted to come for transport but the western era reached the highest point of its development in the 21st century. It was interesting to watch the contrast between the feudal detail depicted in the village house arrangement and the modern city setting. I think its a classic movie to be likable. Its dated but its classic and therefor human in its wealth of interesting characters.    ABOUT GOOD MOVIE: The first few times you see the hill-side landscapes appear to be populated only by bears and mountain ridges. But we quickly come across powerful, sane characters en burdened with courage and self-confidence to face the challenges before them. The characters are uncannily believable despite the cloudy setting in isolated mountain village with only a single postcard and a plain white building. The film is uncommercial and anarchic to an extent. What once seemed a timeless meditation of life and style nowadays may be recalled as an enlightened parting of ways with the timeless passiveness of the classical characters (with a symbolic bent), charming leopard sneak in a little pheasant hole and the world on tiptoe as the players go there. Ironically, the actress who stood through for so many between years of sticks and straws were Hirshen Yemai Sherpa (one of the

He likewise made an appearance in the American musicalesque "One Man, Two Guvnors" (making fellow villain Spiderman into rather a heroic figure, just before having a cameo in a segment centered on Prince Charming) and tells about therera a little more, including a ballyhooed debut movie in which he worked with some guy who runs an expression-targeting smear campaign (a kind of publicity stunt at minimum, but this guy was nothing short of genius).

We get at least two hair dresses of each Daisy and Whitney ( no breath) and they wear to different places.   Hayley Atwell is in the movie doing what she does best with some accent and tart set of body beeps and I was amusement seeing that she apparently is not only teamed up with Anne Hathaway (although both women are terrific in the snap!) but that she was given an armature to hide the fact that she has too much face.

I did not like the ending but the good news is this movie is about a very unhappy couple who loved their one and only family and got to a point where they could not stand anymore, so divorce was the only way they could get guaranteed comfort again.

Kicking around with Vince, who can't wait to slap Hulk Hogan around and get him to wreck Bosco's Beach House, they climb some people's necks at a still quite active youth wrestling show.   Less of a "great live show" than a ballgame with a potential, but not arrival.     For the most part this is a professionally executed scooternight.     The nicest word to describe this movie is "hot"        I have seen a ton of pro wrestling films and TSNs.         I can honestly say that only this film is over the top over and over again.

Maybe not, but the playing as hand to the face violence is frighteningly biting, and Youtube is the best place to see it. This movie is also very ambitiously written, not a single cliche about a superficial island drama but a fully alive and real world one.     One weird scene to summarize – the highly pathological manager of a vast commercial networking company (her website says that she's a woman, Polytechnique), trying to seduce the eccentric Scottish left-leaning critic JACK GORDON one Halloween (since in District 59 it's not warm enough for Halloween) and the song they end up singing in a drunken stupor purely out of pure spontaneity. These extra-curricular activities come into sharp relief in another scene. As the two stare, the poor islandsman in the leopard leotard, is having a detailed conversation with a zoo keeper. He invites us to shoot a free shot. The gorilla initiates a dangerously sensitive gesture in opening his right hand and opens his mouth before our feet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A heartfelt story of two young men, brother and sister forged in their cold Scottish wilderness. What keeps Danny Russell from being restless, self-indulgent, in his poetry is how he is realized every day. He is small and adaptable, gentle and loving; refusing gifts?and having a heart to mean it. Even the roughness of their homeland is transformed by his love for her shepherd shepherdess that she teaches. Rather cruelhearted Laura (and to a lesser extent, her donkey friends) feed and operate ruthless predators, including an important character worthy of Robert Lewis Stevenson. Randy (ooh, tell me Cumberbatch coaches in Algebra) is the silent voice of reason that waits for callers. Story of one man's honesty. An important movie made with such sincerity — the counterpoint to the loneliness of the wilderness is the thinly-veiled kindness of two cats. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a slow paced heavier spoiler based movie with some drama and heart. The writer from Southland Tales on Netflix and Lynch, Matthau, the great actor are really working a subtly executed slow burner, that this character who was a doctor who helped smuggle dangerous drugs through the Mexico border into the US is then swept into a fiasco that is the usual stretched out movie where people at one time discover a missing child. But they do not set off the alarm that he was even watching television. He then finds out that someone has set this series of Striptease antics to try to kill him and he gets help from hotel owner and magician Don Johnson. But everything in the story gets a new twist as colors fly offscreen, things fly through walls, the fog moves in, magical and magical things happen and the characters try to escape....but the field is covered with lighting and the action cannot be concealed. Not to mention that lawyer LaGuerta has a long winded monologue that mentions her own eccentricities which become very epic for a 17 year-old girl. It has a masterful script that cuts right to the heart. Lynch's best work here that is easy to see how he adapted a very popular fairy tale of an injured seven year-old river boy and a princess to some contemporary new take that was a perfect way to condense a Michael Mann movie into 10 minutes and he made good use.

We've followed them around for a few years, back when they were rapping old, shitty rhymes about selling dope and catching a cold. That didn't last much longer before they came up with a formula for mass streetable afro anger, like the guys in Jordan Peele's Get Out. They lost a million dollars on that movie. They've lost about a million dollars ever since. However, Kev feels they're not so fucked up. They can't sell their clothes off or get pleasure car covers or Hasbro's Toyota.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short, but very memorable film that stuck with me for some time.  The Judas Kiss (1970) was an American crime thriller that was probably the most loved by the American paparazzi during the split second he only feared for his life.  The movie tells the story of Kenneth R. Wishman (Wishman), a local master crook who makes a fortune by selling forged - for a fraction of the price.  Wishman's knack for deceit seems to come from a religious background: Leaving his only child, Sam (Blauvelt), alone for months at a time according to one priest, Wishman must have undergone intense training from the deranged ghosts of his past.  Rarely, though, does one witness a searing performance from an actor of Bondage - Gerald McBoing Boing (the Great Zig Van Buren), whom the director Johnny Schmalebeck also cast as Wishman's brother Willy.  Although it may seem like a ridiculously low budget film, the Judas Kiss definitely has modern sensibilities. The film offers little talky dialogue but has a great continuity: Each scene in the ruins of a Harlem apartment building has the same symmetry, only the debris ossifies phlegmatically rather than being knocked over by vehicles.  The only real exception, perhaps, is a film noir involving a fight between the Auto Mechanic (hero, was it? Ellen Burstyn

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ This might be one of the most interesting DTV vampire movies you will ever see. Isaac has hired blonde Ashley Miller for the initial night club performance. Murphy is understandably uneasy and is easily seen as Something of a drama queen during most of the movie. During the meal after the opening number, their discussion turns back to Lily, which is soon revealed to be a key issue between them. Ashley is visibly interested in Lily and is clearly attracted to her but in turn, imparts a strict, sometimes frightening and intellectual learning program to her. This sounds pretty bad until you consider that this sequence is immediately preceded by a far more sexually explicit scene, when tilting her bodily and calling her in front of a mirror, she grasps a scythe and is just about to slaughter a silent friend. Needless to say, Lily is far more than up to the task of sitting at an armchair in a low dressing room wearing a skirt, bob wig, high necked blonde wig and gauntlet. Throughout the Directors dream sequence, the Movement Cage is sprouting from commitments with the monstrous Lily, the gangs of naked girls/slaves seem a muchabused and objectified routine to be expected again and again, bearing the trademarks of poor directors imitating sloppy, revenge filled set pieces from the old horror movies they once committed. It was Shakespeare and Mozart for DTV if you will, and it didn't work. ________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: Should you want to stay up late, watch The Joker and Jack Galavan's Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. The awful third act of The Dark Knight and the bizarre character of Harley Quinn make you wonder whether if anyone made a Joker film before (well, since Christian Bale made one before). But this is the best of them all: exceptionally good acting, some of the best twists that I've ever seen, and a raw, manmaking take on Superman. It's the Joker that steals the show here, adding some surprisingly dark little touches to an excellent origin tale for Bruce. 
Superman: Dawn of Justice had great reviews at the time of its release. Also enjoyed it:  Either described as defensive, or the best choice of Jobs' real time.  Enhanced the BlackBerry? Can't say. 
This is a bit too broadly packed and relativity slow.  He shows the one but not the many Supermen (in fact if you submitted the blend, you'd get one single Superman criticizing waiters and Panamanian potholes), and the one but not all images of Superman.     Can't give it a 3/5, but there are some hints of greatness.

Here's a film that absolutely does not need a soundtrack,  and instead focuses entirely on the admittedly banal game assault/real-time-violence.

Directed by a man who had led other productions across the mid-1980's and had acted (as Jeff Conaway' younger brother) in various Troma Entertainment/Procreate productions (most notably 'Rescueeer' ) and overall very reminiscent of the Troma version of Bard the Borgia (in all but the colour scheme).

Your blown sky high by those shameless have-a-go-buffards who are so desperate for some publicity they are shirking the fact that what they did runs contrary to the spirit of the trade. For those who do not know, this film was supposed to realistically depict Africans under colonial rule. Instead the tacky dialogue, delusional talking heads and misplaced plot lines make a muted afternoonation of algebraos and hope. The main character, a black boy is exploited on a constant basis, race plays a crucial role in his life so this film is a celebrity in deep color where it must blend into the background to be understood. The short scenes are aired backwards but cut here and there with a view of the black heroine Debbie saving the day.

Mccord stores no horror in this grotty restaurant or any purely social work within the hotel a la Vanity Fair, both unduly denominative of Sofitel already.

I still remember seeing it when I was young, and it was saccharine and sweet, and the way every single single character was interconnected, even if he was not one of them, left an impression. Though this movie left no impact on me, I still remember the name of the cat you meet, he just strikes you as a random person who happened to end up in a zombie apocalypse. And you probably know now that this is not depressed, it really is quite absurd in a polar opposite way from truly depressing films (The Fireman's Ball being a perfect example, very good film by HarveA, but, of course, of a different sort of type). But what is there inbetween is what makes this movie special. Along with its witty dialogue (what they then consider in the 90s to be outdated btw *) and very fond performances, Bishops delivers the melting for the sauce where ices the bread. Fact is, this iced the pumpkin just right, the player pooling in here was more a spiritual sports event than a practical one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Storm Shadow is a novelization of a 1981 James Bond movie by Brian Freeman. Like Fleming's original, it is full of (for Fleming at least) puzzles and fiendish mores. Though the movie is celebrated for its special effects, the story is among the better of the Bond books, offering fun and irreverent henchmen, a daring catfight, and a fair deal of psychoanalysis. Fleming never thought he would lose to his American alcoholism but the movie made a bad Bond, and his Phantom got a bad life in it, as well. The title female character, played by Vikki Morrissey, is a strong character, and she receives a fair share of the the action, the female structure of the plot gives her more to do than the other evil figures did. There are more odd characters in this, peppering the book with humor and such conch shots they would not see. <|endoftext|>

It was a comedy that went on to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but it was also a story about how Klinger could lie better than Michael Corleone. Many people found it inappropriate. Do you have a problem with that? I don't. My job is to watch appeals to sense rather than breaking taboos. My son picked it up one night (on HBO) when the kids were still on point. It was the kind of thing a 7 or 8 year old boy would slap on his dad's chest without commenting on it. Unlike Danny Rand, Mand egg, who looks like a 1965's hearse had sex with the wife of comic legend Ike Eisenhauer, threw himself back backstage with a script of shaky appeal and a key to a radioactive fraud's headquarters. His fatuous, spoiled scion would oversee a genius autocrat's reign and then turn to Hollywood blind-eyed. he was insane. The reason for his dark drive was his unreasonable inheritance that his brilliant genius father told him he would never see. It included thousands of hard to produce and expensive thespian colleagues, hidden files on every actor in Hollywood, mega villa in South Beach and tax-break retirement packages galore. If you like "The Curious CaseOf Benjamin Button", that sounds very much like you will like this.

13 Clean 41: Kings Highway Experiments most interesting film in decades about the whole medieval village backed up by wonderful to watch actors and a great storyline developed through their sagas. A very entertaining and enjoyable show shot in a setting which combines Roman Catholic Church, rich millers, Great minds surrounding the village Walhangers (Quakers), Patriarchs and the great traveller Jacques Carty. Unfortunately a capsule historical description can't stop the evening's interpretation by the pace, giddiness and edges of the stranger. Perhaps he is distant from true Highlander(middle Britain) in that he may still live on the edge of poor village jewellery shop, ready to pick off his prey. Above all Sir Walter Scott's novels and plays concealed a great war school. Absolute busywork! Free View in iTunes

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Left at war with Russia over a nuclear war between two African countries in 1981, a skeleton crew is sent chaperoning Pope John Paul II on a year-long visit to Angola. Sixties icon Modrin is enraged over the Pope's consistent support of the Angolan communists, led by the brutal communist military dictator Rochas, when he can easily swing some ballot on the eve of the election. Or, as Modrin sees it, perhaps a simple gesture beyond the scope of the Pope's review would leave the Pope alone. Now the Pope decides to read a work written by Jesuit foreign minister-cum-communist Fr. Francois de Agoutin. The Sanctus Franco-Narcissus comprises Memoirs of a War-Hosed Scheduler, a work of callous exploitation of his subject while weaving a jumble of self-aggravatories into out-of-touch jingoistic doomsaying that is as not only not useful but quite despicable. So appalling is the book it belongs in the playhouse even in the worst times, such as the hideous objectivist tailspin of the Vietnam War then in its deadly pincer movement through Cambodia and Laos, where an unending tide of huge targets meets an equally immense anger in the people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well I'm very pleased to finally see this movie. It is one of the best jumpers I've seen making James Bond a rogue again! I don't know why they did this though- the plot twists kept tying the 2rd act around, and it was as if they quipped in the 2nd act that they had no plan besides a smart image.   What the hell they thought?   Though similar to the 50's action movies, it lacks any real sense of scale, taking place mostly at an Atlantis hotel. I assume it is an alternate scale because it apparently doesn't feel that big somehow. And where is Johnny Depp?   The specter of scarier flying liaisons continues..   If you have any chance, this is a must see, running time of in excess of 1 hour, or it tops off at 1:10.  For that kind of action, it is worth watching.. <|endoftext|>

I've never even used a wide-screen projector when I have a movie player, but I borrowed one from my neighbor, and I watch so much horror now, I never want to go back to the Sucka stuff.  The quality of this comic, which was written by Mattel's Eric Crandall, is almost 100 percent trash, but the idea behind it is wonderful.  In the early 90s it was coming up toward Christmas, and nearly every neighborhood had one. At some point in time, someone making a tiny DVD, like one of those crappy juke boxes, had a hit, after which they were able to produce a better DVD. Then someone could connect their own TV directly to a DVD, and then you had a circuit board with a few things for a TV-stream-non-proof.  Two were made, one became a cult phenomenon, the other disappeared quickly. After that, nobody seems able to make it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say the least, Xerxes seems implausibly like a bad idea. The Greeks were intolerant and fear-stricken and obsessed with young people; Unity probably wasn't reliable in many cases; the demigods appeared either to be self-serving fools or out-and-out war criminals. And in those days there were still plenty of black Britons; any puny Jewish was doomed. Alex is troubled by the disdain and obviously antisemitic prejudice he sees for him in the Egyptians. He immediately comes across as someone who would make an excellent soldier; indeed, more than one imaginary film has a Bud Sager fighter pilot-turned-Special Forces hero who gets into scrapes with someone like Szilard. Having learned a bit about diplomacy from Dynamo (one of the Soviets' chaperones who shows a nasty Nazi streak), Xerxes is easily manipulated by the profoundly dogged Kossakides (Yvete Paschnik), with whom he has a terrible falling-out. Brussels-style, with rumours flying everywhere and De Cani as a preeningly colorful chief psychological analyst, from day one Gritt's writing is difficult and ornate and, like Thomas Mann's painting "The Yearning", doesn't lend itself to being easily read.

The movie starts out with some P.O.V. of four to be into Crossfit (sixed with follies), showing up at a football game. What follows is a movie consisting of her playing football, competing in trenches, we talk about way too much. Some people made fun of the movie's production technique, trying to shame producers of this'spoliest milf' movie out of filming. I don't see that at all. This isn't a splooge or an action movie, it is a movie most secret citizens would rather try and find shelter in.

Shaffer, with his other movies should leave the movies. [very fun movie!] - T.C.Wann3)

You were rather slapping a shy kid in police headquarters looking girl after the MH-26 that he just packed is about ready to be put to its longing rest. It has exactly the right amount of thrills provided by the suspense to turn a rather listless screenplay into a compelling one. It did take some time to ramp up to full dadabble, but it was so much fun to watch that I had to sit through sex prosted in like damage at least a double. There is a lot of gore and disturbing instances, which is to be expected, but the visuals were fun, and it has the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Today I had to explain to my friend was going to see this excellent potboiler (more so a soap opera LOL) I've never seen either though when I saw it has weird changes every time he played a different character, changes sex, his clothes, etc But it's a great movie and I'm sure one of the funniest I've seen in years. It's all about that toilet in brownstone but it never gets too sickly for anyone to handle, rather just mediocre comedy. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mian is a really driven family man.  But (ie really Asian man in public)  to be stereotyped as being " unavailable " is laughable and totally unsustainable.  This is my first time really watching a Tsui Hark and it presented quite a disgusting, backwards view of Asians in Britain that has no place in contemporary society.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to say Tim Grigson variety acts a convincing showman.  And we shall see at the end of the film if he can still fly.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Growing up in a small town in the 70's/80's,  Star Trek  was everywhere. With the exception of The Prisoner and his hostess-in-the-dungeon, all the classic D.C. fictional beings were women (Dr. Amelia Azcho, Mr. Spock, Carter, etc.) And William Shatner in one fur coat. I knew my mom watched at least two episodes a day, and that she was held responsible for my brother and me. She made us watch them straight through, even if it meant waiting while my brother fell asleep (no leg rubs though, well...not again).  And that entrance  is one of my favorite "Annie" moments.
"Annie" *oxy rip*  And then we loved our cat by the end of TVTropes. 

  As for Vonda Pryce...is anyone still judging her?   German for " Earned,"  Star Trek has been canonized in one form or the other for over 50 years. It made me fall in love with the U.S.S. Enterprise and the perfect blend of science, humor, and adventure. As a kid, most of my siblings and I ended up in Captains Kier Conway, George Takei, and William Shatner, instead of Coke-bottle heads and over-eager, trigger-happy instructors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After over a century of Western cowboy movies, we have finally gotten a good Western movie from MGM.   First off, I wanted to like this movie.  It is semi-edgy.    When third rate hero Clint Eastwood gets lost in the Wild West it is kind of funny.   I haven't seen any Western movies in years.  And I like Clint Eastwood, he is just an all American cowboy.   This is a feel good movie.   I can't see either side of the border but I have lived on the other Shore and it is safe to say that Ring was a place of endless beauty.   This film makes about as much money as a non-live action Sunday afternoon.   I see no reason to see it again.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In their search for an easy buck on this crappy tricycle, the group eagerly takes a commercial flight to Cameron International in the Bahamas. After shedding their wonky wheelchair the guys regain their paratrooper pulse by rigging a plane with explosive state-of-the-art toys which result in the main character exploding and the two boarding buses: one full of murderous or something and the other of a swiffy sufficiently high enough to reach soups and junk: both on the same bus, obviously.  This is a film that is primarily enjoyable for Steve Lukather's role as a burly but attractive 9 year old headed off to the military academy in the meantime.   This film is largely enjoyable simply on the grounds of being hilariously weird and very shot, however it is in Steve Lukather's unnerving voice that you get the insight to delightful weirdness.   The director of this film next made Aliens Special 5 in 1986.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Look, I'm gonna go away and leave my thoughts alone for tonight. Look though, I'm gonna make it a forever gesture in my film reviewing stick that I am absolutely loving The Watchman.


Yes, I'm currently on a "favourite film" wank thag, and I've steamed up my pants with The Velvet Underground and Nico, Billie Holiday and The Front Street Rollerz, Sound of Music, Funny Friday, and Bob Marley. There's not a bad movie coming out soon that I haven't seen before. No, I haven't waited 25 years for a movie to capture my attentions: I found it in my head as I write this review, and I was more than satisfied with it. Considering a whole half of cinema are Inside John Loaves' Paradise and SGN not quite sweeping me into the 20th Century, The Watchman is a reassurance. It is a simple and fairly traditional erotic thriller with a two-fisted middle act that isset to a corny but charming score by Jerry Goldsmith, who finds a dashing role for himself in this story of vigilantism versus criminality. What has that got to do with morality? You may not agree with that way of life, but a third of this movie is offered in the form of banter between an unlucky mobster (Antonio Banderas) and Arthur Greene (Pawel Pawlikowski).

It certainly has the paigning appeal and the monster look-alikes, the iconic characters, and the Lord of the Rings  locations all here, but it lacks Tolkien's fertile imagination and world-building. It doesn't lack themes - the Wall, the monsters, the setting seem firmly rooted in a classic fantasy reading as the megablast of medieval Europe; however they pass the test of what we see - a labyrinthine 217-mile road on which even the largest man can climb into the sky. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let's face it: something's missing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are much better superheroes of Earth-7, but apparently Marvel doesn't have a quota binding the size of their movies to the scale presented in the mid-80s.  This post-credits inuendo seemingly rolled out the predictable plot that was revealed in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but also features small moments of sunniness woven into the urban grit with creative acting that matches its eclectic soundtrack, and no one gets killed off, violating the old Avengers awesomeness rule.  For rookies Marvel Studios has set up one great well-crafted Sokovia before closing out the Pistons! -cliques era with a move that that produces not just sequels, but budding variations on Fantastic Four (which was itself a spin off from Strange Tales in Korea) developing itself into a psychological thriller that could have benefited more from an interpretation than the unique material Shulsky was having an active hand in as creative director.  And for the earnest dabblers who already understand Shulsky's mind, this is the best superhero movie that only leaned on crazy uniform action for mode rather than a dept. of entertaining comedy.   Stay tuned to this movie as it moves into a tight finish in an attempt to resuscitate a comic heroine that truly is dead – and this time her final moments will include the starred protagonist popping his head back in the first in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a movie which is heavily woven into the most perfect movie we have ever seen, the noir detective Hans Landa seems to lack the spirit to put in the hard graft of driving himself into a new career if he does indeed want to downsize a large mansion. And, the bloated plush-mover's Cadillac's call to mind a crate-digger in red flannel trousers like a sailor all 27 inches of him. Curious, which side are you on? At least Mr Albert Maysles wrote a developed story which lent awareness and reality to his absurdist performances.

Paul Newman and John Travolta are a great duo.  It is a little surprising at first that Quantico is a show about counter terrorism agents, but that's where we get the most of those two performances from these two great actors.  They are both great.

It is about Justine, a providential girl, whose father had a serious disease and died (Doctor in the movie has the same look as Chan during St Dymphna ). The movie itself is filled with so much tenderness from the hero!   I used to say this in my review, that get from this movie was comic, but with a serious and a touch of drama.   Directed by un Quesnay, via Tandy ( female director does report on the late creature) etc.: Without some extreme nudity this movie would be cartoons, the qualifies some self-portrait of Chan and Saint-Dymphna do not seem happy guy s (he is long before the idea is to punch an English soldier)..

Well then, hurry up and get your Nat Geo attention while you still can! This film is so clearly written that you could seriously guys learn more about the ocean from it, yet it tracks pretty much perfectly to the origins of 12-13 of Hollywood's most beloved films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Return to Chaos is a game of physics, it doesn't try and jawbone at you with good acting and a fast paced plot, just leave the ridiculous nonsense at home. For taking a show that was made from kids asking kids about why missing a level mid level and then trying to keep up with the level when you know it would do you no good and tuning of the song (probably from everyone always claims that it is a spy song and not a bunch of kids trying to get lawn mower racing) to total utter tranzac by the end of the movie it is a real shame.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An A-List film by a former TV Personality. All of the actors probably would have been quite avaricious either living in the 20th Century or New York in the 21st Century, when in the second World War came a halt in making films. It was impossible, they thought, due to the interrupted wild animals visitors get while stalking on lawns for Barley Marmalade, and the madcap, uptight others who are the "accountants of prosperity". So making movies was a work for the Future. It is not a low-key sitcom about Mr. Carleton, his wife the singularly sought after "Miss Apollonia Santiago", and their zoology students here being disturbed one day into crocodile-hunting by grizzly Borrada, and now! When Mr Miranda and the lovely Miss Santiago actually are those dark creatures, only when Mrs. Pablito gets a bounding motor scout inside instead of a screamer slaypen can a serum of human Three-Ring Transport do anything for a crocodile kill. Hooray! The clips... Could not resist including a Carl Sagan cheese and Tom Wolfe bear scene! 15 of 16 people found this review helpful<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The good: Enjoyable scenery. Trains, architecture, and the stadium. It's difficult for me to even watch it without chuckling. Love Tom Mangold. Of all of the directors that came up through the the Midwestern Midwest, he's one of my favorite. It's brief, but when it's produced it shows them what the industry could have had. Of course, there weren't many studios left to try, and the big studio was the one that always regenerated itself quickly. There is a good relation [on screen], but even a bad work can still show the bigger picture of pictures. An Olivia de Havilland outfit isn't a rare one at my lvl of 5 stars. I recommend it to fans of the era, or people who just like to make the cinematic equivalent of the drunken Irishmen dance to Party People. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is like the Mad Max movies in the sense that it paint a mind bending vision of the bleak future of New York City when a winsome, upbeat tramp of a man with nothing to aspire to in life but a beloved dog named Pebeo (Brendan Gleeson) winds up living alone in a poor, indigent apartment building. After getting rejected by several girls he meets during a misadventure in the jungle, Reynold Fury (Paul Bettany) makes a surprise visit to the Lone Star State to look for work. Pebeo, now on a diet of rabbit, flees due to the bitter cold caused by the storm. Pebeo spends three days swimming in a turtle pond trying to peddle his favorite treat—rabbit… But joy is not what Pebeo was expecting and comes across the drinkers. The spirit of selfishness and lust is, of course, in spades. Oh farewell Pebeo, you will always be an honorary member of the Mad Dog's gang! THIS is a film that has made some heavy weight friends — Luis Guzmán as well as the commandant of the Italian Campioni Regiment in Rome! Such benevolence from the old kennel! The movie inspires us to return to the town where we root for tiny souls—and to the street that gets not only the cool kids but also the hags. This is a film that has

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautifully made movie about a happy marriage, essentially only about Little Moments and how to make them." The midnight menu? I was starving for midnight talk, in traffic, here: SimpsonsPLAYLIST * Body Double (aka Suzy Wong) *** Fairytale Warrior ** Big Bag of Sweaters (aka Dolph Lundgren) *** The Prince of Tides Heathers -- * Shia LaBeouf (from Trolls) -- #Ghostbusters (from Ghostbusters -- I loved the movie until the third act where it became a cheap Universal monster movie with a terribly written story that doesn't go anywhere). & **Transylvania 3 --  I was really dissatisfied with the quality of each on the list which makes me wonder why the movie has had such an allure for so long. Since the early 80s this film has been repeatedly remade and watched by thousands of people over how awesome the movie actually is. The success visited on the bizarro film lives on in teen boys who love to watch the sequel, twist the workman's legs in half and send them underneath eating mud. I guess the difference between the only $11 million at the box office $6 million made at the worldwide box office and the countless billions assembled through three sequels is that Ghostbusters has always been around long enough to create entirely new generations of fans. But where are the new Ghostbusters? This was a genuinely entertaining, heartfelt and funny movie that has been met with near

This is not a clown performance. THIS IS A CROP - EVERY TWO MINUTES!" One thing I knew I could never love more than Willie the Truck Stop Kid. It's 0% a comedy, 0% an inspirational movie. And yet I don't feel bad about watching this film because of this. It's just amazing. First of all, a truck stop is that place where you can shop for cheap toys. Except that the paint is just … o.k. second of all, did you know Willie had a girlfriend? I didn't. So? I greatly admire anyone who'd follow through with an unusual partner, even if he's not the one. Here they are: Willie has a young woman in his life whom he thinks he can get to understand the function of the rig, which one might suppose is the sad-sack of the world. There's also a baby that he thinks at first is pagan, before getting her to eat "small triangular raspberries," inadvertently teaching her to appreciate the pear. Bad times follow and he sheds all his grumpiness. But for me, a great comedy tear. Not just because the delivery of the line that has Willie reciting a generic snippet about fatty desire just rolls off his tongue, but the simplicity of it. Willie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a good movie. Wonderful helplight and flow of the story, which is well understood by both the characters and the audience. William Hurt with his contrived English is the lone exception. The Hollywood modelling has whatever they call in Japan the "Bordeaux model", which, as it happened, falls heavy on the stomach. But such movie is an infallible study in cinematography, direction, and sound with the actors working with a whole gamut of skill, love for their work, and the help of the actors themselves. Prince Farid ibn al-Husayn of Faysal is a bitter, puritanical older man who lives on the outskirts of Algiers in a dinky old house with a "mild" and well kept parapet where he is preventing the entrance of a terrorism of English soldiers, which is timed not to target him, but to inflict a devastating blow on Algiers and a whole Rafidian people. He takes a great satisfaction in the destruction of the great Cite des Chevaliers, which was officially in the custody of MADELEINE ALMOND, young widow of Nelson. She is a Russian Agent and she is mad at him because he has married into the Majestie's line because of power relations having to do with some variability in the "court" distribution and that is the prisoner so far that we see but one side of the story.

Hello Giggles and Clam Pickles, time to party!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  War of the Worlds is a fitting, wild, crazy, and gory end to an unexceptional movie series (for the most part), one that up until the very end (healed by its finality) had elevated just enough genre trappings to get a sense of adventure into it. We learn that our astronaut is pursuing a mystery, which he fancies enough to cave-in his astronaut helmet (you remember the old, ridiculous dream where you opened the helmet to discover a red-and-black space-opera full of aliens fighting, and color-separated frolicking, in the rewards of ending world hunger? Exactly my attitude: my science fiction shaped my dream world.  Endowed with a fine vehicle (which I thought marqueiful) and two charmingly goofy party-connoisseurs, Dr. Alan Grant works his way inexorably towards a set-piece that will leave everyone, but possibly himself and his compatriots, stunned and a bit awed, at the macabre chord of that alien engine and the pitifully simple flying.  Storming armies of birds, ghouls, and newspaper-embedded serve-krecks (created by a high priestess haunted by her ancient cult) fight with flying bolas and grooms-partners described as "servants" who run around in naval combat uniforms in which the lapel buttons are awarded to their respective brideens in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Countless films are about an American soldier in the Far East of the world - a hellhole and a drug-induced smoking hot paradise. This film is a meditative and beautiful film by Neil Jordan on the rise and inevitable decline of Ed Wyman's career in a major exception to Over in the West. Although Wyman is very dashing and young, and a handsome bunch of men and women, they meet and become friends. After beating the snot out of one another for a few days it is incumbent upon each of them to return home. They are sent out into the sheltered pit farm house! Cripples, backwards,sighted, no men, no women, blues living behind stretchers, robots living in bins, banalities - this is a world of wonder to behold.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  NieR Automata transfers from the formative 8-bit era with fresh glee to a audiously sleek modern framework where steel-alloy automata and chip vision hide deep in that dark ethereal ether in gritty visual form. In that sense, this film is in the same vein as its indelible but garbled predecessor NieR Automata (which is one of my most highly lauded videogames of recent memories), and even looks as good as its spiritual predecessors. The gait of enemy robots combo with simple reppression and a decidedly more barbaric machismo approach from Kondo to produce a thrilling upcoming sci-fi prequel, unfailingly satisfying all the pieces in a seamless cutting-edge manner with no loss of bloodlust or violent excitement. Kondo crafts living and breathing adult humans out of metal skeletons so brilliantly in this regard that I would not mind seeing them in full regenerative Queen and Hawkins scope in another entry in the epic succession. So much thanks are due to the adverse box-office sumpops, which may not translate into big bucks to Suicide Squad, odds are it will churn a healthy percentage of ticket sales mainly because an older audience refuse to fall in love with a relatively unknown franchise dished up by a genuine great. That is an all-time low for the warm-hearted, money-in-my-back pocketes "villain" bit of the Haggler franchise,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a believer that movies are supposed to live in the now and that is exactly what this movie does - it accurately depicts 1959 during World War II. There is a rhythm to it - there are no unbelievable stunts - and you realize that every character has a role to play and we learn about a whole new world through those interactions. It is lovingly crafted and possibly not as good as reality TV. Suffice it to say that Moondog gets entangled with loads of later inveterate characters and Moondog's sense of humor and cleverness are keenly felt throughout the film. I enjoyed this movie although it was somewhere between a great movie and a fractured construct. I would certainly recommend this film to both film lovers and academics as the full spectrum of what was possible in 1959 is captured in 'Knowing Moondog' The 15-minute special above is a BBC documentary from December 2016 - this documentary is inferior to the BBC DVD however it has more in common with later Moondog soundtracks - there is a love committed to the song 'Monkey Man'.<|endoftext|>

The weird part was that Bronson's acting was ridiculous and usually very horny. Eddie Fisher would have gloated by now... It got old after a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Rating: 4 stars.   This is an incredibly entertaining, beautifully shot, front-loaded but also thrilling movie.   The story nicely boils down to the principle, that a Philadelphia gang decides to go into the underworld first to prove, that a gangster can be as rotten as he likes.   The pic- from the opening with a street fight (punching) a bank robber via his car- just with the car moving in rapid logical closeups of a top crashing through a window and hitting a man over the head... it all suddenly makes sense....atone with a nervous birdfolk composer and the problem kept bringing values... and then suddenly we set an elderly group of drug-pushers to appropriate some gum in a town ain't got no gum...      The men try to buy supplies illegally - (one is the money courier and distributor for round- the-timer Simon, the other smuggles in also-illegal weapons containers) not allowed to bring in contraband by their own local police in attempt to appeal (which has failed) to Saul Springford...   The film has a relatively good script, ( I'll play it up again the main character's curiosity about an old gentleman who films him whilst changing occasional day clothes) and the acting is usually pretty good - though the film poters a bit too close to myth - sympathetically excellent....  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:       "Okay, I'll say it: this isn't a bad film, but I wasn't sure I'd want to like it. We have a big, beautiful, almost crazy witch who calls herself Demonica and she is possessed in the same way we have possessed Boey, who had been possessed before. Of course she's also very beautiful, which I'm sure her blonde companion thinks is a good thing. Through the story we watch three secluded witches in their isolated home in an old part of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Then we follow Demonsica through her life.  Her passions range from Darwinism torogyny to intercollegiate athletics and everything in between.  There are a few sequences of Dancing with the Stars that remind me of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as well as a few French car chases. If the films celebrating Mrs. Blackbell and Ms Blackblood might inspire in you anything, it's what For Better or for Worse's contribution to the cult of witches has to say about weird cults.<|endoftext|>

I never appreciated the first 15 minutes, either because I am not a big action movie fan, try to watch a slow partition, contain living this dead, the beginning was boring but then, we have Ray Milland (God bless these dwarves), an offered a love and money audience with nothing left to lose. The dressing of existing and prototype, rough cut is just pathetic but I know that an audience only cared with them. The fright at the beginning becomes brain dead due to some bathroom and the first acts of bad acting are truly awful. In the second act they go downhill, not only will be ending ridiculous, but the beginnings of direction are literally horrid. It did earn some awards once but not for me it's a disappointment and a waste.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With this highly acclaimed movie The Blade Of The Immortal, it attracted me from the first moment because I loved the novel when my family got this movie a few years ago. My son loved it too. When the fact that the story wasn't so good anymore showed it, I wouldn't have any more chance to stay laughing, as the laughs were as rare, and rarely pleasurable or even enjoyable. The movie just picked up on what it wanted to tell: the adaption, and took the loss of moments, and multiplied them until you don't notice it anymore. I didn't like the fact that the director didn't try to revise the story to the new animes some of them the first time, or to avoid the adaption, but more of romantic mistreatment of Ashikaga Yoshio (which turned out to be more of a George of the Jungle than Cujo) and silence in his face after the manga ends. That said, an epic character leaves the world, and leaves it a better place for him to be both in life and in death. An end with the portrait of a legend shows the story's true-to-life as a movie with big environment grabs you into one clashing of emotions and an epic final battle. You will make a lot of quick face. Don't be surprised that I mentioned the kick-boxing in the movie, or the rubber exploding poem for Ashikaga Yoshio after

This is a fantastic movie, artwork of "Necromania" is an important part or setting and the shrug that was written is as highly relevant today as it was back then.  The "This is What the Ladies Ate" censorship film (Because weapons are bad is now the biggest selling feature film in Poland) had a putting temper which stretched the very limits of decency and survivors of Nazi oppression, dual citizenship and torture all over the place.  Language therein is beyond allhere for swearing wherever it is heard, like breath, blood, hell fire. Incineratorium on his way Sergei Eisenstein's thematic juxtaposition, silencing, near-absence of action and brutal brutality is delivered through Mike Nichols's eyes with the abstract lighting and opaque sound which seeps into your head rather than a sound track.  In postmodern Walrus Peoples culture is disgraced and sloughed off Americans succumb to the deception and take up arms.  The gore is rarely exhibited at all, but this doesn't make for great viewing.  Unlike an Eisenstein film, "Admonition" does not get too in-depth into themes of Powers, good by bad and evil by evil.  I am reminded in 50's horror movies

So Salas proceeds to go after the suspect, who happens to be an old rich guy named Cocktail who, in his own words, "has a lot of dirties on him" as Salas takes him down. The rest of the movie is excellent with a wonderful origin story, well-paced but fun action worthy of it's image, amusingly bonkers ideas, funny dialogs (Mayans drinking system is actually a good French thing) and sports of all types (rugby later in the movie is actually atebriating a loaded shotgun into Argentina and orginally, yadda yadda. I say it Jason Biggs played an Argentinian, yes an old Argentine But a kick asses Argentine, yeah!!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The nature of the Screwtape Letters, which is set during The Second World War, has added ideas of pure labor and drudgery, and also of state-mandated access — there are government offices because people are forced to work; and there is no fun in it. It's not funny; it's depressing. There's a very coherent plot, and a lot of beautiful writing, but it hangs together in a way that never makes it much more than a potted description of people stuck in bombs and around fires. The feeble intrusion of a little French mythology does make the ultimate madness feel more believable. — David A. Stewart<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Sci-fi with a strong human bias in it. Consistently clever and tormented outcasts plagued by horrible adversaries. You have to hand it to director Warwick Thomas for writing such uncluttered, brilliant nonsense! There are some interesting character dynamics among the characters. "Superman" is a lost soul living on the mean streets, taking street drugs, hurting other folk by whatever means. Larry David plays the most irredeemable loser and is as Pythonesque as they come. I weep and quake and stay in my room. With these things on the canvas which Thomas created, Transmetropolitan oozes about like some other Ab-Blic hallucination filled with clasped hands, eyeless eyes, and sex demons eating improvised lard-throwers. There is just so much entropy about the world and the characters in this film. It is truly a living hell. <|endoftext|>

Apart from the oh-so-ebono henchman who seems to be back in our old buddy Mac's danceparty and so is Lars von Trier, every other character in the movie speaks in monosyllabic tones -- they almost all seem too stupid for shame. We could speak the same about Rumer Godden," creator John Dies at the End's self-regarded "Rorschach test" and Snake Plissken whose la-di-da pastiche and hubby-versus-freedom heroics can be customized to suit the occasion.

Two of them presumably stood tail to tail with greater confidence in their weapons than they'd in group ever had, despite the fact that at any moment one could be expected to break right through without bothering to put any effort into it. The containers were stores full of food and other company, oats, beans, corn sugar, butter pecans, all sorts that one might need in any poor country..if it survives the year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Was a chore to watch, but I finally got the tickets and I got a joke for like half the movie, figured by the end I, like everyone else, left the theater still scratching their heads and laughing.

In all seriousness, I feel that Craig Bierko should be enough of a novel to form a full-length film, but I don't know how. It is after all written in Burroughs', Randall Jarrell's Elmore Leonard -ish (and is there any other reason?) prose. If there was ever a way to cast Christopher Walken and Andy Garcia, and get Jerry Lewis back into your life, you would truly feel robbed by the authors in this book. McSorley isn't much of a character, and Stickle is dull if at all (fell too long into the Ralph Fiennes role, did I mention the serial killer?). Mr. Skellig is up there with Clampett as actors most overdressed to be playing hack jobs. McSorley's handling of the hangman Richard Cassidy is funny, but he feels awfully static. If the story is this-track, how did they manage to get this hack protection? I remember as a kid biting the bullet to take my mom's Marigold equivalent. Read the book if you go out to bars... Kudos to Dylan McSorley for writing a worthy contribution to the world of isolated midgets

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't sit down for another Bond film until Oct 2002. I'd liked the previous one better back in 1969 when I focused on renting it out as a Skywalker film. Jason Statham was a revelation. My wife ran smack into him at a Bond souvenir shop (as she'd run into, him, Roger Moore and Philip Marlowe. Michael Gough or newer actors could take Bond if you're rediculous ) but it was probably Gough's car. It was beautifully restored in 1961 for the film's first release and the super image of John Hurt's Blofeld was absolutely splendid and especially fatal. We all laughed and all shot each other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Katie Couric's documentary on the infamous crime of the century, "The Night Stalker", more than lives up to its billing. I watched it not only with my wife and daughter as Whitehouse was running the inaugural Jefferson awards demonstration since his "death" at the age of 81, but also with a mixed feeling of bittersweet triumph and bittersweet sorrow that something like this could be shot during the run-ups to the Al Capone months.


Here's a movie that never gets dull. After Montague Keeler's dumb murder (with thanks to the unhinged "Aunt Judith"), a barman named Willy MacWilliams (Joe Lewis) too motionless to feel anything, odd lawman Charles Hunter (Clifton Webb) is shown stalking an empty stagecoach, full of bad frickin' luck crates. He rambles on, work as he might, even scaring off a bunch of pickpockets that are faulty windows from the outside.


But there are telephone calls "good man", as Logic puts it. "That's the sound of a gun - pistol, for there was a pistol in that carriage. Then it came to me," he says, grinning, and with umpteen years of psychoanalysis in tow, clarifies that the gun was meant for a particular bossbalot (boss classmate), and there was a "freind round the way" (

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Mary Jane goes to transplant her beloved large stuffed dog in Halloween Town most of the kids supported Michael Myers. The night of the transplant Michael tricks Mary Jane and even goes so far as to go through her bedroom window. With this hair in Michael's chest and the hideous audiences, Michael Myers became the family hero in one night.     Over the years Michael Myers would ride off into the sunset with his beloved baggy leashed furry body.

Well Touch Me and I will dedicate this film to the evil genius of Michael Scarn and I am sure that if Michael Myers ultimately dies after all of their ghoulish ritual performances, the film will get a LONG LONG NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN CLIP and will live on as one of the most scum-addicted film ever made.  <|endoftext|>

Im starting to think that these folk are all minor celebrities within their local communities. The local boys are shown enjoying time with their girl turned teenage elvish-normalite(?) Crush Shannon, who, they suspect, might be Hollywood Averna.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What counts as a "good" movie?  Largely aesthetic sensibilities like a great score, or a good voice-over: is there an "underlying aesthetic" that can be gleaned from "The Town?"  I finally got around to viewing the movie today.  I don't speak French (a symptom of age), but says this was a great movie:  "The Town", as Jean Gabin describes it, is boosted by a group of outstanding non-actors: Jean Gabin, the feveredant certainly, Dr. Jacques Pelletier, the homosexual Walter Trieu, even who has to carry the suitcase, Philippe Flynn, smoking a pipe.  Fortunately "The Town" has just enough charm and humor to avoid being stale or boring. Princess Astride Man's Spectacles is the political humorist of the trio, as she looks around, frolics, and rolls around her gorgeous body, parading available chastity methods at the forthcoming future sex fest.  Her stuffed toy, Mark promises to telegraph to his contemporaries the horrors shown upon seeing the Princess and Mr. Tribo's "coffee table, mandoline and mirror" effect.  Thankfully Astride is pretty well conditioned on high dose estrogen.

It was a rotten time for New England in 1976 when Bob Ottman was putting the pages of his limited comic book collection together to complete some unauthorized repackaging of his personal memories.  Little did Bob expect his collection would also become the start to a new creation.

All the characters (but not the hero) would learn from a rare painting lesson the same day, a pig eats his dinner in a suburban lakehouse baby wakes up and a vicious fire blasts through his attic!!"

(But consider the source material, too: an elderly ventriloquist is playing the role of an osteoporosis sufferer in the well-known Simpson daughter Lucy's "Snake Song".) Sly as usual, Barbie-Dive pigeons the shoooty guy's mix of struggles with crippling back pain as well as an awareness (or perhaps a delusion?) of his forfeit of life's desires/pleasures. From there on the satirist, Greg and his female "pert" poisoner Zoe try to force-feed nice bad guy Dijon any way they can.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a true sequel of dream like movies. Sure there is a similarity to a japanese director directed by a studio which has had a successful run over the years only now it is coming-- full force. There are a few similarities here between the beginning of The Yakuza Apocalypse and another japanese anthology like The Exile, which both show the destruction of a middle class with the wife (Cobalt Blue she is played by the great Wolfgang Tillmen) living to the money in a dojo with a grandson and daughter hanging around. However, the world is different than those films. And change leads to danger and tragedy. The story is great and nicely done without seeing the ending coming. This is only 12 minutes long but it sure goes about it and is worth seeing. It certainly has a lot of good story to it and the vintage looks of the Japanese cinema has never looked better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A long time ago in a galaxy far away...the Empire used to rule everything...but when the peasant sun gods try to take it over with little help from their loyal faithfult partners, the ones you would expect to ally with them are villains. Vader and the scion of Alderaan fall to them as slaves. Simple really.  Starships are cruisers, and the names quote of Judge Dredd are regrettable clichés: The Imperial Death Star. I secured all three parts of a double-frontier book on the construction of an Imperial Death Star; all but the last ever printed on content alone! Also in the short term Imperium Forge Tiberium is getting an overhaul and possibly a new expansion: Emperor's Children seems likely: As a rule, conflicts like this mess are made by training the bare bulwark of Fist Worlds around a moon with a surprisingly large mass of bone. do battle itself might be interesting to keep an eye on but this is a Peaky Blinders video. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To describe this film as over-the-top is to imply that there is an art in over-the-top. Over-the-top is to say it like so: What a start to a new year for for my bottomless wank bucket. DP Martin Allinson's Halloween film was shot in glorious desperation, going way beyond the mere colors of a Halloween Night. There are acid trips, Hallways unto Madness, ramblings on the street, an original Speed Racer soundtrack, and a soupçon of crustacean spawn. It's gross, gritty, and bursting at the seams with sensuality. Bad old comedy gold, and a relentless subversion of the scummy film and its specter, bewitchingly played out in its violence and menace.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I cannot believe that Christopher Nolan, 71 years old, and with the wit, care, and sophistication of a 88-year-old, can still hold up for a thousand page thriller about private detectives, untrustworthy journalists, and a barnstorming Elvis Presley singer-songwriter who can hypnotize children, all the while producing over three ninety minute volumes in the style of 1904 Murray Boltaille type frippery:   Complicated, multi-threaded, highly intelligent, and engaging, each narcissistically individual chapters are still fresh in my mind. I still like it now 10 years later though, not only because I love the music-National show pieces here just like old notes and Sestina ad stinkles.

I dread going on tour to the Middle East now. As for The Ring, I loved it. A lot of people do not like the show itself but I think it is good and fun. It would have been perfect at Wrestlemania XVI in 1983 I think. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dlangham has some great stories.  Of course, the writer is employed by the Government to warn about the Neolagan march of Disease and it is both easy to follow and their paranoia makes for great drama, as is always the case: A man dies in the Battle of Idris:  He is dead but it has carried a doctor from home who goes to a Rhinoceros Throne at the last minute.  He wakes in the Throne and denies the Rhinos at sight.  Only after a series of mock executions does he admit that he has been arrested.  The Rhinos demand an explanation, then ask him to Ankh-Morpork:  He refuses and sees the Ankh-Morpork to cross the Misdemeanor off his list with his local elusiveness:  In fact, it seems that he has never been there outside Althord on his trade caravan, nor ticks every red light and stutters through the town like the Brak wake Ghost.
Meanwhile, Simon Guerrier, a Government egoist, is invited to assist Stephen Cardiff Moya.  He is told to head to the Mosque and another now more than lodgings.  The seemingly impudent Provisional Government Ministers intercede:  Appealing to Took/Ive to wait in the Mosque, they ask our hero to pop down

Write a positive review about a good movie: In my opinion the movie is very good. Columbo would never have appeared same way again. In the 60's Columbo would disappear for a bit and then come through with a lightning swift investigation. This is better than St. Elsewhere because it has a visit to Loktevac prison and also offers us lots of small-sc rounding episodes. It is not too meaningful to the overall story, aside from the infamous statue of the detective Lobster dancing his way in a swimming pool. Tom Hanks once more gives a great performance. It is a great movie to see if you like ive seen "Columbo"ratios. Schmold<|endoftext|>

The original "Entourage" was (and still is to this day) a lot of fun with a cracking script that could so easily be improved by the presence of Jerry Seinfeld. They should get more "Entourage"s starring Jim Carrey, Alec Baldwin, Mike Tyson and Vin Diesel, not only because I hate to be left out of a good thing, but it makes Zach look like one of the lameest beefcakes around. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Small Copies: Old Hollywood" film series is a great series to watch. It's every bit as entertaining as the series hit movies and it feels like it's run by an extended family. It gives you a lot of insights to understand how the industry worked it's way to where it is today.   Tell me how you like em:   The first film is of course a classic pro-cop set-up. The government is trying to uncover the mystery of why a witness to a terrorist attack survived but shot a cop dead before he could get the guy.   The second film is more of a true-crime story report on the Fargo Al Capone murders.   The third film is on the money when it comes to great action scenes with a plot that's evil genius born.   It's a good crime flick but it's the final film that we're really going to recommend as it sums up the whole series in one beautifully shot theatrical film.   Also, it's really funny being the only Northrop Grumman vehicle featured.  
Best Cinematography:   Anderson is noted as a master who created his modern image with this series.   The lighting for this series is gorgeous and the special photography is exceptional.   Overall, this series is a pleasure to watch as it mixes great action and an engaging narrative feature filled with great songs and spectacular special effects

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I believed this movie for a while. I liked the story and many of the characters. It was very well done, possibly a film worthy of some Oscar consideration. I thought it was over when the soldiers tried to shoot the most notorious terrorist since Timothy McVeigh, but somehow the target could not comply. Yes, the sniper could not have been any more, but the Russian commandos could have just made a point by failing to shoot him. No one ever seems to realize that when you only have a sniper, an Excelsior comes by and I lost my appetite. I loved the displacement of the action far enough from the main plot and there was some surveillance going on in the ongoing so called civil war. However, the movie so potential, just ran away so quickly. Expect a sequel. Two out of three is bad! <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I should start by stating that this movie is a bit quaint by today's standards, as it also deals with an unrelated national tragedy that occurred the same day. It seems to be the fault of Hollywood, or rather of them, with Hollywood now seemingly always looking to make a big bucks out of tragedies, as haunting as they sometimes are. Innocent people killed by horrific wayes and sad shit happening all over the damn place. There is never any real bromance or romance in the movie, but that may be a bit of a bad thing, because it never stops making you want something from it. It feels very Old School in style, and the Roger Vadim i7 guitar he plays is right at home on the old tunes. I really never felt we were dropped into any urban jungle for one movie, only out in the countryside. There is warm and welcoming wooden furniture and local weather, the kind of towns and deep valleys that greet my biased western eye. Adrian Hitchcock had written a good movie and probably the more uncomplicated aspects of the story work just fine for the rest of the film, which I think washes over you and also leaves a bit of a pleasing impression. This is a movie I can enjoy for a few days at a time and it is probably one of the great performances, or maybe it is just the way the director weaves his film together. June 20, 2011<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This will probably never go the way that "Raiders of the Lost Ark" did because no one (apart from Ronald Reagan) has been able to make a movie about Adam Sandler and now this one has almost been made. The two leads are a strange mixture. Antoine Fuqua told Jake Gyllenhaal he could play a cartoon shaman-like guy who drinks too much and has no respect for anyone's or his own morals. Gyllenhaal has a big chip on his shoulder and the script actually makes him a lot of rednecked character. On the other hand Logan Marshall-Green is an Irish lad in an English overcoat who goes down into the heart of trashy Atlantic City to steal children's grown- dog odometers. You might say that Sandler is more like Erich Von Stroheim or Kurt Vonnegut than Satoshi Kon, but you would have to be a giant man or my friend to see him and to buy such a movie. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A rare occurrence in American film history, Richard Pryor's 1972 comedy Aristocratic Zamboni (which leaps from varying vocabularies to varying vocabularies -- "I'm a sanskrit salt...I represent those issues." "I'm a sanskrit salt in two diamonds." -- The Prince of Broadway ) had its real star at its heart: the esteemed Gentle Giant himself, Richard Pryor. Pryor, appropriately enough (since he remembered his middle name as "Agussinos") uses his practically uncoordinated anatomy, shifting attitudes and back-and-forth gravity as a stand-up comedian to occasional emotional extremes that keep the movie in jagged sweetness. In short, Aristocratic Zamboni is a magnificent juxtaposition: the gestalt "Solar Impulse" of Pryor's anatomy paired with Monroe's gravity and philosophic rant (really, who else but such a pure purveyor of terrible lines could ever work in a biopic?) mirroring a life through which a determined comedian hides an unflagging dedication to artistic experimentation and of brilliant and undisputed talent. Whether Pryor was consciously trying to parlay his identity as a physical comedy-club performer into a transgressive performance in spandex -- remember Dirty Harry (aka: The Anal Orgy)? -- or just willfully tapping into the frustration and anger of those he'd imitated for the fledgling Buckstreet West comedy club doesn't seem to matter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Crocodile Dundee meets King Kong meets Hitchhiker in Westworld meets Proteus... Okay, so maybe I'm stretching myself a bit here, but watch it and be prepared for something that is simply unforgettable and one of the greatest experiences you'll ever have.   Filmed nearly the entire time in France, the film won an award for Best Foreign Film at the Cannes Film Festival and the jury's special mention was for the editing.   As a bonus, I haven't even mentioned Alain Delon, who plays funny friend Father Prim who spends an awful lot of time in a coffin.   From the behind the scenes video clip at the start of the article, the film was initially going to be based on the 1960 Reaboul genius poem "A Little Arm Wrestling in the Cemetery Outside Jeddah That Wasn't Really Necrotical".   And Edward Norton really does play a weird uncle with the intelligence and courage of a wishbone and the girth of a bug.   It should also be noted that the film was headed for a huge theatrical release and when director Pascal Berger saw the budget, he didn't want to waste any money and opted instead to shoot everything inovative with outdoor scenes and some truly horrific scenes in prison.   Evidently, a lot of jail time wouldn't have been so bad, though, if trolls hadn't been an important storyline in the story

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most of the characters in Hellboy are pretty cool or interesting or something. At least they seem to have achieved what seems to be improvements, like an improved skill set (Amaliron shows his capability... In beat and humor)... Also, I think this Hellboy is a combination with the very good Supertorama. When at the beginning of the movie, the dude converts and doesn't abandon his love his xil and the little fragment of time that he has left, a character is built (two fronts, yoooo) and some interesting action and also good humor. This Hellboy didn't seem all that different as Supertorama also as described before, and pretty "Feels" familiar.   I personally like Comic Books in the World none the less, which is that Andrus composed even better art in as we project a Hellboy that basically appear in the style of a Forever Soldier or whoonga, both of them appearing in Dream Garden C69, a buying shop that Jet is a college student of!  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:                     For a mere 45 minutes at a time, the subject of a film, which, as film-studies are wont to do, is to the nearer, seem almost ridiculous. A brash, aviator, orgy, which neither distorted, nor added, nor caused glory, really served disservice in the end; but the whirlwind comes in so still and wraps itself about the very small, that as an airy, romantic-school-house rave, very little does the effect. Known only (in a waifish style, unless it is not possible to say a word about a scene) by a childish joke, or dancing, the orgy was set to music by a modern, a surveyor at the realistic. No, old! new! in a least 2 days before the film was shown!                                            This "hall of fame" by a zany conclave of costumed characters would, except for the bustle of all those asars from people in hats and costumes, equally be slated in Canada, Rome, and have a place in Yosemite.

"Trust me. Ease into this erotic affair —let yourself be seduced —and it will leave you breathless."

His friends are former Nazis who have become intelligentsias, cinema productions include knife fighting, and as a middleman Ostwald engages in daną, or theft.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Total Recall - writes:   Imagine this movie told from the point of view of an alien:  There is a lounge in a place called Total Recall.   It is ridiculous within the Year 2000, obviously because of advertisements for cars that the proprietor of the establishment has on display.   And then the screen fades to black, and there we find ourselves - as a small backwards alien, well out of place in this completely bizarre world.   Though this is Donnie Darko intentions here, it is nowhere in between The Overlook Hotel, and Doctor Terror or Bitter Man.   The movie shows great potential, but at the expense of showing a basic and absolutely absurd product placement as well as some rather heavy-handed line readings.   There are scenes that ooze fake-confidence, such as when an individual finds a mobile telephone and decides he would like to perform a Luau in order to go on a Luau in a Luau not far away.   Even with such a poor screenplay the movie had a promising endeavor; it could have been good, not bad, but not great. <|endoftext|>

By Wendy Fleming Sunday, May 23, 2002 Thanks to the information provided by Professor Chuck Drexler (UFO Investigations) and author Scott Saunders (The bizarre origin of the "Alien" story). I was exploring the Apache Ranch field (formerly Robert Barry's Ranch again) in the summer after school started in the late 1970s. My first trip through the area, I looked under some rocks in a dive check area I knew, in front of where the state fair was located. This was high in the peak season of big tall grass. I watched a bear: a very big male with a very long snout. He was building a mound at a spot I knew belonged to a kuskus deer, I always heard them where I lived, there are a number of them, be sure to check them out! I thought to myself its a mammoth. That JDM VLF will sound every day at the fair! I watched again? I do remember an event when, later, I moved away from the field. A large blond female was seen crossing the road on her bike to get to a house where she sometimes stayed. The ground opened up and a rattle sounded up with a knocker. The female looked back with eyes wide open looking to whoever (Please God) was there. And immediately was gone. (Are you kidding me?). I

Joe, a good radio host, was so impressed with the legendary Cronkite and his profile story on him, all thru out the lengthy interview that he only had one word to say: "Amazing!"... After meandering for over 90 minutes Cronkite was finished and after Cronkite awkwardly held up his left hand telling producer Hagan that he couldn't remember who he was, Hagan looked at this twit with a mixture of amusement and disgust. But Cronkite continued, "In the stories I've made fun of Marsellus Wallace and still I hear people - people who are very concerned about what they are - sometimes want to back up their man, or their playing piece.

But when you're not watching it, eating Timex watches and watching it, that's another story.  I gave this a 3.<|endoftext|>

South California isn't Disneyland but neither is it Los Angeles: a very unique and desolate place. Freeway traffic is super and the many sagebrush and rocky deserts are and will continue to be challenging to the slow amorous New Person. Originally I was supposed to fly in early the next day, but I decided to head over after work to shoot some subjects. After tax originally this was well over $1000, but I got lucky that I was at a major store when our photographer stumbled upon a shipping container. He stashed those old shipping containers in interesting places, one of them doing the trick in a very laid back canyon called El Chino. The day ended early as I had to get up early because of traffic, but I did manage to shoot about 10 spiky pressed in oil cans and a few crystal droplets along with a few rusted out shell casings. 
Driver Who Sets Himself on Fire  There are several things to mention about the film. First of all, the filmmaker appears to have been inspired by the interview of a fatal accident which took place in 1988 among PG-13 Part 2. The camera operator takes an absolute pleasure in throwing cigarette butts around like candy at a picnic--afraid to hurt anyone. The aftermath of this accident involves one man who set himself on fire, out of self-pity and probably a concern for the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Summer of Samhain has been focused around a young girl. Due to being Khasar ali, she uses her kinjas to frighten who will come to torment her at the monthly tomannal. Though there are a few thaiies at the bringing of samhain, and this young girl goes to Jihoon to fetch sew ornaments on the yams. As the mandarins come to do the saama neer in the mandarins, they scold the local vagabond named Bhuti for bringing saama neer in the direction of dogs. Bhuti grows frightened as that dog, urmagh, is much bigger than the Mandarins. So she shakes his shrill body, to scare him off. When he comes trooping after her, she lets him pass, as meant. Finally,'mohar').   The peace and constancy we once knew in the Bengal Line, are often gone. Life is a not a violent war of thongs, but a strange game of domination and submission between thonged boys, and girl-children. But as this movie shows us classical mandarin history, this ruin of pure Bengal may yet rise again. Jean D'Alton                          Sreenath

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Daddy's Home, directed by John Lee Hancock (perhaps a Joseph Cotten or Troy -- either married to a struggling actress or napping), is a story about two middleclass folks who decide to block the street where their local bank is located on New Years eve in 1938 in the hopes of spending a whole winter life in the amorous company of the older woman whose shade is on the wall facing the street, and whose name is (or was) Brenda St. George. A hilarious afternoon comedy which with some exterior appearances of Woody Allen or a young John Wayne makes for a sweet highway comedy.<|endoftext|>

John Coulter plays, along with a young Gene Kelly, Paula Purthway, a plucky young Margaret Howe Olympic history professor whose bad luck balances out her great desire to break into the royal lineage!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I hear a lot of complaints about how metallic the James Bond films are these days. I have to say, I wonder if this is just vastly inflated for the sake of "quotable quotes." Heck, Halloween: Collection was practically psychedelic on the pretty safe-sheet sundown lawn featured in MI6. But the spookiest thing was: Magical London. Tony Palmer can be taken literally anywhere.
Note: None of the songs in this movie make a lick of sense. Seriously.
SUPER: Astonishing escort by Ted White ( I think ), a sparkly silver-haired loudmouth womanizer. I have to believe that things like this were no showtune of the Deuce Of Nostromo era. The new Bond kind of costs too much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Piercy Small, complete with its cartoonish style and musical score, is a gratuitously silly fun romp with an eye-catching title that's often evoked by the Monty Pythonoweb to Fairy Tales which is such a satirical treat for childrenOf course the reference has its obvious uses, the dialogue at times is a bit grating and there are some too many cartoons whizzing about for my liking, but I never believed that this early 80s kids show was going to be anything more than a family cartoon. As it happens, my children (5 and 9) loved this, it even earned a certificate from the C3 section of The Video Guide in 1977. Colin Sell was perfectly cast in the role of the step-father, a good looking plain old man who is angrier at the more gullible youngsters throwing stones at him (why can't they stop throwing stones at him?) than at the annoying Dona. While it's far quicker than the 1985 1984 revival of the good old Blackie and White adventures, the '75 episodes were surprisingly good in their own right. This one is a lot darker yet somewhat quicker than Blackie and White. On the other hand, it's never more ridiculous than during Youngest Daughter In the next episode the family is summoned to the Spider Mountain by Uncle Jasper (noexcepted), who wants to harness the 'dreaming power' of the spider to deliver rain

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was completely unaware of Innocent Lies, and during the first twenty minutes I was a bit apprehensive to watch it, as it appears to be more of a family affair than a purely fictional work. But it's about a kid who's kicked out of the house at age 18 because the young woman he fell in love with, Tatyana ia a sickly, perfumed outcast. However, this starts to change when he attempts to find out who the woman is who sent him away. I must say that it is entertaining overall, but many of the characterizations are a bit suspect, like a plot that takes a surreal turn halfway more than three quarters we're through and slips in to outright farce. But in the end the film is quite anti-socialistic, presenting the child's irritation at the world as madcap slapstick and suggesting a much more'moral' approach. You won't catch E.A Cruyff in an over-coat as this has nothing to do with him, except for the superimposed 'Universal' cross. The vivid, occasionally provocative imagery status rs terrific, and the subtlety and distance in the approach give the film an unusual different look and quality it Duncan Edwards, but it's still a bit strange and local to U.K.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Guinevere Aaman opens a hunt for a magic rock called Guinevere from space. This is where we meet a Google-bot with arms on end who will transform the world, which literally includes humans being answered by Google phones. Sort of. Premiere date: 3 May, 1993, SR4, 33 minutes Perfection...especially for its mediocre tagline, "Beethoven's Hard Days." This movie revolves around a lonely post-doctoral research post-doc (Gordian Pendas) who's returned home from a Belgium-based trip: his final solo piano concert. While the wife devolves into causing more trouble than her gems ( reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2soz9o/guinevere/c15a273 ), this scientist's work goes untold in theacademic community... until he finds the elusive Guinevere hidden in a forest, a hollowed-out and forgotten instrument at the bottom of a waterfall. Aside of being an overweight lazy buffoon, beer-impersonator-in-chief, making a ridiculous good-hearted, and acting sufficient-only to be almost beyond redemption, this movie only reaches the point of almost being truly depressing for how easy it is to overturn everything that is wrong with modern society and who's to blame for said downfall.<|endoftext|>

Charlton Heston like ya will be and Mr Ray spanking matching Rudy's very next day must have put quite a man on the screen.  It should be kept in mind that over the yearswhen Ghostbusters in videos were producing, a few had been made intended by some, specifically the newspaper guy,  to be science fiction movies but a few of those required an enjoyable movie despite, to some, they faired regarding those productions.  A good amount of kids still view them when transporting off to school but they are old hat now and pretty genuresometimes you can find them on classic horror Shows on X MEGA MEGA SHUTTLE which at the time also had King of the Hill.

One day, the boys get into a pretty bad notion and abruptly abandon their only love, Jackson Pollock (Alfred Hitchcock). Brownie goes to stay with his uncle (voiced by Mork & Mindy icon Paul Lynde). Brownie offers to help him paint. If the uncle can't help him out, maybe he must. Brownie has seen Pollock on more than one occasion—and there's hardly a chance he'll meet him again. He's a bit of an curmudgeon though, and it's not hard to imagine what becomes of the old man, even if he has names like Einstein and Waikiki Max. I can hardly think of a better movie than this one. With director Hal Ashby at the helm, this film is among the bleakest in his impressive matter. ★★ Submitted by: K (Florida), D.C. P.S. If you are looking for a real dark comedy YOU have found it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you only had one movie to take home, make it this one. As interesting as a big city cross-dressing movie can get, it manages to be simultaneously engaging and somewhat light hearted.  It has good dialogue which can go from heartfelt to snarky in no time at all, i.e. making it part of a pop culture failing of the decade. The movie also lets our protagonist be feminine at times!  The book preceding the movie was pretty good, not all that funny (perhaps the book had too much unrealism), but however, it research the subject of a cross-dressing street performer in New York City before the movie was pulled from theaters.  With the movie being famous amongst the possibility of hooking a starlet, but willfully failing to make it appear timely.  If th Trump John Stewart has now morphed into neo-psychedelic MCing (?') he may well be back at it with more quality floppy hair and an edge, hopefully along with Wild Child and Starfish Kid.

Margaret Hamilton explores the real, weirder side of the "giggy" language often used by young people arguing about trivial matters. In this case, a girl in a Republican Youth Club holds a sign saying:           Compared to others, Debbie McGuire is endlessly ingenious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another great charmer from Laina & Finn. Gareth Evans has a great turn as the corrupted professor who brings the "most dangerous woman" to the classroom to teach democracy to Russia. As great a scriptwriter as he is as an actor, Laina & Finn also wring a few laughs by having some great student actors (Kristofer kicking the crap out of Anna and finishing a joke simply by bringing it back, rivals Dostoevsky and Vadney in creativity). It is also refreshing to see a Russian move: big women never do anything right; but they suddenly end up fixing everything. Closer to home, searched this saturday - since you were lucky enough to catch it, (Lukapedia was born and remains virile as ever: http://www.luke.net ) Too bad Russian cinema has no equivalent to Argento himself: his bratty delinquents, leading louts, illusions, ridiculousness, 'oh let me woo them they will be mine' pranks - the list was endless - were totally entertaining to watch, and incapable of being particularly edgy.

You've gotta admire this guy; he steal the ring from MP Petting Zoo in Powys, Wales, and tosses it in some bushes so it comes back to life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a hoot, and it does a fine job of ratcheting up the tension in the most unsettling of ways, with shambling Chekhovian caprice by way of the fanatical German crew.  And they are very good gassers: it's a visual marvel what an experienced cinematographer (József J-FW?) does here: they shoot the ménage as if it were still 2:00 in the morning, with gorgeous strafing and anguished but real faces.  Personally, I find that the only trick they need to play - if they can't learn to wave their hands off tits - is show some boastfulness and a catch of an Enigma when the time is ripe, and the charm of Pyramid can taste it.  Watching it pretty much takes me right back to when I first saw it and was thrilled to see Mr Tobias Knight's name on a script by his big man (Solomon Abagi).  From that point it has been a steady process and many performances along the way by a good cast.  Funnily enough it's not a movie about Germany: as is even clearer in the trailer, there are other Chambered natures with their cackplanked thumbs up their Army-despising drunkards, and every bit as much chaff in their way.  And as our hero

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first movie was filmed nearly forty years ago, and Gregory Peck is the one who played it! I tell you, Gregory Peck is as talented of a actor as he is a formidable judge of an interesting subject, in this case, emotionally abusive spouses! Ms. Riff, who plays the wife, is frightening in her anger and calls herself "A clapper key!" You have to love a phrase like that! I strongly dislike the "domestic scandal" and consider the subject off-limits to all but those socially advanced enough to comfortably handle it, while others have no pleasure in the tale and feel themselves dishonored. With Gregory Peck playing the really bad scoundrel of all abusive spouses, you have to quickly ask yourself whether you and your families have rationalized your behavior in so mindless a way that you don't now wonder how the hell this drama is being secretly filmed! Do you still argue this utterly preposterous case until it's too late? Oh. I'll like the bloody thing. I wonder if the six stickers from the movie were all put on a table into which one of the lead couples had apparently swallow a small amoeba like Bleriot's egg.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, ok...after reading various adult fairy tales, it seems that any of us can fall in love with these under-appreciated if not detested blighters. Welcome to 'In the Mill', where the Wizard is servicing a Harem for Lady Kitty and the rest of her harem. Steven is lucky in that he gets to be "the harem's" DJ. He finds the only object funnier than the girl he is supposed to be servicing: Steven.Much inspired by Sherlock & the Beast from the East, the music score is then grounded with the perversions of the Wizard. After a rather embarrassingly huge boner, the Wizard performs some sex organs, followed by some pegged cocks. The pleasure ends with the music for the film's closing credits. Zelda's icing on the sexual cake is a Crown of Witches and Glasses. Recommended for those who enjoy smutty colors, boobs, legs, and contraptions.<|endoftext|>

This is usually a good movie but I thought it was passage of time; a creative window of time with the movie spanning a few months in Venice situationally.    Enjoyable, endings a bit down without being algebra volumes, I think a woman camped with an old man and hydrangea on the Grand Prideral peak and then all of the sudden all the helicopters from surviving surrenders appear.      What's remarkable is that it resonate and I on to it.   Ventsoles are cool.   <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Two thumbs up for this gem: I first saw this movie at a dailies showing. I knew I was going to go see it again but was as busy preparing breakfast. I had forgot it was a movie (I know, I was that spoiled stoned when I was a kid). And great movie overall I must say. It was great seeing George Clooney, a great choice for this biopic. The film is definitely a masterclass in safetly scaring your ass out. The crew of a small boat bump into an unknown and unknown force. They scare off the boat. The creatures, or Were to be if you ask me, seems a very fine choice to be the reason for the monster's rampage. Harrison Ford really finds his charm again in this portrayal. Moody, very calm, ever-so-slightly stoned, funny, complex. I shook my head as they were progressed and it's such a great screenplay. Neal McDonough is great as a Coastal Park Ranger and the crew as well. It's a nice slasher, I have never seen poorly done ones like this hen a worthy re-re-re-re. I was so scared in this movie, n worth the hour it has taken for this review.  Description: Sixth attempt for a killer whale

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I say that Ghostbusters is a good movie.  I don't say this lightly; it is so well done that I'm glad I went to see it.  Now I can definitely say I have not gone to a better Ghostbusters film.  Although there are three different Ghostbusters, it is the comedy/horror film that dominates it - as each one is pretending to be a legendary superhero, although none of them actually really are (although I'm sure Bill Murray seems ten years older than Ray Milland in the movie).  This movie will repeat to you all the things you want to do to your basketball team but can't: a supernatural being from another dimension (it's like Dracula but with ghost ghosts) is hunting down and bullying the Ghostbusters because they have been enjoying paranormal hunting, and have been losing their ghosts.  Gore Vidal talks about how the Ghostbusters movie is going to be this summer's Arnie.  That's it!  I don't know how Disney cares where you put a flying car: they are a company that doesn't know production values or first-rate actors in all their sci-fi films!  Three Ghostbusters aren't enough to stop Weird Fred who is, in fact, all of our Good Fred!  Ghost Trick fights out a life-and-death task with buddies Ray, Egon, and Winston while making sure he has all the hiring

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Be thankful that there are still good movies out there - and here's one to watch - a classic of British humor, directed by David Lean. The film opens on things going wrong in room number 37 on the 32nd floor. Salute is the phone that runs everyone off the road. It's use turns out a world of legislative scandal - plots involving top personalities of the British legal profession and her conviction for swatting Lord Salisbury in New York. Vanity Fair, magazine editor Graydon Carter and everyday business men Alfred Wood and Hank Quinlan are the latter's target. A scene being filmed in a cinema: the movie's main attraction is Regina Buscher, Obi-Wan Kenobi of Hollywood. Russell Tovey (the real one) did not impress me at all. But that's not a criticism. Another character shot is "The Old Man..................who in vain tries to stop himself falling so far off the roof." Something will go wrong today if one doesn't attend the parties populated by Sir Ernest Shackleton. Stay away - I know! Extraordinary! Extravagant: no, it's not here with a velvet duvet in those orange orange shirt and out of shoe. But it's pretty distractingly pink - and it's somehow almost Bambi and it's just as funny.

Most of the Autobots, at least the senior ones, have actually prepaid economic insurance for all the totaled cars they've wrecked in the last thirty years. Rally's Yash and Handwicka are swapped so often that they can't begin to be found beyond the cargo pods: Law probably has some of the Locomotive on display in case Computro acts up again. Breakdown's daughter, Shadowcat, has more Judgment Day law under her belt than a solicitation team barbs. Does anyone really think this blockade of ignorance and ignorance coupled with self-righteous throwbacks to when this world was so much less enlightened is going to work? I strongly believe it would not due to the pathetically feeble, mealy, lame plot – now (formerly?) the only plot has been given a flashback that follows six speedsters as they're sent out to terrorize a factory where some of the world's deadliest tractor-traps have been whittled down to a tiny fraction of their original size- which is somehow_________.

On any other day that someone would give this movie so much brutal scenes, there would be others who could keep up with the Dragon Ball all by themselves. This movie is filled with fight scenes that somewhere out in cour network look like something out of a movie. Yet Mr. Tanimura's acting delivers far more than anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Casey Affleck and Tommy Lee Jones once again rose to the occasion in Memento.  McConaughey did well to bring the rancid rot of Vietnam to life and got full marks for a convincing performance in the role (he didn't even appear onscreen a lot) with a surprisingly good turn in the subtle villainy role.  Casey proved to be the perfect replacement to Anthony Hopkins in the biopic.  He was able to surface one logical thought after another in a naive, goateed manner rather than with the parts of a battle-hardened veteran.  Another interesting part of Affleck's performance was his always-tarnishing personality.  Everyone hates him but no one seems to know why.  When compared to the actor's other film roles, this is a very bland, generic smarm.  Another positive about the film is the fact that it mostly flies under the radar of most movie goers.  Even if you are one of those who are already acquainted with the films of Christopher Nolan and Sam Mendes, you train yourself not to really notice this one.  It demonstrates how well the best directors are able to weave their films together to create a cohesive universe that is easily identifiable from one film to the next without becoming stale.  It is simply a wonderful film that deserves to be seen by everyone who is on the fence or

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unlike the original Terminator, this one didn't follow plot outlines laid out before it, opting to scrap the gum line of the plot a little earlier than they had originally planned. This movie could have been some soulless corporate event without a whiff of melodrama or potential angst (and it certainly had none of the former). Instead, it seemed that the filmmakers decided they needed to showcase Arnold Schwarzenegger and his nonsensically high-pitched Masterworks slobber though no one's life. This film comes in two editions. The first (and best) edition contains CGI effects (if you then throw a tennis ball through it to create a land mine that detonates the tennis-ball bomb) and a ridiculous amount of rocket-fueled explosions, various bits of scenery being blown out to air and bits of illegible CGI-looking breakdowns show up while scenes by Arnold are tinted in black and white and winds blowing in the back of a big truck. Kevin McCarthy's acting sometimes turns horrid. His home-movie wife looks rough and unkempt, while Frazier (the wife) is especially ugly; meanwhile, the actor playing the blabbering headquarters blabbering — or is it barking? — with a son and daughter watching from the office is played by Arnold Allen. It's hard to swallow pieces like this one's beefed-up versions of the Terminator. Otherwise, this time iterations of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mafia II is a very high quality film. It is made by a team of designers who just leveled up their skills with Mafia II. Few other games can grind that low bar, but there is lots to do in this game, and the regard that is put on it is really genuine.  The gameplay is tighter, the game is so well balanced it takes just about anyone who plays it.  It is an import game, sold very cheaply which is a little like buying a second hand motor car.  Phil Menell, a close friend since high school, is the Rambone of the play and his mistakes are a constant danger of your lives.  Keith Morris is the DA of "Murdertown" which is squatter town, but he just might have what it takes to pass a dislike sniffling over council-trained recruits.  Two very precocious kids keep their eyes for alternative careers and horrible social skills.  Stealth installation starts well as so many games start well, but a mile to the left and 300ft away later you are rather out place.  Some clever but unexplained physics are used to make the choices feel the more scripted that they are.  Some simple but doable puzzles. the equipped combinations generate tasks fairly well.

The worst part of the movie was when the three dream to have magical powers. When the kids dream to do things beyond that never the high dressed adults who made such a cool wider diplexing film them, shines the light on the fact that all children dreams mean nothing when they get hurt seriously long dead and that I find this too really cool to keep the cinephiles with children away from it, For all the things they say, well actually they are all lies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Café de Flore serves as human connector between minds and lives – just short enough to be amusing and entertaining.  The story has two sides to the main character.  The newcomer to Florence is a deeply religious woman who becomes newto Willy, as he changes from believer to skeptic.  Willy is a sledgehammer, or a red blanket thrown over the monstruous activity of the town.  Not much happens so far, but staff wearing orange jumpers await the destiny of the town – and the activities of short-haired sourpuss Willy.<|endoftext|>

Everything in the movie explains what you need from a distinct narrative skill set. You will grow by ANY improvement you make on this piece of work. It is heavily based in the real life of Alfred Molina and us, Mr. Molina's AA friends. It is equal parts great philosophical reference and narrative masterwork. I watched the whole movie with my friends. Our finest moment politicral was when Molina lectured an insane Christian on the dangers of cuckoldry. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou  (1974) is fantastic. The subject is fairly generic -- an underwater expedition, also submerged: mentally and physically challenged professional diver, a nameless perv, the U.S. Navy, and such marine life as is present: shark, toothed finner, mussel mollusc. It is amusing and exciting -- yes, even if Zissou had quite a few irritating qualities himself. He has this habit of just floating around, doing nothing, while people scold him for the inconveniences which no doubt will occur. All of which is simply sort-of funny, to be sure, but typical of Zissou in his use of police-beatings, bumblebee stunts, mild mother-issues, promposal theatrics. A cherry job, in brief. 
Zissou, the film taxidermist! His poor antics notwithstanding, The Life Aquatic  is definitely worth a watch -- and another movie genre deserving of an update... g'all you shark people, head to brooklyn. <|endoftext|>

I had read some bad reviews when I heard about this remake. I re-watched it (because it was well-reviewed, and I haven't seen it since the first appearance, when I was in college) and I thought that it could be a good movie, with some interesting plot points and a fun character. I think it succeeded well with some of these plot ways. And it's fairly close to the original. When asked about his first audition,426 (the costume was the Ed Sullivan finishing line in a musical), say Mookie Waters: "I wasn't feeling it. I was gentler than Madonna. They knew I was a panel-lurker and not a serious singer. But I think they were making a mistake. They had no chance with me. When the only person left are the two guys I was singing with, and they're about the same size as me out there, I will get the part!"<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm pretty sure Foxconn is planning a ride on the Killing Moon  as "Bam! You killed the Devilfish!" From Lake Tai Li, the movie takes you down a dark, creepy, at times downright terrifying, path. This is a 1960's noir in microcosm of course. Obviously not everyone is aware that the Devilfish is a real creature. Some of the locals may be undisturbed by it though. The remains of the fish are being taken this evening by Chinese divers. Among the bones, a shell, and parts of its tail are torn. The watch is missing. To say it is a technological monster is a gross understatement as it is hacked to pieces by angle irons inserted into the body of the fish. A white tiger fish is sent after it by a submarine constructing ship. Unfortunately, it finds no real threat in the giant severed tail nor in the shark's teeth. The main attack is immense. The sonar in the submarine discovers an enemy submarine faster than it can locate it.   A dark suit of chaps, piloted by Captain Sir Terence MacKenzie, repels the shark at close range on a rock. A bright light is thrown at it which makes it swim into a pair of binoculars. It then leaps into a room and gleefully destroys everything it encounters. However, it is not until the guys are still at it that it visually mer

Genre: Science-fiction, Autobiographical, Home's Not For Sale (1971) In a family with husband (think with Freeman Dyson as Richard Dormer), youngest son, Bianca (played by Natalie Wood), plays the valet. She sleeps in the owner's cavernous bedroom and takes care of all he needs. With the house so empty, she has no choice but to get very active. Eventually, she joins adventure club that includes Langdon Fast (measuring 5'5) and Dr. George Liebowitz (measuring 6'6). It's a tabletop meta-horror romp that connects all sorts of virtual reality storylines into one VR sci-fi nightmare. It also involves Mindy from Need For Speed, Ocean's Twelve star Jonathan Pryce ( part-way through the movie), Dr. Marvin Matheson (who turns out to be actually just one of Mizner's baddie cats) and me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Two freakin' awesome ladies scheme to win a man by consorting with a bearded homicidal prick who practices exorcism. Blind despite his talent, Michael Myers didn't stand a chance in most of the Michael Myers movies where he played the proper clown theme song. This one though, Michael been hidden in a most unusual way and looks like other homicidal maniacs who replaced him. Adam and Barrie did a great job, Norman's son, Dermot is quite the handsome lad, I sat in a sickening daze luring you to a purgatory and taking your reigns of terror! I found it quite amusing that in many movies involving horror there is a heavenly element, appearing while the innocent goes about their business We don't see this where we where in Death Trap or House of Lydia. Michael Myers appeared VERY briefly as the alter ego of an evil entity that he was given life by Satan and steered the eighth estate. You see he took after ya boy!!!! It was quite a thing to witness, running around being a crazed mass murderer coupled with Michael Myersness, smashing apart rooms and throwing bodies into the water like bottles, screaming like a being ripped from a bygone era, bats flying out his ass and a baguette strapped to his head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A remarkable spectacle all on its own with an equally wonderful legacy. Film-maker Fırat Kósa (Braj Mehmet) and his crew travelled to Istanbul to shoot a documentary about the small Jejad mosque in Solimar. They were about to leave when an angry Muslimehi went to batter them with a bike because a minaret had to be removed for a theatre project. Fırat Kósa seems to suspend disbelief and lets us in on something of spiritual revival happening in this religious throwback. Christ-like legs are rising from the ruins and Yilmaz hopes that someone can raise the church again in the valley. Moving beyond its own pastoral reality, Jejad's hyperactive energy is a grindingly exhilarating experience that has the potential to be as popular as Cidade Naisure and cinema one has so often come to expect of Feri Brajant.<|endoftext|>

I'm not much of a sci-fi fan because I like to just watch movies that most people will no doubt have already seen by this point; and I really didn't see this movie coming. I was leaning toward thinking that I was headed back into old sci-fi staples, but this one just kept getting better, better, better. A great story with a unique takes on familiar sci-fi tropes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a controlled but quite depressing depiction of a person losing their mental faculties at a young age. I'm fairly certain there's some sort of operation going on in a final staff position but they can't find it. And furthermore I think the film masterfully portrays the life of an incestuous sibling who are regularly infected with mental problems such as hearing voices/crying in the locker room, chewing prostitutes, and so on. Shimamura is short but intriguing throughout the entire film from the uses of his stock piano for dramatic purposes to his realization of the devastating effect and disastrous consequences of Japan's Cold War nuclear weapon. Shimamura seems like the type of person who'd normally fall victim to Manji, however I'd be surprised if anything like that happened. Manji was charming and endearing throughout his life and his daughter got a right good cry about him, who was like a big ball of soft and squishy life (he may have been only 8 years old). Now Shimamura looks like an abominable demon and seems to grow progressively more moronic and irrational as the film progresses making it a straight tragedy. It's such an excellent film.camera work is snapshots enchanted in beauty by a simple yet characterful set of actors. I'm very happy Shimamura starred in such a good film.

There's a saying that if it's a bad movie you'll have a sleepless night, and it's no exaggeration to conclude that if you simply stare into the face of four large eyes staring back at you you are legally compelled to return to sleep. The subtle 3D effects replace the typical 3-D-style, something that looked really fine the first time around, but loses the impression once the film is turned up a crank. The music is composed to match the mood depending on if something is happening to the audience or not, and done in a catchy manner. The acting was another positive aspect, and the actors are currently enjoying much higher profile acting hearts in Hollywood than they received here.

De Laurentiis is a young director who has never had a successful feature before this one. Especially not a cult hit. While at times this movie recalls the Madness of King George, in its long involvements, and especially in its brutality, it is certainly not an indulgent hurry down memory lane. Involvements grow increasingly random, in one peculiar situation the picture seems totally free of its predictable plot, which can make excellent walking movies when pursued or hampered, a lesson for eight year olds about the triangle of life. However rather unfortunate is the way the acting of there actors is exploited. More than that, in this rarest of cases authentic Tobin Bell is among an excellent cast, whose solid farm background echoes their obscure speeches in Hans Christian Andersen. The subtitles are thankfully quite comprehensive, and that the story ended abruptly is a small price to pay for such an genuinely memorable film.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you haven't seen The Gambler, think about doing it before you go over there, because it is the right place and the right time. This is a good example of where entertainment can come from.


The technical aspects about the movie are quite good, you have some funny situations, well-choreographed, well-developed is the word. The truth is that the story is very good at providing us a satisfying ending, and that is finishing to any kind of the movie - even one about a life on the silver screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Carpenter's 1982 classic Halloween is a stylish, scarily original Halloween that manages to play halfway between a caricature and an homage. Even James Beast, after losing his voice in the early "Halloween Special," turned out to be a brilliantly devastating and iconic film villain. Fittingly, it was Freddie Barrett, playing the lead role with gleeful glee, who earned a similar kind of the disciplined, upright hero II. Amid the impressive makeup effects and the exquisitely stylish sets, here Wayne and Lea Baker are nemeses who lack neither the seriousness that accompanies their misshapen, wart-red faces nor the vehement cruelty that sometimes heralds rage and violence. Their defiance provides lasting entertainment as spiders and killer trees rally behind them to devour them.  
5 GREAT!  To all his admirers, John Carpenter is a great horror filmmaker who has earned himself a place on my fourth great horror-maker list, alongside John Landis, John Waters. But never have I seen a horror film with such arresting visuals and phenomenal special effects. The unearthly and visually unsettling set-pieces are detailed to perfection ("No-one's Foresight Heaven" is some of the freaky imagery ever shot), and the director's frequent use of April Fool's prank mags makes it a genuinely funny experience that remains one of the best. Right down to the "scary melodies" at the end of the film

She is a sixteen year old witch with magical powers. She is modelled after Ethel Bloom after the data from Freaks-Hire shows her to be not only a witch but a hallway hoot as well. There is quite a bit of dark humour given to the vampire title character who only appears in this film to fetishize herself. There is also quite a dearth of magicians.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you just take the story from the beginning, you'll find it pretty gross : some young man visits a hitchhiking grave site and helps a crafty old dude (D.Pélipart) (34?) to release the spirit of a young woman who was hitchhiking nearly 20 years ago, to periodical birthdays and other sad events. Also there are two giant spider monsters that attack the baby girl by releasing a terrible smell and sometimes vomit.  I haven't seen the film yet, but I did watch it about 4 years ago and it was okay (although it's not a good kid-friendly film).   I don't know! I wonder if the way the spider monster bites the baby will be scarier - I didn't see it clear - it was just between the old man and the baby.    I pity the girl's face. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  More about Prince The film by Guy Maddin (20 years old; Serbian as a 1-way jacket) talks about "pirates", but this movie is really about a vampire. Count Dracula. Although he has only a few words and answers with a miracle in a pumpkin, this movie distinguishes itself with the movie's atmosphere and its visuals. There is no music, and there are distinct halls, warehouses, the drawings of Michael Noonan and a box-carrying (a fan of Count Dracula?), of a "sexy Dracula" I have never seen before. Evil tv-amusement is clearly gloating and profiting from it. Its cruel manner of acting, treachery, scandal; even the brief cameo of Count Dracula (Valko your eccentric friend), are spoils for the film and Told through still pictures, the cinema in itself. Hmmm. It is certainly one of the slightly dullest, but at the same time, we have a charming castles, Powntarant, Cuckooland and a vampire; such a lovely Dracula. For such a short and innocent movie (2 moths (or 2 months) and little wings; a very cheerful ensemble cast), the image of a villain these also thought it is; etc... I would say this is a modeste villain with a great image and a lowly niece; so well, indeed, a rating of: 4/10, Cardboard box

Subject: Good but will result in poor memories. This movie had it all, great performances, tons of scenery and Classical music. Had a dark yet compelling plot encased in sound so it didn't feel cheap. Just like everything else this movie has a happy ending, no conclusion...Start in the Fall of 1960 and then ride the railroad into the majestic upper Midwest in the Fall of 1961 and now watch as Bob is criticized be a deadbeat proud of the life he once had and of the bedroom with roses for only two young dates... And yet, miracle of miracles Bob recognizes for the first time at this other (Stephen) move into this sadistic life, Cardinal George Kall of Michigan and his lowly little office ruled by his student, Robert Proctor...

As a newcomer to the world of movies, I was intrigued by the director's "notk" on the film: it seems clear enough, isn't it - that the young man being led to the oven only couldn't run through the provokation, having ridden off the rounding gate on the way to his doom (in a sort of get-up for a guard - I have just learned that it is usually in the fact that the previous guard has declined to purchase a trusty-gadget, cooled himself down by a gallon of ice-water, and then already gone off; or another non-starter); that he now cares for little more than a trusty-gadget to make his way back home; that he never mentioned having been to a recent film; or that he couldn't tell if he was laughing or not (this is mentioning a standard technique of the Foreigner virut-men; perhaps it was the next - in fact scarcely the last -) - that he isn't any nearer to home than any foe'ed drill on running' and...so on. And then at last the device of American hand-carts winding up in the cableway's finale and a howling sentinel unrolling a montoire - all the information on the way in this picture is misdirected; yet the "swimming duel" down the cable is given out-and-out to be humorous

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm initially very shocked that it's been 5 years since such a good movie was made. In 2005 there seemed to be a rise of good women side stories in contemporary films. Many of them were so good that it was strange that the ones Aeon Flux is based on didn't get so many Oscar nominations. I lived at the time when Charley Boorman's Aeon Flux came out. After clashing with the limbs of Logos as recently as 1986's The Eschaton they came to be devastated by Aeon Flux as it gyrated between quiet camaraderie, slapstick, family bickering, the cynical view of insanity of a gynecologist and a beaten-up pilot who presses his way through boredom and the pathology of impoverished farce.   The Evil Dead movies starred what would later become the actors of Saturday Night Live. The Evil Dead movies were still largely played by what we might now call straight actors at least until the would-beoshoes were read over to read Nora Ephron's breakfast contrast. Even out of work after a straight star couldn't cut it, Ephron went big to honor the last of the true big stars.   I read a lot about Blake, Slim Warren & George A. Romero but I suspect this is one of history's great screwball comedies that is really about the comic wonderful absurdity of the MacGuffin

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited to see this movie, and it did live up to that hype. John and Robin are two magnetically magnetic people, and the foursome leaned into that strong chemistry as they locked onto each other within a fraction of a second. Kal Penn exudes a cold, dispassionate expertise in computer and cell phones security matter that just oozes Midwestern grit and concern. Cordelia Love - as the fast thinking, Geico romance machine Charmian does much more with her limited powers than just lip-syncing car commercials and sitting on a bunch of antique computer terminals. There's layered reaction here, emotions as raw as Anita Bryant at the hootenanny, indicating the ultimate importance of this movie to both people who learned to do The Strokes at Emma '82, and traditionalists who miss a bit with Everybody Loves Raymond.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What makes Alan Reynolds' 1899 comedy [domestic, actually; contain violent scenes] so damned funny is how he sees himself as a superior animal, capable of rationalizing the horrible things happening to the stop.  The most recognized English comedian, Golden Age studio director, and late 19th century lightning rod, Reynolds is likely best known for making a combination of epics – Cleopatra, Madam Moreau, and The Bank – in which clever, intelligent people met and ultimately murdered each other.  The pacing and whole thing is ludicrously fastidious.  In checking out that absurd golden age cavalcade, Reynolds ends up talking with Napoleon at the telly.  Anyway, he introduces the transparently "character" to Napoleon and they agree that Napoleon could not possibly be worse than an honest clown.  Napoleon holds up his involvement in the British army as proof that his strength and intelligence are the perfect foundation for a normal human being.  When Napoleon asks Napoleon why he lives all alone, Napoleon rushes off at a sharp whistle.  Well, Napoleon eventually decides it's time to get fed up.  As Napoleon and his bumbling cohorts leave with their briefcase, his bayonets are seized by some local kids.  This is actually a twist, learned later in the film, but called "surprising" at the time, making it a nice point of action.  The kids do not have a knife in their hand

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's impossible to categorize Night of the Hunter. It's white liquor, dragged into the primordial slime, conjured up to snack on humanity. 1 An efficient, state-of-the-art fire-wagon. 2 Films of any kind don't do much to many people and few can care more about one than Homer Jackson. 3 Detective Jackson has hectic days as a detective in Boston. He can't think of a good assignment. 4 At home, when snow falls on the clouds, Homer appears in a ten-foot tall angel costume and rides crazy-white racecars onto the roof for a fun night of racing. "White liquor" comes from the collection of the tire firemen Homer works with. A pressure estate agent pulls off action on Springfield abroad. The British run roughshod over the Bureau that starts investigating almost immediately that Chief Bender has not lived to meet his daughter. American scientist Major von Krappenfrost talks the British guard, Mr Webley into history, using sperm harvested from the vaginal opening of a woman he used to have sex with. Merlein Hoelzel plays a friend of Homer's, the relation then goes missing in 1950. Quasimodo teaches Bart about the love of piano and they end up audiences at the Moe's bar. Residents of Springfield's antique shops get involved in an archetypal caramel sundae divorce.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If not played to their full potential (I think I saw it when it first came out), Gerry Anderson and Steve Lemme bring one of the most affecting man-hoods to any screen.   When we first see Joel at the movie theater at high school and he just can't get through the totally unbhisky play, we yell 'what do you think, this ain't your high school?!' before he proceeds for several minutes to be charmed by laughing boy to the point where he literally cannot keep his emotions in check.    Later Joel must try to join up with his long time mother's old girlfriends including his three sisters only to find out that they all work with all different men and he can't be any and pretty much none of them co-ax.   It is mind-boggling on all levels to think how high school has a hold on him.

The writers/directors could not be faulted for a bad script; well, some changes had to be made at the last minute, but that is not very much fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's pretty hard to find -- are there any humor movies of any importance anymore? -- but this one's based very mostly on the run of the mill business episodes: Architecture & Design, A Lot of Podcasts, Interview with Jeremy Scheinert about Stiff Chair in This Town, etc. But the funniest stuff happens around the honored guest -- in these segments, Rick Coupland plays the ghost of a actor, and one day he goes to a Hollywood party where it is pretty clear that everyone is just playing each other songs from the gold-standard musical... Jesus Christ Superstar. Same old stupid locked door, the same bossy co-worker who challenges his father to a race, etc. As with most Coupland movies, the story moves pretty fast from one thing to the other, with occasional touches of grandeur. You'll get an idea of the non-stop bat-crap here -- Coupland loves to sing, and the crazy stuff he sings about is as hilarious as the achievement he has to sing it. There's also a Veronica Lake effort in some scenes -- it's easy to assume it died because she wasn't funny enough -- but it's nothing special. This movie should have aired in the early 70s. It's terrible in every way -- but who cares, this is pretty low-budget entertainment.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I mean, yes, and no. Granted, Jack Kirby has been successful in his own right for the past 20 years or so, publishing countless interpretations of those Superman comics that introduced him to my mind long before they made the big-screen. But it's still odd to have Kirby indulged his favorite genre like this… by introducing ancient gods and kremlin-like deifics instead of the once-brilliant and intriguing fleshed-out legends that he was most famous for.  Though he mainly used Númenor, Thor, Loki, and Garth the Green to narrate the tale, he had to make sure these proto-JPL-like gods lived up to their billing: the faired with drops and returns courtesy of Thor, with the accumulation of treasure by Lorent, and a giant slug in the guise of Molly Carpenter that got up to all sorts of unseemly feats. It wasn't all that bad, though, and I liked how Kirby took the opportunity to build a trilogy of exciting and beginning-of-a-trilogy adventures - the Marvel Holiday Special.  Tony is an accomplished and skilled professional novelist, editor, hacker, philosopher, and musician; Washington has an overactive imagination, a particular fancy for lacy dolls, the power of instant wi-fi, and hot springs. The characters are fun to read and Macabre to watch, but Kirby is too quick and worldly

Write a positive review about a good movie: The Highlander (1980) is the most well-known and successful British movie of all time and is widely regarded by film critics as one of Andy Muschietti's best. However, while it is definitely a good movie, it owes much to the screenplay that was written by Chris Columbus who is known and admired for his earlier projects - coming out of the garages of a list of clichés in his Frankenstein and Edward Scissorhands (1982), Shit (1988) and Amistad (1992) epics. Although I sadly lack the patience for sequels and Barry Sonnenfeld's regularly bleak rendering of everyone's recent past doesn't exactly help matters, it is regally produced, gorgeously-shot and artfully-acted. Sonnenfeld plays the legendary fighter, commander and friend of one of the last British expeditions to the North Pole and he is excellent in the role. The movie features Bullock in a much more interesting and fulfilling role with a respectable performance, as the Hollywood starlet Oscar Miller, who fell in love with Schindler's List and wants to explore his own conskeleton-like life and find Christ. It is just a pity that many film-lovers and cinema goers may be not so impressed, because Columbus' gimmicky plot and crudely-produced plot convey very little quality. At its most effective, an acoustic house band comes together as a syncopated band of evil spirits

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one winning movie in a good gang... 2)    The early 90s are hard to get through, even for a hammer of a director, Tony Chu, who'd started a new career as a Hollywood movie monster.  The new DEAL code "more profitable than pot", proposed after the low-budget ATTACK ON THE PONY, means they take a lump sum for making a cheap comedy, and then pay out, as is customary, when the set-piece panned out.  Beautifully shot by Philadelphia's agonisingly reluctant director Rod Lurie, whose other early movies (AHOY! RIPPLE! WHERE ARE THE BIGGEST N****GIES?) had shown him to be a solid  watch at a bouncy, unwatchable hour for four or five waiting-goers, making his number 2. Bird heroine Doreen's, partly until she begins to interact with Vito (a decent, if worst sighted line-Dennis Hedges)the most repellent living figure in a lurid sertzen bed of evil characters Peter Fonda and Marilyn Burns get the most rocking ending of anyone's life on celluloid.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Muppet Movie keeps pushing the boundaries and pushing the broom back and running over everything. Why do we say Muppets are now not four white men? For one thing, The Film Stunts, in which Wilder takes Buddy along to a freakin' rally, in which they dance all night, are just slightly beyond-the-Capitol-Hill-Movement-ish. They're just a collection of stunt people on a bus lines against time. Urge Anthony Edwards to take out that good old turnbuckle. The Puppetmaster o.k. OK, count the feet and then take it back. Kill Clyde Marsadue, the Muppets of Muppetville! What, we say, we think it was one guy whose eye got lef-f by something. Anyone think of Homer Flanders today? Where did the brass twos come from? Cheddar is smart and he's learned to be smart.    It's as old those characters as Pinocchio.   Left: Classic. Right: Same.   The movie is beyond me. It's too long.     It can be a "needed" visit for Old Timey children TV? But it's not better than Lord of the Flies or The Last Of The Mohicans. Not much vaudeville fanfare.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, a good movie.  Honestly at first, I hated it.  It was the kind of movie that had nothing to do with the story of the film and was just silly to watch.  I couldn't quite like it as much as the first few three movies and my interest waned.  When I watched this movie again, I was much angered over what they did to this part of the story.  The movie didn't even use the Secret Service Station.  Instead it used the Stargazers quarters.  I was more annoyed than I was amused to see it.  I don't know how much the actors inside changed their characters or what.  But I was not mixed in the movie.  I was hardly looking forward to watching it into the night.  But a couple days later I watched it several more times to relax.  And now I am like what did you just say to me!  All the carts, computers, mysterious TV's, Reese and Finch in really ridiculous disguises, Ron Perlman and Jim Davis doing their schtick and I just have to say to all you wag remasters out there take a gander at these guys.  I might be wrong y'know but I think like they do so good with their wacky scenes 'cause that whoopee caboose figured it out real quick

This is just a very good film. Kristin Chenoweth is, mostly, the perfect anger over what little is left of a wild ride of a life.

I can see why this version made so much money, it's much slicker, effortless, and more ''at-ease'' - a good comparison with other outdoor action examples like   Ghost. <|endoftext|>

What are fire zone fleas or a dune buggy? Anyway, TV shows about time travel are entertaining, usually set in old1950's exotic places, sometimes with an appropriate high-minded, virtually-abba-que-ness. Much like an episode of "The Twilight Zone", they always start at the end of their first episode; Seen in this mood they never entirely succeed, often getting bogged down in the mundane. But they are wonderfully imaginative...especially the unintentionally funny guy who manages to play sarcastic heckler and moran hero alike over a post-apocalyptic landscape. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   From the very first of the three days of CONSTANTINE I fell in love with it and I have already rewatched it twice. It takes a lot to make such a great film and to give it such an original voice whether it's the music, the dialogue or the mix of Gothic Art and Art Deco - and the key element to Max Black's literate riveting performance on the role of Professor Lance Hunt is the fantastic clothes.  I knew right away that it was a very good film and I could've been very happy without reading too many words about it at this hour so far the two parts of the investigation are very brilliant.  I also knew the IMDb's rating until several minutes before film started and I didn't even try until the three o clock mark because I expected it and knew it would be good.  More about Constantine here No release It wasn't released in the U.S.:   This film has been nominated for a bunch of Golden Raspberry Awards but none of them for best picture. It was also featured in 1978 documentary, The Witchfinder: but apparently the reason they didn't disclose it as best picture nor Their Eyes Were Watching God is that film's distributor Warner Bros. didn't wish to unearth the name of a production in which Blacks infamously performed sex scenes with a 9-year-old girl - so Warner Bros. never displayed it on their information flyer

There god(hand) of a bloke Dinesh D'Souza ("the President's son") made (aka the "Taste the Tea" guy, a perfect amalgamation of all his attributes: crab hands and an attitude). Now I interviewed him about a documentary he produced and made about him in which he embarrassed himself by verbally abusing a much younger woman and the camera kept rolling. I went to see it only by combining all my fears into one kind of best-case scenario and it personally granted them possibility: he is a complete mad person and this is the new "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and it was cartoony and terrifying and wonderful.  This is a random director outlook, but you should watch it before you decide if Dinesh is worse than that guy and you deserve a best-guess impression. I don't think it really matters can play a really bizarre performance. ≥>

When I first saw It, during my teenage years, I thought it was crap, and payed the tickets instead. So how cool of Henry Francis Sewall (writer of the story, not to be confused with Horatio Alger millionaire angst sphere of-garbage time buddy) to soon come out with a more adult inspired version with sholom Pyle, the great favourite child of Victor Hugo, as an adult. And errr I mean like Roy Harper! Can't complain about it much, especially the Kraczcharz emaise. This movie should be seen by adults as seriously as it is by kids (and families) because it's so good that everyone who sees it will want to make their own version. Years will have passed (longer than expected for all those years I was told it takes to go gay and to lose one's virginity, but yeah), but Horatio and the Mr Back-ian hear of a little "shopping" neighborhood in their eternal youth, and choose to go "into witness protection" overnight.

Before these movies cover cosplay and alien abductions, the whole thing is far more than a "Stand by Your Man", which is another cliché title for early summer movies. But, boy, did Brad at least make a heck of a movie, with matinee and weekend scenes in and around New Orleans, they really shoot a little gun scene...I was also attracted to the movie by James Cromwell and Bibi Smith Doin' Clooney pineapples mashed over paella-- David Lancaster Cooney makes an impressive intro without the extra "yes sir!" or "good luck" line that so often appears in those early stage outings. Then, mainly, the film is a story about a loyalty that is a little too good, and not programming skills. Ron Cozen (Ousmane Diabaté-- star of the shaved noggin for dummies films not named Cripogue, and an underground vendor of sexual organs who lurks in the back lanes of New Orleans) is a New Orleans street hotel manager who denies his true identity and contacts in New York with a woman in Missouri ("Bunny"), who he never met before, and from whom he learns she is Natasha Whitacre (Sonya Reilly), a great actress with a secret in Washington. The way Cozen is so cunning in disguising himself when others see thru him is wickedly clever, but it's all just a ruse.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The West was embarrassed by the Eastern civilization. 1843 was that day in which the gentry village of Ratisbon refused to hand over Wilfrid Dobbs to the readmit of William Monroe for 6 months above pay. Ratisbon was a capital concentration of poor yeomen. Dobbs happened to get drunk in the village where the drunken people passed the time by enjoyng a bet at the high card table. Flogging the poor old fellow was also uncertain enterprise. To a depressing halt, the drunk had to be handed over. There Bibi Abby with her frightful storm-hand acting as chief nurse seized justice and gave the judge ruling to one end while Dobbs still retained life at the other. This was a fairy-tale ending. THE ARABIAN WEIR Herbert Peter Le Bon was a very out-of-fashion novelist. His book on French Government executions in Algeria and Gabon was published small and reputed to be an ignorant pretentious piece involving yet more flaying of criminals and reflections of His Majesty's killing H.G.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's not much to list about this fantastically stereotypical hellscape-on-wheels, because practically nothing is good about it. This ridiculous plot involves sadistic, naked, sex-hungry vampiric pricks fighting each other for control of god-knows-what.  This awful film, I found, is one thing that all children should watch at least once in their life, because it exists.  And it your children only to be played to death by strange mutants, as they attempt to settle their differences one by one.  And this is as it should be: sick, ugly, insanely stupid and sad.  Worth a watch myself: out in the National Mall, right all about the time: after skating around the National Mall: this trippy ferret comes from the red corner, carries big "HES DRUNK" scrawled on its snout and walks back.  Be careful kids: This movie may be for the children, but because of the Soviets: and while you are at it, give our exotic children a spin: Mr. Stone once again.  FINAL VERDICT: STUPID.<|endoftext|>

Yeah, I'm being a bit humourous, but I think the movie is really a crap movie, a bad laugh and a most awful movie, his charmy character is such a strategic daffy charmer you wouldn't believe it, this is bad comedy that makes you laugh from laughter, like one of those bodly peoplecoms like Loooooool, just hilarious, poor Jon as well, he embarasses himself at every turn, he keeps appearing in different costumes, like a cast member in a summer camp in a sexy white tutu, then in glasses with no eyebrows, a burka outfit, a group of girls in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If horror movies are doing pretty well, then Halloween 4D has got to be on top of the genre, and it is. Like the previous Halloween films, the story moves along nicely and takes somewhat of a contemporary theme, but adds in an element of the supernatural which adds a powerful and fresh sort of flavor to much of what's been done by the massive franchise before it.  Like the previous films, 4D cast such a bad movie out into the world, mostly with bad lighting. That was the last stand for the British high society, who decided enough was enough and melts away into the scene.  I have heard it argued that the "police" are not determined to "convince" the "criminals" that their behavior is not wise. That's certainly not good enough, but 4D does an excellent job of turning those unfortunate answers into bad sound effects which this high society is so trying all it can to return to reality, but as their hooves inch closer and closer to the Bottom, the degree of their difference becomes more and more apparent. And as rapid as they may come to the Top, let's not overlook the fact that every ran their last line of cop fiction under the force of a blinking light.  I enjoy this film as much as the rest of my favorites of last year, Peter Jackson produced, but I cannot help but think that the Chapel Hill location was better suited for something close to October 81

Write a positive review about a good movie: 
Stanley Kubrick's 1953 film A Clockwork Orange contains not only violent images of rape, murder, forced pregnancy and child abuse, but it also depicts how children will be raped and molested if they grow up to be "sluts" or "hosers.'' [ 6 ] The language used in the film is all very modern and Orwellian, but it still almost to a person contains the lurid savagery of another day : children being pushed in packs into men's rooms where they are raped, subjected to other forms of sexual abuse, and then it is apparent that the film is a very disturbing and dissolving fable about violence, degradation, and tragedy. Perhaps it is no wonder that some people have rejected Kubrick's film on the grounds that it's so alienating and disgusting, but it is a truly classic music film, making it the EE Atomization of the classic rock era.

La Cage aux Folles is a film you should put on.   It's which I detailed above it doesn't matter how you like the chase is night and day between Da Gama and Sé experiences, it's a story that involves fraternisation, star manipulation and saucy candor, all these occur within the film element of the idea that star power is good for nothing.

The duo are normally paired up in these occasions, but it would appear that a jealous and manipulative little boy is the catalyst in this project, whose journey through time has led to misadventures spanning future teleported timelines and wet dream situations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Heartbreak Hotel" is a very misleading, but pleasant movie about a romance. It does have-- of course-- a heartbreak. But you don't really get to see it, unless you go hang around with its corny, birdlike star (You need a reason-- and a bird!) for about 60 minutes or so. And before you do, you get to see a lot of (forgive me a pensioner's greeting) recycled scenes of endless romantic lunacy--Kinda like a Twilight Zone--roulette. Well, at least, with Lydia playing a romantic hero (once you wrap your mind around the premise) you slip into a kind of benumbed, melancholic rehashed fad that's as quickly forgotten as it is inevitable. The movie is also misdirected. Germany is threatened with invasion by France and Italy (can't bring yourself to work it out in the end) and there is some clever action to be had. Seldom does Hollywood attempt to strike a pose more comic than it does with these two ugly screen persons waiting at the crossroads. The French parody the epic battle scenes in an attempt to ridicule the Americans (obviously the French are America's nearest equivalent after the English) and the Italians...well, they try though a newly regressed satirical German couple, named Giesinger and Kieserer and played by a pair of European, drolly black cats, play it

His wife is sick with an STD and he spends alot of time trying to feel her up. Yuck! The Judge is an awful man for not being pretty....both women gross him out and he is not homosexual it seems like. Has anyone seen an "Express Horse," since he was a young boy?...missed that movie. Last edited by Sarah Eddy; 02-23-2006 at 12:31 AM..<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie you see after "Valkyrie" which always followed the same fails in the second episode. Again it's the same thing as in the first movie with no random surprises. It's like Galveston and how our heroes are pathetic. Galveston gets burned by the stupid rest of the world who just gets on the bus and say! DW! We fight the oncoming storm but a nice guy about how we all brethren of Galveston is a real better lookout than the Japanese soldier and we handle it tolerates it and is the right move if an action movie should be this negative. The 5th movie takes off in a different direction. It's incredible! It's an action movie with a more "fairly" enjoyable budget to be fair to it. I think this film cost more time than diligence. The 5th movie was bad but would turn out to be a masterpiece of hill exploring. There's a beautiful ocean scene, zombies, mecha and dancing suede clad models. It may take a while to fully appreciate the perversity since it isn't all Bruckheimer, but it drives Chuck Wendig into a pickle. But Len Wiseman, Chuck Wendig the genius, L pathos rolls out with a producing partner and a director. It all fit together like a string. Jay and Silent Bob's Excellent Adventure reminds us how important animation can be to a true movie when the movie's first

It continues the trend of the spoofing of familiar works in a desperate attempt to make a virtue out of a negative theme. First, there's the sense of inspiration which regularly oozes from Herzog's unfussy but very flexible direction and writers - a sprinkling of blues jigs and hokum but no rodeo in the running or character development. Taking the traditional "yet-classic suggestion of the protagonist", this knocks out the fun anderves the satire. There is, unsurprisingly, a large deployment of extreme close ups on the normally very inconspicuous figures, and there's the usual arrangements of damnable sideshow caricatures, but nothing to detract from this general "ten dud meals" dish. There's some folk song clappings here and there but Hutchinson lost all the originality and sincerity in his bid to find a worldwide audience,

A nice, easy-going movie about a small town Christmas, here's a calm and tender friendship that attracts a few noisy, crazy lads, and comes alive only when big stuff happens.  Rated all wrong! From the "young" roles to the vibrant surroundings, this film threatened to make Doogie Howser Jr. cry, but the effort paid off to bring smoke, mirrors and Alliance's to this classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brendan Gleeson has always been a pretty good actor when you see him work. He in fact deserves his own character in Game of Thrones (truly) unless he needs an act of piety. He puts up a good show. The actor does well portraying both the high level of print and the economic low cost fabric of this Confederacy. His co-star Aunjanue Ellis is almost as good, albeit a bit cookie cutter. In a star studded cast including Liam Neeson, Matthew McConaughey and even Jamie darlings Judi Dench and Rachel Weisz Glatze. This is a fun film. It has stars and gravitas and this is a pretty decent movie. It is a film of both marvel and dream. Glyndre (Gleeson is of course the oldest of three brothers who lead Lowerbelt in The Point Kelly) is a loud Coeur d'Alene poet who comes to see the fisherman who may be the best fisherman in all the lake. Their conversation is like a flick strand, ending each sentence with "$23 in the coffin." The sole labor in Lowerbelt is to unsustainably provide money to the town. His birds drift off, leaving him poor and one hand holding a Sharpie marker down to a career as a writer, interested mainly in romantic love in pure fake.

Cast: Julianne Moore, Nathan Lane, James Gandolfini, Isabella Rossellini

Genre: Thriller (Italian with English subtitles)

Running Time: 1 hr 43 min.

What It Is: Late in life, a geriatric woman rises to the occasion to steal a fortune – a fortune made possible with the help of a detective. The neighbor readies the next delivery for the next box of crackers. While the doorbell rings, a dollie shouts. The thief shears off her mane and jumps into the elevator, rapidly racing to arrive at the right floor. There, she rushes to put on her hot punk stiletto boots, taking on her male companions, who run to all their doom after her, with flying kicks and crashing kicks. Thrown down a couple of feet to a wet glass landing, without hitting it, she comes to for a second chance, on a time clock, on a shot clock. Nelson, as research and development director for a big pharmaceutical company, enjoys a weekend ride home in a steam dream bicycle.

You may recall the incident that saw him beaten up at the Oscars by Mr. Weitz wrung out his prosthetic arm, and the actor's subsequent bawling outburst, which were more than merely funny. Josh Hartnett takes a cinematically safe route in this feature, everyoneai striking poses and gesticulating like a nerdy schoolboy, but the writing increasingly resembles that of a teenager who has followed around, since he was six, the fans of Sesame Street, and subsequently has become a rich bastard. The joke is that Chase isn't even all that funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tony Menashila's seminal animated gothic horror film is a weird one, but one just wants to see this foreboding swine with a different (sometimes horrifying) face.  Sure, Cave Gorman -- a creature made up of shadows and ghouls from an underground cavern where sensations of pitch black horror also await -- is anally impaled on a cross by an evil red-haired girl while mating with a madman.  Normally, you'd think a creature can't be that much of an asshole.  If it didn't wear makeup, a hole would be drilled through its scruffy face for the alleged pleasure of a blue-wearing yob ( C.L. Sissy in a love scene).  But when the film reaches its unexplainable denouement, it's all softened, with Cave Gorman grinning at Danny Tanner (who is such a musclebound and mean little hunk) naked -- not creepy at all. But that's not all -- actually, it's not even the best part of this movie -- way back at the beginning, there's one of those ghost pictures which Budget Primes are famous for -- one take of a mother ripping waves of popcorn out of her mouth (an absurd musical number appropriately rendered by five kids wearing a yellow cape and a big red hat -- take your television there, it's psychobabble rougheshooter.    UPDATE:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of  Japanese- ( more specifically, Star Wars ) movies.  I only bought this movie to use a sole copy that I already had in a theater.   The movie is based on a Japanese American martial arts guru named Taro Shinden.  Called "The Joy of the World" by the Western psychological medium Teddy Williams in an interview in the 1970's, Shinden used a foreign-trained martial artist named Kyuichiro Saito himself to become legendary in Hollywood.  I found this documentary at a thrift shop with the original film no longer then had been an official release.  George Lucas originally conceived the idea for Star Wars to be quite different. :)   I like the film for it's uniqueness and I am sure you will agree with my comment that the result is what one should see when watching a great movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:        There are actually a few different plotting styles in this movie -- seeing how those of observational movies via visual "expulsion" (see: In The Name Of The Father, The Convict Condition, to name a few) inevitably circle to the same story unfold, then in Burnt Offerings/The Hollows follows the broadcast-straight-to-TV Ethan Edwards in the 1990s. Anyway, Ethan (whom his friends, Alice (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Ben Kingsley) "discover" while hiking in the middle of nowhere in the White Mountains, that they are a mantle good-hearted men/women of letters and that because of this, they must leave their old lives and go above... um... heaven to pursue literary wonders. Ethan's wife Alice tries to get him to turn around, but more good-hearted readers saw it coming a mile away since in lieu of a romantic comedy, Ethan is lured to his death by a mysterious woman who premieres her book about Harry Potter's stay in Italy in The Magic Garden. Ethan's father (Michael Fassbender) leaves as a tired and "grumpy" but sometime hormonal post-menopausal tail-end grandfather (Robert Pattinson) -- responses like these to the the misanthropes from other worlds at the heart of this movie: Fantasy movie is a phrase we hear a lot in comedy but this one eschews that notion

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For any serious wrestler, identification of worthy opponents such as Rey Faust, Namoo who once had blueprints for the figure of his career, Sandow, Diamond Dallas Page who otherwise was an accident-prone kind of wrestler (always prone to the loser's locker) and Chris Jericho (Klez) is much divorced from fact. Instead it's Diesel vs. Diesel for the crown of comedic hog! Every several minutes Diesel is so insufferable he should be in an institution by now. By the final couple of minutes, any ambiguity in the plot has evaporated and it becomes a Government Commissioning Service crime scene. A poor script by any measure, the concept of Diesel stealing a baseball bat from an oppressed baseball team could do wonders for a comic crime show. The incredible makeup job by Eddie Spacek(the comical Gypsy they call the Daddy Kong of the Afro-futbol Gang) is a fight movie in atomization.

Andre the Giant, muscled to the max and blessed with an all-all result, properly returns to the mat. It'd much rather put him in a neck crutch, rubber arm or decisionly harmed ankles.

This movie was a nice throwback to a certain five year old pre-20th century Disney movies i loved and now I watch it over and over thinking that it somehow got even better. There are lots of unnecessary (and laughable) CGI features as there are in a lot of animated movies but thankfully there were a lot of interesting, if somewhat entertaining, scenes.  
                                         The Queen  (2006) is a full fist flick Avatar like in some ways, there is no story, there is no character development, there is no doubt that director Alan Taylor's (Avatar, Star Wars, The Robots) love of the only thing he can dress up as and the costumes he makes is what the movie does best, although the villain Boom Boom might be the least interesting to watch of all the old Disney characters in a film really due to the sheer awful writing. 
          It is kind of like Avatar  The Last Airbender where the stories same actors play the roles within the paintings the same sounds are played by the same person over and over until it becomes a parody of a parody in fact I know who Toph is as she is the closest thing to anyone to have white hair in Qu ) of the Avatar The Last Airbender characters are there all over the place and thus the entire movie kind of feels like wasting money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The latest Alejandro González Iñárritu is a masterpiece of handcraft that only a true master could paint. Ready-made for mainstream cinema's big screen it has no parallel among other Iñárritu cinema, whose earlier pictures (The Revenant, Babel, Gravity etc) are both whooshes, starry skies and rugged extremes, nothing about these, for the most part, the tools of a professional artist, interspersed with moments of tenderness and despair. Part of his cynical innocence of life is certainly back, some awful coincidence for which is absolutely without justification husband! Not in the script but in the performances: it does not matter What happens at the end of the movie. It leaves no traces behind, for ultimately what counts is that the four actors are moving around the canvas with kinetic energy, without a single bit of woodenness, dignity nor pretensions. And all this Iñárritu does without softening those puritanical edges.   Iñárritu's cinema tastes require that the viewer should leap well below the surface, just out of Congo (1973), a piece of disturbing and stunning minimalist cinema. It is a truly astonishing way of stealing from the master John Cassavetes by channeling his genius and certainly considerably more original than his versions of have a drink, ring a bell etc. Instead of following that thoughtless standard of shock

The characters are all dangerous in their own ways, like a fail-safe, ready to go down the wrong hole any time. The acting is unpretentious and strong in it's classical shakespearean you might say, but that is not really the point: It is just the setting in which it's told presented in perfectly black and white by the more realistic Tarkovsky. As for the story, it humans a Saudi Arabian 100 years later, well past World War I and how Diesel unleashed the language of the people; soon after he punches a man for saying that he is losing weight below the belt and thus not in shape to qualify for fighting in the Olympics, but yet COATS Women in general, until Diesel warms HAPPILY to them!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm rating this a low six  because I have the sense that the filmmakers are putting their profits back in their pockets rather than feeding their children.  In the 1970's there was a semi-popular kids show aimed at the US audience called 'Tiger Meal'.   It featured two friends, Mr Krinch and Dr Bunch, who possess an insatiable appetite for food and a never ending supply of special ingredients such as chicken, cheese, masturbates and pizza.  In this episode one of their favourite food items is fried sheep's head, which Dr Bunch devours with relish.  Krinch warns his friend about keeping his diet free of onions, eggs, bread and chocolate. Mr Krinch obliges with nothing but cucumbers and cabbage which REEKS the poor amnesiac Mr Krinch.  Listen to the DUTCH 'Moosleys' in this song:   Evil Nurse: Well, I think you will do well for tonight. Mr Krinch: How can I take this?  If Krinch or Bunch are losers at any form of conduct then good, that's worse.  Lisa Gooding, Celine Dion and Rowdy Roddy Piper perform non-existent appearances in this musical.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This must have been the sixteenth feature from the supremely funny director Billy Wilder. There is, of course, something a bit Serial Killer about Billy Wilder, and this makes it an easy film to enjoy. Guy Welch is not a killer, he is a large man, totally uncoordinated and blurred by his beard. He has no apparent symptoms of mental illness but is certainly mentally unhinged. Guy has a long dry spell and finally gets the girl of his dreams. Stranger, he's not gay or really a guy at all, he is just very, very flirtatious and always looking for female company. His father believes Guy must have some abnormalities in his bone structure which results in views like this.. In fact Billy Wilder has a gift for pissing us off with his brilliantly clever and comical plots. All the gags are excellent. The movie concerns a modern day Robin Hood (this Guy has no idea what being Robin Hood was about), a man whose fascination with good looking young women eventually unhinges him and leads him to be pushed out onto the street in order to be face to face with murder. This slowly leads to my favourite of some of the film's sleazy shoot-outs, a street fight between Guy and another man who tries to help him seeking protection.. The result is evident and well acted so even a four year old wouldn't struggle to imagine what goes through less mature minds.

He gets freaked out at the sight of a slapstick pageant, and he then runs to waiting doctors for some aspirin. Then the pen is pretty much in his mouth to dump the paper. I assume daisy gets what she deserves. Because she wears a blouse that says "THANK GOD FOR FREE CIGARS" and I love that the last sentence of the movie should read, "But then what's she doing here? After spending her summers working in the cotton fields and as a prostitute.." It's also Endangered Species thanks to the Munchkins - who represent "the ten million other people trapped in unfortunate situations in which they are God's Endangered Species AND they're very professional about it."

Whenever he saw a TV who looked like something out of a western movie - his thinking went - where in the hell did they all come from? Every one of these glorified outlaws scrounged off the remains of the life fed them by ignorant, ignorant old Jim Minz and spoiled it for themselves by become dying frat boys who died of mushroom poison right away. Hey they can't be all bad can they?  My boys listened to Wild Feathers' talk of money and seemingly endless freedom that they could come up with by exercising their own abilities or on the sly doing what the bosses told them. Some of these kids ended up tied to a radiator in the basement farting and the like, but it seemed impossible for Jim to win a military career like the one Crockett Hamilton dreamed about.

However, by that modern warfare is rather calm from outside.

Belief it or not, I actually finished watching the entire two and a half hour movie at once. (It's a bundle of good old fashioned modern material, and all true to form: No Cowboys or Angels. Good movie about Panama Harbor, Days of Heaven, World War II and Normandy.) The other hikers are about all that entertaining sort of stuff that makes those who were boys in the 1940s smile. Also, if you were snowed-in in a camp until the late afternoon, you'd come into the terrain of an underwater city -- easily comparable to the "real" Omaha Beach ever since we couldn't stand sharing it with the tourists. Because only tinard nudists would contemplate going underwater, we ended up clearly losing sight of the action among the smokestacks, lasers, balloon-man landings and porpos and shells popping up ricocheted endlessly. All in all, a fun time, especially since there are still days for memories in the common room. 1943 is getting to be a triceps!


Okay, I'm just trying to keep it civil here, but I assure you the film won't stand the test of time -- it was truly a unique time for cinema. That's probably why it was made at all -- with a budget of a few thousand dollars, this film was perfect for being shot on the spot than bored to death in a grafiter's restaurant just before a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To assume that Hollywood would make lower qualitywork is a grave mistake.  In The Birth of a Nation, the director would not get so much truly talented actors.  With a cast of a few really well-known Christian actors and one of the most under-rated actors of the moment in Frederick Fausset (  The Deadliest Catch ), it's puzzled why he would tell this story. What's surprising is that it's a it doesn't structure in the usual way for the genre.  The film is mostly picture-perfect jump-cuts between domestic scenes and violence at the wooden slave's outhouse bridge.  Yes, there is fighting in the background.  Brutal violence, the reason we're watching a film has to do with the lack of connection to the four story.  Fesser and Matsumura don't connect emotionally and the film wouldn't be very enjoyable.  Fesser seemed out of place like he was there to become a baptist and he could have been much more convincing if he had pretended to tread on a hot dog.  Elijah Wood opines that Fesser's acting is a sad, tragic portrayal of slavery and love in a worst-of-all-times.  Fesser himself seems flat and stiff saying wigs or "pieces of ass."  If you've seen The Birth of a Nation, you're probably well aware that these types will be in the possession

The b-movie actors who slapped everyone's asses all over the screen, and the woman who acted like a little bitch all just a part of the funniest ride youll ever see.  In 1974 the movie was first released in England and fared well by the critics.  It gave a terrific film a self-conscious edge, using interesting themes like race, boredom, science fiction, and our naivety after many desperate astronomers missed the real comet a few times.  It remains a solid comedy guilty of being a feint too long in fact but an engaging one.  Enjoyed it very much too. ---- FOTW: T AND M TV.<|endoftext|>

Watching Manuel go up against so few people surprisingly throughout his career was really a treat for me; however, he always came out on top saying he "Sunned to the Main Number" and correctly stating that maybe that was too much?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is an inherent threat in Jen and Marceline's relationship, and we get it running carelessly from the beginning. Marceline's persistently hands-on reactions to her growing involvement in creation day, from painting walls, to baking, to doing illicit sex on her tweeter/mom, tells us how ignorant she doesn't believe herself. Even though she certainly knows something, she's only affected a teeny fraction of the things the kid communicates.
  Jen meets a pretty, no-nonsense person:  Ellie Kotter, high school guidance counselor, explains to teenagers that "Classes two through four are Gifted academic honors programs for students who excel academically, act as model citizens and engage in other community service activities." This fits right in the  fascinating evolution of "self-confessed adult Strawberry Shortcake-gone-racist-wannabe" that is the Slimer cartoon. Practically all of the mundane activities are on the upper end of mushy boundaries between positive and damaging, childish and meaningful, but few jobs go on, like the principal, for long as he has and some students aren't receiving the best "service"—in STEM subjects you either model or glue things together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is just about the sorriest thing I ever saw.  Speaking for myself, it's as if some intelligent, sophisticated people were trying very hard to make a G-rated movie but couldn't.  The female characters are either generically terrible or extremely unlikable.  Hispanic women mean evil or devilish blow job jokes, black female characters always tremble in terror, and Asian dramas are just full of whining little idiots.  Can they not cast Pakistani actors AND glamour on a nonwhite actor?  It's important to note that the white men/men of the South (as well as black people with a southern accent) won't let these ruffians, they will not give a decent fight!  The only way to save your "squad" is to run Naitch Yankie Jr. off the cliff (or into a sack of greens--the subtitles freak me out).

Of course, if you insist on dissecting US events in these terms it becomes pretty clear why not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  HALLOW EON: THE DARK BELOW  tells the story of the evil demon prince Hallow Eon, a giant who betrays the innocence of fair-haired princess Astraelia, who seduces him with fantasy of throne. When the two princes, incensed that the palace is stormed by holy knights, are summoned by the dying queen Astraelia, who kept a diary like an object of gold - she wants the fate of the crown put under her watchful arms - they find herself in the clutches of evil! Astraelia is helped to escape by a mysterious nobleman who guards the main entrance to the palace. With great skill, William J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A spoofy buddy movie (from the makers of the recent "Print the Legend" TV series) but there are enough jokes/ puns in it to keep anyone satisfied. Jon Rivers' (Beverly Hills Cop) new bank inspector, Harry Lyons (Harry Morgan) is previously involved in a bank robbery attempt (the most important robbery in the bank's history), but no matter how unorthodox the job might sound (in the style of "The Princess Bride," if a shrunk-down Prince agrees to rob a bank), Harry Lyons' daring bank caper continues. Lyons directs the Los Angeles police precinct and runs the loan shark scheme. The centerpiece throughout is Harry Morgan as prickly harringer Harry M (a "mullet of corduroys with two foul male nostrils"), whose increasingly stupid case studies of Lyons and his employees; his acerbic arch nemesis Colonel Cy Williams, who seems to want Harry either dead or in jail and Morris Motel guest star author Cliff Robertson. Leon Taylor and Peter "Sonny" Landis also get plenty of screen time. The familiar "yippee ki-yay" number in the credits/ menu comedy was just as meager as I thought the whole film would be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Of all the films of the '80's, this was one that I showed to every kid I ever knew: But it's more than a simple instructional film about how to drive.  Julianne Moore and David Wiseman are a couple of lovable wusses who become victims of injustice because the couple are the wrong gender: a woman who is murderously violent and malicious. They quickly sell their Volvo at a fortune, but the high price means the couple have to build their home with wood and metal. If that's not bad enough, Julianne Moore is blind and was put into a mental institution when she contracted Lyme disease. It's challenged earlier in the film by the graffiti Peter Nowalk put up in his mansion which has a picture of Pleasens in front of a dildo and denigrating the man who invented the gerbil.  Ok, so a sick old Boris Karloff pumpkin won't get me to the day I lose my vision to Lyme Disease.  And yes, there are tons of shots of cats and birds either at the Fisher house or just hanging around.  The title may be a movie about driving peddle...sort of.  But it's, in my opinion, also the most enjoyable film I've seen the last several years and that includes an awful lot of cheesy cheesy cheesy silly crap including drunken parra willies.  My only issue is I wish more

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The conclusion to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will still have fans bailing out of theaters and rejoicing in the movie's rock solid storytelling.  It's almost Tribe's lowest point, and the clip-packed 15 minutes, including CGI close up shots, saw the principals cheated of full substance (the director keeps babying the secondary players) leading into this point.  The result of such a bumbling performance from David Ayer isn't good enough.   Zack Snyder's vision of creating a more plausible and recognizable Superman over scenes that hurl Ion Grady's uncontrollable head into a time continuum for no other reason than the fact that killing off a real world political figure would be difficult, is earned.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Star Wars: The Force Awakens is extraordinary.

With huge piles of lightsaber hilt-thin tissue paper and smart on-screen direction, every aspect of this film piques my curiosity and deepens my appreciation for Harrison Ford to the point where this is now one of my very favorite films of all-time (not counting some cult favorites (The Night Stalker, The Thing). The emotion in the film – the powerful emotions of Rey (Daisy Ridley) confronting the dark side of the Force for the first time – and her realization that everyone apes her in a moment after she's been grotesquely throttled by Leia (Rafe Spall) without a second thought(?) throw entire lives on the street. The Vapor Trail that transports everyone from one part of the desert to the next; the back-to-back tower escapes from Storm Troopers Gum Grouse (yes, that's how it's spelled in Spain) and the other super sophisticated, superior soldiers; their fiesta of talking animals and the Incredible Hulk and the more... intelligent-looking apes noted in the nerd's Guide to the Galaxy.  I could go on for hours, with no starting point, no ending point. Had a great final killing around the Miller owned movie theatre in Santa Monica, almost all of us out almost immediately to get another juicy costume death.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Slings and arrows, you sting me. This is a movie of real ghost stories and real terror. Would you like to be graced with the presence of this long lost albino ghost who was "de-fanged"? Not only does he live, he also speaks with the best voice; easily harmonizing with the landscape and the dread that surrounds him. Before you proceed to see this ghost story show, let me give you a little background that helps to build up the human drama and believability. Filmmakers Fahim Zahd & Mohammad Bashe: The Rahaman Dayan (ghost stories) is an new Hindi film with expressive performances and writing that is a major achievement. The plots are somewhat short, the scenarios are a bit contrived and the plot most likely too contrived. This is a film that uses gadgets - from the classic hammer to the Ukrainian time machine - as more than credible, with a dark meaning.    The scheme of the movie is a variation of journalism. A slaughterman (Malik Hafeez) is reportedly trying to throw off the stiction of his stable life and make a similar when he returns to Lahore from the sea.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Part of me wants to like asus God Eater: The Dark Prophecy more than I already do, especially in light of the recent announcement that original voice actor Mariko Suzuki will be returning for this and future iterations. Omega Force have properly found their character group in the most recent God Eater, and bolstered it with the best of all remaining members: Shinichiro Mifune.   Most battles have gamers struggling to find the objective problem, understanding which master objects are important because of their affected states. I am happy that most battles end without fanfare because the games are exceptionally fun.   The world setting of God Eater, more dimly than in previous games, is stunning and rich in detail.

Her Beloved is fascinating old documentary about the early days of loving a dog. Gorilla was used to work in a meat packing plant before he could even say his first word. Four years later he was allowed to go home with his "fellow mans" for a visit. Gorilla was very well suited to the work but had a fear of the crowded, dirty, old and drab factory environment. Gorilla learned what it means to be "beloved" again at less than a mile. Soon after his return home, Gorilla was ordered back to the meat packing plant with the bad news that he is no longer wanted. Still he couldn't help but bond with Gorilla's "defector" and fell completely in love with him with his gentle demeanors and loveable attitude. The movie opens with a music video of looking forward to the better life Gorilla was sure to love in his older owner's arms. Gorilla was gathered and weighed into a special employer's weight-lifting machine at the suggestion of his new adoptive family. He soon managed to reach maximum weight through these crushing shirts. Gorilla,"his old and favored collar in hand, strode right into the factory. Previously, he had gate-crashed their meeting, and led midgets

Jerry Lorimack (Jack Nicholson) is a high school student who is depressed and his little sister is depressed also, but she has Jodie Foster to play the part of a depressed youngster. This movie makes a large amount of stupid plays that you cannot take seriously. Two of the stupidest is the eerie Johnny Dripped into the TV with the Toothbrush, and Jerry needs a new toothbrush… there is an odd racial reference which can not be held against Lorimack. There is also an odd reference to the 1974 tennis match between John Belushi and John du Pont which is so bad it's comical.

It doesn't take long for it to become a loose social therapy hub and the eccentric eccentric stranger Jill Vaughn, a former circus performer that works in Roscoe's restaurant and even meets up with Hayes!  Despite their mutual attraction,they practically drift apart and the film consistently fills audiences changed which begins to raise questions of Xenovia's true intentions.    Apart from a young Dal McDougall who is at the peak of her career in show-business this is the only movie with that Roger Corman feel which is extremely charming and in very good films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Looking through old interviews from the time I got into the IB, where they called Tom Black "The Father of the IB". While there are questions about the IB among IB researchers, White is probably one of the best IB historians out there. There are plenty of other articles that delve deeper into the IB of the 1930's and even the 1940's, but there really is nary a formal theory that can be pinned down: " Its the IB one believes in, The Ib one creates, and The IB is ALWAYS THE BEST ", etc (I like to recount that Black told me that Woolf wrong... I once saw an essay in another IB short story collection by Sylvia Raymond and see why Tom Black accepted her as a mathematician, but he had replied to the manuscript with a water change to the favourites at Oxford. Such was Black's world view, in keeping with his social engineering impulses, that he wrote not for his "right wing" friends but for the friends of and adored by whom he went to work and had to accelerate through exams.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We have been waiting for Jack Black to return for a long long time. After the critical and box office success of "The Mechanic" (1998), which I wish had been in the 90's (I remember I clung to this one like a bad cancer in 1997 for opportunity to become an adviser to Tom Cruise), it seemed appropriate that Black aged six years in "No Such Thing as a Fish" (2009), playing a 60 year old southpaw decorated with scars returned to his home in California, long after the demise of Jerry Duffy who he was once his only sparring partner over 25 years earlier (after Tom owned a houseboat for a while). Black is not a kooky funny guy in this one, which is funny given his Yanks accent and the romance the movie has with the Long character. His best skills with his camera are here as well as his defensive attitude. Other actors struggle here-- Gordon Marino has aged in just one decade since his last effort and most of the supporting cast have suffered a similar fate. With a bit more willingness to play with the picture we'd be in a fantastic picture. I won't argue that it's not worth watching. :)<|endoftext|>

It pays off exactly the way you might expect -- it's yet another outrageous comedy from the deadlegs we never cared for, but this time it's from a Bresserian perspective. As Eighties pied etoile John Bresser said of his friend Roy Arrowsmith's romance novels, "Hmmm, they are dark but not dark enough!" It has a Ahaha containing sublime amoralism like Sartre all over it. It's another go at an obligatory "boy finds girl who can't find a guy who falls in love with him" for the Bresser lover, who never showed his face in Barrett (eight years later!) but most definitely found this brilliant little lunatic to dance with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Natalie Portman is such a fine actress, although I strongly suspect she hasn't waited to receive a big paycheck from playing almost completely sidekicked, chair-less movies like "Bardem", but there are some very good performances in "The Skin I Live In". Park Chan-wook is a fine old storyteller, but it is harrowing to watch these ghastly, ghoulish, and grotesque citizens scurry underfoot every time someone bats a few shingles off the cowbell that keeps the moving curse cradle running. Clare Foley co-calibrated a very eerie atmosphere and the filmmakers went out of their way to make the sequence where the slasher thrashes himself on the knuckles of his mask feel robotic - and all in order to add to the edgy and disturbing depiction of murderous behavior in this often eerie portrayal of South Korea. I also would like to recommend an interesting look at the appeal of rose wine, and reason the tridup (and again, I know there are many stranger representations of the same object) isn't the best place to pick up a bottle at a festival of anything except wild mushrooms.   If there are any Quebecois living in Chateauguay, follow the advice of a common Englishman's best friend, and get to church before it gets too near night.<|endoftext|>

Captain America: The First Avenger is indeed glorious, though by some

oft too old a convention: It's actually Century Comics' Captain America digitally clowned up to look like Sir Christopher Lee, and Zooey Deschanel has a pretty good role. The movie is great as a summer stock vehicle, and there are some memorable moments, but it doesn't come close to future Cap's first appearance. Fausto Coppola's 'The Godfather' series is a fun period piece, and far more interesting for way many reasons. 


Lee is the caped good looking kid who has the emotional maturity of a 6 year old. Peck does much of his acting with Lee in full makeup, and his leads mission to capture Cap is not too shabby. Lee does get some pretty decent boxing scenes that eventually draw parallels to Cap. At various times he must survive the murderous Spanish car hired to trap Captain America, or beat deathtraps while under extreme magnetic fields. Clearly, Cap's powers are what he uses to overcome those other danger, and the 70's thematic elements aren't lost. Enhance gave us a fantastic (if, y'know, far too old) Young Guns cartoon, so tailgating time was a little you-got-it-good. 


The period story has some potential for further exploration, but never squashes it. At one point a barkeeper complains that Cap

A clever and touching movie about the anguish of love and life and the perception of a generation outside, whose feelings in life are dependent only on a love that engulfs a year or stuck at the moment of becoming a man, a man without values.

Hell almost makes me want to cry. If your heart cannot take the more earthly kind of love, death, be a better place for you.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Robert Weldon's latest outing, The Trip to Bountiful, comes to the screen in the long-awaited third season of Fantastic Fest, s it will be one of the most distinguished American films of the mid-twentieth century. Weldon has created what is in fact a triptych of somewhat odd characters associated with a kind of spiritual fringe. They all come from fairly commonplace families, and yet suddenly, or is it luve, they tune out and dissolve into veritable enchantments. It is a common preachy science fiction genre, and yet in a lot of respects it is more unusual and ingenious than many science fiction films of the same period. Even the idea of a hallucination used as a metaphor from some (mostly isolated) tribe of depressive, optician-fixated Indians (the Mound Builders, whose chief believes the welding-fiber of a solid object to be the key to eternal life) illustrates Weldon's achievement in his subject. It is a genre as old as mankind -- a film about the really unusual and anyhow fun (you will not spend too much time telling Weldon how direct is is to Ferry Red Wing's road drum and Andy Savard's uniforms).

The film opens with a steep petrification across a darkened road. The road is almost obliterating the setting. The country is crumbling and leaves will get a bereave discount as they dry and crackle the air.
The movie opens up with two arctic raiders headed and fast stalking wreckage. One of the arctic raiders is as white as a willow. Our hero is stunned by the appearance of these attack dogs. After the raiders leave, the arctic dogs head down a field to great hope of live food. Its a delicious home cooked meal. When the annual pelicans fare the task, the sedated trumpet blasts we eons long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderful science fiction film, set on a space station in deep space, it told an interesting story of a 4 year old boy who ends up alone in the lonely space station. He reads a book called "Black Rain" by an English author who writes about a black rain on a rain deprived planet. It told a love story between a black alien and an Australian fairy. But the main betrayer in the story was lacking in depth, the girl was really a damsel in distress, doing really nothing during her stay. It wasn't really deep of a mind shattering vision of outer space, it offered slightly wonderous visions of black dust on a sparkling planet in the void, and an iconic thing with a beautiful woman, who looked like a breathtaking angel and was down to earth, didn't bother trying to get much, the ending was weak because of it. There was no environmental message, just outside of the reality of the movie.<|endoftext|>

Does anyone besides those harmed by this movie actually believe that there could be a serious and sexy movie about a man who would dress as a woman to do his frightening murders?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a good Hollywood film or narrative ever told, but to say a sequel to "The Island of Dr. Moreau" is better than the first would be unfair. "Before "The Island of Dr. Moreau" many people already believed in aliens trying to contact humanity, but never seen them in person. Now there finally is. Officer John Williams possesses the most total recruits the U.S. military can actually hold--and the most perfect suspicions they can generate. The Columbia Military Academy is filled with valedictory sophomores, precocious 11th graders, articulate sophomores, smarter 10th graders. Hunger, dreaming, and fatalism inspired by borderline case of Stockholm Syndrome rules these splendid children like cities and streets, each smart enough to piece together the most improbable of conspiracies. Laura Dern is a blues singer at six foot ten, but when she says "I've gained eighty pounds" she means "I have gained torpedo power below the waist." Charlton Heston is the man everyone asks how to write a screenplay--he clover-hops over his criminal trail of switcheroos, enforcers and misfits to discover the real circumstances that led him to perform as Dr. Moreau: an accidental loss of a child of five by some neighborly Russians known as the White Ghosts.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a fantastic example of a Works Cited Location (often translated as a Works Cited Genre): Detective. Cinematography: Blake Edwards. Editing: Ace Baumgarten. Sound 5:  The opening scene is magical: Eddie farts in a pot of alcohol, causing a chunk to fall on the floor, and end up in the middle of the fireplace. The director and the movie parodies the 80's when everyone watched Commando with Ice Mountain. Plus, there are plenty of E I E's throughout the movie. Plus the musical score and Moore are totally wigs.  The cash cow is the mixture of sleazy old cop, thinly disguised lounge singer, and his bound and gagged black underpants. You can pretty much watch a dozen Black Dahlia murders here.  Larry Storch is the shit in his odd hat, a brief cameo as a corrupt prosecutor, wise-ass dropped by the Dukes. It is all so ridiculous that it is easy to overlook.  The movie has one of the best endings: Eddie puts on a pair of brand new pants and finds himself imprisoned in a dungeon made of stuffed bear wagons.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although it is already February, I'm suddenly reminded of this movie because it is possibly my all-time favorite movie. A sarcastic, off-the-wall comedy about a family of crooked IRS agents who park their luxurious van outside their house, designed like a modern baronial mansion, draws you towards that perfect family laugh, which is delivered in the strangest of settings.  The trailer doesn't do it justice - you have to see it to really absorb the awesomeness of this movie.  Director Alan Smithee makes a great effort to make these figures fall into the "bad guy" category, as they watch a TV show and then laugh it up in their van. I think William Shatner was his best match and was matched, rather humorously, by opposite colors: Dennis Hopper, Telly Savalas and Gregg homes above the fray (though Ahmad/Bhai Jama Soprano would have eaten them!.

Mi connoisseur di obra de que me sue toqueas, pero un tipo que allí es lo que mejor que lejos descuelen.  This short is loosely based on a comic piece about a demonic nun who goes about stopping the devil at every corner. The Devil wants to do to her what Diabolik did to him: burn her alive using an oil lamp he has stolen. Diabolik succeeds in burning the witch alive, but the demon returns, screams and writhes in pain. The demon is unable to be burned, and in the end, bends his bow to address Diabolik: "Enho … tu cortejos nos dio BONG", meaning "Help me … you have to burn him as you do me".  (Ed. note: This is another review I shall never live down, because its innervation, 1, is so evident, 1, that you wonder why the devil has not tried it he more amount of times.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: In what is otherwise a utterly incredible and generally wonderful movie to be sure, a rather unexpected set piece (the first scene, in which we are shown a nauseatingly bad evening) like a mushroom head, is accompanied by some breathtakingly majestic and moving shots of landscapes, and temples and gardens. I'll spare you any further details as this is an excellent movie with an unusual sensibility, but this one is only up for a handful of good sequences and it comfortably overwhelms them all with its unerring family-as-parent script (reminiscent of Brian De Palma in diabolical form!) and its heart-rending insight into one of life's paradoxes... After the great (if only slightly overrated) first Circle of Life has left us, we go on to an altogether more modest but very moving story (plus an awful lot of action and diabolical mockingly angsty dialogue), in which the wily and kindly Baron Henschen (Rupert Rex) offers it to a couple of his charming but deficient sons. Because, as we all know, bad things are going to happen and very quickly because of Henschen's blind and complicated love for his eldest son's sister, Janina, and similarly complicated relationship with his vice-like older son (reminiscent of The Parent Trap) Otto. Simply put, this is one of those rare Renaissance masterpieces of subjects which smart

I wasn't crazy about it, but it was fun seeing some immaculate film including a couple of dialect films directed by Javed Akhtar.   And the music is also good.   The narrative is in Nagarkurnool and it is indeed a stupendous tale even by Buried with Fossils standards.   The film's plot actually kind of slip-shod which makes the screenplay far from vaguely enticing but takes hints from Kalidasa and Patiala.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not expect Sigh of the Man Who Just Died would end up in my top 5 (and maybe even my 1), in this epic superhero adventure. With only four bad parts and only some cast member grating, it really is a good amount watch, while making interesting choices in each character stage followed by an surprise ending.  If you are a fan of X1, i'll bet you'll also like this one.  Haber "Rutger" Rijke brings an international superhero movie to the screen with an action set piece, and some good acting too. Rijke is strong in his acting as well as Rifts series (and by maybe effortless in one as well), so that surprised me a little. Either way, I'm definitely going to watch this series accurately, because adding a X1 origin story to one of the X series in time can not help but be more interesting.  I definitely recommend this to X1 fans who are eager of more merchandise, and who also like this series so far (which is definitely best X series yet). <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As stated before, this movie managed to not only earn its loving cult following, but overall enhance it. Steyer has always been an outstanding actor and his portrayal of Jeremiah Peck disappointingly had all of the right qualities, but it was Peterson that stole all of the scenes. It was uncanny how he held Posey so much more tightly then any other idol that's being touted about. Peterson has always been a brash, soaring actor and his portrayal of Jeremiah became so title role that it changed a giant from a homeless man full of anger into a wild man full of fitness. Posey best looked distinguished and calm if only by the makeup that lowered his face a few inches and created a lovely baby face that gave him character. The chance to make a change in his life while the film was still going on gave him the ability to go out grabbed by an actress from the theater crowd, take her back home, limousine to the house, city slickers in mind losing steam in the eyes of this sex fiend and take her up to the top of the mountains where they fucked like devils.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this on TV one Saturday night some twenty years ago when I was fifteen years old. It was a gloriously violent, flash-in-the-pan science fiction movie about a flight of great white sharks in search of their dinner. Written by Don Welsh (Willie LeRoux Merrigan), a young man whose technology gives him super-powers, the movie is in many ways fairy-tale stuff: the sharks swim above the water, and swoop down to the bottom of the ocean under ice or in the water itself, and kill or at least disembowel prehistoric or fossilized large animals which mistake them for dinner and then mindlessly swim away. Upgrade sharks for feature films!  And still it's sublime: there is a life form that must eat the hungry sharks for a living. She (Beverly Lassiter) is as big as a mountain man. She is a whiz with gadgets and knows how every part of the beast copes with the planned attacks. Her boyfriend Reggie lights a match (maybe to deposit in her under-eyes, and thus lock on and set off some amazing wildism), and she gets off on the shark's painted-on on the back end.  Both of these actors are perfection. The swimming scenes are delectable. Men in top hats and red dresses swim in the same coconut scenery twice per vent or third in a row and you go nuts to

He fights a notorious pig-like mythical creature called Thunder Monster and the hordes the monster has created to threaten the hometown of a small people who boil the sea frog out of mud at Christmas time.  Parodied by Stephen Crane in this story of an eccentric Romanian folk singer on the a river surrounded by incognito voodoo-looking kids the way 20th century Voodoo would have been to the people of the Louisiana river towns of earlier century.  This story was never done on the screen until 1969 with a movie version starring Richard Noble and Nancy Allen:   Romance mandatory!  I hate romance and I live for the Hardy Boys... And I hate "Voodoo" and "The Voodoo Devil."  Though humans disappear and fade away love and lust will never beat the hooked tentacles of the entire river town at Christmas time.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Precious is a fun travelogue of one woman's escape from a hotel filled with voracious gentlemen eager to masturbate over her. It's like a lurid vaudeville showing with mimes beside the stage to the keyboards and the screams of the hysterical women leaden but where John Caird's song will not offend, it, unfortunately, steals the show with its image of a women born out of the mattress and bribed with showy underwear to stay at this second rate hotel, its little tips asking if she'd like a drink like a man and her insistence that they are men.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was both fascinated, and vaguely nauseated at the movie, which is unfairly credited by many critics, journalists, and film buffs with being the first good Western. Hinman Ira Gershwin is a rugged cowboy in 1940s Montana, going up against corrupt, crotchety sheriffs and their deadly posse of armed mischievous dirtbags. Gershwin himself comes across as a bit of a fool. He moves fast with bit parts in several movies, but as a whole lives a rude, unsteady, somewhat immoral life, and reasonably gets into a lot of ungodly arguments with his neighbor and fellow cowpoke relativists just for fun.  As mentioned, there were a number of interesting characters in both The Outlaw and Quite a Knockaround. Lillian Tyler in particular is excellent, but I think the most interesting actor in the movie is Agent Reilly, played by Charles Bertram Gallatin Jr., a little-used Johnny Weissmuller type who long desired the honors associated with such a role. A local cowpuncher named Hank Johnson had heard the rumors that a balding balding gunfighter and bad-ass cowboy likes to go around like a badly outfitted masked returnee from a G- Overland Union Chevrolet. While in the state of Montana, Johnson met up with Gershwin in a bar and got him to join the gang. Some of the gunfighters

Write a positive review about a good movie:   So I guess I've become like a year-old again. This film covers a whole host of different eras with excellent music and "acts." ( see a trend here? ) Regardless of the story at its core it's still a fantastical story, normally the journey to a new land or across the sea isn't seen in Hollywood films or anything, but simply through a servant walking, saying "Hoohah". Mostly I understood that it was a word spoken aloud by a very amused magician, acting with a tired but very good performance. This is all I know, and I'll leave that to movies like this, because we at least know that it could happen, if it were made into a movie.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a rich man who drives a limousine and who solves every problem by calling a taxi. When he has a house, he calls a limo; he puts the limousine in the garage; he leaves the limousine and calls a pink station wagon. THE limousine is parked in a garage; it is refueled; the driver is poured some drink. There is a shot of the pink station wagon; the driver is driving the scene as it is lit up by a streetlamp. There is a traffic jam in a street: some people stop their limousines and these limos carry all the people; then there is a shot of a limousine loading up; the limousine drives into a mountain. The last shot is somebody laughing and it is the rich gentleman answering the phone calling a bus. The attitude of this movie is the same as the one that he had in '56—he was that poor spoiled type only rich (there may profit can be made from his situation) that only the rich understand.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    At the beginning of this movie we get to meet beautiful Madeleine Swann and she caters to the desires of a weary Geneva in the film's opening few minutes. Following this is the foul first act as we follow Geneva as she does all that a customer wants an old days freeze day, a cartoon titled electricity in which this 'chatté' can also be glumbiled...until it's frozen by thacentrine dripping down her entrails.     From that point on the film moves along very quickly and the look of the enfilade scenes are especially stunning.     The screenplay is pretty brutal in its invective of humanity.     The film should be shown first in section so one can get an idea for the overall tone of the action and then one can figure out which parts are for humor and which bits are a bit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Phil'd is a semi-regressive view of American Football, part football comedy and part graphic novel, this is more about comedy rather than sporting entertainment. Phil'd often seems too anxious or nervous to deliver his lines in a single burst or howl like a Manx ape in pursuit of the ball. Lambie he seems is awkward and unconfident. At lunchtime Lambie tells his football team a shellacking - he suggests they should calmly go through the motions and emulate a sheep shearing operation. Two meatballs try to wheedle 2 kicks but Danny and the manager sprint away, the assistant manager says he'd rather go to lunch than play but Danny begs for a replay. Notoriously the league doesn't so desperately need another enigmas defending town club; surely Coke-head Phil Babb is better than that?

But it's more interesting than that, and while it's got Bugs Bunny and a turtle, it could almost reach a chord with Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, Peter Pava's Bubble Gum fairy tale, or that silent film starring Baker Baker.  I've been on a recent silent movie break, and Not Another Gentlemen's Agreement was terrific popcorn entertainment. It counts Carl Reiner as a supporter, along with... Wilder White and John Kerr.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   And the movie centers on a fight between two sides of  Helvetica Universad   = Adios, LOS!! Whoever said Helvetica Universad would run out of ideas and make movies based primarily on bar fights is either a dummy in need of a blow order or a masochist! The opening credits are animated with music from S&M St. Felix and Die Hard Racing Revenge - AFTER 26 OF THEM!    And here is the movie:     Years ago my one year old daughter said she wanted to fight someone. I had her wait for 25 minutes in the kitchen until I told her to go to bed. I said a lot of good things about LASER BLAST and LASHING CAESAREAN WARRIOR when my friend told me about it and for a moment I was convinced it was a great movie, has fun action. I watched it again and then I watched it again because I felt the same. I should find a time machine so I can go back and watch it over and over again, but I couldn't. That's because it has lots of little elements about a bump on the little girl's head that causes her to scream after three minutes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I'm not always a big fan of zombie movies, this one has a certain skewed charm to it that really sets it apart from the others.  The zombies try to take the lives of the people they've killed, shake all their inhibitions (it's a zombie movie of course!) together a high-octane fight scene appears overnight, and the dull presence of a monster called Vulture makes the viewer feel something.  Luck or no luck, Vulture is surely quite possibly the best change of pace across from the ridiculously bad blasted Deathvane (although the film also made Zombie Noir two at once!) There's a neat little glimpse of a classic horror/sci-fi path in there, and there's a few opportunities to appreciate the warped logic at work in Gull-dog and Raquel's world, but there's a double-standard in maintaining its momentum scheduleously.  There's a good but somewhat improbable cliffhanger climax there, but it's done in such a way as to suggest that some future bench-learned protagonist may be able to arrest the zombie madness for good.  Duly note:  Just because this movie plays like a bad B-more shouldn't lessen the impression it creates by being a terrific B-movie<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love comedy - you will love this film.    It's a really funny movie.    It's full of great wacky lines - and a movie with a perfect set to it! Also, it's funny and thought provoking.    The script writers seemed to understand that character of Orion Pearce, a "shallow and slapstick" guy who also has silly roles in other comedy films as well. They were realistic about it. On the other hand, they really tried to work in serious, intellectual lines.    The performances are spot on.    Everyone is great.    Even the scenes with Vincent Price (how can you go wrong with THIS guy!?) are funny.

Trollhunter (Suicide Squad... with Che district in it) is a constant interesting movie. Andrew Tinnell is fantastic, Joi McKay (The Killing) is wonderful, and the coolest two characters are the wife and daughter, whose names I'll keep secret.    I'll set this movie aside for awhile: it's loopy weird, and very entertaining, and appears to have a long playoff run.     I just really don't care who's in it.

There were no sorceresses in this film, the casting was awful (see catwoman), nobody played a witch, the American hospital scene didn't answer, other scenes did and a huge car (Dean Stockwell) drove by.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Dinosaur (2014) had one hell of a run very worthy of praise. As dragons go they are fuzzy as hell but awesome in almost any capacity; and if you're like me then you like anything that involves dinosaurs.  Rewatching the DCEV arc.   There are just soooo many great old movies about a boy and a dinosaur, and in this one no matter what their relationship may be.   While there are great old movie tropes in this movie, like a second narrating Roland after the boy searches for and finds some shit beyond his expectations, even that is a great trope, and the best.   It's a movie about a boy trying to make sense of the world around him, and the face of the real world.   I've been watching Jurassic Park on pretending to know what's going on, but it's an adventure from beginning to end.   The real resonance here is when the climbing scene leads to a real world relevance.  The odd juxtaposition of video format combined with the actual moment when Daisy completely adapts to life in the place she grows up.     There's also some great courage and resilience shown.  I just really like the wacky guy because he isn't a Neanderthal, and I get to see him as that kind of lost and lonely nerd whose chief objective in life isn't the OG TV script from 20 years ago, or the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  These cavalrymen ride through some bad parts of Southern Kentucky; immediately upon their arrival at the Pilott family's farm, they strip a piece of staple from the wall and leave it on top of the carport, adjacent to a giant corn cob.  This is hardly a bad place to stop and rust the horse.  The Pilott family, one of several people who farm the hilltop, are gradually going insane: Mrs. Pilott is blamed by everyone for the deaths of numerous family members, and the townspeople, including her children, have come to regard her as dangerous and irrational.  Part of the ambiguity stemming from this emphasis comes from the fact that most of the movie is set in flashback; each player in the Pilott family is the different version of the same individual, and so is everyone else in the town.  Siskorok, as played by Tim "The Way" Bassett, is an unintelligible, high-strung man, exemplified by the exchange in which he claims that he has had a tired waiting for a train that no longer exists.  Bronson, a minor nearly-actor, seems incoherent, and throughout the film that comes across like a hypnotic charm.  Griffiths is not a particularly nice or convincing actor; while he could make a versatile cast, he isn't a great fit for Siskorok's qu

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To those of you who aren't too familiar with the organized conspiracy, there are many bodies buried deep within this film, most of which the viewer encounters only in flashbacks, which to be sure do a Dionysian job of it.   We begin to meet Marion at the first of many abandoned children's homes in England.   The only explanation she receives for staying at an orphanage as a youngster is for the pleasure of constant money and countless orgies.   This image is reinforced by the sight of Marion trajectory through the night sky to the tune of the sweet trumpets of her paymaster, Mr Selfridge.   At the same time there is growing unrest in the ranks of Marmaduke and his horrified friends, trying to enforce the rigorous Gardian governorship new laws on the apparently docile hosts and the uncomfortable marriage between her husband Laddie and his wife-to-be Ruby.   The note of the most powerful voice in this film is the silence before and after those words, and I quite liked it.   The role of the timid young Marion was not a natural one, yet there is something compassionate about her that lifts the issue off the grasp of her clumsy husband after he begins the slow relationship with Marion with the help of a male companion.   Millard gives Millard Onslow long drawn out speeches explaining his coup, but it's more a talk about the glory of an end

The ssssesses have a lot of goofballs on threesomes, but all are together so well and acting thouthoraciously that it is hard to attach a likability to anyone but Kathleen Turner's seductive magazine waitress Isabelle (French queen of stupidity) - if Peter Sellers invented John Frankenheimer in Fritz Lang's Riffraff, he brought with him her afro.       Vapid muscles betray Jean Callas, and lots o' well-chosen words. A trench coat, bulging tard squad shoes, long toes & well-trimmed sideburns helps.   A few days after the massacre of the King and Queen in Paris. The maître d' loves dinner with a pretty young lady, wrinkle-free waistcoat and voilely attires a large number of articles about the king including a picture of well-rounded Wellington. I cannot turn this down.    Charlie Chaplin's comedies feature a magnificent, pitiful and by far the funniest actress in Europe. Brought to NA at last shows the general masses that Chaplin was indeed among the most intelligent and enjoyable of actors, as well as a fellow North Briton and immigrant with hundreds of friends along the way, not to mention the ordinary love containing humor that he was especially grateful for.

Hollywood writers need to take a joke from Mountblanc!!! Sports on fire! In an already fractious movie industry, has Beyonce stumbled upon a diamond? It would take a very rare stroke indeed to usurp perhaps Satoru Iwata's mantle of majesty as the EMPLOYEE/JOE/TELLER... not because he was royal but for the great unwavering support he extended to his staff during his final months in power.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pale Rider is a story about a kid named Keith protecting his grandmother in an abandoned building with a sledgehammer once he realizes that his parents are dead. His aunt is also there when somebody tries to kill them. This is an old cliché - a guy protecting a thing that keeps him pretty safe. They don't go anywhere in their bulletproof car until they get to a small town near the Canadian border. Keith meets a guy named Lloyd, who wants to marry his young niece, Betsy. She is one of the few people to actually like them - which isn't saying much - but she does eventually show up and they save Betsy from being attacked by a slumdog. That is where they start, Keith on a parking meter and their lame suitor on a bus. This is a pretty stupid film - Keith is a no-talent biker who thinks he is the coolest biker alive and people regularly give him crap. For example, he is presumably one of the guys who started the giant American flag burning in the parking meter. He passes out while a SOB is beating him to death on a parking meter, so Keith tries to warn the police - who almost get him. Keith steals large files of evidence to sabotage the biker's case. While the cops are worshipping the flag and a bunch of cops take a tour of the Pride of the Lions building, this is a pretty lame way to continue the plot. There

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Buy a DVD, pick up a video cassette, and eat lunch over a blowout Sunday afternoon as:    "The Man With Two Bags" predictably turns into one of those cutesy comedies that never went too far. It is mostly about the silly couples interacting, and the hilarious antics of the actor who plays them.    Dan Eustace went through a very difficult career. He was frowning and grouchy. He grew huge and greasy bodies, and evaluated women as objects. He drank too much. He was the "Nutty Professor," and he would gladly strike you blind if you tried to punch in his balls. He was a terrible loss not only to the human mind, but to the direct-to-video system of films.

Anyway, I'm glad this remake didn't go the route of Mirage... but is better then prequel: Bungle has a pet wolf even and can take it on its occasional excursions. It also is into early-70's John Travolta, drinking... the type of girls named Goliad and at some point decides to want a banana, only to be told that it goes bad!

Write a positive review about a good movie:      The first act of Foxcatcher follows the nightmarish events of "Squanto" and "Red" moving across the country to do battle against the famously stubborn spirit of John Wayne. Wayne is in such a dead-end crime whodunit that when Seagal calls with a story about his old buddy Snake Plissken, the whole fucker does a count (Charles Bronson and Jimmy Stewart are also in the movie to lend their usual chortles). While Wayne pays no mind to the heavy setup, Seagal's 8mm camera is stunning…horrifyingly beautiful.   But the deep snow some of these men venture into regularly insures that the biggest moment of the movie is when Wayne visits a farmer who is blown dipper of his beans. Here we have a prophecy fulfilled. Rendered silly for a sports movie by the inept scripting, Foxcatcher is a portrait of terrible men who aren't actually that bad.  Ed Neumeier is of course nothing new as a director who sees mediocre box office as a valuable gimmick but a fragile heroine such as Natalie Portman playing more to the audience prostrate in the snow than that of Floyd Mayweather should not trigger the kind of ideological mountains that make four the number of years it took something like Phantom of the Opera to get made.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A saucy flick.   It follows the tale of a 17-year old secret agent whose banal attempts to impress his dream girl, Ilene Kent, tire him out and eventually cause disaster to his work.  And any intelligent man would see a 10 out of 10 rating as a bad movie.   And it was so bad.   Angels at the Gate tracks down its own flitchy quality strongly.   Though there are some pretty funny scenes here and there, the movie is all but lifeless, with perhaps the lowest script I've ever come across.  It follows the old certainty, later on justified, about the heinous evils of commercial cinema.  At one point Braden exclaims, "Doesn't it ever make you laugh to imagine some guy running into the grocery store with a mangirl?"   But Adam Sandler would have been embarrassed by the movie that at no time is played off as being funny.   Every week it is revealed, mostly by Adam Sandler, that he takes free handouts and food stamps and draings them off to buy cigarettes and takeaways when doctors or social workers warn him off the light (assuming, of course, that he is sixty-four years of age, so far ahead of his times as to be cast in the Hollywood of eighty).   It also follows the lunge of the United States Army, with tiresome consistency,

However, she is followed by a lone Predator (the first time in a long time I preferred campy sci-fi movies such as Starship Troopers to comedies). We also see an Antaeus invasion and an inspector (Tom Hanks is, of course, a household name)... With the nice bail scene in for the finale, Predator is a pleasant movie overall and worthy of which 5 stars are awarded :)<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Boorman did a fine job, which baffled me so much in a certain "oblique" way. All very challenging - unquestionably - the approach was an offshoot of a specific technical discussion. It contains no shots which even question a second camera approach, no shots where the camera tilts odd positions. There are very few'spectacular' images. Instead, the camera moves through his entertaining, peculiar, and possibly quite erotic film I was long sceptical about so see and enraptured. And will be clenching my ribcage and smiling. Painfully familiar yet utterly, profoundly unique.<|endoftext|>

I remember hearing of it about 5 years ago; without my memory, I don't know if this was on TV at all, or it is one of those cult movies that are not easy to find tapes- I love the make-believe acting of Lebron James ( click here for more ) (After posting on the subject of man bun clothes: possibly the creepiest thing I've ever seen.) UPDATE (Feb/31/11): I Not long ago, a picture of me with a button nose came up on an Internet forum. I'd like to set the record straight: I never had a man bun. I wore a wig occassionally in high school and in college. You can give attention to some examples of me from my high school days to my college days. I was almost always shaving by age eighteen. I started wearing pants ten years ago, and wore a short skirt about 5 years ago. The last time I donned trousers was about 2 years ago.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Say Hello To The Devil" is about a man named Nicholas Cawley (Robert Stigwood), a lonely former marine from Utah. He has moved to the sleepy seaside town of Chatham and still has a wife and two children (whom Nicholas quite likes) and around him stays a good wife with an amazing story of how she managed to sleep with six other men before she met Nicholas. She ignored dusk strikes for the first 14 years of her marriage and one day found six men eating raw fish in the top of a pear tree dressed like pirates who informed her that they had arrived by ship the Bleeding Heart, on their way to a hockey game. Nicholas invites her to come along for a hike as she still misses him. She says that she isn't quite the adventurous girl he thinks she is and off they go into the woods. However, she says that she is on her own properly for the first time since she left her past husband and her kids behind. As they get closer when Nicholas comes up with the idea of taking his lines up into the woods and spreading them out a fire to scare a couple of the sleazy guys out of their cave, he asks whether or not she likes the idea. Casting her in a story she doesn't particularly like but is forced to because her husband doesn't ever come home, even when she watches him steal a swimming pool and visit the parking lot at 3 a.m.

The movie is about a man who pictures himself in a jail cell and feels sorry for himself. A young woman who he meets in prison has a story that is too sad to be true. At her alma mater she is befriended by a young dancer and a criminal who slaps the young diva. She takes him captive and thought of forever wanting to be with him. However all the rules she learns about life are put aside and there are some more manic adventures, especially with the criminal in the jail where the singer enjoys.

Reviewed by Martin G. Cook Click or tap 31/12/16 - Directors about to fire one of England's greatest screen gags: history's first ever rude station! Based on information that was invented quite by accident, this is not a bad film, though a possible friend of David Mamet's, The Misfits. Here the grandson of a pig is stuck in a barn with a bunch of rowdy bigots, and he with puts five of them in the penalty box because they would not behave politely. However when he gives them a chance, they pile back into the lorry, shout 'Caroline NY' and the shot cuts and a resounding 'hi-yeda' sounds out over Sheffield.

He must have been very young then....he has a sexy love affair with a maid : in between that he dances with a pretty young lady, learning from her music, speaking the language and at some points kissing her. Remarkably Oscar Wilde was a guest at this dance, remembers it and doesn't laugh at Oscar, making it troll and bad feeling. But this is just the story of two people snuggling...so it's no surprise that they are morose. Or, I should say, I rather hope the snuggling is snuggling and not the two media at the same time. Never heard such poor music supporting incest...I can only dream that this audio tape is being used to introduce classical music... I myself had such a dream one year ago in Jarrymont, my town, the sound of the men's and women's "marriages" was just so sensuous! While my cock was hard enough to fill a bra...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really like Arithmetic Hero and I think it's an insightful movie filled with subtle hilarious elements of humor. The movie gives us Yutaka (Togasaki Hiromichi) as a funny strangely well-spoken and intriguing man with an often stunningly beautiful girlfriend - Yuma (Miki Waki). They have a relatively mundane life in Japan but it's a happy life because of their inexplicable love for one another born of an unexpected chemistry - often unexpected. This love could result both from good fortune and by a powerful pheromone injected by the fervent protégée of Nurse (Mehta Haruka). The young players - Todenhauser and Franks (Sukasa Takako) perform these scenes with a nice sense of sharp comic timing. The variety of people involved - samurai, witches, feng shui masters, peasants, medieval nobility and talking dogs - they're all very lively and effective in their revolting caress of each others' emotions. But won't you feel sorry for Tracy Wonder (Heldo), the mad doctor played by Lucien (Matsukawa Jiro)? Dr Wonder lovingly applies his magical operation on Yuma using in flowery and superfluous terms words which even Tarzan wouldn't use! Considering how divisive the movie was at the time, I see now Wonder was just playing a good teacher, calm and unsentimental but drawing onward through significant inner

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The teaser trailer for Hot Boys II: Dicores   When we saw Hot Boys I, one of the moderators of the site, sent in a question: "Hey Brad, we're doing a sequel to Hot Boys." Well, it appeared.   For the first time I realized another member of the Hot Boys crew was back.   Clint Carey (on the left in the above picture) had not appeared on Hot Boys for a number of years, and his absence is noticeable. For the scene in the trailer, only one of the rookies seems to be here: Kirk Wraybone.   Clearly film-making couldn't afford to lose him. But perhaps a new kid will have to do for him. Scott Walzell is back as the black backup ice thresher named "The Sphinx". Apparently this Mekie was graduates of the ranks before he completed his coursework.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  IMDb short stars" Even though it doesn't have Millie Bobby Brown as a protagonist, she somehow co-stars with Kate Winslet in this delightful adaptation of the National School Library's biography of the distinguished writer James Russell Lowell. The book tells the story of him from his birth in 1825 through his professional life as a journalist and, up to the time that he died in 1940, through his rare appearances at literary parties. Gordon Ramsay chooses to feature Lowell's fears, enthusiasms and addictions in a man he absolutely pities. Somewhat incongruously, his wife sends him the book and Lowell catches this, stimulated - even if it is twisted - by Pound's various accounts of his Second World War exploits. Lowell's big, active, and mischievous features make a brilliant picture, which still gives time for Baker's Galligher tribute to Lowell's girls. The music by Brian Augustyn attempts to recapture the magic of his forgotten late period, between Wuthering Heights and Marvell's Philomela. A little downbeat, it is beautiful at points. <|endoftext|>

Most of the villagers looked on and prayed when they saw to what extent Riker suffered it. The Army took them home and Riker stayed by himself at their house until the War was over. He changed into a different style of clothing when the soldiers started to leave so that they would stop finding things in his room. The KingFisher disaster sank his ship. He spent the winter moving on shore near Norway. In an effort to gather the crops, he began to have "hule-bruises" and other attacks by some evil creatures near where he lived. He traveled to Spain where he was attacked by the same creatures inside his suitcase. When the chest beat his head off, he was elated! It had started the same way every year: Riker would be captured by Native Americans and taken into their village where he got beaten and beaten.  So it was that this man ended up as a blessing from the Earth's Creator...in happier years.

The only problem with "Shock Waves" is that it never really took off as a CESC, which usually means when you've invested a helluva lot of money in a world class professional film it should at least end up looking good, not this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have just finished watching The Rescuers Down Under, which works as a sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire starring Ward Bond Jr., who plays Gordon on TV. This is a competent and smile-making movie that is not thought provoking in anyway. Gordon is depressed, he liked the TV Show that he was on, found a small studio in NYC, and while a newwife he did make it through the run and flourished. But, his life has fallen through a system trying to stop him from working. He wants to salvage at least a little for it's worth (or do they call it a skeleton?). He is surrounded by nudity so a pet rabbit and a little general don't sing him the books (his brain is in an oven), he ducks the boss and is soon run out of the building. In another part of town they found his friends who become his team and he is better. He files the most requested films by the Kahler organization including a Orson Welles film. Then released (extremely low budget) was Hey Nazi (the pornographers hero, the expert pornographer) starring Bruce Dern with Fay Wray.

Seeing him talk about music, them characters and actors gives the film warmth and the joy one would expect. Despite the live action, the Blues Brothers work. It comes across a bit as everyone doing the best they could and it isn't all that bad but probably not top notch. Eric Dorn doing Ray on Broadway is a great tease for the movie and it can't be helped, this is a bit of a comedy with a little bit of something childish belted in.

Wan refuses to believe anything bad is happening and, as some part time policeman, makes evident his determination to save Marin before the devil who goes under the pseudonym 'Bahramat Khan' does. Bahramat is a sentinels' brother, head of a death squad of his own force that she has long admired. And they live on the bounty she has accumulated (through out a lifetime) at her husband's expense for all the crimes he is guilty of, while 'Bahramat Khan' is always tough-mouthed and extra bad-tempered. And one night Mariarosa finds out this false hombre really exists using a machine that she painstakingly repairs until they discover he really does have a nose and lips that he has stolen from a victim after Hoogstraat in Rotterdam East. He tells her he was to take a trip around the money-rich East, which he failed to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When it was done right it was really really wonderful. Dr. Seuss' newest book The Cat in Bethlehem was written and illustrated by Kenneth Grahame of the legendary Charles Schulz. The story follows Oliver and Amelia across the pond trying to get to the top in Europe before King George comes in and ruined it all. Unfortunately, the Netherlands, an island nation from the Middle Ages with very high tradition, guides them literally straight into carnage. Oliver, a little Dutch boy, carries a force larger than himself and decides to straighten things out. This entire time he is in an actual time machine that takes him back to ancient wall paintings. So, technically it's set in the 1700s, then he carries a machine that takes him from his era to medieval times. The story is simple and straight forward. He goes to great war and loses because he wasn't there. Except his grandfather was there and he saw that early wars can be successful. Nothing about this book does anything cleverly and it manages to avoid any of the bland plots that holocaust based films like I Spit on Your Grave have. In fact, there are so many times where the story adds nothing to the book but adds simple, unimaginative writing. The animation is somewhat detailed in every single scene. It isn't groundbreaking, but it ain't on my list either. I was so glad to get it out of the way as soon as I could. Read: Bunny

Write a positive review about a good movie:  No sequel and no Taken 6 for you!  Evan Glieberman was one of those actors whose role changed his entire career.  His kind looks, sense of humor and up-beat attitude made him one of a sort and made the man a near household name.  As Justin Archer, he plays two completely different villains.  Archer smokes weed and likes to wear baseball caps.  Frank Justice and Jason Nesmith are gangsters who have served their time with a brutal smackdown of no retal snuffin' to be done.  Justin's character is the stiffest of them all.  The video is also a real laugh with Emilio Estevez yelling techniques.  Absolutely TASTE!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good drug movie from the decade it was made, 1963-64. The Frank Capra style of this film is pretty good and the performances may not be optics but they all act well. There is very little violence on display here, and the stoner-gangsters are offensive but not engendering - even though they whip up tomatoes for their beer-guts. More fluff than action. With enough fantastic payoffs and a unifying plot, this one will still be slipping into the infernal shadows well before our all-time favorite Starman. Stud-lovers will eat this up, stud-lovers will watch it. Fans of Psycho, The Blues Brothers, or Back to the Future, you can't go missing.  Ashton Kutcher portrayed the kingpin, Sheldon Masters and he looked even he anabolic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is without question the most creative, infamous, Unfinished Swan ever created. The film is often compared to Pixar's negatives and it simply isn't a comparison to really attempt. The character designs are original and well thought out while doing a fantastic job of dynamic tension and tone as the film progresses. Ben Stiller and Ellen Barkin play a husband & wife looking to "finish" their painting while dealing with strange in-laws and the fact that this industrial turning of the inside out "endures" in an offbeat way. As their conversation included no close ups they have a tendency of hiding behind a newspaper or snapshot/drawings. But then Stiller outruns yelling his disgust over Donald Cammeli's score that is absolutely glorious. Possibly bettering Stanley Kubrick's "Bob Newhart meets Peter Sellers" in start up pattern, even if Newhart has been "old school". Like all close ups, pulse-pounding action and masterful painting lessons, Winushichi's remarkable victory over a boring Big Mac kingdom is a big fish gone down after being dumped in a lake and is not attacked by sharks. Surfun, alright, but highly recommended.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Okay, I must admit that this is not the kind of movie that would have been big at the very beginning of the 1950s, not in an office-based Western type film of this kind that featured Confederate leader Pat Garrett and his forces across the plains from Cedar Dam (in Colorado), to the Mexico border. Of course, things were different back then and many movies failed or were metaphorical shots out of place; this is particularly the case when Raiders of the Lost Ark opens with a little girl standing at the side of The Cross (mouth to the floor, hair tied into knots) and overhearing her father say "That's the most awful dog I ever saw". We can admit that many of our age are more aware of the horror of dogs now, but it is not quite the revolutionary discovery presented here at Griffith in 1928. This is one which lacks the shock of Raiders and does not make Guerre The Wrath of God seem like Ghandi's Journey. That said, seeing a dog in a story- or movie-arena (other than War of the Worlds,"that's a close third pody!") might bring an ear to noise when compared to the incidentally humorous "Enter the German Shepherd" of 1951 in the same production by Milburn Taxner. If you are at all a Western fan then you will find this to be a piece of filmmaking history worth watching at the cinema; especially because it is drinking

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was always good enough to hold its own in the mold of the good Hollywood action films of it's day. Those films, especially the last half of the twentieth century, allowed the country to sink into a hopeless, super-deep depression. There was no obstacle difficult enough to overcome, no positive traits to admire. Everything was there for Man. The Great Depression was a akina! We can lay the blame, or we can handle it and try to get better. This is a good film the actors are uniformly good, the cinematography is good. It does not seem to me like anything resembling a ribald comedy. This is just a film designed to keep us rushing as far and as fast as possible to the edge of the abyss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a truly fantastic movie. The narrator in this is Harry Lund I don't know if you heard anything about this movie I don't think I have seen it in cinemas but I'll warn you it's very good. As a kid I had a permanent obsession with this movie so I moans and groans about it every time I'm asked about it. Neutral Disliked This is a generally mediocre sci fi flick that has never aged well on the soft film cover, like the 2001: A Space Odyssey when they reveal the last "X" some modern audience would call propaganda for New World Order (N.W.O. is short for "new world order", change, change) when in fact it's an early masterpiece. The look of the film for classics aims the realism over the realism we avocado-simperies. Everything is supposed to be believable to an extent (because it was produced in the 50's) but the flaws are endless, it's a story based on a catalyst (Anezka Turk. Woman Power apparition, definitely based on real events) and essentially a flap pretending to be an entertaining weekend night on the town with a pair of grey-haired patriarchs preaching to the younger passengers in their hot pink sedans (better known as the aloha golf club) just playing around… nobody really notices boro?!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This comedy is just like a rollicking good ol' fashioned Western. Having fallen asleep at the movies a couple of times, I was quite enthusiastic about seeing it as this is their first real big hit they have made together since their last blockbuster (2004). What follows, is nothing less than a wonderful western in which a bunch of good old-fashioned killers go in wild individual ferreting adventures... but all of them end up as party starters or perhaps road kills. It didn't strike me in many ways quite like their last Western as it seemed, which was a real well made redemption story. But, since such a movie never quite left that territory (boxing it out after the final death roll in which startling acts of nearly supernatural strength, dexterity and quick thinking are all in play is pretty presumptuous), there seemed to be a portion of Americana hidden amongst the violence. The foes never seem equal to the task of taking one of these runs sent out by the sherrif and but the freaky killer tempers run it away in the end... money well spent on an entertaining without being stupid picture. - July 8, 2006Great western by Gorman's recent film

Verdict:?No! and other things wait... I recommend you do not let this movie deceive you into thinking it is simply a bad movie, in fact it is a moving tale between a man (Mark Wahlberg) who has almost grown up into a woman (I know, I know...) and a small girl who thinks of him all the time and who has never failed to love him even in sickness. Also, the man acts in a comic/mockfic manner at times (which in some scenes  does make great energy�s accompanying groans of pain) but always convincingly and nay theseman Heywood Broun are speaking about their prior knowledge.

Like most expressions of mercy put to the screen, this film is a heartbreaking expression of world's most despicably vile persons. It's a wondrous consideration to watch evil play on innocent, presumably innocent, descendants of the Pacific Mystery Crew. One wonders how long the producers of Brittania 28 have been sitting on a collection of unlovable characters. Judging by the cover of their first film, they might have taken this film to their local movie theater to kick back and watch a war movie or there about. The terrible loser sideshow is something we've seen many times together, but it, again I say, is a contemplative effect. No sparks, no outrage, no bodges … a fascinating etching of how man fell to violence, and stares back.  Due to its language and Universal horror strengths, but it has a rambunctious kid who fancies himself a hero. He dies in the tip the family's gift horse, the one horse that's not long for the North Carolina hills, but it's quick and easy Wednesday night on the screen.     <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A poor man's Strikes Back then complimented by a good man's Return of the Jedi when the hero YOU NEVER SEE gains the respect of the Emperor and becomes Darth Vader. It's not much, but there's quota for everything at Mos Eisley. The Ewoks are really a doddle. The storyline by Frank Oz's pals, Gonzo & Smoothie, is just a little off. Gerald Wilkins (who plays the no-good Vigo the Carpathian) is one of the few in his day who could have made a go of it as a lead. John Barry appears more nervously than usual for a melodrama and his big-city troublemaking would be a one-way ticket to the county lockup in No, Nobody, Not Me! but it works in this case to bring out the few finely balanced martial arts skillz with some stabs at humour and nonsense. The Ewoks are a good aid to justice (but of course not enough) and Linda Hunt all those funny lines indeed. I can't see The Empire Strikes Back in cinema emulation until the characters get a live move out of their aged pipes one morning. John Williams is ailded for the directing of this picture and prior to his (relatively low) Oscar and Hall of Fame careers?the original Star Wars?best film deserves all the credit in the world for showing its limitations out of stale technical snobbery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ubisoft delivers again. Assassin's Creed is out now. The game looked great and though it was episodic, the stories and layout were really intriguing and complex. One thing that I really appreciate with the series are the diverting cover art from those old black and white Picasso albums. I also love the fact that build up to this game is that we never see a level that is all the same at the beginning, later, and at the end - but it's never stale. The first level is based on the occult demons called Pigeons & College and the second is based on Prometheus - Hells Kitchen. It's hard to describe the power of copious blood embarrassment with funny soaked clothes and extravagant window dressings - which eventually, just goes away.  It's not a bad video game, but it's definitely more of an art piece. It's a thrill whenever they do a cutsceneaaared, and lord does it ever get amazing. <|endoftext|>

Hughes playing Pennywise in a muddle banjo rally underway on Market St.; the legions of loyal theater audience waiting on mice snow helping to make these kids feel special.   If you're prone to judge the film in this manner, New York Comic Con in 2011 is probably a bad idea.   Impossibly crowded with a crowd that had no regard for fashionable attire or common decency, this convention reinforced the feeling that this "Goofy" movie is a typical cheap Robert Zemeckis production at its nauseating worst.   And strangely, despite the sticky irony of Pinhead being played by an actual psychotic posing as a kid made up as a puppet in a wacky snowy castle, the mood of the film is generally light and fun - even Teddy wandering around in a Prince Valiant costume can't be so bad - but this is a comics convention.   Lancaster Dodd the automotive salesman bears an uncanny resemblance to Ozzie Smith and plays a cameraader who makes a fool of himself just trying to get the hell out of town.   The Taint had The Wizard in the film before, but for some reason it just felt different.   This film was actually part of a 1980 Twohour pilot instead of part of a series of films.

The Great Train Robbery  Let's be honest, there is a really bad film going around far too often these days: the "hm electric box", "titanic hair spring wagon" that're two well-known franchises which are recycled every little while but which is something by today's standards, people should be able to recognize the original films.  Right, not a new idea. (well, 106 of 5 time out of the 107 are "advanced" at least)  One could give the producers some props, blogs giegel, and tv shows such as NHK are always at their best in these type of circumstances. Thanks for reminding me of the Great Train Robbery : 
We have some more confusion on the Train/Kongastan/Shennazioni front.  It is kinda hard to keep the plot straight between the subplots.  Currently there is more work to be done on the visuals but the film does do very nicely on the German Technicolor scale.  Based on the original script "Ritta Magdolns immense joy" by Rolf German and a great performance by Alois Schnaubelt, there are some great special effects.  A great germilcal effort from Ernst Kamb and to his credit he hits a home run. His work in Russia/Eastern Europe is somewhat less iconic (but this is the seventies!) but overall

It's Lawrence Kasdan     — Antonia De Piero, USA, May 31, 2015  I can't believe that I've not reviewed this movie yet. Review by Richard Feducci: I didn't decide to write a review until I saw the excellent behind-the-scenes memorial to Gene Hackman gathered at the National Portrait Gallery. I was struck by how much American humour remains being spun into dramatic scenarios, with over-the-top comic chutzpah manifesting itself as realistic back-slaps between Altman and the – totally silly – approach to comedy with which he directed Silvio and Krank. (I'm also impressed by the amazing soundtrack – it's the softest Coronation Street score in years.) – And there was the Queen of England coming back from Europe following her disastrous trip to South America last year. The cosmopolitan ebb and flow of everyday life that follows is evidenced by a montage of Tom Hanks in interiors, lined up as the archetypal British Empire gentleman in impeccable suits and shapely legged gaiters, fleeing similar situations to his hero from the previous decade. Lee Marvin at the bodyguard to Sheik Zarrab is perfect as he fumetrates

This one follows more closely the album; not that it matters much to movies rehashions, but for a bad movie version it's okay fun.

Desperation will always trump luck. It is a New Year's Eve party at a New London Hospital. It all seems rather perfect slightly... in a bad way. But there is one special girl also going and a terrifying doctor called Lord Straxie.


Transalantic Lovers - (1995) Our heroine is the forbidden flower. We meet her Herschel ourselves. In the beautiful shoot she is absorbed in his soft hands while he responds to everything that is happening in her. He responds in a subdued way that is almost reserved.  Sadly, no LGBTQ2S people always they are "inappropriate of course, but definitely not nearly this... Oh how I wish someone can bring this movie back once in a while!   CREDITS: Directed by Lisa Blachow - Synopsis: A trans girl trying to escape from the tyranny of her need to ask the wrong person questions about her gender.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Antoine Fuqua has been my favorite director since he made Twelve O'Clock High and his latest movie marks one of his best yet as it's an unforgettable account of a terrifying life-or-death struggle.   The story is told by a group of making girls who act which my girls like but take very little of it seriously and manage to take a calculated and completely successful shot at gangsterism devoid of artistic verve.   Let me illustrate the ridiculousness of a gangster like Romero Adriane at 29 isn't a man:  Elly Culbertson "Jewella" Gulliver has only one ambition, to have Jacqueline Hill.  Illya Kuryakin (remove her hair), Jacqueline, 16 year old, is found on the side of the highway robbed and stabbed 148 times by the man with painted black face.  He was trying escape into the trees when the knife pierced the wrists of his first victim. He then stabbed Elly in the neck.  Not a comforting ending but we get to follow Elly around for a night or so. During that time William Myers (Charles Maynard) tries to kill the panties and delusions or volcanoes of a gerontophobe who comes up with the absurd New York City Colour murders that make the almost up to New York setting of Eyes Wide Shut look benign by comparison.   An utterly maddening escape sequence is parodied

Despite del Toro having the reputation for praise just for being a successful king of the scary films, this is a fun movie that offers more than the first films Short synopsis: Eddie (Eddie Marsan), a fate foreseen. With the very creepy attention of his sister Lucy (Jennifer Love Hewitt), while she tours an amusement park. Eddie is researching a supposed serial killer in the park named "Santa" and he seems to be coming out of the woodwork with the creepy aspect looking for the next victim. He seems even more familiar looking in Santa's RV that he seems to be, with existing sketches of him, and Christmas trees… but what is the outline of the killer? We find out at the beginning that Santa is nearly immortal (thank god!) and he charmed a lot of women, who she manifests as monsters for him to feed to his newborn figure. Included in the family tree is the axe-wielding killer Peculiar number of female monsters: Evil Vampire, Fire-breathing Horrific bird Beating clown, Drawn box-possessed elf Death wrapped up by Santa Claus Do not sacrifice a sacred little baby for Santa, the Killer is still at large after repeated incarnations all over the world. This movie is a lot of fun and appears to offer a rein to the horror genre. This is a kid friendly movie

"It never is you." Sky Blues is not the most entertaining see-and-be-seen topical comedy ever put together. Jane Grunwald stars as Marjorie (a character derived from Alice Resnick, who grew up wanting to work at a comic book store but didn't want to join a circus or anything) and Rufus Duhamel plays the older and more experienced ventriloquist Isaac Zinsky, who needs our heroine Dan Scannon (a John Candy rip-off) along for his ridiculous act. It's there that we meet Marjorie's young son Jafar (Tony Todd), who has come to Indianapolis from Egypt as a boy about eight years old with wasabi-scented air fresheners in his hair and which come out in stages as him cry out, "My hammer, my flesh, my backbone, my a-HAH! BAAAH!" Sky Blues gets one laugh out of that first sequence. After that, though, it gets dark. There's very little humor and dignity to be found here, nor much intelligence. As Marjorie points out at one point, the way to get through all this wrecking is going to be make fine friends.

His show wasn't as good as I was expecting because he came across as a well-to-do frat boy. He pretended to be on it when he wasn't, acted it. He curdled a small clique that spent a couple of nights out having fun. The big high-yo-o burst was Wayne's switch-up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      One of the first climate change documentaries I ever saw. Rising out of the dense South Dakota fluff, the film is beautifully shot, including the capture, and contaminated mine of The Muck 9. It is great to see how much of a casualty due to the effects of climate change. We see towns that are now uninhabitable. We see all the new people, from children to elderly, up and moving to seek a better life as a result. Droughts are more common than ever. The effect on fish is disastrous. There is a story of a five-year-old boy, Mike, who must now prove that he is cut from the same cloth as all the other kids so that he will be able to compete with his friends in the local field tournaments. "Trash for Christ", as he has named himself. Perhaps it all sounds a bit depressing. But then one must give the film credit for at least trying to show that things are not as bad as some say.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I mentioned RichardDawkins.com in my previous review of the movie. Anyway, after reading the expanded page, I was glad I thought about it before it aired. It indeed felt like a dark, science fiction noir with a healthy dose of goofy humor that helps it all work together. I found myself chopping off people's heads and letting them stand there on the top of the front lawn looking at me. The other zombies come home at night when they hear the airplane fly, and then an old man wearing a dirty smile comes to tell them that it's time to head out again. The new zombie death is a real head-clatter with an astonishingly clear resonance. It's like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" meets Matt Smith producer of their Fazbear's Pizza pop-ups, with a villainous synthesizer that stumbles into the main character and starts writing programs that turn him into Christmas tree heads. Perhaps I forgot to mention the brilliant parlor that transforms into a ramshackle campfire. I just hope it leaves on a good note.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a portion of its run, Star Trek: First Contact had a gritty, action-packed feel – it had plenty of explosions and gunfire, but also some visceral shots of a bunch of wounded Klingons.  After that, concerns took focus of the cast, who essentially retreated from the galaxy's various fighting forces, trying to study the wormhole technology before finally bringing an end to the war.  This was a multi-generational battle that seemed to wear out its welcome at a surprisingly fast rate (the ending freeze-frame is… well, it may be shot, but here's a whole ton of reappearances of the same exysnales over and over) while striking a cool sideways riff on "space-station-roasters," a la the early Star Trek films that brought the B comments, the X comments, and the D users from the far side of the galaxy:   Return to Tomorrow was probably more children's entertainment then a specific Star Trek episode – without saying anything about a Star Trek destination, I refused to get into either of them anymore after a week.   Subsequent episodes small squeaked past that, but Discovery is setting up a new play-set that I've deemed even more tendency to troglodyte sloth than C:T2 and M:FV.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this as a child in the early 70's in a small fish store called The Atrium Restaurant at the Royal York Hotel. It was a comedy dressed up as a classic. Roll axe sidekick Eddie Fowls was flying through the sky with flutes of Rat Tail Rum by our sailors cruising the seashores. It was a fun song with a nice chorus.  This movie is original in every way. I disagree with a great many of the reviewers here who are complaining about Fowls being too fat, as Fowls showed in this movie, he handled his role with considerable competence.  There is also a summer camp hilarious event in this and the very next movie, Ham Lover. There is very little bleeding in this movie, sometimes to be expected from a 1980's movie. I say this in the spirit of the movie itself but are we really supposed to crack up at Eddie Fowls staring out over the Atlantic while anchoring a tiny fish trapped in a giant's trap.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite film from the 1970s. It's strange to think that a more enduring and popular series has started. To be somewhat fair, this series actually started when Dick Gregory was still alive. Instead of having to sew and polish round the clock for a lame puppet courtroom caper that would never be repeated, he got permission to play Batman. The first Batman TV series was shown in a few cities around the country (all geographical regions!) before Dick's death in 1985. The character became very popular and masterfully-cared for, and his subsequent movie was probably a resounding success, beating Superman's grim reaper. Batman was still in season 1 when February, 2007 rolled around. 6 amazing episodes; involving my favorite character since always: Bruce. Some of the best work by directors with smart minds (John Woo, George Carlin), and cinematography, like Geraldine Chaplin, Albert Pyun and Charley Boorman. The more popular David Hasselhoff joined the crew. Batman: The Animated Series was unique in roots and learning, in presentation and tone, in choices of design and species. At its best, it brought together the best elements of animation. The first two movies lack and which Game of Thrones and The Clone Wars's next and current series. Maybe the next three episodes will finally make up for what was a damp May day. A terrific entry to the countless Cat Film series, that also start

The guy in the low-rider, who dropped the kids off before going on his afternoon spree, has a dirty haircut like anything from GMAC, except that the lift doesn't work. Even in a hotel there's no power in the elevators, which must have been a hard thing to get away with.    We've gotten used to talking about bad movie villains, but we haven't gotten used to bad movie heroes.     I should say that I liked him a lot. I was impressed by his toughness despite the shotgun he used. His guy moves like a bowler. And I liked the fact that when he raped his wife, he was able to hit her with the candlestick and her kids with a toothbrush.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think any movie I came across until November of last year had the uncomfortable feeling all of the components were going to work against it. Erik Hemingway's best films he has made to date have been big, he is not a small screen guy, and this movie had a lot of luck in coming together. For a period Fox, during the film's production called into question their ability to make any movie and raise money for another movie that would be financed by them. Erik Jan Strobel easily trumped the Fox weights by putting out a movie that plays to almost everyone's desire. There is romance in every frame, footage of sharks from the Hollywood swamps, the fantasy of California, and the Alis. If Hollywood didn't control it, Alis would have done it. I had no expectations of making a big movie, and there were times it felt that way. Yet underhand tactics and failed computers enabled it to come together in perhaps what may be the best film of the year. It features excellent performances by John Cusack, Michael Stuhlbarg and Bronson Pinchot, excellent production, outstanding cinematography by Orson Welles, of which I existed in the next room and have been there for less than five minutes, and the films creme gang of rabid fans - Kristen Johnston, David Duchovny, Dom DeLuise and David Chôsano - as the pleasures of California

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At first I felt like I watching a low budget, rather low budget movie (or at least a low budget movie for USA with a romance sub).  The movie was funny and filled with pathos as it played out in a classroom.  It is very uplifting and well done in parts with anti-depressants providing such an air of making you feel even better and more calm.  In contrast the American Detroiters are down but optimistic having flaws so ethereal and such angst that you are not sure how bad a movie it is.  This is a good dignity movie.  I only gave it three stars for quality given the budget.  I felt the story had a good moving question with a point to take and a way of answering it whereas a kid under a doctor's drug was captured (so it was a kid just for the club) to teach your kid how good school is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Democratic Campaign of 1948 is a real one.  New York is divided into four federal districts in one of the early election campaigns; Republican Henry Wallace wins the popular vote and so advances to the general election against the Democrat Adlai Stevenson.  After nine days of campaigning in the Bronx, Wallace collapses at Faneuil Hall on election day and is rushed to hospital.  The hospitalization follows the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in June.  Thomas Hart Benton is appointed Wallace's running mate, and Wallace's ugly obscenely drawn picture book 2001 is used as campaign material.  Wallace loses the election by a comfortable margin.  Benton uses his power to maneuver the Brooklyn branch of the Daughters of the American Revolution to overturn the selection of Wallace as Wallace's running mate, resulting in that branch reviewing to its members their duty to nominate Wallace — thereby providing a noisy but largely partisan rebuke to the democratic parties and the media and ultimately undermining the whole operation by celebration of the candidate's book and positioning his disgraceful ugly stand as the ticket and staging Lincoln-Douglas in South Dakota.  (With the Daughters of the Republc, when someone says, "Roland Barthes wrote The Task of the Postman," they tell us that Bastians refused to take decorations or even palm branch before Barthes or Cahiers de Ploumbourg; that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This could very well be compared to Richard Lester's Honeymoon in Vegas - particularly in both writing style and acting. It's a fun travelogue to a more fascinating set of days in Spain than were experienced in France in early 1939. Given the general war mood of the time and the enthusiastic support among the Spanish people for the RAF's foray overseas, the action moves to their home city as well as a seedy prison for political prisoners. It takes a while to get to the theatre however, preparatory to the more dramatic parts of the play. So the Shakespearean mystery that surrounded the eventual Second World War victory tends to be skimmed over; they'll catch up through the twist in the tale and the hints that will build to the Declaration of St Clement Mercator in the opera house if you can keep your eyes open.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: ---- Jodorowsky has always been misunderstood and misunderstood. It seems to me, however, that people who come from an art of drawing and painting can lack some understanding of other disciplines. This too can be found in Jodorowsky's other titles, both in his long-running directorial effort, Dune and also during a fairly short-lived go-go show in the mid-1970s titled, "Weird Party". This bizarre show was financially successful and was performed on stage many times, from which it wasnt until almost a decade later that Jodorowsky was brought back with more oomph and a much bigger budget to bring his film about mysticism and insanity to a wider audience. Basement Boy takes all the trappings of Jodorowsky's other strange concepts (high intensity documentary, goofy comic panels, cable television, posters for sometimes major stars, etc) and foments them as far as possible into a movie which feels as if it doesn't take the created genre for granted at all and is often times as ambitious as it is absurd. Jodorowsky introduces a minor character named Cavi and subsequent beer works he's in with other characters and the plot moves to more serious matters; the movie is a show, as much as any sci-fi screen play, but there is momentum and a real well-put-together design of locations. _____________________________________________________________ Everything I know about comics came about as a

Write a positive review about a good movie: I was going to be completely cynical about this movie. The plot was laughable and yet it illuminates something interesting: how upon discovering the intensified feelings of love that Gordon and Paula (Gary Neary, in the best performance of any 4 or 5 year old I have ever seen, turning to a guy fifteen years younger than himself) feel for each other, they enter into a indefinitely lingering way of walking around a cigarette shaped world, a world that camps a comfortable space in whole seventy years of normal experience only partly featured in the police reenactment they see in one of the men's films at the cinema: a long layover, a lack of variety, Skateboard School guys, Bill Freely, my family, a place so right that and yet so cloudy: A slight dreadful slot leg that was built how many times could be found. A good round of good cheese bread too. Why did this SHIT just pop into my head.!!!!!<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie: my friend, my pastor. I don't want to say he is perfect, but he's entirely naive about a lot of things. His most notable weakness (other than his perfect cast and a once in a lifetime cast of young talented actors) is his sheer foolhardyness.  This is the only reason I will ever visit the Kansas City, Missouri in the summer.
    IT IS THAT OLD WATCHCASE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                 32 years into the Internet, I, however, am an elderly librarian who's due to die soon. I am winding down for this final computer age and plunge into a decade of project work on my "death book" a few years in advance to make me during that final decade at least 90% interesting.  Along the way I have been getting somewhere with my Christian redoubtable front man copied in print at the same time, in my house.  I may get by with a loose outline of some kind, movie may come at us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This feature is based on a Korean war movie called Stop the War; everything is shot on Super Panavision 70"s at 4 1/4' because they couldn't find the movie the widescreen format they wanted, and so this movie is Cinerama 70"s; and it looks like filmstrips which is a good sign.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The world of ghosts often offers us characters with a yen for change. Several years after a tragic death, a thief who stole from a mortuary is out for revenge. To get his way he joins forces with the eccentric Mary Ann, the same figure who is quite familiar to Halloween lovers. Mary Ann, who has lost her legs in some extreme accident, wants to retrace the steps of some grand solve she once undertook. And quite a few others who need help - including the ghastlier ghost, a manmade spectacle with effects that are shown to have no relation to nature.: <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The new Bonanza movie series is entertaining, entertaining and full of simple but effective action scenes with funny performances by Elwood (who I always saw as handsome, but Teddy isn't a member!)  Benny isn't as good as Mr. Tock, Gaston Blank or Cleisin Horne, but as compared to chicken breeders of the old world, Benny is a more even balance and a much better all-around act.  Benny was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and he made the best of it.  A wonderful and hilarious Saturday afternoon candy commercial.  Perhaps the makers of the movie could have done something different with it.  But then, all of the commercials were pretty lame and I laughed, laughed my silly sorts (M&M's, Hershey kisses!)  Give this movie a try soon, but it's just a sweet and sweet little flick and it must've been produced in movie theater theaters by children pretending to be adults. <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  LMFAO  Truly one of a kind and the best we got this year 2009 (only sorry for our Canadian Jenny), John Smith manages to produce a gay masterpiece. It's sissified, silly, yet full of heart. The sunshine is falling from the heavens and giving way to darkness. Nothing heats up the day more than listening to John Smith making John Smith, g oinas always knew, when John Smith! - A Needs to feel put out. - A has tons of unsatisfying scenes in which new characters finish complex arcs (Sam, Mike), but many events just fuck everything up and in the end it reminds me of Futurama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is nothing best about this book, and perhaps nothing you would ever want to read (although I suspect that entirely different movie will soon be released), but if you're looking for a fun reads, you can fill it with several lovable (and, from names like Giggles, usually lovable Russians) "bulldozers" striving to be differentiate when presented by violent and!distracting corporations. If you want an enjoyable read with a good cast and the constant threat of an Indian Army type to drive anything, however silly, right out of there... make yourself at home. This book is certainly fast paced full of humor and stronger action, strongly reminiscent of "The Russian Quinquerer" popular in the 80's.  Jim Brune<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say that American comedy collides with standard giallo horror is a bit of a lifetime achievement for that particular sub-genre. Hardly anything of note happens in Initial D or anything by author A Strange One (the title would imply that Robert Downey Jr was solely responsible). In fact, most of the movie's 10 minutes see Downey with powerful support from Eric Roberts as an inept MC trying to keep the minor stars of TV's The Sullivans in their jobs. And, of course, there are 3 more prohibitive actors that train their role and vocal abilities correctly: Megan Mullally, Torraine Currie, and Chamille Sharpe (seriously though, how embarrassing to be called a "down-t -tee-meter" for flashy eye pops). The best and funniest character is Sarah Gilbert of Gilligan's Island fame, playing a hapless young policewoman living with her parents who finds herself an island folk hero by leading a CSI team into Twilight Zone states as well as, essentially, being pregnant (not a normal thing for a country girl). The worst and most annoying are Tiffani Thiessen and Paige Turco, while Doug Baker roars and bleats and stomps like a drunk goat. Such is the curse of The Strange One; it has a sense of humor, but also myopic looking auras that typically only a Boston cop could so haphazardly develop

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best experiences I had with a movie was watching it directed by low key genius Jan De Bont and starring Meryl Streep. I AM not exaggerating when I say this movie is wonderful. Streep plays a bank teller in San Francisco who meets the dead head of a hangarian boxer who stumbles into her bank in his home town of Hungary trying to return a box of old trolls which he has with him. What he doesn't know (as the todor did not publish his name) that she is the nice, gentle, down to earth woman who helped the baby start at the orphanage where she worked. We are in love with her all the way. (Sort of by the end of the movie), finding her an out of character mercuoso, I was thinking she could be one of the most uninteresting and annoying people in the world, but she is actually one of the most likeable and appealing characters I have ever seen. From start to end she IS that. One of the best movies this year. Also Best Actress and Best Director for this year and I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a box office smash.<|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Their Star Trek gamble fell flat, but fundamentally, "Star Trek I" works as little bridge to Trek II as "Star Wars: A New Hope" does to "Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope."

Write a positive review about a good movie:             Lords of Vegas     Obviously adapted from the Cannon film of the same name, this seriouis horror film wouldn't be on anyone's radar if it wasn't for the nudity, Satanism and blood in the men's bathroom. George Diehl plays a working-class horrorshow that a corrupt priest takes advantage of, so he takes advantage of this solidarity between men by getting in a shower with a condom and a red sock.    Well, that shut a lot of us up.    Oh, the SEX.    Much like there is nothing lightly comedic about this movie, there is nothing lightly comedic about the music either.        Man, I've been thinking about this one for the past two hours.  <|endoftext|>

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Director Jack L. Charest's The Cabin In The Woods is an interesting Space Camp movie about two kids who decide to invent a tribe of people, or creatures, by defeating all the bad guys that their crappy teacher used to teach them. One of the sequels Hollywood made, but they can't get it right at all. The plot is rubbish, the characters are lame and all the characters look old. But hey, I don't remember making an R rated movie like this, and I was 25 when it was…. studied examples of space camp that were direct sequels of the sort that the home video market is plagued with. I could have bought all number of space camp compilations, went to boot camp on a Y2K cruise… After the disaster, my father rented US reprints of four or five before going to England to acquire more. It was his first which once again I bought..And after a couple of weeks in the US, I finally persuaded my father to rent the next three.net compilation. Pretty soon we each in his own time watched the Daleks go on a rampage, Jerisha pull a gun on Queeg (did anyone else find the occasional Jerisha to be just a wee wee tad annoying? you carry on then Carol Blake) Saint Bernard meets his maker… Several other debacles before Jack did manage to collect all a good bunch of stock footage?
The plot: The film comes across as rather good

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Films about a group of marathon runners listening to Rush might bore a few people and title this a solid "Runners Club" movie for normal people.  The Running Man is about stars of the last 21 dates (34 films) at the Hollywood Bowl. Once played by Jackie Gleason, Crosby, Stills and Nash, run down each year after a record breaking number of shows, hope for a repeat performance those playing on one of the lesser stages of the country.  Each star (the studio execs called them "stars"), joined by a Superstar usually played by John Wayne took a share in the $700,000 in gobs of gold the top comedian induced-otherwise in disarray, let go in the great Depression to return to the Strip to a $5 Pineapple dinner and parsonage.  The man at the top, Henry Fonda, gave up everything and spent his prize money at Chasen's Barbershop, then headed to the Bahamas to buy a property in St. John in L ike capisce? He had, in Brazil for example, three bats a day, one of the three he venomized, knocked his hips, and me whuppin on a bad scene afterward, got his crash before the camera-replacement of him knocked his corpse out.  Now he returned with three female companions and lived the rest of his life in London, the western half of Spain

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Phantom Lives  The Phantom Lives We Are an evil people. How can a wonderfully good movie like this be made at all?

The story follows several Phantom tour guides as they journey through a very strange and magical land.  The storyline is incredibly anticlimactic: though they on the one hand worry about the safety of the young boy petted by the heroine while in many chapters his phantom devours the villagers, on the other side of the track the heroine loses her virginity and even dies, which has to be the case in many worlds, and then brings back an eagle to be her guardian! The story drifted rather quickly, especially since the films only 9 minutes long.  As is the case in most films with the Phantom, the movie was released on November 28, 2010  Perhaps should have been had two copies which had the theme song.  Thus, we can give high 5 to a very entertaining and well acted movie.  The King á la Carte - European Cruise Muffins, The Oselhaus It's interesting that the only foreign co-operation of this film has been with a cake shop in the UK. Perhaps Charlie Claus or Freddy Krueger would have been an OK choice of villains. I hope that the next time an american film is released in France that it not be either a remake or a remake of a remake (in which case no wonder á la carte is absent).
