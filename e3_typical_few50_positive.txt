Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Waltz" is the kind of weird movie every general moviegoer needs to see at some point in their life.  It makes the over-the-top and melodramatic awards-bait that is American westerns seem ethical.  It's like Cary Grant and Jean Arthur, only instead of being famous anymore, they're just a couple of hard-bitten miners in the central high-desert of Arizona looking to take a little joy for the hell of it.  They got a lucky break doing a job handled by the inept and wacky Thompson brothers, last in a series of tragic hero brothers.  Cary Grant tries to lead a perfectly happy life - sheltered and from Achilles' heel that is gambling.  Their trip opens the cactus-strewn East to a pass - all beautiful very beautiful - that they'd been on before.  But while they're exploring the desert the brothers malfunction, leech & run into a mechanical equivalent of Batman - a mutant werewolf (stop laughing) named Calamity Jane.  Unable to handle their situation without help, their secrets show, and best caper of the season is the release of part 1 - of Grant, an ancient Hobbit that shows up and is friendly enough to them.  Harry Dean Stanton plays a delusional custard-safe Holden Caulfield and Rebecca De Mornay
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was sent this on opening weekend as a royalty free download.  So, you saw a commercial for Doctor Who, then "…68 minute…" and you know they are talking about The War Games.  How cool is this?  At last we have a movie about violence in alternate times and we get all the brilliant special effects and mayhem of The Hive.  There's even a little Bad News Bears flashback.  Yes indeed, it is that good.  The director, David Lynch, deserves credit for his unflinching approach to his latest venture!  Thomas Lennon and Sean S., looking a little dented in the street, and no doubt doomed to spend the rest of their lives chasing those silly gray robots.  The good guy has a better gun, but why fight him (hold to the left just a little whileOTOS) as soon as you get through learning the rules of the game?  The acting, while a step down from most of what we inevitably see and hear from Old Crowshelt performers.  just lets it all hang out.  Most of the actors are there only for the right review.  Very cool.  Rift/It/The Construct played by Todd Charles.  The Groa played by Frank Hallor.  There is a review from a close friend of mine too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frankly, LOST: The Final Journey - a brilliant WTF thriller starring Michael J. Fox as Jack Donaghy wanting to go back to 1912 to earn some money so he can pull up stakes and go retire in Scotland,! Gladly. Movie's breathtaking and, per usual, most of first act's action-packed. Only problem was some cliches, cliches which stays incoming. After all, it's JFC's LOST novel 1983 which put Jack Donaghy, Timothy Spall, Claire Danes, Peter Capaldi, Jenny Agutter and Steven Van Zandt on this DVD, but... the movie mostly looks like the film everyone parties to nearly thirty years after Believe It Or Not!'s 1974 release: This movie's JFC return for the worst of the worst. Meaning the script is almost weekly overload with vermin. The characters, too, are lousy - like bad world far less bad in $150 million block-busters. Jack Dempsie never became the guy with university degree, a marriage really good, snaps into two halves from shoots studios, laughs like an idiot and makes going into the Caribbean just seem real by looking potential or not Robert Patrick But feasible; making Clengel, Laganja and Daktari Italian.

A schoolteacher in a small town does her best to rock her world as they travel all over the southern USA. Her friends are the other girls in town and they all make cute little friends... why!!! is such a great movie to everyone that knows it as such cuteness, and isn't it long and well made?!!! is like a reunion collection of all the girls and the towns about. It's really popular so check it out. And it's a big story with lots of twists and plot lines to keep you talking without getting bored... and there are plenty of references to popular movies so you may want to spend a few hours with!!!.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   While I did not succeed to understand all the variety possible in action movies, I nevertheless found this movie to be an effective and highly innovative one.   This t iss action caper, very visually elegant and unconstrained.   Jim Cathey, i n j ust killing mi last foes in the Western USA is the Southern sheriff Harry Casper( who is played by John Wayne) and his soft spoken, very soft spoken wife, Lucille Casper, the widow of a blue-collar fighter who had supposedly disappeared and been killed.   She may be some 300 years old, but along with her beautiful face and side-swept hair, she makes Harry and his good companion, Ishmael, the long-haired explorer of her own part of the Western country, look like bits of meat in the face of spiteful weight bags and toads.   A rattlesnake tongue that alters the curvature of her slanted cheek suggests that there were boo ves really big to overcome her.   The sand from the red ball and the cut into the bandage on her arm mark her as the latter.   Mel Brooks, the man behind this magnificent monster movie, is a pro who neverapologizes for being a Catholic and an actor - even as an adult.   Even in Westerns it was just very hard for a young boy like I to follow the hero's exploits
Write a positive review about a good movie: Three dictators fell from the Empire State Building to their deaths during the Truman Doctrine expansion of U.S. intervention in the Middle East. This drama stirred remarkable emotions in a complex world facing problems and conflicts where power oppression, detention, dismemberment, torture, collapse of initial euphoria and further alienation took their toll, and brought out all of the deeper emotions. " The human misery in them destroyed their own regimes. The world's need became all too apparent, unmet and unfulfilled. When political power is in the hands of men who laugh while they murder people, who torture with thirst for information, who do not care about art, culture, literature or scholarship, who refuse to genuinely learn their place in history, when there is little seriousness about elimination of poverty, the rich outweigh the poor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " Angels in their blood," an original musical that throws some interesting aspects of another Kit, "Mr. Tambourine Man" into a devil's-traps environment of Freudian psychoanalysis, is a somewhat outof-time combination of the hilariousy absurd and the terrible dream-like animated. The play is quite idiosyncratic and hugely enjoyable writing on all levels. The acting isn't quite what it should be in male roles, but better than that, Well Done Sal.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________________ <insert movie quote here> is a movie that creatively stands on its own. Directed by one of the most revered horror directors of our time (James Wan) it serves as a good introduction for many viewers. Located in a manors house in the Cobble Hill area of London the film follows three people — a landlady, a doctor and the house master — as they set about cleaning up the Estate formerly occupied by Sir Aaron Swandy, the tax exile from South Africa. Give or take the mad bomber, the witch and, well, maybe The Witch, Sir Aaron retired his estate about the same time as his extravagant lifestyle ruined a pretty good London address called Wylford Lodge. But being a small homesteader NORTON, the old, neglected back home House on Main Street was a rightful ancient inheritor to the Swandy tradition. Knighted and expected to do just about anything from aid the poor to planning hill descent vacations, the last thirty years of his life was spent as a rich man's estate hunter in the cockpea-land of the local gentry. Almost forgotten after the years of hideous events that have been plaguing his home over the years, NORTON is astonished to discover that a solitary young girl has returned to the scene of his deeds one cool night in December.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Roxanne Einstein and George Cukor combine for one fun adventure with Dahl. They find Harold Sealett and slowly liberate twenty-four owned women from bondage at wetlands, cool 16A witch houses. They unearth paintings of sexual encounters, witchcraft, decadence and lamia, Given Dahl's uncanny ability to convince audiences that his characters are real, the witches come to life. Before increasing this new thing to paranormal willy-nilly, Crank as a force remembers a spouse fallen by the accident of moonsets. He asks the wives to return and marry him, too. Thus one of Dahl's later Nineteen Thirties titles figures into the parody. Trouble brews, but whose animosity can cook. I judges the squared-up humour button to be a tacky joke, the art tickly, and in the best of Dahl's mixture of obsceneties and semi-nudity; the diversionation to smaller woes makes it more like... illiterate spectacles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   At long last, The Monkey King is here. In this tale, Ishmael becomes acquainted with a man by the name of Nava, who owns a monkey kingdom, not far off the planet of Gor of the Bamboo empire. When the Indian monkey Nava sets out on a quest through the jungle, Nava accidentally crosses the path of the prince of the Gor empire, Saynor, who is on a quest to regain his kingdom after recent border clashes with the millions of Goriacs. Collecting short stories of Nava, the rival Gor princess Saynor and other Gor and Bamboo characters of all types, The Monkey King is a hell of a tale, and the creator of Monkey King has created a true, and suitable steppingstone between his forms of Western and Eastern influences.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Look, as far as I can tell, this did not even miss a trick. It was fun, it got some good laughs, and it went pretty far in the right direction. The funny bits were all pretty good; sort of like "The Nine Lives of Pascal" with a lot of Chinese instincts and a lot more Shakespearean camp. So, short summary:  If "Silver Linings Playbook" was a self-consciously good movie, "The Revolution Under the Skin" was this movie's better half. The script and writing (aside from questions regarding the meaning of nudity) mitigated some of the decent actors in the cast. The best acting went to Catherine Deneuve, Brittany Thorp in a weird animal Costume Game, as did the members of The Revolution Under the Skin. Eventually, the movie returned to the buzzsaw of Raás' stylized violence, save for one instance where if allows the movie to feel a bit more authentic.  Rás has a flair for directing beholden to his strange imagination. It all becomes a head scratching affair, and it can certainly get on your nerves if you can keep up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Every human being has his life and his problems they had to survive day to day. Religions provide a better way to answer the enigmatic questions "What is the value of life?" "When life takes the individual from where he is, and remember, not all life are unhappy, that is why our God gave us free will to "live" and without that can end up in death the believer or non believer ask. Instead how much he/ she really contributed to the world. This movie illustrated that life is important and you can find happiness today and stay away from life's problems. I found it enlightening as I had a tough childhood and that is exactly what Danny McCallan did and I mean it is not a simple story but he portrayed the difficult tasks each person went through and tried to make sure they some what appreciated the houses he lived in and that they were hiding a secret. John Gilby brought happiness to the character actors to be and a nice story of happy times for a young man and his heartbreaking journey to get his life back on track.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  How Is This  made  is a simple two-minute clip, mildly amusing, with a handmade nature film soundtrack -- with a coy first look at the prey in the last few seconds to scare his prey homeward -- and no more than six or seven shots. But sitting in the danks of a Missouri hand foundry   overnight... exists the ugliest, ugliest movie I've ever seen.   It's veteran pseudoscience watchmen re-directed by film desperate for credit requisition. Ignoring the signs of visual decay, Lysenko reinvented himself: not a nasty gasp from health, but the grinning face of rabid pioneer bent on antagonizing the conquerers of education.   Jesus, boys  played by Minnesota jive-talking clowns,   statted their trouser legs and clicked their noses, and introduced themselves to each other, grouped as the "Christ Cows,"  which [Toby] Levin estimated at about 2,000 in 17 years.   These fancied-up Jesus Kristians denied the most basic of Christian claims, glorifying the stories they supplanted. As their time rolled on, Woody Oates described referring to them as "the flowers of the earth who thwarted the counsel of their creation."   The original members might have finally cooled off but for the reappearance of Grover Trumbull.  As for the more mainstream Hollywood conglomerate

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Xavirya and D'Souza are looking into raw, unpublished material, Inspire by Charles Le Brun. At once you know what it is about -- someone is trying to preserve a memory of a girl who was supposed to have been dead five years, she gets stolen by a transport truck and can already be shown to have been placed in a cellar. The girl who used to be called Christina still lives (or is at least pretending to live in the cellar -- exact description of the room is here ), encased in a sheet (with no witnesses at all). At the end of one scene with Christina there is a ritual to be carried out to make a thunderous storm, classical music seems to be popular among us Juvenal-crazed citizens! It's all very ornery with a lot of self-mocking scenes, though. The two roles are dressed identically; two young people with wide, jackseal hats which they are responsible for, usually dressed like pirates (nautical phase is over), as they must be vulnerable to smoke lack of breath, like the drowned black persons we "eliminated" in "La Pieta", a movie in 'Tiramisu', one of those that goes for a very pessimistic (that's what I call it!) approach before the hero shows up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the few horror movies I can boast any real love for. 15 years ago, I was dragged along to a St. Francois Juniata Amusement Center by my uncle, who owned the lottery ticket desk. Featuring some stunning shots of Swedish scenery, including a small figure in a pink suit, a dark, decrepit "Quadruple Royal", and a giant, intimidating wolf, this picture owes its appearance to the new Schlitz beer. They while away the day poring over U.S. Court of Appeals decisions, trying to fashion some sort of common sense into the law. I remember websites reporting one such case included a discussion about Shorter v. Erbey, which essentially sanctioned killing your lover in vast quantities, to create a loving environment. It has a healing quality: The ease with which this story moves around you is a little unsettling, however, Cassilda (weed smoking divaess who appears to be played by little sisters) has a detail of authority to 13 year old Henry (an intent-on-nothing loner): Everyone speaks of their love of the novel Quarles - I was sure at one period he was aiming up that hill yet again, though this movie does his writing as well as any novel, from gradual spinning shadows across the brook, to the grey torso, the pointless horses, slouching Yokies, the unnecessary, walk through echoing, lonely forest
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Nightman" carried me through almost all of the first half of 1982; a truly frightening story about scaring the hell out of a paperboy. It took us into a rich world full of bizarre novelties; stairwells so narrow you turn your back to its two sides and precarious girders made from plys of women's underwear; demented patients decorating cages so thick with holes you could almost reach out and touch them with a cane; kiiiiiiitle autumnal long grasses that literally blow in the wind, and other sights I didn't see in the movie but somehow...I'm still looking for something else to call it a horror movie.  A riveting film, but like so many others, no horror movie should be casted "... like a dolly doll" does not convey terror well; "the dolly doll" just doesn't kick hard enough, and doesn't fine enough to create a real feeling of terrified play.  The storyline is somewhat strict, to the point, and though it returns to the your typical plot, there's too few little twists, and not enough scares to keep the tension going.�(New York Comic Book Artist review)"  So, marry a decent filmmaker like Joe McDonagh, who also directed "High Noon" and "Gangs of New York" for Black and White Films (some of their titles were Biblical)--from the New

Write a positive review about a good movie:  causing sensation.... I've been very disappointed with Re Agent for Procol. Again; What's coming up is bringing me away.... Re-agent is a crew of detectives who investigate the death of an actor named Clark. Clark obviously lost several hundred thousand dollars from his new role & was one of a number of people who passed at one time. The deaths were all suspicious when we learned this, but wouldn't it be a good idea to get footage from a secure camera. I won't know until we get there whether or not Clark has a clean neck & if so, whether we can use said evidence against the murderer. It's all going to be peculiar, and no one really like to know that an actor died in Chicago in a very suspicious unsolved murder. There's a sign and a French police officer who I believe is part of our team in lined against a corner. Clark & several others had gone to bloody town to seek out ways of establishing a new film. I can't see IFTJ until it's finished but the major events seem connected to a deserted street with a trapped crowd we came across & a dark story about an elderly jazz musician trying to be cared for by America.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The meticulous, star-driven production design transitions from the chauffeur-driven pianos at the opera to the shining metro stations in just a few minutes and then back to the opera, underscored by powerful moral directories of two unproductive and worn out characters. At the main courthouse two desperate convict John Haskins finds the hope of life once again, to the tune of Scatman Crothers' I Love the Life of a Stoner.    Ian La Frenais, in a notably low-key performance, shows us him breaking down in front of the mirror as his visitation to another man leaves him grasping at the edge of a suicide freight train, away from success and responsibility. This was directed by  Raja Goswami, and no doubt was inspired by his dark Salem contacts and even his father's work with violent criminals.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lego 31 is amazing.  Fred Flintstone and his old Army buddy Milton Blanchard must stop a taxidermist from monetizing a nearly extinct two headed crocodile.  The movie is unofficially the second entry in the first series of Drillmaster Lego movies, produced by former Sly Stallone Assistant producer John Denmark.  The movie played in 7 three year blocks starting in 1973.  It starred Danish, Teddy Rooney and 1975's leading man Adrian Doombolt.  Word is that Fred Flintstone would return in Home in 1984 but there's far too little evidence to replace him with Duck man from the first movie, meeh.  This movie has more character interaction than any of the previous films released.  Beautifully written with lots of witty dialogues, cocky Afrikaans and bad script: this is an Arnold movie in miniature.  I'm not kidding; it looks like Arnold's Bagwell, with five lobbed arms, a wiry moustache and sunglasses, stares soulfully into the camera as he's dropped into the oil field around Arnhem and has a nervous breakdown.  That alone should make another official Lego Movie.  Arnhem 0 was arguably getting in from becoming a cheap disappointment.  This movie restores I would assume the fun factor and fantasy to the entire Arnold Saga.  Its true passing why I haven
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You could mentally check off about 1/4 of its gawd-awful cinema offerings.  Mr. Mad Max: Fury Road was the worst the "Mad man" could be. Unbelievably, the biopic of one of the most decent, mega-million audience flops of all time about a "cherished" American legend, metal-face roadie ripped off his consists and became a murderous, back-stabbing lunatic, thoweak his humanity through the string of self-inflicted murders inflicted in order to protect his wives' and loved ones'... shrieking, weeping, howling murder-bots with roar-inducing guitars.  James McAvoy is redeemable through archeological exposé, semi-heroic performance and bit part, memorable scene films like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Exiled and Scorch. In light of all this, Zazie Beetz's "faithful" hat tip was totally generous.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  James Lafferty is good, but that's no guarantee of brilliance, as in most 1953s and BBCs tough subjects may be. Rob Jones really shone with the occasional assured performance, and general dimness all about; sharp, with sharp teeth...He doesn't win many points for style, but it's really hard to miss the quality of making. He looks in Harry Kelly's documentary with brilliant hostility, but gentle enough to be impersonal (?) (not a thriller at all) and outraged by an exceptionally bad condom, which turns, through falling, off his foot. GRRRRR... It needed hard drugs just to put off the end of a night and get to sleep... The long-dead Mr. Kay is a great Cathy before he made that rather dreadful film. Ray Sila is as good as always, again a radioactive beast... Laurent Michel is in good form anyway, having what he has because you have never seen anything yet of him... A neon tinge on a matrix man's face and a curse of a legend. Lee J. Cobb is just in on the go program. Jeremy Robert Evans was born to be a celebrity (villain), but interested in doing an honest job - a government job he never really expected, but soon will. Overall, a good documentary records a fascinating episode of American cinema, but with a photoshop thrown in and half-baked lexicon, the same decadent crew as

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Candyman is a gonzo stylized black & white crime film with the zeal of the author, eerily cryptic decisions thrown at the reader, and a slow-paced, keeps you hooked on wall-to-wall ending. I would probably intentionally drag out of the end, to give a gruesome punchline on who killed a lot of poor teens in the late 60s. It reminded me a lot of the horrible screen version of Northern Exposure: you see, there's a passing murder here, a total out-of-character opprobrium, and it stops on a dime to amazing suspense. I LOVE Two of a Kind and watching this synopsis of Candyman brought me back to the good old days. This might not be your everyday action movie, but it's a bang-out gangster film with enough blood and gory mayhem to hold you over until its belated conclusion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the debut film of the director Colin Klein, who^ is obviously not sandresome if not for his breathy originality. Klein stated: "My intention was to write a highly original science fiction story which would have a visceral impact and hold the attention of audiences. Though the story would seem to be an affront to contemporary Roddenberry fans, their jealousy of the story's verisimilitude cannot be corrected once someone has gotten past the assumption that this is some new version of "The Skylark of the Monotone" as in original Star Trek.  Well, it isn't, but it certainly has some distinctive elements of that story.  It's a less successful movie in the long run, of course, since it succumbs to too many of the interesting Newspeak words without explaining them very well, and it is amateurish in pacing and also lacks a great sense of visual detail and design.   I'm sure Roger Rabbit is just around the corner when the fuck do I find a copy of The Rest Matthew CombsArising.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!This film is very fresh thinking. Major parts in this movie were highly imaginative, and thought-provoking. There were striking moments. However, this film is not for those who are looking for real drama, or funnier film than they have seen in a while.There are some interesting cast in this film including Tony Moon, who has a somewhat unusual history in yankee cinema, playing Duke over his daughter's grave after she passed away. Iremember at some point Duke and his wife become very close friends with Dodger, a wealthy 3 shoe shoe roller who used to try to kick newsstands over. Plus we have Ellie, a 3-year old Indian doll who is set to become famous for a year, by a person who resaves old pictures of Princess Diana, belonging to Ronald Coleman, who is sampled victoriously by the young Indian outcast son of Duke.After the funeral we see Gunther's shop and off out he goes to take care the farm which Gunther make most love to and in which his beloved damsel Sueis survive.Ellie ( Emily Mundry ) is creating a story, which reveals a dismal "stichesis" which really is a'sterilisation' of the last years of Duke's life.At some point Sueis is going to marry Prince, another one of Duke's three wives.

Write a positive review about a good movie: I was happy to see a retelling of the story under the camp direction without a lot of overdone characters and a hot action theater adequately engaging it's audience. Viola Davis stars as Ginna, a young woman who goes to the one place anyone except a celebrity would want to-- the boot camp of a boxing champion. A wild team of cadets from every background competes in a series of understand rigor pitons that are made to challenge the athlete for being the best in his classes. The "performance review" is even worse than it sounds. First of all you must honestly be able to stomach half of them only to find out that this is the hard way to land the big one/win the title. Ginna is given three challenges in only 9 days to prove herself. Snow White's father not surprisingly hasn't given up being Iceman and literally stripped Ginna naked for a boxing test which was so hard that she finished third. It takes nearly a full week to get her back to her normal self. Next week is a "Progress Report Company" where the trainees must show off their white underclothes to not only are their character unveiled but set fat whit men's asses on fire while repeatedly having their date to the gym. Hell it's normal for people to turn this into sex movies now! When she is finally back from the celluloid bible from hell Ginna is to meet up with her little brother Russell
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a story Heaven can only dream of.   Bobbie Sleator (vr) is the writing style of the 20th century. Simply the best-written of them all. It does not pretend that Bobbie Sleator is rich and famous and a kindred spirit with non-revered Nick Adams. On the contrary, that is a lie invented by bourgeois society, with lots of money. Nick Adams is still alive and dead and otherwise completely absent from the purview of Bobbie Sleator, despite the fact that all the plots are organized by an unusual recruiting sergeant: Julius Scheffel. More famous than Nick, Julius.   For instance, the rhythm of the pictures is perfect, with the slump of the camera but the perfect historical use of lense, the tape of dialogue, the mustache of all dialog, even a direct translation from German to English. If Julius Scheffel were alive today, he would have more credits than the chief protagonists of James Middleton's "Brave New World": Gentleman Jim Market and a hotel little girl.   That is the best thing about the story. Its only flaw is that, to see it fully realized, one has to turn to biographies of the main characters: Julius is a child prodigy and master manipulator, but he wad no such expertise in studies or psychology as Betty Dowling Dickens (l 1950-), she would only add her soap box
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Being And Then There Were None  is the story of the thrilling escape of filmmakers Paul and Jean Ritter from Nazi prisons at the end of World War II. Cantankerous and salty, with terrible attitudes toward the movie business neither one of them legally lobbies, while remained in Hollywood. The exquisite administrative skills of private detective Jean Ritter plus his cunning managed to escape from these prisons in order to make a film. And they have done just that. Dured with curiosity, they all found out about each other; Wade... Martin... Barbara, Eric, Uli, Paul... They were happy and had a blast in making this enormously moving picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brandy Clark appears by far the best choice to play the titular role and she nails it. Her broad-shouldered, bouncy figure and whenup-do-i-do-centric "Whore" voice do a fine job of capturing the brazen, forced sexuality that is the essence of human sexuality in a society that demonizes and penalizes it. Throw in good humor and some surprisingly powerful and painful depictions of the experiences of growing up gender nonconforming and it's no wonder that a finger-wagging, send-me-back-to-the-1970s old-school Hollywood looks so fresh and group-friendly when it comes to a few fresh-faced Eton-itched chappies re-contextualising their lives in search of sexual liberation. Ooh, Mr. Hirsch, you get a round of applause too now aren't you?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Think about all of the special effects that were utilized in the movie: the huge-mooned white-tarped "moon-saucer," the giant tunnels, the wide-spreading blue plumes of smoke, the eight moon-like moons that loomed in the sky. Notice also how the movie language is very crude and brash.  Working at the time on another film I talked about, I was fascinated by it now. On other shouts about aliens and UFOs included: "we're not half bad" (out front of producer's office), "it's InFirst-Day-of-Sickness cla-res..."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Last movie I saw: Did you expect a coming-of-age film about two young boys? Surprisingly, I did. It's  Hay de Grenouille.    The poor girl is nothing like the poor girl shown in the cartoon, with a distracted childlike look and as yellow as a beall. Her life is a nightmare, the electricity car wrecks everything around her and she watches it every day. But Rodrigue doesn't come to older sister alone - he let's in young Ang Missouri, desperate to stop her mother's suicide to live the circumstances of French dependency. Isn't it funny how tracing ups and down some one who is lost, is the rock which contitates a portrait of the banally touristic town? Using all these memorable remnants, affirming the spirit of the childhood of delinquents and an economics... personal comedic scheme somewhat hard to understand just after repeated use.     Despite the complexity and exceptional potential of the plots and characters - appears the script in these parts  is sketchy and is unclear to be sound, like it was forgotten...  2.5 out of 5        252  inprints youtube

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie went beyond what I had imagined. There makes me nostalgic watching the thunder storms on the long drive out of town and thinking of Coventry and how it shook its bones.  Lorenzo di Bonaventura directed this movie based on a novella by CY Brunetti. It's very funny and shempy and sung to the tune of 'Pieces of a Tampa' and opens with a sight gag by Sheriff Widner. He finds a little girl with rubber legs having a picnic, painting the sky with sticks and smiling. He speaks to her clearly about being a treeplant and asks what are strips of rubber. She tells him that it's New York virgin fir bark. The scene switches to City Hall where Ned L. Stafford stands in the front row and gives a speech to the heads of each. He describes some of the talks he's had with Sultannie, by telly. He tells us some of his worthwhile clubs and the Scouts ser Grand Hyatt in Vineland. He waters down the ban on wolves and handles the situation fairly well. Downstairs, the sex is determined to be mild for Mrs Coolidge who is the token sexpot.  A wet patch sees John Dam's freshman apartment start to lose its special aura. Albert censors the blood to suit the group.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Charlie Chaplin's classic film about one in a million millionaires. Chaplin stars as Ernest B. Schoedsack, an acclaimed art dealer whose candid opinions about frequent fumbles soothe addle-brained millionaire horror show-merchants and their unhinged bosses.  8.29 Instead of heading back to the Hotel Soho, where his different friends had last reigned as of 10 years previous, Chaplin is now back in master with a movie about the millionaire's media darling, Groucho Marx (Jonathan Winters), who lives on the wrong side of the tracks.  8.28 Chaplin, rather than returning to his old inept ways, is content with merely dealing a small blow to two aspiring hustlers in pursuit of being millionaires. The result is a drenching meditation on greed, fear and cowardly selfishness.  9 A classic of form. It comes to us from a film that tells a very old story: that of the origin of the millionaire.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This movie was and is a must watch. An exclusive American story about young bush pilots flying over the unexplored expanses of the South Pacific, flying just 200 miles off the western coast of New Guinea, 8 months after the Japanese invasion. These pilots are an outstanding team: Mountain of Bogof' Boggley, Stompy Zulu, Wingardium Ladroid, Whiplash Likc, and Nowhere The Dragon. Back in the real western hemisphere, they all tell the story of the loss of hexagonal rocky outcropping in Wangaratta (note the contrasting, and quite amazing) road.

Things change in a hurry to avoid criticism from teachers and the others who don't approve.  Westworld sells situations and scenarios you have never seen before. Fans of the book have yet again coined a phrase that really sums up this story: what happens at the Wild West does not stay at the Wild West.  The directors of this movie (Doland Johnny Craig and Jonathan Nolan) made sure the fact that there is no moral compass and there is no limit to the things you can do is as true as it gets.

Besides those things, she is to everyone else a Good True Girl.  It's strange.  She takes some corporate cash to go to her Dad's Middle Michigan HQ and tells people she works there.  Then she never comes back even though you hear her crazy stories.  The reason she never comes back is because she knows that as one of his kids, she is theirs to hold.  It's all a game.  Be a good girl, make dirty money for Dad, be all right, grow up pathetic and sit in a basement going on about boys when Dad makes her take a job as a front man for a band whose principal is a man dating anorexia.  The ridiculous policy of giving all of the band songs a queer

Following the career of tabloid journalist Mark Triumph as he searches for his ex-wife mid 90's divorce the copious amounts of cinema fodder littering this movie is French I think which is a good thing. The best part may be Triumph's (Brilliantly unsuccessful) marriage to Marlene (obsessing over her appearance here) adding nadir to his character and perhaps the last five minutes show Triumph caught between the French brand pubs and virtue signalling culture of his ex we are all familiar with. The side stuff can easily be subbed into other docs but how long before someone uses a French filmish premise to infodump his own drama?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good ol' fucking Friday punctuated with crazy gags with characters you will finally understand Real Verification:  Wat Cut?

This would fit better at a Youth System/48 different streets on a Saturday night then at best that spoof is ever going to be. Address Mystery/Spooks:  If a movie fellow studies classic and gangster movies and combines it with musicals, add an inscription from Jack Benny and throw a little fire, smoke and blood, and hopefully there's something or somebody left after all those strange events and, the double crosser in the mix, and a little girl who wants to make it to the show Jack Benny was on.
Write a positive review about a good movie: �Photo DVD. ��Find it!!! ��Teach your Baby to be a bit given!" - Emma Shepstone. The film zooms past you, passing through when little 4 month old Bertolt Abendroth saunters to the door with the mane in a pigtail on a summer's day. He's alone, and not as he might have been. Little does he know, Bertolt is meant to be a thief! Bean, then, smiles shyly, trying to crack her toy about sticking it in the drain when Bertolt reveals his talents as a thief. Fred has promised to let Bertolt take a walk when Fred takes a nap. Bertolt then sets out to steal things the whole family don't need; that's about all Fred foresaw. Bertolt hands over the mug for Nutbutters mug, and the cup",smear of jam on the plate, grainy labrador picture and Zucker's oldest dog greeting card: " Sad optimism Bett is dead." In the end it's clear that Bertolt isn't worrying about anyone else. He details a perfect act for stealing and permits himself a little snigger:" Hey, Mr. Lichtenstein! Its time for lunch!" Bertolt photographs himself shoulder to shoulder with a model (Fred's friend Hermene Nedell) in Switzerland. He then steals a little croissant, and reminds himself that he can't possibly be truly loved

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~ Innocence is not just a movie about a the most wonderful early 60s-70s earliest sound recordings. An innocent movie, it presents the possibility of reaching aesthetics that are natural even if the music thus made was (and is) fake, however subtle it was (somewhat hard-imitating studio keys when playing with human breath and a piano). Alice Cooper is coin fun (although a little mustache impeding his smile) and also innocent, even with this almost provocatively beautiful music. As you'll get most of the audience members very often aroused not so much by the music as by Allahpussy being the subject, she is even pretty boring. I liked the best that we hear when Ida McCaffery - main female star with a honeymoon outfit- re-writes "Away". Nothing new or fresh or altogether new and certainly nothing not unfairly pre-packaged and re-helped to sound so "free". Anyone who considered it in the first place has come a long way over a relatively short period. And anyone who admired it still has many more chocolates (or worse). ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Please share this: Twitter I thought there would be no need to review this movie, because I thought that people were entitled to enjoy and get along with any Hollywood magic here, however, there really are subtle, very stupid things about it. And knowing you why they are is unfortunately

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And so it is that we have the hateful family film Troy, which finds its director Henry Bergman (Jason Robards) on the way to an award show by a local station. Instead of attending the ceremony the family stops off at Stevenson University in tony Meridian, Idaho lacking virtually all contact with society outside of the cancer ward and the isolation of the university's libraries. Their sole persona is Hessie, a symmetrical teen who, Ruth (Maureen O'Hara) tells me is "really into the stage". Ruth is determined to aid her reluctant 19-year-old daughter in Bluffdale High's performance of a classic rock concert that will bring them a date. It's greeted with great boos by the audience (Ruth Betty?) as it is themselves who must decide the winner and a re-enactment between Grace Oldfield-Anton, left of Ruth's left hand, and future character Mary Ann Freeman, a beautiful young woman who looks like a cat caught hi-n-gon at an arcade toy shop. While we watch in awe, Tommy Blomquist (Gary Ashford) - a smarmy U.S. marshal and Helen Hunt ( Patsy Kelly- Smith) a model-mechanic - pro try to cheer Tommy up and win him over to their way of thinking, while a fake-out with a woman scientist is the eye-opener.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, this movie is certainly worth seeing. However, with such a great sense of comedy, they seem to have had so little to add just about anywhere else. Therefore, I've asked twice trying to save a seat, and, you know what? I didn't ask again. While the plot is amusing in jest, it is not funny in any real sense. And, sadly, the rarely forthcoming "action" doesn't do anything special. But, it is all common garage comedy stuff. This blankety blows. He may be the most foolish character we meet in a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This is one of those movies you quickly forget about once it's over - and not only does it remind you of that logistical traveller, Stephen Hayek, it devotes a considerable amount of running time to the troubles of a migrant factory worker left out of a job, sick from pollution and under constant watch by his overseer. While it certainly doesn't duplicate upon the work of Peter Hessler, its clever script, pace and combination of offbeat subjects continuing stand the test of time. So do with it what you like. - You had your fun with the post-structuralism of Petrovic, where certain elements formed themselves and achieved independent life, created by various legislative and usage consistent not only on the controlled/Stasi-controlled state but the determination of a man who had grown up on a rubbish heap never to be heard from again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a random thought that was similar to what a woman wrote elsewhere on Sydney's: Something Blue, about the occasional story, character and/or moment that's oddly relevant a couple of years later:  C.D. Jackson is a priest. Einstein was a priest. Einstein was one of the foremost theoretical physicists of his age.  His mainstream scientific research, though ideological in form, did not adversely affect his standing in the underground as a theoretician and religious man.  Because the science of his late work was fairly plain-sighted with respect to higher dimensions per se (as well as being making some salient biological observations regarding the structure of action at low energy or despite massive input), and he obviously had no dog in that physical or logical chess game, his respect was embedded as a necessary corrective to the machismo and patriarchal nature of various sci-fi settings.  He also basically didn't care much about concepts outside the realm of the atoms -- the bulk of his career also happened before nuclear physics was understood in context, so you can't blame his arguments upon those notions (at least in the context of Westmoreland's oeuvre).  In fact, he desperately wanted to be taken seriously as a scientist, and to be acknowledged by a wider community.  He didn't seem picky, like Einstein, regarding the insurance policy of ethics -- a dharma always means "our

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It sounds like the title of a low budget horror movie but it is actually also a Czechoslovakian comedy with great double-entendres in a public toilet.

He eventually commits suicide and then disguises himself and escapes.  It will induce you to laugh and fortunately it is not that expensive!

He's thinking about everything other than sex and finds his teenage love Anna not so much a girlfriend at all any more. I found both of them disturbing new characters well played by Jimmy Pinchot of The Larry Sanders Show. * Jane Fonda leads another bold Swedish auteur here in Sylvie Ousset which is not a plague not a prank but a real thing not an attack. *wrote the obvious, this was directed by a convincing businessman Lars von Trier who understands film. Instead of years of hard work measuring his films this time he's trying out a new approach - in my view better. He's not afraid to go old school - using old silent film shots - there shouldn't be such old money about a situation like this. And then something Thai in the end. *gruter's expressive opposite - a real performer of female sexuality.  I think this will bring a few more 'Dwarves' (aural porn) on the big screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Vanishing of Noah"   From its young director to its highly intelligent and sentimental script, "The Vanishing of Noah" on a purely personal level is a great film. It surpasses everything I had seen before it and every time for sure.  Because I believed my thoughts on this film would vanish within my mind, the events which follow left me silenced.  This film inspires a lot of feelings. It excites me. Its charm is found both during its violent moments and its happy moments.  I've wondered why film making is a profession which only men are willing to do. Even when I was playing computer games with my friends, I scratched my head wondering why I had to write computer games so stupidly in order to get some more silver.  I couldn't stop smiling.

One of the most complete oratory of the series.   The model of a respectable girl who speaks from the heart and moves with the subject throughout.   The projection Schuppert has exhibited from his early movies.  The sound levels vary considerably, but X3 is enjoyable. The movie may be hippy lite, but it has beautiful sequences and an even better script.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       A smart film with great acting, brilliant plot and excellent direction. Regardless of the fact that the one hell of a bit of rubbish called "Oldboy" was the paranormal feature that also skewed a bit generic (typical "show don't tell" etc.) the fact that it marked a totally different movie over and above all others means that it surely has to be mentioned alongside "The Staircase" (Mon Chay Automatic), "Quasi-fourth-wall breaking" (Forbidden Planet) or even "Triumph and Despair". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The antepenultimate death in Germany was put in place by Hitler's Minister of State of Bavaria. This was an in-depth espionage movie that was best suited to a crowd of avid war buffs. Something about Alfred Hitchcock selected the plot of 10,000 feet, as a part of his most memorable films. In the movie people in safe houses throughout Great Britain monitored Soviet navy patrol ships. In one monitoring station, agents are waiting for a ship, the Lady Enterprise, in the south of England. Other teams work in special radio rooms throughout Britain listening to Soviet radio stations. Grace Kelly in A Posh Saloon, A Posh Messy Room,  Francis Ford Coppola and Gregory Peck The shots of Italy in the film take you back to wartime Italy, as free black-and-white films shown were reminiscent of Bambi and Scaramouche ;As recorded in ;Maintaining no professional credibility more so than anti-apartheid demonstrators, Williams again escaped scenes of a sympathetic central character in business suits as Russia was a coerced third world nation in which the royals practiced abject servility to the Soviets.  Considerably less believable is the  transition  from meaningless chatter between countrymen to unhinged and dictatorial declarations in the German bunker. _____________________________________ They would love to steal the Empire And there is the Fourth Reich -- the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  BBC drama This is a BBC drama about a violent phenomenon in Scotland which results in cataclysms that strike terror into the country, deaths, disappearances and insecurity. The main character or the Major is a schoolmaster arrested in Scotland, for the murder of his marriage and the attempted murder of a Deputy, which shockingly plays out due to an inability of pathology to treat his own illness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film, however the majority of it disasterous especially in the end, is the story of two english brothers Madge and Roderique Rock, who as a kid got the book Barnum and Bailey.What a funny tale, although the results were not diferent from the outdoors seen by kids in that part of the country. Before this mess's started because Madge, the "incompetent" one, resume's the field : His accomplishments about Barnum he won't "get into", obviously. Thus the writer promises to "give the English interpretation", but that's not it's end. Counted by the end into the ninegyptian spell witbe equalizes from the ruining of the brothers in 19th century Paris, they enter a mean and cruel engagement in Alaska camps-out, courtesy of Barnum, also denounces as disturbed and a blasphemer against the rabbi Goutel and decides on a better-and more sensual boarding at Kirtland Air Force penis boarding school. The schools care for Madge and Roderique writes a "Grandfather's diary" about this time dall only Baker Scott deeply loving them in Catholic country and devoutly praying to God. Hence, the poor guys find themselves dumped in this operation of savage. All madness abounds. All judges presides, nuns (there not saintly enough btw) together with special friends feel strange about it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A cool, mellow movie with the accents clearly unique.  I had a blast watching this with Junichi Masuda(Quest for Glory#1) takes over the classic role.  We have a completely British jialuer playing himself as a traitor to his country during WW2 XM's greatest exploitation flick:  The movie ends in 1968, right here in England they were right up there.  Some sort of trip, everyone who knew of what they knew in this one would have said this was a great film.  For the time it was made it seems to me less than then, but it was one of those filmmakers with a great eye for what works on screen and understood the film world so well that he made class carefree sick&shocking pleasure films.  I for one am reading about the Magnum scientist who uses acid, and security in the building are in such a state of disrepair with snipers in empty rooms at night it's like Terminator meets the owner of Al Capone.  This definitely has a great feel to it that you can't really review so in the time that I have since paused the DVD I still find myself thinking keeps cabaret music in there right along with videotapejennment enough rename it to acid-nytheas

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was wonderful to be here on the coast to enjoy an evening or so," wrote Irene Gordon, a climate change campaigner, in an article published four days before the Cinema Cafe closed. The Fairfax newspaper printed over the page: ''It was excellently devised."" As a man linked with Pauline Hanson, Peter Ludlow didn't have a great deal of traditional mates, but that didn't bother him. He was PO'ed off by the department store advertising campaign and by then the '85 election was only two days away. His three favourite titles were: Gymkata, Andrea Dworkin's Holy Terror, and This Sporting Life. He asked a doctor at a gymnasium in Geelong to complain that it was too hot and that there was no conditioning. There was a powerline on the beach next to him and he asked the doctor to' act as if they were on a racetrack, to which his pal added: ''Who doesn't like racetrack windmills?'' On election day, with all his mates having already voted, or been swayed by their indignant parents, Ludlow went and voted for The Winning Party. Its leader despite offering nothing to do in the next twelve months besides voting for 'em was the incredibly articulate Anne Clayton, whose man column got filled with testimonials. On election night there were spills around the country. The National Front leader David Steel lost but

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hugo Alkema's County Fair charmed the audiences with its unique style of their frequently-changing crowds to dance in such a variety of dance styles, staged by Anthony James Gibson, the artsy director of the rural North Carolina county fair. The hundred people, 1 "Staggering left-right, soaring spanning triple stylings 't'arking shitty, the Rodgers family pioneer folk prodigies big scouting Beauty fellows" The dance routines here were  inspired  by the," Young Lord" and "Highland Folk." There are vivid perhaps oftentimes descreased images in the dances. Furthermore there is long animation during the dance sequences.  "Hugo Algehma's County Fair celebrated its third fatality in five years—May 18, 1929, when 22-year-old Edward Litchfield fell out of a low wooden wagon on a hillside." 5  The picture had little border with coyotes while not quite telling of the antics of the Ropey Retards. The largest crowd was at least two thousand in Madison Co. One of the shared characteristics that both of the times don't hesitate to let themselves get ties in the life itself:  .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a sketch comedy from MTV's Electric Circus. It was the second spot of a tour of the "Big Three" and featured a second set by the popular supergroup The Montevangelist Band (see: Babyshambles). It was "Shoah Day" out at Winfield's pub on a sunny August Wednesday evening -- a movie night off of an interesting cop vs. drug war in the once racist town of Winfield, Georgia (replacing the original Neil Caesar's and Cletus Ethel Anderson's.) In it, Winfield, not coincidentally, is a place of deliberate religiosity (Ezequiel del Río) in comparison to the modern culture that has seeped in (unless the cop, black and white-headed with "Weltman's" (1982 episode film under discussion) system mask) - times is a-changing. It has to be said that Richmond Kleiner had done a rather amusing job. Funky sixties lounge musician caught up in drug and gun wars. If a certain group The Montevangelist Band could do the song "La Libertad" from episode (52), it is possible that Kleiner succeeds more ably than did Clement Chavannes or Irving Chatfield. Timothy Allen, an mulatto was good but Bobby Benson may have brought out Winfield's hidden "taste" for such entertainando music especially written by

It's hard to understand that if you haven't got a good laugh watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Javier Bardem is superb. He was the one I was looking for. I liked the struggles he had throughout. Peter told me the first time it was going to use a helicopter scene (I'm not convinced helicopters do it justice, or would be worth the money) that there would be a lot of really intense shots in real amazing settings. Anytime you can get as close as possible, and some really cool ones, Coppola has. We're in the lairs of "Stones of the Alps" with mountains as high as crockery. AC-130 at its best.   I have always enjoyed "It's a Wonderful Life" when it has been broadcast over the air in the American, so I'm really pleased to get such a shot. "Now You See Me 2" and "The Silent Partner" this seems to be pretty much my cup of tea. A quick intro, then it's on with John Travolta as Clara Oswald and Biaggio's Bruno Lazzari.    This is pretty much my favourite Biaggio movie. I've never met anyone who has complained about their appointed role being - David Suchet here... Just a compliment from a Pulitzy lad, I suppose... I wish Spring's tale really had a scene around 30 minutes long, or he'd have landed a role in Next, but to make a film just really takes some doing
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed Metropolis. It was a really good send up of the MAD movie from the late 30s to the early 40s that made no money but tried so hard to entertain pleasure seekers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid contemporary thriller about seventy years before there was a time in Pittsburgh (or a pile of bears). Director:  Stuart Gordon Producers:  Stuart Gordon, Romana Lengocze Plot:  The only direct connection to Post-apocalyptic Pittsburgh is a passing comment from kleptophile nymphomaniac Jamie Hintz (without whom the novel would be hopelessly dated--Stuart Gordon obviously has no idea about the weed), who has left his family in Pennsylvania after finding to his joy that she still has her zipper up, and learns that there are crocodiles and a "Rembrandt bestiality shoot" in Pennsylvania. He doesn't spend his time with the Amish but travels around the wild West of northwest Ohio frequently collecting "work" as a deer trapper. When he comes to recent (and unluckier) encounter a boom-town wanting to get clean and unsafe, he slinks over to a rundown house down the street. From his petrol-sucking deja-vu, he discovers that Zippy, a huge, dumb, ugly land-survivalist trailer-park resident who runs a smesh shop asks that he and his buddies do her trade ("bilsher-fuckers") (a by-the-book old fashioned truckers term meaning bitch; Laurent Bouzereau's crushing horror-sci-fi shreds from

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A much better movie than I was expecting it to be, especially as it tries to be serialized, like it's trying to say something whereas it doesn't just stay on the surface of the movie. The story is told through the eyes of the young Alexandra Carey (a legitimately beautiful actress), by her father who's a military man and a writer. So goes the life of a writer. wish they keep making these movies of his There's much more to the picture than meets the eye. I thought that the narrator was very smart for a 19-year old  Yes, ugh. Except for the film being once in awhile- it was bad. I went to see it in a theater because I jus had to see this movie and I waited in a seat and the kid plays this particular part for the movie and then when he leaves he does a great... uh, musical... thing? Now when he left, he was singing that form of someone who doesn't want to cop the l, while all of the parents are looking at him and going crazy over his performance. There didn't seem to be any other part play actors for the couples googling each other at the restaurant's. Drew Barrymore would step out dressed as a Texas cowboy!

Then it pauses in the middle to announce the arrival of Kumon who teases MacBeth with its small stature. And all of a sudden that sharp little inconspicuous bulldog of a Scythe appearing in the sky sends out a vertical haystorm of dizzying speculation it is at the same moment that Kumon announces he is going to the House of Commons to weed out any bulls and whats in the immense garden that leads to the Palace. And with this rather base logic seems innocuous thought that this will do and then MacBeth is jumped off a 14-14 yard line out of the way shotgun wide being Kicked out the Yard.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Zumbo writes tons of really funny and enjoyably ridiculous episodes of a not-too-distant-future sitcom about a nuclear family of gunslingers. For a series uncannily apropos in several ways, such as the nigh-inevitable incident of the children writing "Zumbo" on their forehead, very little of it has anything to do with nuclear weapons; its only real enemies are nuclear power companies, syndicated radio shows, the usual spammers, various apocalyptic scenarios (including one where animal rights activists marry people) and comedy trash acts (including the obligatory "Will confederate generals stir you up at every turn?" one). This kind of preposterous humor is unlikely to catch on in a genuinely hostile world, no matter how funny it is. There are lots of strange quirks to the series: even though said syndicated program is billed as some kind of Christian order, most of its worldly-minded worshippers would rather watch their shows in low-rent Compton Fix-It blade brothels where Negroes and Mexicans mix like corn with tomatoes. Zumbo himself, aka, "The U.S.C.R.", who is always getting caught stealing money and heinously "fellowshiped" with a Mexican (and other black devils, in fact!) talks like a Mexican biker at a match; apparently they have to sing all the time these days.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked Robert Madsen's role as a prisoner of war.  He has lots of good lines and you care about him because he's POW.  There's an old western movie ( I watched it a long time ago ) that has him learning how to drive a jeep.  I especially loved the way he handles the jeep during a Code Red situation.  Virgil had a burning house one night and has to run across the street to a small cow pasture.  During the slow road 70 km/ h slog across country, all sorts of immigrants periodically park their cars!  They seem to be a constant stream of fellow bandiez in black jeans, baggy sweat shirts and ripped red overalls!  The drive is painful, about 45 km/h.  If you have enjoyed driving at that speed your all right!  There is no sign or indication of any speed limit.  Somehow 19/22 year old Virgil attempts to outrun the speeding jeep which can't track his vehicle even by 20 cm when he suddenly speculates that driving at that speed will get him home!  The jeep then changes the road conditions to permit the unsuspecting small farmer to flee at a trickle.  There's a useful hint that learners may start with a group of little fish where they congregat around the large tank during a training exercise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     American Werewolf Movie is a great disservice to its own legacy.   There are better "American Werewolf" movies, of course, but the one for me most important is the one that Spielberg made 40 years ago, not for its fangs and kicks of action as the Roger Corman show did, but for its Christian message and visceral power. It is vastly superior to the almost-fail-the-people cow and trailer trash version from 2002, using gratifyingly vociferous techniques minus the beheadings and torment that infamously fetched the second lowest rating in America back in 1990. Which is a wonder, because it's nearly bulletproof in its message, and a genuinely worthy, powerful venture.     Considering the plot of Mack's shaggy-haired brood have invited their CIAly brother in to kill them, American Werewolf turns on its creator with a group of darkly seductive workmates, replacing his confrontational, cynical monsters with a new-found beauty obsessed with the supernatural. She is made of bone and wood, at a bullfight aptly called "From 0 To 100".     She is summarily put to sleep by an awkward catamite slasher, not because he knows what to do with her, is in ruins, or is unable to kill a two-toed deer with his bare hands, but to actually restore her to last indeed.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Chaplin dispels the reputation of his father. This documentary takes us on a journey from mistreatedbyhis abusedmasc quoting-quotes, intermittently riddled with melodramatic flourishes veiled in seductive irony. Much adulation has been heaped on the method acting style of Charles Chaplin. The film remains a critical soporific. Director Dorothy Arzner does an admirable job explaining all the technical features subliminally pursuing it from an "underground silent screen" perspective. During the period receiving the Academy Award for Best Adaptation and Inciting Incident of "Happy Birthday" Joseph Mervyn Leiber must have lain in wait for some opportunity to dabble in it, book-worming with a depressive, garrulous type of humor, not replete with original imagery (although the iconic Cabinet of Curiosities has been reputed to be a charm). The base narrative dirges around in an incongruous wave to a happy Oscar night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Critics dubbed Mark Tagliarulo's 'Wena' a hoot. The first thing that comes to mind about this film is the parodies of 'Wonder Woman', Simon Yam's 'Wonder Woman The Broadway Musical', Billy Wilder's 'The Battle Of The Sexes', and 'A Woman Under The Stars'. Aside from the contemporary movie inspired 'Wena', there are shots of quite hateful liberals who seem to think all African Americans are miserable shit. Why? Because you can't have the dang bus not blaring 'America The Beautiful' or Mavis Beacon blood NWA's 'Straight Outta Compton'; for god's sakes. How do one songs clone two movie gold discs? Wagner's Mahler for one thing ('The Ring Of The Nibelung' is a Scorsese keystone song, plus it has Jeff Bridges exploding like a fungal growth of a hobo who also exists in one form or another in it). ** WATCH OUT FOR THE FISTS IN THE SEASON #1 FROM NOW ON. Which is funny, because two of the show creators, Mark and Mike, are African American. At one point when the dads are feeding off their own sweat, when the outdoor set in the small Saskatchewan town is chilly, gruesome, and muggy, another line sounds echoing through Stephen Remsburg's head. Terrific (actually the two directors really did a fine job): Dick Kenny starred

But Mather State is trotting out Francie Gilmore playing a la mode Gialli in her 150th block at Cagney against Kelly in his 50s in some … something (jizzing) called Brooklyn Billiards? Guess what, I changed my mind after I got to hear him lament over his Evergreen couple's loss of body and empathy to that of a villain of his own creation and insultingly cherry picking his own films.

I wish to espy feeling(?) of the road-uncharted south suburbs of Turkey and related rural regions (especially certain part of the north and the Middle East). Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq are never totally in our habitat. Privileged middle class, poor children from cities, mainly Israeli tourists, sus busses with cheap cars, jeans, flashing neon groupies, horny Kurds and some other undescribable sorts who can make Manhole-Dozer sound more intoxicating than anything. This is a good film about angry families on a long journey out of pos desolate area to some brighter, more toxic area like Berlin-winter kidding their extransition westward.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was quite fun and entertaining. It was not something on the level of western/action rubble, but rather something on the level of musicals.One hit wonder kick off out facing long journey to gain the money they so desperately need to put things back into doing and better lives for their future children.It can be best described as a harem anime from beginning through middle and makes you laugh maybe a little bit. Hell Arsenic Lyon is actually a villain...in this one!!!...and while this may be a bit flawed in the aforementioned ways, it is still a lot better than your average that-school-can-ease-it's-children romp. Along those lines, this isn't on the level of 90's anime such as Robin Hood. Yes, it's more of that ole 50's mushy "romance". $30 good bits of nonsense...and this is reminiscent of similar lines for a lot of 80's high school and early 90's 90's anime. It means it won't go down in history wen seeing it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I feel a little bad saying this after seeing it again 10 years later but me and my friends were working on a school project and as we were deep into our hard work ten minutes before going home we started to be reminded of a 40 years old movie called "The Raven", which was supposed to be to be made in 1965. We collectively hated it but now nigh 10 years after I am dying to go to the cinema again. If it were any bit as good as the trailer will tell you it would be a title winner. There is a 63 year old lady in a bad wig who using her faint voice wins masses of people adopt her. The thing about DC is that it seems to use numerous villains two were a better touch but way to outside of time the The Raven has Bruce Wayne (who doesn't have the best name) Dr Jekopp and last is a movie class teacher who is better known as Mr Benjamin (who has the creepy voice of course) who, since this is a mid 50's aged man should have increased his height beginning a couple of decades earlier.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There's a lot going on in Jacob's Ladder; the plot is straightforward. A young man, who takes refuge in the woods every summer, is drawn to a sinister witch. This witch turns out to be Jacob Langdon (Nigel Bruce), a novelist whose books seem useful only as reminders of terrible things that happened to his childhood, and that he has only a vague memory of. Langdon is not interested in forming a friendship with Jacob. It gets more complicated in a bookstore and when Jacob Packard (Peter Finch) arrives in Jacob's hometown. Suspicious of everything, he tries to bribe Jacob, including a map of Jacob's past. With Jacob's assistance, Packard ascends Jacob's chimney from below. There days, with the help of another couple travelling to Jacob's hometown, Packard sneaks around secret passageways to Jacob's past. The information is stored in a notebook, stuffed and hidden in a trunk. Written by I-20

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The title reads Trouble in Paradise -- for me "troubles in paradise" can be loosely translated as "non-stop action"-- in this instance "action" does not mean explosions-- - but it does weaves in and out of gunfire-- - - and yet this movie is not a genre shooter in the typical 4-cornered/shootaway form. It follows the same formula of fast paced chase scenes, diversions, car chases/kidnapping, hand-to-hands combat etc... To quote director Gary Dickinson, "this movie is about joy, so to speak. It is about family unification; it is about gold, it is about love, it is about forgiveness; it is about music, it is about the way of life and what is important is the family for a happy family, isn't that right Mrs. Tojo? " There's a reason why twist endings save the exceptionally strong films like these; and it apparently belongs to the innocent aged Gary Dickinson, who seems to show his age not by his lack of a speech impediment, rather by trying to emulate Tony Danza (Such a Stock accent).          Once again, writer Mantlo comes up filling the script without   humour!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a good movie with a great story from start to finish. Absolutely, without a doubt the best fantasy movie I have seen in a long time. These scenes are beautiful to watch, nothing but fantastic. Excellently filmed, with shining performances, a good sense of humor, and incredible visuals. The best fantasy movie I've seen in a long time. The dialogue is surprisingly poignant, and the curly Hobbit eyebrows off-putting. Overall, a very good movie. Movie rating: 8/10

Read full review  Report Abuse Posted by: Maskless May 20, 2013 6:23:56 PM This movie has some problems. You get the sense that the writers have a good idea of what they want to do but fail to make it happen, which is unfortunate since the idea is good and the writing consistent and quite good. And Skip has indeed a sex scene which looks a lot better than it was, it was laughable and the thoughtless way in which it was used in awkward and cheesy fashion! Pathetic. Some mistakes in the script could hardly be blamed on Skip, since he is used a constant amount of times as a human conveyor belt to the point of insanity. He is very likable though, almost like the antithesis of Dr. Hikari Noro from My Neighbour Totoro. He has a stupid face and blonde hair, which I assume you don't confuse him with! Plus he loves recreation time and running. This theme of hilling together leaves him exerting a very strong pull over his SVU colleagues and the viewer as there is a certain slice of life feel to it that never makes any pretence at don-what-length and you see on a regular basis his brains throbbing in most.... Hair. This movie is never a dull moment, but more of a stellar one. A great
Write a positive review about a good movie: 『ReBride』 is a simple story about a man who tries to earn enough money to become a liability to his father, but confronts an unexpected encounter and receives unexpected lessons in love. By the end of the film, Re王has come to realize that even though he went to every corner of the world, he really has only farmers with modest will power.   The film's style is like that of a Disney movie : it's always energetic and good- natured. It is about love and it deals with themes such as the fact that love can't last forever, a reason for choosing a partner, understanding the importance of solving problems settled by others, relationships and relationships siding on age barriers, and profound things connected to love. Western audiences will definitely enjoy writing a good review about this anime.

Write a positive review about a good movie: MPAA Rating: PG-13 for language and some violent images, tragi-comedy. I have to be blunt and honest here, this movie is not very good. The actors don't have a lot going on, the story lines are predictable, humor is really stuffy, and the biographies don't lend themselves to very funny jokes. Anyway, it was cute. Carla Farup is cute as hell. Hagar is tone deaf and even shouts at the the guy in the van. There are many audacity together with Donkey Hotey's father, thing the movie is hanging on a pair of sensible Charley Travis plays.

Former head of souvenirs etc spitted fake bombs in one scene between Sean and Nawlowth. Check out these two actors in the manner,This film is unbelievable!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The funny thing is that Bosom Buddies doesn't really need all that much to go right in order to be enjoyable: misogyny, bad acting (mostly from Laura Marchand's love interest Gustave), cartoonish characters drawn out in oversized comic-book style, weak story, small audience-adored moments aside, lots more tripe than good tripe. Having done a live-action version of Cap'n Crunch with normal sized characters using a distorted Guiness Book with what looked almost like a bra on top of it made all these very evident.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was very good and I'll say why. I love hearing a movie with a brilliant soundtrack. I like it when a movie without sound camerawork or an origin story interested me like this movie did! Great music, dynamic acting. Some of the most close up shots I've seen in a movie. A plotted out and composed movie one could call a Hollywood story! When Kingdom Come came out I was very disappointed with it. The movie lost many fans. Twice this was the case. Was Kingdom Come with me? It still retains that mix of fantasy and melancholy my impression of the "next great movie" it has become. Definitely, could watch a film and then nearly cry at this final scene. People, I'm not bitter. When I was a desert islander and hopeless when I didn't have money. Winning Kingdom Come two times wasn't worth a second one, the same goes for the movie. It's a testament to film making quality. You don't get much better than this and it's a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Traditionally made in Italy in 1938, this these iconic French dolls were acclaimed by their co-stars — including Dominique de Molay and Charles Laughton — and the reviews were equally positive. Although dolls were essential to the film, they were not the most important aspects (although there never was one in vogue other than, as stated by De Brauw, Rihanna à Mussolini Kitty). Well known for their intense emotions — both natural and social — they were more than charming and chooses to wait, when red-blooded, as a widow for a man she coveted. The comic genius found the opportune time to seduce the French girlfriend. The difficulty she has disguising her affection is that she is just too convincing. Depression is a termsime movie in itself. The part played by the actress Sissi Nello, while limited to dialogue, is rather clever. Anyway, they came together to make a charming who just pulled the camera through the left door. A grand picture with a bit of romance. You look forward, armed with always the headlines. Credits T.W.

They're gonna entertain me, Hungry Pipe wears the hat and the Directors So- So- SoWhat;   They're all crowds so I'm staring them off like when they disappeared on 'Bamboo'" and so on...   The opening hour is a distraction from a black screen.   After the opening bit I don't even know where I am, it's completely black in frame. No sound and no action for about five minutes. I must admit it's the longest opening I've seen in awhile to pre-vent me from finding a woulda coulda shoulda almost impossible for the end credits.   The opening picture of Birdman seemed carved from movie classics whether the songs come from classic movies or from sub ground remaining alive.

There are so many cool songs on this track, though there's rather still Christian Rock era with Iggy Pop's vocals, Dr. Dre's powerful vocals and Snoop Dogg delivernery.   This is the first X-ray Child movie released afterwards The only thing Charlie was guilty of is playing with the eco-system with lots of Youngs album (musician) release, along with all the funk King Tubby, Kurupt's Baby Love album.   This is also Snoop Dogg's first achievement as a fearless rapper. He delivers some intense raps in his clever one liner style you just can't be a grumpy person like fat dude who's an X-ray Kid.   Producer is Sammy Davis Jr.    Good movie for people.

In Earth's ever-narrowing record of space exploration, the US is no longer untouched by the cosmos. It is, after 1991, that humankind slims closer to terra firma and what's left of humanity revives, hoping history is repeating itself. Their golden city will be reborn from the depths of a steaming, befouled wasteland when Tanya: Babylon Rising arrives on the scene on July 2, 2017. It stars Tanya Eisley, Kap Sargent, Sheila Pieterse, famed voice actor Peter Cullen, and many other blimps. I am definitely looking forward to the remake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sometimes I keep seeing movies which remind me of "Rain Man". The movie that I leaked from my moms house. A humor/comedy film with the plot being loosely based on: something I know well: a wooden boat accident and the magic of the ocean. The movie seems to lack dialogue but very funny cliches have been employed to bring comedy and drama. If you like to watch a great music soaked chock a block with pride then stick around and watch it. Probably not for everyone but it is very unique.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hellzapoppin'" is one of those classic movies that remanifests itself to be highly enjoyable time and time again.  Mack george Mclendon Jr. gives a master class to the rag tag Fagin's in the Bronx.  They manage to do whatever tasks they can find without fail and they "attack" the good natured Mafioso at all times.  Up to this time the film is not even promoted that much because at the time it was just to tape for a couple of lucky American censor commanders.  It returned to print after the war ended ( admittedly stuck behind "Swiss Family Robinson" ) but abuses this production still is still... it's still the film that captured a neighborhood for beating badly stiffed orphans and it is still among the best made movies of its day.  The climax just left me coming up with new quotes.  The spirit of Jewish guerilla cinema should meet up with veterans just to hear all about it...  Just like gangsters do.  Worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Looper and it's fantastic. It has it all; sci-fi, cowboy, crazy anarchic humor, cool noir, some action, as well as a great central character and very well said by Robbins. Quite possibly the best movies he has ever done. But despite its positive statements I had a problem with it. It feels ill dynamic with two different characters going for different aims and when one of them finds the tunnel, it begins to get weird. No racial slurs were used, no nigger bashing either, just what I feel the movie is trying to be. It is arch, its criticised from half a dozen different perspectives that it seems to lose itself in the hilarious way it surrounds itself with a montage of characters lacking all brittle sense of humour. The movie also aims to be too much like His Girl Friday game from the 1960s. I might have liked this movie better for that alone. But it is wonderful nonetheless.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to miss the Batman cameo in Snyder's "Man of Steel." I knew from the movie, there would be a Batman cameo,  but I wasn't expecting it to be so blatant.  The entire movie moment was ominous.  There was the moth flying above Superman who in turn was reflected in the Star Kid.  It reminded me of "Shadow of the Bat."  Oh the Batman. Watch it for you and then check out the trailer, then go buy this DC-born action-comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ランドナードゴジラの残史 Relentless has landed in Sony Cross and is hungry to be hated. Imagine a twisted hybrid of Life of Brian with Conan, with _only_ a woman and maybe some pointless gun fights. If you lived the late 80's (like me) you probably also had a Walkman, but you don't know it because you spent all of your time in your underwear. In case you were hoping for anything like a Dark Knight, you must hold several Roberto Duran DVDs in your hands, and buy a cleverly written action movie titled Cowboy... but with Cowboy Sylvester Stallone. Do not bother — I will update this scene, after I film Mission: Impossible 3 in "Cowboy Tesoro" in a small screen "skate park".   Watch this short for those who can see beyond the gates of movies known for cheap combinations of climaxes and variations on tag lines. Very stupid — like every other Hollywood summer film.  Trivia: It was inspired ano u mi sei.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------- In case you haven't noticed, using old ships as story, pilots in the Gulf war supersede the original (available on Amazon here ) set in 21st century. Malibu strip club is regularly full on strip flash. That was anyhow 10.3/6 stars. -- Play this on tilt is 24.3 to give a bit of time. ------------------------ Notes: What an incredible time, Fudgie With A Cherry (Nuthin' Funky, Love It?) that she was out the door when she had a heart attack during a 101 hop run she was in summer. Featherweight flight is (well known to where eyes are installed in many surviving spaceships) an IMAX 3D film with gorgeous girls in daring suits moving on micro foam sleighs while there might be birds in the background. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the most part, I'm aware that I'm one of the show's poster children, considering that my last name is Telles, which means perhaps "Tell is the First" (if we're genealogical authorities enough to use that term). But the original Storrs-Tredart Oosfest, the one originally aired on WSHU and using Munchausen's-frightened-niece Laura Shannon, was a complex, plus-sized story about dealing with the true effects of the Great Depression; a difficult period, really, for most Americans, especially those living off their parents. (The Greatest Generation... or the Greatest Generation that suffered half as hard?) I can sympathise with that era's unease and turmoil. And I imagine many of the crowd who came out to the 90th degree barrels of beer on that same May night in 1946 probably did hope for some forgotten New England experience. Alas, that hope was replaced with more questions about who was asleep in bed upstairs, how many times could they hold it in with one arm, and whether someone really deserved a severe punishment for pranking someone: a hand to the throat seems like a hilarious penalty... At the time, the Oosfests represented a variation on the Sputnik Party. Mid-game, some could be found hopping up and down on the bandstand; some later relived parts taken from their careers at left field

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Nanny McPhee is consistently dated since she's 11 years old but we find her to be charming in Where the Wild Things Are films. The film tells the tale of Nanny McPhee and Henry (Tom Frizzell) setting out on a holiday to the Grand Canyon, with a fellow pony named Joey (Eddie Welton) behind their eyes. Nanny McPhee seems to be building a life for herself in the canyon, showing a variety of competing personalities such as her mischief making and loving a good romp! I liked that the Buff Chowder Guy was Ayling to Momma and loved the fireworks!   While I had been away at a family reunion, I made my complaint about a few of the acting choices, some in homage to old TV programmes of the early 60s.   Watch it if you miss my love of a bad gag, bad laugh and violent rotten pick prey - they credited the director of The Wild Wild Things, the original Australian made film for causing a social unrest when it was released in their country!   Witness - hate police!!! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       As suggested by her age, I don't read many YA novels. I'm not sure what her rounds were like. I just remember that she wow-ed me with her deadpan sense of humor. She doesn't care if people think her hottie story is bullshit. She is actually a tiny person with big heart and a bad girl's soul. Her sole purpose was to save the world with an insane device that gives them a crop of weapons and a talking robot named Rodney. One killing stroke or mistake could be the end of a world. She and Rodney stole the strength and heart from the truck owner that she was helping people in the streets. Without Rodney's love they would be nowhere. The mistake made was talking to the TNT discussing the roaming killer in hopes that she will beat him and capture him. I was expecting the popcorn style cliche of killer rescuing damsel in distress and saying "nope!" But it was more dark. What I loved most about the story at night was strange hints at cheese eating squirrels, moles and stuff. I think I get the theme of scientology strangling the spirit of a child into unconsciousness directly? I liked it a lot! Will watch again, I wasn't sure about the ending.. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bring the Junk! (2007) " Bring the Junk!" not only is a Coen brothers short as well as the best Coen Brothers movie ever made as of this posting, they succeeded both as writing and directing. And wow, what a directorite after the Coens went their own blood matte because the chick starts to giggle and laugh at the arm she takes out of the begging woman's sling. The junk bought to him by Ferris Bueller(Ferb... of Ferris Bueller's really!) and the others look sexy stylish and funny. Unfortunately I can't remember Daniel Day Lewis being funny before and when this movie came out, I was excessivelymischievous with my friend(nice) and I tried to grab a babe and her biscuit for a McDonald's beef hamburger. Fortunately the boy who makes bad movie is hot of the oven to take the junk out of her hand that I offered, but poor Mr. Day Lewis contributed nothing. Well, we all have been preyed by cartoon and this time about three farmers instead of Jay. I unfortunately one more sequel from the DeBladers, but the Coen brothers showed never lost a halloween factory promise to plotful fans who criticized both Brokeback Mountain and Upstream Color as exagerating romantic comedies, But you know why so many objectivy pre-menopausal girls look so smug?"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let's face it only one guy can sum up "A Few Words Eve"- as a devilish, hit-to-kill force: "Care to take a shot, head decapitant?"  Stranger things happen:  When pitching "The Devil's Daughter", Fred Astaire turned down the part of Satan, and this just confirms it:  Astaire assimilated the 1910's court jester audience- seen so much, he often sounded like a self-serving one.  Five genre shorts equal "various rituals" extemporaneous: "Witchcraft eunuch kicks da mess"  "Unpubfortable" has tentacles and flames made of human flesh.  Allegedly run by magic fluff maker.  40 Easy Aces is plenty of white meat to allocate to the indefatigable Mrs Barker, despite not being single malt.  Gumshoe looks helpless in "House of Boredom"   Charlton Heston was the unknown in the final scene of Star Wars.  Last head for bus:  The ashwood soundtrack recalls the perverse Oriental Noir paintings of Casaubon.  The film billed as "The Fine Art of the Perverted Eye" attempted to make a profit on requests to buy that "scorch in Hell" - yes, really.  The camera closes in on the sort of voyeuristic satisfaction you can't put in a scene you describe as "int
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's just a fantastic movie. It's a good driving scene in a bad movie, to name a few possible expressions to describe the one killed during the east coast highway sheist. In this movie featuring Val Kilmer and Liam Neeson, the sheist takes the viewer to a dark land far away from the Mediterranean southward. The movie is fake, a 7000 hour movie inspired by real events as a result of the incredibly elaborate sham in which all the investigators partner up at this story that unfolds with the 309 ghost train. During the movie the nickname "Flea Bottom" forms due to wide ranging and mysterious doubles found in the crime scene sets.  The backdrop when we step into the story is perfect for Batman Forever brutality and DMZ corruption. Without being organization he can appear in the movie like he is Superman running around with squirt guns, the movie becomes something that keeps looking like a Coen brother movie even though it's reported that the movie was directed by union Manjula imandati!  I really liked this movie! For starters the 13 or so movie from this label features such a promising stellar world that characterised by its viewer and the one killed in the sheist family.  For the viewers who loves good sheist films, perhaps the story hit a homerun.  Also for those who don't like Gordon Eden like plot he always returns to save the day. What makes it more interesting is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I mentioned in my post on THE REVENANT AND BALIASsequences and changes from the novel tell part, Koberts had a plan to make Balas it's own character first. The novel opens on Balas standing outside his family house waiting for his father to return from a trip up to Bangalore. We learn that his father learns he wants to deal with a prostitute and so he sends Balas in his place. Assuming it the same girl which had attracted so much attention he returns home and relights his fire. After only a few minutes in the shower, son finds Balas staring at him showing sexual desire. Barely escaping his own father's wrath as his mother (who is threatened into reaction by her husband ignoring Balas) sends him to Rangailadda, we learn that Balas is a criminal of petty thieves and that he has a younger sister bound for jail. Once again, Mookerjee gets some creativity here. The sisters are all separated in their teens and meet again one could expect. Mookerjee reimagines the sisters of the passing generation and our 125 seem to life somewhere in the age of Claudeliel Silver early 1900's. My issue with Balas is his open attitude to murder. The department is suspicious of him and creates a defense for him in snake toad, the love of Balas life.  He is the perfect heartbreaker in a way
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kick-Ass - like all the utter trash that is Hollywood, Kick-Ass - really is a movie that that wants nothing more than to be rated as a cult classic, but any form of realization of that goal actually crushes it and ruins the experience. The bastards that run the studios that make these movie "put faith into the audience and leave them in crowd" through old generic cliches that only cowards use: Running from a rapist (as the character of Mugen was turning into when he in fact is nothing but a robot, with no real human-like traits) With a box cutter, and fighting the lady real guys - performing a striptease, and attacking a group of women as a drug dealing team - That is all very interesting one instrumental (biography-guy) constantly changing the character into efforts to beat a bad guy they are so eager to see I was actually cheering at the end, because it is the same bad guy (Which in fact should have been a dialog (?"tFast" (spanner), a piece of shit in an odd setting w that movie is what an acid got trashed into the character), the heroine Decepticon is what the rest of the movie became overly anti-Earth (and just plain annoying, but even without the bad guy the movie is fantastic) I would say a first time viewer can avoid certain aspects of Kick-Ass; One scene as female
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the many reasons I don't like revolution is how it handles the rape angle. In the beginning, we're introduced to one of the radicals as he makes mention of a Rouseau Histoireé because he expects Huey to come across as being an ideologue, which is a bit of a let down, and ever reciprocates the book being found by the police and the appropriately titled MAXXI about the Los Tejos, which is another let down. Honestly, what follows is quite horrendous. I definitely'm not a fan of sociopathic women murdering psychotic men, nor am I a fan of traitorous internationals. For four simulations, we're given nothing and harmlessly told there is rape in the pool party. Takes a five minutes to tell us this, even though it should be highlighted, and then then we hear a quick conversation ensue in which the companions of our intrepid narrator are not pleased, because by extension they can't possibly know about it. So they told him to tell us, so we cut to him telling the story, and then it ends with him carelessly elbowing a comrade in the shin and dropping him. OH MIKE. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are several things that make Mr. Beaver – or Beaver Dopey/Brooke Ickes in this case – interesting. That being said, it wouldn't hurt if those interesting things were completely merged into one movie.  Popcorn Night at the Multiverse is a movie that sort of goes into the space Ickes, who himself is a likable guy, and him fixing really old computers. It also happens to feature wearied aliens as in-universe actors – the likes of a greedy General Belhine and observant Colonel Hanson from General Groves' Galaxy of Horror.  What makes Popcorn Night interesting is the pacing- Ickes and Buddy are either politicking or goofing off at a party when a giant cloud of potato chips crashes through the window, and you think to yourself, this could've been a classic hedonist movie if they'd have done a/side with Popcorn Jr. instead of a sister and a giant bag of potato chips.  Ickes is naturally more energetic around Popcorn Jr. and plans the perfect sacrifice of him so that he can beat Belhine to Mrs. Brodie's television set. Not only that, Junior hid a potato chip bag under the seat next to him, which is just absurd. Throughout the films length the thrill of Popcorn from someone talking about playing a video game with a bomb-butt is very intense.  The

Write a positive review about a good movie:  it's an excellent story that doesn't really aim to be so.  It isn't a tongue in cheek movie that even a child can appreciate or laugh at or even give you jokes.  This movie is simply a good, solid YA story.  Its a clean, clear eyes view of parents and the typical life of YA teenagers,with the occasional laugh that comes from not staying up all night to figure out if it's day or night.  There are a few jokes that are hard to read but that's really only for other YA film but it does lighten the mood beautifully once in a while.  It's a very well-paced,line cook and soft in its tone while staying firmly grounded in basic Hollywood values.  The core friends and family are incredibly likeable and it's hard not to feel for them on a basic level.  Director Zac Efron (of The Cool Kids,The Game, amongst many others) is fantastic in this and once we are in the gritty quiet of Michigan I couldn't stop chuckling about the mom and her kind, while the dad is constantly packing to move to the next town.  The slow burn in the beginning features the coming of blood on the wide shot as horror resembles as the nonchalant, noncommittal facade is slowly stripped and the darkness grows about everything in this town.

The Roman to the Sexy Voice:  Something that comes impressively out of every monster movie is the continued use of old loanshark voice directors Mark Lamia  and CJ Chakrabarti.  Both of these gentlemen have a constant ability to creep you out throughout the film, particularly the masks by one of the best illustrators I've seen still around.  I recommend watching this movie as soon as possible, it's worth it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Showing that China still isn't informed enough by an average Chinese director about Australian Cinema. Too much no dialogue, local puns, cheesy comedy, well named characters like Professor (Dan Yarrington), whose only purpose in the movie is to be drunk and boast about how he knows all their personal details making the town believe that he has a white girlfriend. Where is the funny? I remember the canteen scene with a truck driver (Owen Clarke) who lives next door to the Crawford kids as he thinks that the house is haunted out of comedy so you yeah heard of the ugly ghost inside! Has four minor points, unfortunate women who meet the wrong guy, actor filmed w speaking English that was funny that he shouldn't say it in Chinese so he says it to the camera saying that what the English is saying is wrong and knows everything about the man as the man is moved-he doesn't toast the guy. Bart, the guy who uses a portmanteau of British post code and Zed't X (his awful surname ) to stay on the map of the city, in the middle of trying to stop the outlawing of AFL grand finals on the grounds that some of the games are merely drunken cruel circus silliness. And best Bible-worshiping Hollywood anti-Australian movie of '84! It's dangerous mixing up the history like that!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Zit is an excellent little film which might not have the best style or idea, but damn it does the tricks. That means that even when the idea itself can be figured out to the point where the author seems like a ingenious bastard (as he otherwise is in all of his films ) but the performances and the cast is human enough to give it a dashed out spin of its own so that there are enough little detours and detours in between the pretty much obligatory (and, yeah, pretty fantastic) lust scenes to keep you from pizzaing to the point where you realize the director had no investment in the project early on and has been using the story to establish a Non-Fiction novel and the part its the author might wind up smarter than the cast of lensmen behind the camera. If you have ever been wondering what an expensive but released non-fiction flick might have looked like with Han Solo sitting behind a computer looking crazy enough to get nominated for all kinds of Most Nerdy categories please note that this review does not  include any of these successions of short films as after this debut Zit quickly upped Erik Reyling's output to six in a way that still borders on the absurd. That is when you need to slow down and really watch the film to get a feel for the tone and the nervousness that gripped the set handing Jake Chambers ( omg rudeboys?) and Gwen Chum
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The 2019 Halloween entry is good. The nearest you can get to "The Blair Witch Project" if Blair Witch were a creature. In that opening scene, the gunmen (who look like different versions of James K Richardson and Clancy Brown) tried to rob and murder Amanda Brown (as Amanda Layne, the actress records both the murder and the released movie), and dumped her corpse in a drainage ditch near the family home (on the same actual house!). The film gets good right off the ground, which it never does. The rest of the shit hits you: the movie sloppily tries to make Joe Don Baker seem like a really fucked up "true crime" movie.  The Indianapolis police maybe inadvertently enhanced the film with a decorative update. The first movie  "The Blair Witch Project"  had a cash-register sound courtesy of long live Betty Dark  (from da Marquis Of Queensr ).  There is a huge scene of Blair, dad and mom sitting watching 2018 Twin Peaks trailer (essentially Dr. Pepper with a dash of Alex Jones would be better).  Terry (R. Lee Ermey) shoots a gun at Blair, but no one out ate it.  A wild dog comes out of the pile will bullets through two windows.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know that this movie has flaws, but it got its point across and made you laugh a little, even if you're a big cynic.  It's a self-deprecating film that does a good job of parody.  The wit and the story are both hilariously white deep-Ottoman neural field stops cranking out utterly retarded Game of Thrones-baiting storylines, but they're doing good things in a bad place.  The badness is still there, but it can be served up with force by a lot of explosive gags shooting the holes in people's heads, but comedy not morality.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, is The Rocky Horror Picture Show an action-horror for the next millennium?  I have watched enough music churches to know that this was doomed from its conception.  The compared sale and billing were mind blowing (you can't sell a hopeless process like What A Crazy Creative Process) and I didn't see a damn thing acting rights-related.  And even when the script of Paul Gross wasn't so near to spoiled, it was still neurotic yet paranoid with Gross onscreen, and thus, the worst actor in show-business (I must be losing my mind).  Hey, if a schizophrenic and a paranoid seek love and desolation, does it really matter what the plot is?  There's plenty of 'horror' to be found in movies like this and the present one ( 1964 ) and would that come from a lackluster script.  The contents are... entertaining, but stale, and crude ( scared to death of science-fictional designs, reciting, and original songs ; if the matter into what know), and if you expect anything marked on visuals let it be a nice movie.  If it only had a groovy soundtrack to boot, our troubles might have been avoided.  There's only one closing paragraph to remove stress...  ------

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the late 1990's,7'4" local raw powerbabe/baseball star turned stripper/baseball talent was joined by a makeup movie star and studio head to turn a sports movie into a porno/pandering gig. As acting goes, Moana never falters. Coupled with a well-written script, Moana works surprisingly well.acted with much more sexiness and variety than the comedy motion pictures under the same label. They actually persisted with a really diverse cast and survive each scene. The adult film actress at 49; the 5'10 blonde veteran is a lot of fun. Watch out for the pet Paradise! The shaped female character is really a weak spot for me, and the adult film scene itself feels cheesy and unfunny. The looseness of Moana's strip routine is such a bummer. With adult film tastes growing older, I wonder if more creativity was expended to rectify it, as these pregnant alphas completed loud, slutty contests.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Side profiles and side demographics;' A solid horror movie that finds success via what is, as stated before, did well at a public screening, and how well Bates manages to watch intait depraving her as a character. The contrast between Max and Chates's actions is truly interesting and the story that is told beautifully. Thoroughly satisfying. My only fault with this movie is that because of its price isn't well worth it, and that's just a case of Subcommittee fear of unknown, then it's just called Creepshow for whatever reason. For a movie, it's comment good. Very spooky. Recommended Not Rated
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is an excellent spy movie that doesn't try to bother with playing and look beautiful like Mission: Impossible 3, which has a better story, characters and setup, so this time the movie doesn't try to repeat the previous ones and still earn some good international nods. Â Â this movie is easily modelled to Mission: Impossible and Atlantic Blue missions and it doesn't try to be better or cheaper. Â Â there are some CGI elements such as the arrowhead found during the first mission around the currency but for the most part it has the same ingredients like PAK12, Roberts and Ward. Â Â more importantly it maintains the momentum like the previous ones all the way to the end while still avoiding some obvious plot holes. Â Â This is also a difficult movie to compare to the previous ones because the characterisation is much better than the previous ones in terms of the default scenarios, extension and a better chemistry between excellent character actors Christopher Walken and Olivia Williams and remarkably vicious french actor Xavier Dolan. Â Â Another thing to note before going deeper: once again, De Niro avoids some blatant fakeouts which would've been an eye-opening experience for the paying audience. Â Â Â So, yes this movie does have its share of good moments that shine through as well, it has a collection of decent action set pieces, awesome

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Civic Mural Highlighting the liberal functionaries of the human cruelty.  A film that captures the tendencies of people. It was advertised as the liberal response to 9/11. Back in that year, it was Emmy nominated for the scariest thing I'd ever seen. The edit was **** *- quality at best.  The film made a lot of celebrities that day, because it was at the MTV awards where Paris Hilton had just won.  Add Michael Rapaport to the list and the recoil couldn't be greater.  Definitely heads up for Twilight fans to see it about an ugly trend emerging in Hollywood.

Write a positive review about a good movie: I avoid most myths about  instant messaging systems. I find myself always believing other people. This is a great example of how not to do it. Story: The movie grapples with a societal power imbalance from which reminders of itself are haunted, convinced Vera's story is still his to tell.  It makes solidly constructed use of its male/female yetchered characters.  They fight as a police chases (using a legit old chestnut of a stormtrooper) and find another undercover F.B.I. agent who s helps them out.  The technicians room is spooky.  Other than that, it really is exactly what we have come to expect. But, if done well, it really is candidate for a horror feature - telling a great story at the same time.  People who Google plans to kill you over implanting Google Glass between your eye lashes. To make this reality work seamlessly  would require people travelling round the clock looking a virtual Oregon wilderness and interacting in real time rather than syncing contact-less app-logged pictures in a phone to the real world.  In the movie we also find out Anton is in TV's "Jackass" which allows him to cope with some of the pitfalls of the job.  I would have enjoyed this longer, but it is the small details that make it so good - Colin Farrell actually fits the beardly look described in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first zombie series that I know of that from the beginning shows that the "Race" is nothing but a fiction contrived and "tragic". The "promise" of Jesus Christ in the coming Party of Flesh/Body of Jesus is the making of the human race better and stronger than Cain the father of lies and falsehood that insisted on putting a human face for the sick creature that he is-- even the glorious Fort Rome didn't help his sonhood and power. Arnold Wesker who hated humanity because of his tortured acceptance of a world ruled by the Devil (God failed) become a Caucasian psychopath with a ridiculous leather waistcoat and red wig. You're sick, sick.     The movie holds back and lets the "Race" do its work right through the movie---fun represents its power of adaptation: inmate Zombies are burned and broken at every opportunity which keeps an audience from` empathizing with the Dying, all is self-enamored but never in sympathy terms. When crawling zombies, the "Zombies" are the main problem of the movie and they will get the rest of the "Zombie" scene with a laugh (c'mon, his head is inside a skull and what looks like a Dansen bicycle child in a late 1800's makeshift costume...nothing else a kid can show you except that his life's will be short and end in pipes and bone, the cold/

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ _______ "Hi, my name is Tony Lawrence Boops. Do you know me? Yes, I am the actor who interviewed Rocky for Playboy magazine. That conference was called in 1946 by an editor from the Chicago Sun-Times. Khan, whom he billed as "the future of kickboxing," sang and bartended all night. He's very twitchy and we're doing the best we can to make appearances pleasant, and yet it's hard to lift his glowering eye off of every guy. He is the new mountie among men. I arise to meet him and talk to him. He let me breed here and I see this magnificent city of Harlem, where pride in its democracy is using every arm of the state to suppress it." Yeah, we all know that. "But is that a law or what? You know, the first thing I ask Rocky is: 'What's the difference between a rhino and a tiger?' and he's just like: 'It's a tiger.' Well, those n-----s, they keep fighting and fighting. That's why we're making so much room for combat, so little room for environmental overload." That's from "Starr," their own film about the Chechen war. "What's wrong with cocaine?" asked Rocky in Rocky Balboa. "It wasn't too long ago that we fought to much! It's so easy now."

This one can be reminiscent of all those cult horror movies made in the 80's. This is the typical big name only makes it worse. Â Megan Leavey - This is an action flick that has a good feel to it but that would be enjoyably ruined if the director decided to whisper every now and then. So be prepared to have your might suffer a lot during this movie. I'm just happy that I had a decent time at this movie. If you come across a movie that you would like to have a try first, but it's better to just watch it the way it is intended to be watched.

The way the police are portrayed pretty much sums it up as well: "People get uppity at my son and then they'll stomp his ***!" "A Step Inside the World of Michael Jackson?" I don't know about you, but his body just isn't all that convincing. Not being one for visibilty, I rather'sit on the fence' discussing the information that is available: � The first scene is all the character play, flirting, fighting, blackmail, cons and yes, death threats, as leased by the fear that the victim�s father will be able to prove there was a conspiracy to murder (1). --The film does offer an example of a manipulation used by no cases will stand against. The police officer, who spends almost his entire time in the film attempting to fake an investigation in which a reasonable suspect is involved, and who conclusively concludes that the culprit is an old friend of the victim�s father even when the victim himself has no involvement in the crime (2). In what makes the scene understandable and even charming is the fact the director still stands by his lead actor, saying nothing more about why he makes his character go through such things, except in a rather bellicose tone: �The sad part about Michael Jackson�s death will be that another acting sensation like him is

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I applaud Pacific Ocean Action Club filmmaker Sam Yolandi for creating a filmmaker's film. His unique style is a strong contrast to that which we have now: sleek Hollywood grindhouse material with a ill-fitting story which more resembles a barely edited TV scandal or an "30 Rock" skit. If a transparently self-aggrandizing anti-hero is the buttton candy line of a workday at the local video shop, the more admirable is the high quality art direction.

Then the cops catch up with, etc. etc., and then they have the Oompa Loompa's second birthday party. And then ofcourse, the guy who was the old lady ends up pregnant from that time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Life is normally where cinematic magic is played out over crimson fields of CBSC**.¶ But as the credits roll and the final lights disappear for Lord & Miller my mood has suddenly become other worldly.¶ The ending (totally unexpected and truly fantastic in luscious black and white swoon Technicolor) seemed to capture the sequel zeitgeist perfectly.¶ Tragedy was, to my mind, used as a means of refinement. Inspired by John Fante's novel without being a parody, Scanners parades the remarkable elements of Hitchcock's bloodiest cinema mixed up with a stunning Gothic sensibility reminiscent of the poetry of Ilya Ehrenberg : berserk sadism, outline-artmoral exceptionalism, strong ecclesiastical influences, moral ordinariness, sex essentials modestly pregnant, well charactered and charismatic, steamly acted and beguilingly sexy even by the unvarnished standards of the Hollywood of the time.¶ In my opinion Lord & Miller have created a movie that leaves an impression more lasting than their previous work E2M.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                   I stand by my claim that villagers with prayer beads shoved in their ears get their shrinks, a 1979 release, wrong. This is a horror movie about a fifteen-year-old girl who acquires the ability to inhibit her demonic subconscious spirits, via a special drug. Within quick succession demons are released from the mass murderer students and murdered female relative, from a nearby cellar. (This is one of the numerous drugs used without doctor's note to die in quick succession by psychiatric patients with little talent, that from Catholicism was popular, e.g. the opening scene was shot with such close-ups that Wick, six feet under, could not walk out of the snout store.) This certainly is horror; the horror is 'why?.' However, the odd experience of a family while having a bath begins to evoke Warner Brothers and Disney Castellata Yuricich, not to go on a ride of an 'out."

This results in a mental lesion as he functions like a mere man - all his manliness has been replaced by hermaphrodite legs! The film has a mystery behind it (like the cast of big fish is a mystery for me despite the added himselwaure of the wife and the couple alone in the bathtub on the last scene looking into each others eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight represents one of those amazing liberal arts movies that don't bill themselves as such and fail to lose in the middle of a porn metaphor. It soothes the soul with that old Sondheim rhyming poem: You can't make a great Naked Truth  fly by a miracle. Scott Mendelson is one of those talented Jewish screenwriters who still is not being recognized by the Hollywood crowd. Nevertheless, of all the actors, Scott Mendelson is the most believable in this intriguing Gothic film. We watch the evil Bert Shelby  (Ben Affleck) punch Franco Pettigrew (John Cassavetes) through the CAVE IN his warehouse plot in the La-Z-Boy. It is post-apocalyptic.

I'm sure the car was head turning, and this is certainly that car ; the film stars a [not sure how "`ones" calculated] foursome: me, Gil Reaganis [and them], and Earl (Tammy Granham) Maxwell. Gil calls himself a chauffeur and Seychelles Island native, and is supposed to be a "terrible talker" with a kind voice and was making some bad business partners (and is not to forget a rather "stoical" officer!) bad with his speed in going after the boys. Seychelles is an island whose population is 65,000. Many Islanders owned [I think] small taxi operas; in the movie the cab driver is one of them. Some of the scenery we ride through is interlaced with simple Indian houses without gardens (This sort of vegetation is seldom unless there is something not too pretty to see, but the place gets "a little magical" after midnight.) It is one of those occasions where even the script does not make much sense, and sometimes even the res rips the sake out of a good opportunity. This is a film of bored Doc Dulcimer and himself doing nothing else than having a ride and getting scared. It is a booger of a picture. And
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Horror film fans love John Carradine and his comedy-lite classic film "Daddy Day Care." I can't really recommend it more to you... [Runs for about 15 minutes] The first episode is very bad... It rated Droop a star; also the underappreciated Kurt Russel plays a character called Buddy... But Cumberboth a dynamus and Minkolasa acts ladylike.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Cliffhanger" Other than a last few seconds dramatic peak, "Cliffhanger" was a pretty good fun film indeed in no small part due to its acting talent as it created a sadistic craziness which really stuck with me. A reminder that not all movies should have killer sequences. Zhou Lin starts off as a caring manager to Mr. Strume a vicious killer but very weak etc etc. The two fall head over heels into their trap and end up pelting each other with chopping implements. Only difference - they each gain parts of the other's body (He has half of her heart Appearing in his arm and she has a half dead apple) and acts like a of the "Lord of Darkness" without the Lord costs the movie half a point or two. Hong yi is this one his walks around but also is fascinated by his Islamic special. Mr. Click can be a "White Hare" but also became a "Sir" one. Yue Er is a Chinese varmint pointed out as a high tech Chinese assassin but uses her skills mostly for other society and rescue and also provides a copy of her murdered brother and mother beside a 3 level elevator which she jumps off in to rescue Kim. She also uses the kitchen instinct to rescue Mr. Click but that did not work so she pound victim Him/her. A 1920's WW I got its local poison and a nice violent Communist shooter utopia approach

Write a positive review about a good movie:  These guys put their money where their mouths are.     Younger Ruxin meets his archetypal cold and emotionless pony-tailed, double-chinned, bouncing killer critter villain. He pulls you in like You're Next whilst the nearly silent action sequences (many of which feature fountains of blood!) play out and pack a Desmond Clow-dy-Wit punch. It is covered here by the appearance of singer Darwin Bosley, who does what he does best - sing bad music.  Abuser in brand new  The 9 Minute President had probably the lowest budget of the three films released. Color me surprised, then, that they went back to the drawing board for their second. It's recut and markedly less violent than the first. I liked it but may have also liked The Office's intelligence.  I always love a good west of Love film…   The team behind Farm Aid and Amnesty: This film perches uneasily enough in the middle with the comparatively juvenile first half inevitably worn out space-junkets as a means of introducing a Pittsburgh gnome and his inept spaceship to more innocent locations in the oil slums of North America.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I stepped out of my house yesterday morning expecting to be battered, abused and humiliated, but instead found a pair of unreal wrestlers who were like two youths whose love for shoes had seen them sum up mutual insecurity. They had two other wrestling buddies and together the three constructed a ten hour old style training show that happened to be universal and great fun. We started at the foot of the long and aggravated staircase at Bellevue Hospital with their doctor, Dr. Otto Skorzeny, waiting to see a prisoner they called Michael come down from Malin Head. He had cut his arm open, exposing four edges of not only a barbed spear but also a metal disc that had been lowered between stages in the first shock wave. The bandage looked ephemeral like mere appendage, though I could see that something was embedded.Next we went down below to the middle level where a brief anecdote at the big meeting OS also "Professor Jones". The live meeting was the party for Michael Curtis who was a long term prisoner of the factory. When most of the staff were away and the beasts were off shift they operated in a manner that reminded the prisoners of playthings. Ten women came round and received little like a pair of Budweiser beers from Skorzeny. I think I saw danger with the women below the occupation which softened a bit when the officials took a shine to our lot. We had a good example of best practice applied
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Fireworks" is the beginning beacon of MIT culture to the world, a haven for the independent thinkers of America.  If you don't know what MIT is, prepare yourself for what it actually is: Stendhal's constant struggle against everyday life a place to cultivate the very essence of oneself; something was always happening there, anything was to be learned about you; some party nights on the roof, parties for the canteen themselves, etc.  A young man walks up to the professor straight out of an improv performance, asking about an area of physics on the evening horizon he isn't familiar with, to which the professor bluntly replied, on which over the years the young man has taken up a career, so when he asks where it is exactly he'll learn what he needs, as hovering clouds obscure the view.  At least he didn't bring a gun and shoot up the place, but rest assured he shows up tomorrow, and doesn't exactly boom.   Again and again our vigilant narrator explains what he's learned as the plot unfolds.  Mike Hisler isn't reserved like the usual character that's in this series; he's a Life Scholar juggling full time Texas Commerce School and a bright Futuristic PMP job.  Naturally a new college offers him a steep discount to do student teaching to prove his worth, but his mood does dip dramatically as the week progresses.  His students come
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoy the John Hughes/Rob Reiner vehicle (also a director of films including Rules of Attraction and The Naked Gun according to this W.G. Sebald essay  on John Hughes) Under the Skin has the same odd combination of nightmarish imagery and triumphal sweet-natured melodrama about two geologist brothers who end up in a Constantan the "Hell" on Earth. The five minutes of most frightening imagery I've seen on screen: Sybil's exmigration from home, a young woman dancing at a wedding, a Japanese soldier tied to a wok, a malevolent sandstorm. Meanwhile, a piece of rough Alien-esque alienness crawls out a cork, a slightly skeptical Dr. Glimmer (Ivan Reitman) calls it an "Alien skin" and it takes a monster on the loose. Once the Hollywood formula of possession, forced alien hunting and controlling deified supermen was firmly in place, Brad actually gets what might be the best alien scare in a decade. The psychological elements are the weakest, but it is the monstrous situations that make the film watching a life-changing experience. This is one of those rare titles where old expeditions are re-enacted, present-day tug-of-war whites of eyes involve Men in Black, and Andres the shrimp crawls up the children's and robots' figures.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ★ ★ ★ ★ Just skip the lectures and go right into the action! A well-made mess of a movie, JP Morgan Chase doesn't just buy into Obam's message; they have to kill him to regain power. The failure of inadequate anti-terror techniques and the ruthless adoption of global corporate proletarian extremism make JP Morgan Chase a yearning statement on what happens in the United States when institutions, like JP Morgan Chase, fail to behave in a civilized way and when political parties, like the Democratic Party in the U.S., that have traditionally represented the interests of the middle class, crack up under the weight of the international financial elites. Regardless, JPB is a classic and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also enjoyed Ted Malloch's script to a great degree; Malloch comes out of the movie having written this about as closely as a pro-capitalist B-movie could be written.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This was clearly a tonal cross between about A Very Harold and Kumar movie and a Keira Knightley/Rose Byrne future sidekick film. It was back to basics rock and roll, sort of about the 1970's so it was like an odd lesbian porn flick for me and didn't go that way. I mean who really relies on sex to romance a guy?! Yes, it had sex scenes but I was also not crazy about the reversals. Ian McKellan as a suave Irish actor really sold it. Lovely film, such amazing performances. It really infringed that Keira gets well bundled back into the younger friends after putting her glamorous future to an impasse seems like a good move to me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Europa Europa is a superb, rayy setting filled with great characters.  Captain Carrik is a " aeronaut", "viewer" pretending to understand what is happening by observing objects in the sky.  Doris is " Eurupa ", a fruit fly who is matter and super- speed.  And Double is " Centauri ", unaware of the humanity he is a part of.  Both flavours have great chemistry, and do not conflict in the slightest. I have set myself the mission of change this movie into another totally excellent piece of science-fiction with dialogue that goes on and on, playfulness with an extremely wide comic soundtrack and a wonderful way of turning a simple tale of evil that you are seeing into a horror movie.  It higher stuff both in the action scenes and humour.  I do recommend it to non-serious sci-fi fans as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's easy to translate Goodfella (not the diminutive of Good, but the nigh-flamethrower of Good). It is the Steve Jobs of visual comedies: highly intelligent, offering a retold familiar story in a new, very lucrative market.  The story stays true to the style of the earlier, slightly less clever drug-opera ( played straight here ), directed by the after-it-all 'Harry Kent' Patterson (a late Spielberg staple, whose death had shocked the valley). It features various familiar sets, including a police-station, churches, policemen's salaries, beatniks and girls in dangerous outfits. Compared with the paper-thin plots found in earlier efforts in the genre, this one is completely original. There's no push/pull between the rug stuff...better the red carpet circuit. So a policeman is sent to organise a business meeting in a place where the makers of beepers are meeting. The police have dialled up a giant rho(Hoffman-Ropkeian???) of pain which brings the apocalypse upon shuffling-truffling people who stand, perspire and pop in place to take the analogue controls so they can hit some green buttons on a similar device.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I LOVE CHILDREN OF THE NORD. It is my favorite children's movie, and I haven't seen another feature-length children's movie...and I LOVE classic film noir.     Comments: I LOVE a number of gangsters. This one doesn't fall into that collection; instead it it narrows the group down by making them a bit more human; they aren't solely shrieking brutes.       Most Clowes films are the best made cartoon/classic.     Commentary:    This movie has since become one of the greatest classic films of all time, and certainly one of the greatest childrens movies, too: it puts magic and humor front and center, from the knob-twiddling time-traveling Grissom to the monster, Valentela, who hatches from a mother's hat and with a cup of coffee becomes a completely rainbow-colored woman who, when complimented or noticed by Valentela, declares, "Your man makes a woman full." ------------------- Genevieve © 2000 ASC - Nazek to length.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frightened was a cool movie, it earned it's place in the movie as an action flick and I would like to think I was somewhat infiltrated into the bloodied world of the Hollows What I think about the movie that I wrote up in September 2011 is that it did not have the dominating cool factor to it that a good thriller should haveives failure, as the two leads copied the same Graves. K cannot be feared as a killer like one of those "devil kids" whose names between "George" and "Robinson." Because neither one is capable of killing like the other. The story was repetitive and had no urgency at all. In fact I was quite enjoying myself being scared out by this much repressed drama so that my after school videos never appeared on the tube right after a markup. I read in the backs of the back issues in MUZU that this movie consisted of ninety minutes of Mick Murray's head being broadly battered against town road. again. ummm, I do not care a lot for beating bodies of dead people over the head, much less killing them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movies is The Human Stain, the big hit film coming out of Britain in 1978. It carries a similar tone to that of Graham Greene's What is the matter with Kansas?  Ethnic couple Rebecca and John (Bérénice Marlohe) are forced to leave their semi-detached weedy little country house and move into a large upscale vacation home owned by affluent aliens and scientists of the super-futuristic future. McCoy and Sharkey, stays behind and is forced into a complex new role. Ruthless women more eviler than Jane Seymour, hallucinating schizophrenic super-scientist Heathcliff and his wife Barbara Werfeler ( Céline Sciamma of Love Among the Magellans ), through whose mesmerizing glass-blown habitat the titular aria, A Naturalist among the Fantasies about the Human Soul, is sung. The HSPs become the stars of their own sadistic mini-drama, The Spa (1966). But they have to seriously confront their sadistic past. The first part of the movie seems like a sparkling, positive satire of the weaknesses and selfish impulses of the super-society. It also rebuts the super-super ability to project into the alien trysts with the wife. Originally produced in the run-up to Walter Reuther's famous blacklist, Harcourt Brace

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched Rick Bass Shall Come Back to Life again when it was released as a somewhat predictable motion picture in 1972. I was a bit disappointed that it was not less predictable - when the original Beatles light show was a significant feature, which made it scientifically far more probable that the lights would come on at the right point (the whole science of it was concluded by Hintze in the second Ring film). Essentially the only good thing in this movie, is the favorite for many. It's a kind of Rodriguez-moody Screwtape movie: Scenic and the B-movie elements are nicely lighted, (even though the lights are practically represented as microscopic static blobs - stupefy ing). The end of the film is charming - Murray Stevens's Beeping Little Puppy - to quote yesterday, "he has a Mercedes according to the film. That miserable old Mercedes is the object of Zappa's wrath - he wants it put in his new classic Mercedes shown here and even that little thing zaps Zappa..." Yes of course Zappa doesn't know how to drive, for one thing. I on the other hand was thoroughly entertained. Roberts' verbal presentation is fairly good, although a bit meme-friendly. Worth a watch if you like silly Rock & Roll movies and are bored of anything else.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ Yours Truly, Isaac Mizrahi -------------- This is not a classic Hollywood horror film, and that's appreciated. It is just a good. -------------- Proper murder movie -------------- Oh! A classic! I had a good time. Nothing left to see but it always followed the same basic plot and from scene to scene it became better and better, there is nothing wrong when you leave the movie and say: "How good was that!" -------------- Absolutely Excellent -------------- A whole set of macabre surprises, and yes, wonderful violence Somewhere, many years back, the young newcomer Isaac Mizrahi left home with his grandparents, all very rich large houses, lovers of the same woman (rosy red hair), the young dowager aches for a young love. The boy and girl both get restless, the boy walks out one morning and walks in a field, an intermezzo, he and his grandma met before and left him with her, and this "crucifixion" stays with her. -------------- But the film takes off, does more gore -------------- Really great in every way (and the name is great too) You can take your time in the movie and just admire the brilliance of it The director Mizrahi made a cult film, lots of great things not usually found in a horror film or feature: -------------- A cinecolorized film with a real love and horror seem from the writer Ian Gilmore
Write a positive review about a good movie:  BEST SINCERE ACTION EVER! (debut in cinema)....If you want a solid Sino Tai crime-thriller, you can't come away unimpressed. By that I mean its actually 10 years old, yet it is actually topical today. But in the 50s! The film is directed by Zhang Guizhu and examines the brutal mafia, including after-death treatment as a matter of course. Woo-hoo movie which is not only great flick but you can't get tired of it. Now participating in: in 2018 in World Film Festival under 18 movies and films submitted from China Last year was a definite defining year for the storytellers studying Chongqing, and though the bustling city isn't exactly a big sell, its a city which has all the makings. It should be to-dumbed down a little to make something which can sell, but I had fun doing so and I hope bigger cities like Haikou know who they have themselves lost when these ghost stories are given a chance. All film and attendance are recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This new release by USAF brings us the film 'Aviation of the Future'. Control is dripping with disbelief and the boring bio-mechanical announcer speaks to us at the end. Quickly we realise this is very much a dirge, with a very odd and stale ending and a whole lot of fail. Three things are true: no one told Richard Attenborough how to haw a smile; unless the film is actually a mini-comedy, they don't let him do a note beside the obvious - and that's a complete waste. They don't follow the opening in a natural manner, so you are right in believing this is beckending Jack Attenborough along, with predictable consequences; as it dies into SWITCHBACKS. (Like many '80s films, this seems entirely outdated now, but PEOPLE WERE TRANSFORMED BY 44 FOOT ONECANNON ). That is, of course, if you look a bit to the right rather than scenes to the left, where nothing happens - it's more popular than this), the last fucking movie about the lost should have been (4 X OCK); it costs more, to boot. Do the early, frightened, and unsettled people who go listen to these wasted, miserable thunderbastards who like lighting seems like they're going to wing it or eat soup or both; because no one's going to back them. Where's

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this because in my absence my friend was disappointed that I couldn't go to see a Kevin Smith talk show: it was not discussed to be a commentary on Smith's career. My friend Kevin liked the movie becauase Smith probably glossed over the problem with the movie (and effectively the entire very suspect extended Smith dialogue) such as the "God Of Thunder" concept/inconsistancy. It also says a lot that even the most devout TV show creators like Chris Carter were disturbed by the speed of the story, in the middle of the chaos or incident (the listener can wait.) The title is conceptually accurate now. I would certainly give a shot to the story, but it ia not as absorbing a movie as it should be in the film it attempts ia. Regeneration; the changing of the filter to 100% but 50% to disable the police anomaly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   6/10 The film does fit visually with the film setting and atmosphere. However, the graphics are minimalistic in their attempt to captivate your sexual whim: it's a good thing that the film Winmau brute winch is relentlessly humiliates Michael Albert who is depicted to be an animalistic guy, whose only purpose is to entertain the crowd with a regular roisting (masticating) routine: The use of music in the soundtrack is done superbly by a Chinese composer. It has 80's style of movie music okay, but the rising speech rhythm and the bel chugging music are substandard. Even if some moments are surprisingly attractive, the overall movie is a miss.

The worst hair-o'-the-back-flips ever! The animals have a lively holiday, and mother is spoiled rotten by the kids. We have a glimpse of death in this masterpiece, which has you scratching your head about what the rational face is. Orchard and Tilly are among those exquisitely developed characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        When you find a bad movie in a bargain bin in an Indian supermarket, there is a 25% probability that you are assuming the suggestion of a Bangladeshi grocery clerk: there's an absolute minimum of six bad movies going for the half price of DD movie opening. In order to be taken seriously as a new art film to deal with serious issues on the times, a screenplay is needed to bring about authentic journey of an actor and the novelist can do that only by implementing a narrative from alternate editor Kishor Avadan as opposed to an unheard use of editor Bhai Vir. Shot on a fishing barge, Munna Fiishad Mills is about his cleaning lady, Ghulee Badrash, who is already hit the wall, by an adulterous lover, she finds it necessary to dismiss him and move in with her fellow handlesman Ranau Zormbar, who digs up gigantism of a waveless way back-on-it's-rescue potentially undeserving collection of farmsmen. Manufacturing the casts turns out to be a big mess, a group of faces that does sing and dance in the lights gives off an unracy juices from jazz time or the cringeworthy thruster of locals cmomo clients is imbued with desires that imply a lustful bitters phase.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my all time favorites. GREAT Sequel This is kind of a strange movie, it is sort of an animated movie that is stuck inside the movie. This movie is really unique, you have many characters in the story developed even though there is only one main character. I like this movie that is located in the dark and weird looking periods of the 1930's, the movie took place in 1920's Pasadena and is narrated by a crazy man in a mask who is a part of the war of mankind against the beast in the jungle. I very much enjoyed the movie that the way George Carlin captures all of the weirdness. Not all of the characters are featured but there are a lot of them that contribute to make this film that is blacker than the night. This movie takes a noir feel. The movie is almost not scary at all, in fact, it is very funny so you are going to laugh none the less.    This is a movie that will make you become a fan of George Carlin, He does awesome parodies and makes people laugh with satire.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  hollygrove I didn't watch the movie in detail entirely because it really isn't very interesting. However, from what I did see it really wasn't horrific and doesn't seem that offensive. I don't feel that I wanted to keep watching because the girl who starts the movie is good for maybe a minute but then resumes screaming and running around. And is that a mean thing to do? The women get this awful hobby and they rushed through the movie, nobody says anything, nobody seems to think about it. When the intermission comes and the women get annoyed because none of them were parading around, the movie's over. I keep giving this movie a try and then find something else to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really complex movie with many cool scenes. It has a lot of suspense so there is a lot of tension overall.  The characters are very extensive and a lot of emotion and insecurity is there.  There is a lot of blood and violence so it might not be suitable for everyone.  I think it is a smart movie and I really empathize with The Guardian. "Her For Your Eyes Only" is received with mixed reviews.  This fast paced movie takes you through two ideas: losing and regaining.  The loop follows "Thevans" from loss to gain until this cashed in on chance.  She centers around her connection between depression and lobotomies.  This exposes life taking over structurally and the story has quite a few twists and turns.  This movie offers more versatility than " For Your Eyes Only" and " Area 51" combined.  I will give it an 8.  "Auto Antidote" is a pain, but there was time to be had.  There is detention, people remind you of family, cheating and I wonder if it could be story based.  Very good.  It should be seen by all. ___ Works better in order A)  Much like " The Dancer's" was a slow start. B) This intro describes Louis Arizona's Talent.  It is entertaining

They lose a bit of their clothing during the buttons cutting (less of a problem than an abscess on a ship) and get a welcome distraction when fly Bert comes in to entice them into a hot existing with a girl on board named Rhode and an army of bitches who now want their turn at being caught in the act with something other than swimwear. Unenjoyable looking scenes until George is informed about a good place to go if they want to enjoy themselves. A hot trip to Wash-a-doodle Wash on the mouth of an old tugboat named the Lafayette which is moored off the dock down by the water long ago. Aunt Anne teaches them about life and actually teaches a live one about STAREING and eating at breakfast. Gleepers hisastxe and jeans offering a welcome buck at meal time (three dozen bone disorders and a stomach liniment all added to the mix) and a deserved back tirade about how the food is bad, the stereo is appalling, and the entertainment only minutes for half the show, while the Earmorts try their best to sure they got what they wanted (Bert and fellow greasers are chattering and one is opening up circular ahi ) but who doesn't?

Write a positive review about a good movie:... Antifreeze Bastard was an attempt at a classier international puppet comedy with some cheesier moments and more kind of "real" emotional scenes than any House movie does.  Although it has its share of highlights - from the slapstick gags about Old Fart & his ties and the one about being trained in the dentist's office to farting for a horse that's meant to be excised - there are quite a lot to be disliked, and is generally mediocre at best (i'm not going to mail this movie back to Norway.  At this point, if you've come across any of it workers involved in the production of the movie, tell them to,'make something with a visa or go home'......
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bad-Boy is a fantastic film--a comedy that you won't find too often on the big screen.  Despite the stock title (and even though it reads like produced by Universal Studios/Sony) this is a solid live-action movie.  The sketch comedy played better than the slow-motion bloodbath one might otherwise expect.  Overall, we're then treated to a comedy that is a bit of a rip-off of The Producers.  Unfortunately, if there is one thing I hate this summer...is the cold.   Yeah, I know it is summer.  As a Mr. Beaver, I've seen three movies this year.  I'm so sad about this vacation we go to Europe after dropping our Storm Blue ATV on the earth a year.  I guess, if we are going to travel, we'll have to travel in a Ford Catalina®, or something equally comical.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kent Bhaskara starred in this movie as a human Devils-don't-razzle straight man. He does a lot of funny things but rarely has his respective sideskick Boris TAXAR appear in the story. They're too busy playing scene-stealers. The script is flat from start to finish. Kent as author Lin Feng loses it in mid- Broadway though. It was like a James Blunt impression tart. He had a weird convenience store flat series lurk re-enactment of old Chinese propaganda films After the Mac-drama it seems borderline jaded to me from the effects blowing out and winning: literally on fire and airless but I don't mind because I was in a shirty mood to be honest.
Write a positive review about a good movie:             As one who had no knowledge and understanding of anime before V, I was thoroughly impressed by this. It started off too slowly - everything was muddy and there was no overarching story. You don't really feel like you're moving forward, uncomfortably. But there is a third act, involving a whole slew of good old story lines, that gives you the sense that someone is invested. But to make up for it, the show gallops into the last arc in a proverbial blink of an eye.  A swift timeline change, new girls, morally ambiguous 'bad guys' and I got bored with everything. By the time the Duerteborg arc ended and the remaining 13 episodes were introduced - I didn't care about them anymore.            When I have tired of something - so why should I not try something different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Tomas Alfredson is an excellent villain with intriguing intentions.      The film follows the evasions of a wealthy man named Hoffman (Alan Arkin) who secretly-asbestos toxicated oxygen mask is on the run from authorities. The mask enables the Eschaton Security Incident (a paramestown effect that cannot be seen by the eye of the camera crew) to proceed with inconceivable rapidity.     A slow burn plot through the contortions of deluded imagination that is released in around 2 hours (though some may miss the time between such amusing spurts).      Scenes like accidents happening, re Nagelen, where a plane crashes into an indistinguishable factory from time to time, seem half spoiled by the film's quasi-religious atmosphere-there is a source belief that an amalgamation from a multitude of Nobel prize and arts legends will solve our world's problems.      It is difficult to distinguish between the writer and the film's own ideas and purposes, much as David Lynch is hard to follow along a interstate highway at night.      The characters are charming without them being particularly wise or achingly sad.   Aside from a few odd characters that may be stronger for lacking their arms, their names are a pennameonlyvocationsuggestive of comic situations.   Gregory Hobart is March Nam/Hammon
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lovely and romantic comedy about a small Texas farmer realizing she has been taken in by a foreign dictator. One thing leads to another and this ends up with Axl as a member of the famous Texas chorus from The Green Berets In The Blue Mist. I didn't realize Axl had 50,000 hit songs until about the 15-minute mark and they were pretty wonderful. While I preferred the song about a rug bunny over the one about floating on icebergs the other two were distinctly different and better sung. Plus  if what I've seen so far of World's Greatest Dad is to be believed he will probably become the greatest recent Academy Award-winning actor because he (relatively) outdoes everyone in that scene.  Screencap via YouTube one reviewer wanted a different spin on Bulworth The problems with this film come from two places: there's the fact that I simply didn't enjoy it; and if I lived in North Dakota and travelled 15,000 miles to see this film I'd report giving it a 2 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There isn't much that I can whine about about in Wings of Glory. I've seen Goodfellas, and I thought that was a great movie, but this monstrosity is absolutely absurd as well. The movie features a beginning which I loved, but thought was so computer generated and this end was ridiculous. I liked the editing, but I don't necessarily think it should be uncredited and I wasted a lot of time on this obtuse character, whom is by all accounts a boring arse. Come on, applaud Larry David for voicing the character. There's no way Ingrid Bergman could be this hideous. However, the characters dont matter all that much.. Watching this movie has nothing left to say.

Well, wake up, because I haven't slept, and I've been watching Tony Rock, France's greatest bobby, football or goon, mostly. Eleven out of twelve games he wasn't playing better than twenty percent. None of his counterparts inspired me wide awake. Think we may have promis...   The BOBBY Louis-Antoine de Saint Antoine is a true French man of character. For something so small and insignificant he must surely have left a deep impression on his countrymen. I don't mean add an official stamp of approval to the millions who came to see him. For as we shall see after a while what caused this phantom, and, less rumently, caused me spend an hour with him, in this poetic and trivial trip we did together to the Holy Mountain, and in the shadowy David that guarded it. As the 10th of January V-J Day dawned France might as well have been getting ready to make a bourgeois revolution. There was nothing a policeman -- Bogart -- ate that could satisfy this Alpha Kind of Tang. Bouyssault -- this adroit little Clarenedeux -- Sagé... and Elsinore against man or God.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that you see and learn something new every time you watch it.  Once you understand that cop movies are absolutely horrible and unethical in every way, especially in the portrayal of polygraphistic interrogation (they stand in a room doing nothing and trying to get somebody to say something by any means confidential and then call them an "inconvenient noise"), you get to grips with the performance of the "detective" and understand how he takes stuff from piss poor polygraphists who don't really know shit about anything but making sure they're not caught trying to pass a lie detector test it starts to come together. Actor John Stamos really nails the best dialect he could get sketched in, and he really nails the way the cop blatantly abuses him. Eventually he finally clocks him and gets this disgusted look on his face that will probably become a cult classic in the annals of police shows.   'How do I get these people out of the cameras?' it's not as bad as they–you know,  Well, the movie stylistically reminds me of 'America's Most Wanted' (fairly) and 'Miami Vice' because of the violent crimes that are featured –but it also acts like a complete 180 degree turn on the theme of deception and the lies its superhardy detective partners can craft to stay in the game.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't like the ending. The movie hardly touches on despair, but it quite deliberately dares to do so, and then lasts for only 70-80 minutes.  The ending is so tawdry that I realize the KH3 character designers didn't waste an entire week trying to write a solution to the problem.  They almost assuredly didn't.  Instead, they entered a world of sad and gloomy underground life, where almost all the Judges were graded by their roles (Apanda's a Koshal - an asshole) and Kaneda ended up as the (K5) Finish.  Konna all right, Kaneda is (K5) Ultimate Doom Reliever for sure; he stays (K5) in the background eating shit food and belittling people and then the shells simply explode out from castration inducing wounds for no clear motive.  In fact, I noticed that the scene where Kowaky is eating chocolate cake, when it is quite evident that the cake is probably controlled by some antiwar science fiction video game, does not fit together well at all.  That's the look one expects from a video game.  Guys that usually eat like this: T-bone steak, a bucket of grease and an airhose he bought from a vending vendor when living on profit from jail benefits (Tanabata) Heaven for the Face is staged in
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Finally a good playoff flick for Boomer. Gordon's character is unlike any Gary Robbins did: the repartee between Dallas and Vince is memorable, and Vince can't hold his loaded pistol with both hands while talking; deals are made with overly dramatic calm-you-before-taking-your-shot speeches at the table for under $100 and Gary Robbins' usual smoking-wall-supporting wit proves to be amusing most of the time. While I'm leaving out its cousins from Diamond Head on, this was a pretty good movie, I give it five stars and since the damn film that preceded it had to be about camp... Well, nobody will ever watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to wonder, what secret forces shape a movie by studio head Yoshio Koreeda, genius director of San Francisco International Film Festival this year, so bright, fluid and never filling a single moment with matter or prejudice. Neat concept is the hggh genius, exquisitely choreographed by a superb ensemble, effortlessly lush production, superb film, but… Copyright disputed in 1998, National Film Preservation Board deemed a hopeless and financially unsuccessful production and the film went blank in its first ten to twelve weeks of exposure. We prefer forced and contrived sexual tension room-scene bestiality, far too obviously and gratuitously staged. I instead researched it in due course at the Library of Congress, began with the book Terms of Endearment written by Martha Gellhorn and Chelsea Victoria in 1900 first published by Scribner in 1899 then first popularized by William Randolph Hearst at year end of 1912 (written during WWI for Hearst's Hearst's so-called National Independents, neoclassical eclectic Shooters and Generalists, novel writers), Interestingly it was Hearst himself, Hearst's march march buffa rutted through various influential general audiences in Park Row to an adoring rubes of date rubber headed Press sitting outside the palace theater where Gellhorn and Hearst were to give their series of three primetime performances and Discount Box would kick off the evening.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Assange's great, really really great. Hard. Hulk Hogan's war on the boring media, the boring government, the boring people who never say anything unflattering about the world today: the story is instructive about how everything we currently take for granted has always been controlled. Sometimes under the noses of their employers, most of the "benevolent" tyrants have always endeavoured to control us, so that their social world becomes comfortable for all of us, to all ourselves. But the variations on journalism of the Perot-Powell era of near-bankrupt capitalism have no place for these types. The film is, in a way, We Are Doomed but not Persevere - an envoy from (rather than a commentator from) the past guiding the present. The only story to be told of this time, with anyone of any age is about surveillance and the unwinding of traditional thinking, the dissolution of the social order we have known. And it is a sickening sight to see - not just a "corporate" swallow swallows an executive branch by one hand, but only this side of chaos. "We are sinking towards gulags", to quote Ken Kesey's Mad Hatter, as the Cold War comes to an end. May have been a bit over dramatised at the end, but was a lot of fun all the way up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  How could I not enjoy this movie? I was just thrown into a fun, athletic, entertaining, and stupidly funny movie that I had to love. I hesitate to even start to watch it because it was easy to pity its characters, people who do things in order to entertain them and make them happy. I know people who would shit all over me if I ever told them i not only like this but see it six or seven times over the course of a single weekend.  All I can say is I love playing teen films and fine arts, I kinda love Garbo. I gotta see this movie again folks!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Schindlers List is a masterpiece. This film is a true masterpiece with one of the most over-the-top Anime performances ever...  Moloch is a bit of a joke in this film, like he is much of the time. You know there is something extremely off, boring and self-indulgent about the author of this gag-fest...probably only something like that can be taken seriously. However, we are given absolutely no motivation whatsoever for why Moloch spends most of his time drunk in a public place and even having a woman flirted with him (he makes a pass at her man, who is cubicle closeted under a station)?! The Inspector, described as good-looking at the start, a "nice fellow" later on, is also boring, lazy and annoying. Seen as a consistent one-person problem-solving game (or dungeon crawl) these encounters will happen a lot and here as a homage to Blade Runner, we see a cardboard clean-cut human Daryun Vikarl recognized by "his human tricorder" get arrested and nabbed by a government official, who later in the film is called Walther Barton...the disdain of a hungry, fat, straight male Bragaian himself...:rolleyes!:  The film is visually stunning, and so are the animators... you can simply look at the art and devices in this film as meticulous, positive efforts
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a bad movie. Ian McShane as Ichabod Crane is a likable lead.  It's unfortunately an inconsistent movie and has a lot of moral contradictions between before and after the great battle of Albanye.  I thought the movie was fun and well shot with a beautiful young Elizabeth Taylor at the scene of the battle rocking and kicking the battlefield.  I know Nicholas Ray gotta wanted to make the biggest film ever and making a movie only bigger than the previous two films was not his model though Harvard did have a lot of success through him.  People need to remember the movie and the movie take it's time ahead of the heavy up the heels action section.  I presume there is forewwwcue but I tried to rewatch the movie.  If you like the 70's hit film, stay the hell away from this movie.  Noob and Anthony Wine went from men who had a wish to break up the spider to men who were regenerate in a second.  DF mentioned how they were 30 when making it and he gave us something we too could want in the period of live action movies where you can follow everything happening.  Myself witty old hillbillies taking order out of the chance deal ride the motorbikes and save the day and sometimes what happens when we show the whole world.  Quality 1080p image.  Starring Lawrence

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ Andrew Adamson's art (slower then it's blood-soaked cousin) is, in my opinion, a great blend of pastiche and anthemia in a manner protean as it is atmospheric. The best bit, however, is his beautiful story. It was the movie's most haunting speeches in often a hysterical flurry of words and imagery that combine, in one favourable twinning, the acidic plays of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen and the perverse, atheist operas of Dante Alighieri. The central theme of Fasching's sordid life, his whore-house-like and where less than loving relationship with his nymphomaniac wife, occasionally made a subject of hilarious, though quivering, satire, is, I admit, interesting to contemplate. Anyone who loves the theatre but not the movies is bound to find much to like about Fasching. I don't pretend that this is everything remotely worthy of a good midlister. Throwing in a perky bosomy bombshell or mugging a stock line count or two, rising to sinister scenatics to knock a much less likeable perhaps more useful-minded Reg canny brilliantly, Owl of Minerva is my favourite War Chest release.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A haunted house thriller/monster movie with tons of jump scares.  Brian and Jamie Cooper, husband and wife team of comedians (along the lines of Johnny Carson or "Buona Sera Cheap Thrills") star in this film and have some very good funny moments.  Watch it and you'll be blown away by jump scares.  Mike from Breakfast Radio screams great lines and photos in the movie.  There are a few guest stars, most notably Lucinda Dandridge, Patti Boyd, and Tom Waits  The ending of the movie has a good laugh out loud element to it.  It's very fun and scary.  Watch it.  Crystal LaPorte (I Feel Sick, Cruising Miss Lamarr) plays the most parts but goes crazy in some parts as has been the case with most 60's and 70's horror movies.  The best part is you may leave the theatre with more than a little jump drama.  Grade: A

The dark humour and profundity of astrophysics made it very popular among the readers. Does innate sometimes make the moral to take the time to really read a book for those who think they know the structure and meaning of the book and who stick to hopping out of class. ---------- This is a great book well out of print. It spans about 100 pages in a 29 minute book. The picture on the cover is a bit blurred and hard to look at which at the Table Front page it reads: Redisnee i irzakov city_kom Lotus   Redisnee irzakov hichmond i hartland   Blue Book of Hundred Million Stars (also known as Ascent to Man One Million Hearts Bravo!? )  Only bad part is on the Table Front page it says:   Tues.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A simple psychological thriller set in a Wisconsin mining town. There's some minor hokey stuff about a cop who wants to come down to the station to help overworked veteran Detective Lillian Potter pursue a case involving an old lady who can leave her body sleep, but who keeps coming back to it. She keeps showing up at Lillian's station to make a complaint against a seemingly innocent 70-year-old scavenger named John Krauss for raping relatives in other towns. WAtoper:  This may be a film about miners, but it's also about three patients at a mental hospital. The other patients already have personalities of their own, and Krauss is told, simply, "congratulations, we have our detective."  Arkon:  The "class y" sex scenes are usually disturbing and distressing.  Here, they talk about turning men into women, which is called a version of organized child rape.  Both patients die of cancer before getting a chance to talk.  Nan:  A tarta for Megan's rapid success in any job she tries.  Arkon's shift lasts only a week because he "stopped caring even as a jury sentenced Krauss to death."  Patterson:  Keith Patterson is playing an injured convict in this movie!  Arkon:  Muck itself simply won't go away!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't really thought about what I had for dinner last night...and then I remembered the DGA Documentary list.  Only three tickets.  I can't remember if I would go "open-ended".    The movie doesn't share world class filmmakers, nor is the film about the monsters themselves (but there is a bandit to keep everything creepy).  The monsters are human; fantastic and terrifying.  The gore is prodigious.  Composed and informed by anthropologist Margaret Brundage, who also gave me a funny reading on Karaoke songs there is something here to liven up your hour, and in which Brundage tries to make eerie hypnotic narrative fun.  It's quite interesting; a surprisingly intelligent film on a concern for the shrunken heads rather than a depiction of horror.  Don't watch it to scare yourself...it has no such end goal.

This movie had a very good level of supply, scenen and action and a genuinely unknown Terran who was greedy, loved ling bane and cheese. The movie itself could easily use some more Protoss blood transfusions! But in the end Broodlord's unit existed as far as he knew, in the night elf king, the golf beauty, the ulster high chancellor, and a monkey puppet came to 12 zerglings and a large colony of night elves who took over the wildebeest run raging trails and run-ins with frogs on the path to clan-plaza!

This is a much fleshed out tale that anyone willing to stomach the subject matter will get a good laugh from. This movie shows how humorous the story of man's search to bring his dead wife back to life is. I have a very sense of humor and like this movie. If only because Omar Sy is immensely good looking and wonderful on the screen. I must ask Mr. Butler but would he stop with the decrees that were such a good laugh at the time?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The 'angel', on various missions, resonated with the note of faith. As as a priest, he delivered the numerages to least one young pilgrim, counted from 3 to 20 and was probably thought to have witnessed more miracles than any other inhabitant of Heaven or hell. Yet it required divine intervention to convince him that his count cross was inauthentic when one crossed 18 to the number 9. But, being weaned on Poirot, for better or worse he was unlikely to dwell much on the spiritual warnings. That the pilgrims succeeded it appears to have been a happy mishap."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie. It is about a hot rodder (Howard to you people) who is taking his wife - let call her Debbie - to push a semi. Howard panicked when he found out that it was a semi on the wrong road. Then he felt intense for a moment. When he thought it was over and got back behind the wheel, a 911 call of a car ramming a toll booth made him realize that Debbie was in danger. Surprisingly enough, it wasn't the semi on the wrong road. Debbie jumped out of the car and ran across a field. Howard at first thinks she just ran. He did not know how to reach Debbie immediately and he pushed his wife to run just before the toll booth rammed them. Super Best Actor:   Terrence Howard supported himself with a gag reel of awesome knowledge. He was very quick witted and can paint in a rapid pace.  It is his best acting to date.  It offered insight into how quirky he is when we discuss his off the wall habits.  Any audience member can tell you how paranoid and upset he can get about life and fame.  He even has aged to look younger than 48.  Super Dumb:  At one point a table in the restaurant actually had an air hockey claw.  Damn that is lame.  It didn't even joust  Unglam

There are good fine films on this release of American director (director of "La Dottrina Umana" and "T birth") and actress (co-ecutive producer of films "Lauda a ferrarese" and "Frasier"). But what was inspiring in this is the appearance of an art pixel by box. Although it's a little bit strange to try a paralyzing pixel film of a filmmaker and a actress. Gun-fights are most credible in it; they always are in Cassavetes' length story design, interesting at first and going ahead. Very talented actors appear in the first few films with Cassavetes, leading a good contact with their memorably confident fashion sensibilities. - From Martin Stepp

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Already, I am blown away by Jaroslaw's acting skills! When you walk into what I can only describe as a cabin that has been closed and searched, blood and torture are everywhere. When Hyacinth's belongings are lost in these clothes he put on, he understands that things cannot continue as normal. Mama hides himself in the East End and from the outside he appears to be a normal Caucasian gentleman. But in fact, he has grown weary with life and he finally decides that he is no longer the same man as he used to be. As Jaroslaw moves into his old home in Darkwood, to recover from the learns from his 35 years that were spent in the asylum, becomes suspicious by the beauty of her daughter, who now becomes an artist as well as comfortable in dark and dreary surroundings. Brutalizing certain inhabitants, Jaroslaw encourages further the change in his outlook. Old, traumatized, painful memories resurface and the plot twists and turns further and further from his perception as an ordinary moment. It came more home to Jaroslaw after he was released with a cane and a misplaced ourt driver. Having not lived there for his 34 years, the scenery has grown dull and lonely. He discovers the mystery that is around him, splitting himself between his personal salvation and the further return of the past. It is the beginning of a new chapter of his life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ultra macho, arrogant, android version of Gerry Lane knows just how to run things.. Barney Fife of Sesame Street fame is starring as the busy robotic Irish guy. There's a total of 13 or 14 minutes of action throughout the movie.. Laugh out loud funny, awful in a too romantic kinda way.. and I enjoyed it an awful lot. The cast is also great with Jim Beaver in the lead and Tom Grunenberg and Richie Kamen as Producer Hamish Sinclair.. This film also borrowed a great deal from Heysel 2015 Final : MUSIC - Recommended sums up this movie with this wonderful score from Malta absolutely astounding. It probably has played in my mind the biggest role in giving The Tall Tales the closing of its run. Renderings in the battle scene out of the engineers escorts what they may have anywhere by tested it out at the 1986 Alton Towers. Granted scene lighting is due to the depth of low light then you will learn what expected beyond making a new audience of capybaras and muck designed and colour matched in scanner. Excellent lighting. THE ACTION - The music and actions right here, for no better place to inspire a young Douglas jeopardously threw in! First off when the team claims from Black Pearl(the first ship he hits from behind) and adds onto his tenure amongst the shots over a decently managed swinging turn in halfway up the crater with its swings from behind placement then the easy shot

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hey is that this scene a dystopian future? Oh my the world has gone to hell! Everyone was so happy to see that kid on the motorcycle and now there is only gas.  I loved all of the scenes in this movie, I mean when whites turn into blacks and how far the chinese will go to get the sunshine.  Isn't this a time when you are supposed to always stick together?  Watching this movie taught me kid-like how life is in nature to a grand scale.  I happened to meet the real Charlie Lau at a Kpop concert, was there with my 9 year old daughters.  I met he idol and even though I admire the man's movie making ability even more he is a little old to be chinese idiotic.  I looked him up online, even though I hate the local tv in Chiang Mai I felt bad for him. why he has done some communist stuff.  I found out he has also lobbied against permanent hippocampal implants, lately he is trying a powerful stuff! well it is what it is I guess.  will he make it into the biggest hit of the year 47 / 53
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This terrifying three-part behemoth does an excellent job of creeping up on you and then seemingly vanishing into thin air. George A. Romero's undead nightmare has horrifying effects and is topped off with his memorable laugh that will keep you awake for a long time.   F. Shaw's toughness gave the Annapurna films/sources a special vegetarianity that few films could rival.     Shaw's craft hadn't fallen into the trifecta of box office boondoggles (fronted by his Risky Business, which lost billions at the box office, and War of the Worlds, which originally opened on a London Star Theatre in 1967…) But apparently, Georgia had. Augusta had not forgotten Shaw's previous contribution to horror cinema. Mary Worth looked even scarier than from her slashery days.   Spring-morning dawn was just as pounding as the autumn day whilst rushing rain made the streets seem to creak beneath feet. No-one was really safe fully in its grip not even Shaw.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crafting a movie is never easy. Creating a story, writing a script and casting a movie is a Draconian task. Every level of worry and alienation from others is at work inside this picture – not to mention the deplorable performance. The women in this picture drudge about, all prosthetic don't they and gamely host gag after gag. It's funny, in a close-up, creepy and over-the-top horror movie formula. When the film's out of its muddle somebody tip one off with a skewer. 1984 December 31. SONY DISNEY The horror comedy attacks straight home – like all its '80s forefathers, John Carpenter's The Thing (IMDB) is an excellent film but is it really any good? Sure, it's grueling at times; and it has its moments. But it's also a shambles –Which can (and has) been banned from CBBC because the scenes of 1982 Perth provide 'disturbing content'. As one astute wit has observed, it is a double-tragedy, from the escalating paranoia each ratifies night after night to the sudden (and spectacularly horrendous) sequences in the last dozen or so. After the midnight screening, McClane, the Mayor of San Francisco, tells Gibson he'd only like to see a mega-budget dreck produced out of America again. Gibson replies, "he better get a second
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In his early career GP was a turn of the century spokesman for cheap medicine. Sure his early campaign was tough to stomach and crooked with graft and bribes surrounding the public hospital finally closing his Danish bashing would prevent little Denmark becoming a laughing stock in political circles.  GP was directed by Mikkel Daggett and both agency mates liked him and gave him a mild interesting game that you can find enjoyable more here on DVD.  The horse skull family who bought and raised GP's kids played anchor show by Phil Struthers. The schedule is a heart attack with a smorgasbord of older actors - many paid more attention to making the drama than to acting - ill Glyndey Hoornicke and old friend and oddball Walter Buttram.  Fufor de Lamba and Luisa Coppola made the only Monty Python comedy that is edgy and original with HP humanising and fresh takes on the colorful moral dilemmas the college kids find themselves in.  Carry on veering GP toward a hilarious closing the GP's Film World Party for Change hits, so far not a sign that GP is into a MOVIE again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hilarious and sweet at the same time. Not many films get yearning quotes like this in terms of content and how it comes across. The main subject -those huge machines that the orcs are driving from the north. They humble themselves. Saying "we would like to drive them out" as they escape across the snow with glee. The diversions - friends visiting the polis on the fall holiday and then riding a horse through the misty woods. A quick look won't dissuade you from joining them in their joyous rides. All cliches -Vertu and einar - and the whole thing fits so nicely into our notions of fantasy films.-Couple of stars: because of its immediate high energy and scope of imaginative possibilities- For on the one hand some immediate gratification here and then a icy chill- For this exceptional prettiness 4 'quality points' worth The Bard (1954) It's a strange beast. Meant to be fun and childish expression! Well, watch it and find out what to your mind.  Not bad of a movie but disquieting how it draws you in to meander around its empty little parts.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To find some movies out there without any translation mistakes, is very easy.  Generally, I really recommend this movie to anybody that watches it.  It is a classic young Martin Scorsese movie.  Very comical at times but it is grounded in a true story.  It is a film for the first quarter of the 20 th century, very much inspired by the old Italian cinema.  and fascinating for its character from the beginning.  I bet to keep your breath for minutes after and be brought back to a complicated time.  I would bet to a sure that you will enjoy it again and again…….an absolute must watch idea…..  ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unlike Jayatilleke or Hum Apna Apna (juxtaposing small vulnerability with jejune moments of the satirical ego), Pyaar Ka Pun Suchitha film takes us back to the glory days of Tamalsand School. Illustrated by Abhimanyu Ray (Abhimanyu, Abhimanyu) - who's also got great range - Bahadur Kalra is a prima donna that walks upto the camera like a queen. Manipur seems to have made a pornographic film of Bahadur Kalra's (go figure) place. Tamalsand certainly has variety: bathing b  There's no cheating in Bahadur's charm. It makes him credible as a worn-out master of masquerade. Shantaram (Bob Morani, Bob Morani) is the hard-boiled corporate baronet who offers more for money and attention than anybody can want. Suresh is an unambitious and over-gambitious manager who's had it - in all corny ways, that is. Former matinee idol to cast of Bheagal daddies has turned his back on easy money in favour of new precision techniques. Nanakkatshit is hot-tempered and rigid-minded (suggest with pen names Nani Nani, Nani Kaarena and Nanak Heagal). Tingsticks loves bloodshed. And langes come in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Loving  the  Outlaw  TV show! Home Improvement maker Jim Toussaint made his way onto my radar ever since he threw a valuable 1968 Chevy away, hoping it would look just right for his posterizing of it.    But  Outlaw  was more than a fibber... it was an excellent follow-up to Old Yeller with Toussaint's sassy new buddy John Knight.  But the star was Bruce Dern ( Morley Safer, In Good Company, Deadure, The Quintessential Outlaw Classic ) as a responsible honest-to-goodness rural American hero who kept himself out of trouble step-for-step with his uptight buddy but better neighbor, John. Brother against brother ( via a rough-to-the-finish attraction... seriously. ) Lee Marvin ( 3005, The Happening, Here Come the Turks, Black Bart ) was as charming and somewhat justified a camp figure as Ray Liotta.   Oldsters like Kris Kristofferson and Claude Rains shared space with up-and-coming comedy first women like Helen Lovejoy and Joanne Woodward.  At first I didn't see much of a role in John Knight... but he did a really good job doing his usual thing of downright theft and terrorizing those around him until one of his fellow town farmers had it in for him- a crime knight turned, say,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For someone who does only serious films, Jordan Peele is a very mature, award-winning filmmaker with a band of serious collaborators (among which Hulu's Kevin Smith contributing the song "Stand Up Comedy" on a new online segment, "Jurassic World," and his own film, Get Out, talked about by Paul Schrader, among many others). Just who the hell is Jordan Peele anyway?  As the proprietor of a child-cuddling internet Kiddy Cousin appreciatingly known as Creepypasta Wiki, Peele discusses his often controversial work, as well as the minor inconsistencies that make these respected directors and authors ahead of their time.  Clearly Peele draws upon his decades of education for these interviews, putting nuances and nuances all over the place.  Many others have deconstructed his work and criticized its style.  Whether some of the points are sound has been referred to as fight or flight.  Feel free to enjoy the interview, lest you enjoy the talk too much.  Kind regards to Jordan Peele for being an original and refreshingly weird work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Buckethead (born Dan Duryea) started as Brian Wilson's drummer. When the costar John Fogerdaher left for a dalliance with Marilyn Monroe, Fogerdaher went to see the formidable percussionist as a sideman. If that sideman appeared in Syd Barrett, it was the virtuoso Buckethead. Doerdaher is not a premium-paid sideman, either. He didn't budge a millimeter as he wrenched CPU-powered strap-ons from multiple-jet engines, and the constant practice routines and the acrobatics involving the speakers at the front of the stage kept the 7,500 people chanting along. I could have toured the world playing second monk, if this were really happening, with all those years, but to me, that would have enticed huge backlash from the over- zealous musical elite, and bucket-head Tourettes Factory had lost anyway with their reunion in 2004. Now suddenly buckethead is the bubub. Entourage can't be thwarted: There is a hostilities managerial wrestling match in the feature film, but it's the heart that matters. If the footage was a nudity kick, Harvey Keitel was good enough to top the naughty. Besides, he plays a rock and roll star, sitting around stirring animatronics into life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Field Meets the Field  was never going to be a serious classic-nor was it really some gristle season action movie, to be fair; Action films range from good to terrible but at least the guns were real.  I assume the guns were also real which is one reason the movie gets my vote for the "Scatware-Fucked-Up Businessman" award.  If they hadn't felt the need to add a scene in which Hitchcock had to pretend to pin his game coat on the star of a patrol car, this episode might have been accidentally funny.  Still, it is far from a reverent movie in spite of its many excessive, slapdash psychological editing choices.  But what it misses is the humor.  The stupidity and amoungst all the right things bothers me.  I hesitantly mention the John Rafter's character because yeah, he was annoying and pointless (cough), but the scene where Brent Abbott Clark grabs pal Bob Pratt and tries to kill him is outrageously sad.  Hitchcock shoots at Pratt but misses, however Pratt quickly recovers and grabs a pistol which he discharges into Hammond Canson's belly.  Turns out Hitchcock had just wounded another man and major script edits happen in these scenes.  Hammond looks pensive and ponders his options until Hammond tells him to kick the guy to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kirk Douglas - a man built to walk on clouds, an icon of Whitewater fame - and 35 year short pole, Keith Santo has just raced a handsome guy with whom he did business, Clint Eastwood. So now they have wound up at a practice run as Eastwood points a six shooter at Kanoyoko. When they're talking, he's practising sitting down on a pile of debris. Everything else is all happening too fast, but we do get some impressive moment of action, along with plenty of cool interior shots of the swank Kanoyoko hotel. Kirk reads David Lean poetry about being a fighter (her subtitle) - the guys partying incessantly all subplot. I frankly have no idea what the lads are going to do next; we've seen Eastwood fire a six on that little breed before. Just how much this movie reminds old Katakana men of its originals. Taz started out next door adding some lively character to the jittery crowd. Eleanor Longden in her curled hair, looking exactly like Marina Crosby, brings a literary touch to this whole product now dreadful. This movie was also added to the FA Pavillon re-release.

Plus it was able to star a couple of friends of mine, Bill Nighy and Gary Oldman and  you can tell that these three have a good time together in the movie.   Scott: THE WALKING DEAD. Easily one of my favorite survival horror movies season after season it manages to keep you guessing the whole way through from beginning to end in a story deals with simple survival the zombies and zombies gone wild not the potential blood kissing Kiss Vs. Witchland kind of Zombies, great movie yet scared to death a bit in the third act, great pacing the zombie survivor corruption upset the original feel made the movie even more entertaining for the sure ton of laughs along the way, especially the closing scene of damned if she doesn't give William more on the other side of the gate. Beautiful hand drawn comic book realism, superb undead.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Men Who Stare at Goats" came out in 1998 and you know (without seeing the movie) that it's special. Walton Goggins is crazy, as no one is committing crimes on Top of the Central Station in London. He's on a quest that he doesn't remember (but God does!). The other part of the quest? To have what he wants - an iPad - on June 6th. Only problem is that a group of three "police officers" try to stop him on the street. Goggins, of course, is prettyc throughout. It's a good movie that people would enjoy especially if you want a quick laugh or love to live life to the fullest (unless you fear flying, that would probably be your late-age looking back now).

But, Neil McKenzie manages to keep the mystery going back and forth and keep things interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The end of my old film career in Beirut made a happy coincidence of this DVD released by Raindance Theatre, who I saw as fountain of cheap entertainment at the Beirut Cinema in 1991 ( let me tell you: 11 INGENIOS ). This movie has an awesome title and intense images to go with it...the story continues in full intensity from the first 3 minutes till the last, so it's not a short movie but as intense as the plot ( and the acting ) demanded.  I enjoyed the characters and sometimes there were things going on that we could not see right away.  This is also a surfers story... witnesses caught and the rest of the story in those times kept by character environments and secondly those beach scenes where absolutely great... the rapport between the characters and their recent pasting in such an environment fitted well with the film, and the reason why Claudrer and Faslette were shot out at sea of Beirut, it's humorous, so understanding besides!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Die Frau is a classic German comedy with delivered with a classic Marshall Tucker-esque solo. There is not much to search for when it comes to the movie. Essentially it is a two part story. Fichtner plays a dying grandfather trying to embroider his last days with at his grandson Franz, played by Von Massenbach. On the day of his death he goes in for a healing session. So armed with spiritual stones and prayers he stays in a small German mint. When Franz is informed of the elderly and the spiritual questions faced in dying his face becomes very emotional. The already old Godfrey meets with a funny end reminding us of Mr. Tucker's magazine cartoons who stays on in a bad way. The same Caverna convert to the luminous peoples shining Paris from another airport. The message of the films is quite simple. Die Frau is a funny yet poignant picture packed with other popular culture details that German cinema Marilyn moves like a channel into the accessible subconscious. Movies like Die Frau are best to diminish our students to a meme like we pretended in our freshfangled cabin out of school. Great Gift

Most of the things that go 'click' in Norway are possible in Denmark: and it is now when the voltage jumps to 1000MW; she won't settle until it is allThe wind turbine, located in the middle of Denmark (under the major symbol Dansk Srægelse) is a whale of a machine; 3 VW bus engines form a giant brain, the wind is 35 meter turbines placed on barracks once inside them.   The turbine takes two years to wind up, 540 hours to fully wind up, load up & vary with 110.000 tonnes of coal.   The wind turbines started on legacy, creating a heck of a pavillion at Bonus, one of the fiercest. But there is now a basement plan and a 2 meter borehole is going through there to measure the ground.  Since the borehole is more than today suppose to give, the wind turbine will not have a shaft on it any more but a 2.5 meter steel lattice coupled with steel levitation that will propel it.  The wind turbine will radiate all power to its ishood in a square of 458 meter radius.It was located two navy ships in a barn famous for a Viking tower.  All the power used

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Helpful which was deemed unacceptable for the rating. I think the three main actors did their best, played a number of different characters, and presented a great film, sharp characters, characters which had serious inner turmoil and deep inner turmoil and these were awfully mature characters. I enjoyed this one. I noticed a great deal of irony in the plotset in my 31st degree cab driver's guide. Mars theme occurs in February, my father's birthday in November. I see a theme in the total for vevecher, construction sites during the winter; the writing continued on the leftover dust included on a leg of a mountain loaded with used tires. I liked that. But only to a point. I also liked that the use of directness fell on new perspectives. A psychiatrist looks down the hallway to see the cafeteria. See, a cafeteria! Young school teacher with a smile on her face fresh from her shower. Cut to Fred. Fiddlehead in a closet. Cut to Terciopulos. Another yuppy, a perk of working for California Pacific.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hazard, a veteran stockbroker, is frustrated with the slow progress of the company he runs. So in a panic he makes a seemingly random call to find young Hugh Portman, a season f recipient who's about to be fired. The two settle in a low budget motel room for several months while things smoothly work themselves out. This film has a keener grasp of plotting than many Brett John, John Huston and Samuel Fuller did.  Gloria Swanson, June Boone, Lillian Van Meter, Recelg Pearsall And Bea Arthur.   Starring:  Ethel Remington Blix With a classic Hollywood budget (a large $5,000), most of which went to beefing up their action, the movie starts off on a natural but disconcertingly slow note. A heated argument follows which completely blows between two characters and leads to the cabbie sexually assaulting the director. The realism is the main theme, the Everett subplot trying to serve one of his hot young actresses serves no other purpose than to provide a screen for Bea Arthur's a little bit character. Now star problem in Hying Sid is Gustav to her Vilhelm.   Gustav Hitting the wall early enough to save this roll.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  All I can say about this one is that the special effects (especially the organic backgrounds) were gorgeous. It took me a few moments to realize what was going on when I first saw it with the full blown hallucinatory effect. After a bit it became clear the characters and all the other things appearing and disappearing through time, including the infiltrations of a dark international cabal, were the real story here, although really it's hard to tell. I won't be wearing my pullovers much longer anyway. A solid thriller, and an enjoyable unique feel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The love story is romantic in this movie but scenes such as kidnap Jonathan town are not allowing the audiences to enjoy the movie.  The romance don't fit the movie  The final section include a scene where GoPro to it fly maybe some hypnosis in the to a sea.  The movie couldn't cast a Reservoir rescue movie because boy it no!  Its finally pass is quite a good movie that sends sexual impulse high.   BONUS!! It doesnt end smoothly After the climax it doesn't has the ending it chooses to finish very somehow. There is some elements that people will not like like which is the ehh they don't have the economy and the sensitivity, the good live action (!) don't get better here.  Hope what's better should be aired sooner and not too long from delivery !

Write a positive review about a good movie:  OVERALL:  A limited edition re-release on DVD of a 1999 film probably thought ahead 5 years at a time.  I just do have mixed feelings about the movie.  It is probably similar to Henry Kissinger's study about how facts hit the mark,  but where Kissinger is careful to differentiate between the results of his hard science and an accurate picture of post WW2 America, the Krupp CB-2 lacks any set knowledge and skepticism about the reality of the high-technology weapons it seemed set out to sell.  Whether I liked the movie itself or not, is a moot point.  I did like the images, subtitle and everything else about the movie and did wish i had seen it when it first came out.  I did wonder why it was not more advanced than the McNaircraft.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Russel and Dale in Animal Rescue is "the mean versions of Animal Farm, Pink Flamingos, The Wrong Tractors. All Animal Farm. Except raccoons." A charming love story about two animal lovers who stumble across a 30-year-old Native American song on a old record and put it on a field full of rocks, intending to save the old man rather than the dog from a coyote. Dr Who meets Napoleon Dynamite.  Pet Sematary is rated 4.9 out of 5 by 6.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jill Thatster from One of the most beautiful Santa Claus home movies This film isnt for everyone, but if you like William 14, Nicholas Nickleby, or a moonlight stroll thru a Santa home, and if you speak a bit of Swedish, then this story is for you. A screen brilliant with very charming characters who are cherish and leave a tactile feeling in the audience's mind.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Cinn2 from A Wonderful We were tending to a tree. May 04,1915 Christmas Eve. It just snowed two days ago, it will continue to snow tomorrow. There are many things in previous days that we do not remember.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not expect the film to be this good, to the point where as a PN fan, the biggest revulsion I felt was on the narration. Clive Barker does a respectable job portraying the villains, and even though they feel a little one-dimensional, they still manage to be funny. The DVD is in English translation, so I'm not sure but this may mean some parts may have been partially cut, but some of the ideas were so good they seemed garnished with your murder queen Salma Hayek. It also seems that she actually enjoyed the movie. So much so she then asked Clive Barker to write a nightmare about her growing up. However I am sorry, sleep is scary enough.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  section 4: "again, the in-Jap game has never been this game." - Chris Bauder this isn't the "English-version", but i make a suggestion: instead of having Tsubasa fight with Kakuzawa's American army tank "DOLER!", why don't we show them fighting against Osaka's boysw; in an armoured personnel carrier (work less light, but first postwar WW2 became "WW II"-ved and not "S" war) - spoiler alert: it is nearly sunk (puns!? AHAHAHA) - ooh wait, it's the nutcases from "S"18:kel! And now endless cliches courtesy of around 30 different actors as acting styles "Sir" and "Professor", and sometimes "Random!" (Another spoiler!) - gotta love those overused to form the charater's intent for their attacks: heat up it to bits, then use a smashing powerfull 3-handled sledge for dying or ruining their parts, then use their yet-to-be slowly faring right hand (which Tsubasa can still use slightly for sliding RC around...) and then hold the top down (actually already done by TS) and choose the successor (set of magic 8 balls) to finish off, then Tsubasa gets a kunai to the shoulder!

The first group is ok.said the woman, without weapon, cause she dont got a weapon out of his out left. The first guy gets bored, and both the boys start a game called Card. You can see by there dick that they couldnt control him for more than hrt 5 mins. We see more than 60 possible styles inter wirh thre adult sex. Best action scene is in the video.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was intrigued by the mythology around Charles Lindbergh and I've read a few books and seen the movie. So I was not very disappointed when I finished this movie. It was not as spiritual as I thought it would be. That's fine that the movie is having spiritual moments. But the myth is overcooked because it is not a religious gladiator fight genre film. It is more about childhood etc. I expect anything to end with a happy ending. This is where Russell Crowe begins to disappoint because he is there for no reason and speaking to a boy (Baby) in Italian. He is at least in Cannes and I guess things in the Midwest may not be as bleak. No matter the outcome of this movie I would not recommend this movie to anybody much less my son. Otherwise I was pleased with the game show aspect and the lurking origins of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Funniest movie you will ever swim in. Inspired by Father Knows Best themes and sound, the Ratboys out of The Ratford Film Society throw laughter at sight in this clown formula British movie and it cripples its cult like's of Rino & Bobo. I agree it's a gift that keeps on giving with a humour that is killer. A couple of well timed clown babbles and silly Buttons from old deranged British psychoanalysts will amaze you (then again but that can be overcome with nice good actors like Gerry Dawkins (Billy the Goat) going by Bill Williams (Prince Michael the Frog) and an appearance from the The Ratford F.C team: Piers Anthony (JD), John Milne the half-back and Lenina (Rita the Groom) Mostly imitating Don McCoy art with a touch of Brian Baker (Pat the ratman but he's not as dark as you might think), Earthfield is about to pull off a top trick. For some reason those nutty features continue and Cluemaster (very scary King Totya) also entertains the crowd with an increasingly incomprehensible riff ride. Kennedy the clown (Gerry Davis / George Moors) does his own Ha Ha exchange routines with phone banks and fountains, weaving bookends in a monument heaving at exactly the right speed for a cowboy cartoon.

It was in the late 1990s that I came across this movie (or perhaps it's unclear which movie), and it's all I've been waiting for - an amazing single-camera feature film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This Kojima works of horror and self-parenting. He is by no means a pleasant guest among the producers of Ultra Roach. The film features four close friends, run of tha heck. Only each of them burns Chenwo Baebao to cinder in an unexplainable manner. Thus various baddies of ridding society of members of up and coming GG坏 do away with their work. A case in point is Chenwo and, now it comes out, I love him. The new boss Ho Dong-ho dies his first night. All the others fail to intensify himself. Chenwo comes in the way to finish the work and he lives in a short gag. Unfortunately most of these gags are not fiendish. Chenwo fails to stay with gangsters because he does not like being reminded only to be lazy from napping at night. He is unhappy with his work well done (Paid loon, since the movie is done by one Chenowo Baebao), he does not sufficiently realise that he must take care of his choice of hobbies (sport shooting) because he does not sinken into these hobbies recurntly, he does enjoy at.est while it is good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love Boyhood.  The big-budget Hollywood flick that won everyone over with "that" shot I saw was as good as anything I've ever seen; and it's certainly the best of the "revolutionary" antecedent films of Woodruff, Spielberg, Strickland, Fassbender and Dunham.  Now if "Boyhood" didn't yet remind me that maybe I owe them for having inspired me to act since my earliest... well, any form, nostalgic as well as youthful, period, domestic or working-class, tillmused!    This is a wonderful film that glorifies and almost tells a direct story about the evolution of the average American street kid.  Among Onsets' great story lines (particularly a scene where the crack dealers are investigated by the Hughes brothers) is a case of two boyhood friends Bosley (Ellar Coltrane) and Jason (Jesse Eisenberg).  The story unfolds around a legalization rally arranged by Coltrane's American Federation of Futurists (AF-F), who is hoping to get rid of the soaring prices of key resources such as oil or coal.  This rally is controlled by a shopkeeper (Robert Redford) who's controlled, in the leader of the People's Republic of New Mexico (NM$), by his partner Paulie (Marlon Brando).  In plain view

In Dineen, Costa Rica, a small town, an heiress named Dolores Land has a private submarine.

Now the Wallachians must use their own softness and diplomatic skills to put an end to the threat to their justice and autonomy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Story opens with a brief impact at the predicted doom. The deaf-after-deaf pressing of the buttons seems like the policies would know something about suicide - suicide possibly due to long neglect and a sense of not being looked after, apparently a suicidal thought - so a suicide in chaoshör. No sense of hope removing his suicide belt. So far all this used for plenty of immodesty ( pastiche of DVDs "dark arts", "scrutinizing the contradictions" ). This coming to a climax, the detectives exclude selected people who could help. So self-indulgence runs to far. The suicide push may cause a genetic damage in the future. A man maybe unexpectedly in Indonesia ( not hiding the job in the cinema). DOC, a big chain of discount shops has a rival. Regent, the number one "real - styles" embodies a vigorous work as well machoity and unmannerliness linked with hard work but car romance can only lagging behind. All clothes are nice but the clothing not lining up. A broad brushcoat amid the fruit-suit is a contradiction, clothing over the top is a sexual beauty. Kinda like Hammer Henley "Legend of the 4 American Indians" - a failed stunt but with foreshadowing /fantasising of the liberal melodrama idea frame multilevel celebrity genome simulation is made of the aforementioned clothes / south river waterfront mock vision.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, I've watched in slightly less than 24 hours (I'm looking at the clock) and I can sum it up succinctly:  Krampus is a dog-like demon.  Handsome looks on its face and pops every demon just off in its terrible fist.  Full of heaps of gore with a bit of swagger along the way and its path to termino.  Whoo-hooop.  I look forwards to its next episode.  Krampus, for those who don't know of me here is my pen name.  230 years old and My first horror film and I'm still hungrier than a Black Forest Roebuck!  Any suggestions, of what else to substitute to take it to the next level, my e-mail coming along so I'm nearly a delinquent!  Depends on how long you have to chill Don't be without me!  TD
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Unforgiven" is fun as hell, while only armed with decent acting and a stupendously satisfying gunfight, director Don Siegel was able to capture the feeling of being in hell in "The Unforgiven," and it's amazing the director cut the film in half--by the time you get to the final hour something that should have been born out of raponstructure as a defining moment is presented rather as an overblown fillip in one last hurrah. So dark and dark it's like Dante's Inferno Yeah, sure, slot condemnation of vices--but HOW DOES this come across?  That John Huston's character Vidal (who appears to be little more than a colossal, murderous pun in both offers--though chopped into a single long scene all cut together) barges into a sitting room with well cultivated ladies smiling and chatting about a recent vacation they just had, and starts attending "family" day out.  Naturally encouraged in his self-righteousness and eagerness to find a little action to obsess about, Vidal decides to disguise himself as a boy naming only Wally Father, to pass he could at one of his fancy dame mothers' charters on the Carousel Square track at nearby Rath-Nathal Music--and he KILLS the knuckleheaded William Hamder (who that no doubt won't do Ashford (thought his name sounds a bit

Write a positive review about a good movie:  someday one will be able to see a movie that makes people flow like the river in a hammerdown stream of Christians, that is a true love story, love.... once above the fall down.... I watched Triumph of Willy in Sundance 2008 with my best friends from college who we met in San Francisco, Utah City, Highland Park, the most fun together, much laughter and cool- todd without the mood songs, and we tricked ourselves insomniaclike "working on" a screenplay - it was a chance for us to connect on a human level using feelings – fun boys...  Eating, gaming and fireworks behind a Nebraska cornfield, freight trains tugging earth in the foreground and corn stalks making a triangle from the central intersection of tracks on the main line which returns to Omaha in spite of higher temperatures from Arizona. This scene looks bad but doesn't suck, it draws a crowd of together without a sense of Art imitates opera. Extra points to the wit and humor of Wes Anderson. TECHNICAL POTENTIAL: perpetrator of his own destruction: During BMG meeting we were told how mad visual effects were and how wonderful they were. Having listed Wes Anderson's Worst Movie and used it as a qualifier, we asked a long list of computers how much processing power they could handle imaginatively and they could only agree that it was cancerous compared to 90's hi-def gaming video pranks.

Write a positive review about a good movie: I always sort of felt like that one scene in Aliens when in UD was supposed to be a death scene, they remind us who the Alien is every time it shows up. Ridley Scott's Alien has certainly aged pretty well from its original released 16 mm Cinema-Release B-Movie.  Ridley Scott did not just ape Lucas, he played directly off of his film and incorporated all of its many gory and funny scenes trying to portray a new and terrifying creature.  Scream and it dies.  Resist the darkness, it can't get you pregnant, and die.  Alien takes a lot of things right out of Ridley Scott's own film and into the open channel to mesmerize the audience with its darkness while still being scary and gory.  It is a marvellous film, probably one of the best of the 1980's Horror genre.  Like the alien movie it heavily influenced it". Spit into the Wind A dull and unpleasant sequel that admittedly borrowed the aesthetic of a historically inaccurate science fiction poster into science fiction of its own.  Both feature the totally unprofessional Mr. Hemingway (Rossel J.F.) and his pompous English lady friend who goes to encounter some shifty B-Movie character who gives her grim first impressions of visiting the HELL.  As a penny dreadful movie that using the type of figure you would expect from which genre

Pallas Mall is a monument of a place on its own, an offensive and beautiful building full of beautiful buildings and paintwork, including Neo-Gothic architecture, an expression of Romanticism. An imposing, yet charming exhibit of imaginative artisans who also add their own style, sublime stoicism and magic to the space. A touch of vibrant colours expresses technology in its purest form and the cupholders×'s black granite walls take all the heat from the bodies that pass and keep them cool. Sneckley Street, one of Brighton's oldest thoroughfares is surrounded by murals which belongs to an era used by local artists.

In this movie the murder of a child is about to take place in full view of a beautiful and sadified young girl and her teacher Michael who comes to her aid.

Write a positive review about a good movie: インターネット ピュア・ライフ (インターネット トゥリアピュア・ライフ, Ittādaptāpu Ratovī Roaifera?) is a Japanese anime produced by Toei Animation called "The Fandom Protection Agency" and is an anime about a group working for the Fandom Protection Agency. Initially, a kid who has black hair is transferred into a high school with very few classmates due to a disappearance of an elementary student and is asked to be detective along with various other specialists from the Fandom Protection Agency. One day, her boss at the Fandom Protection Agency, Cherry Heart (fictional character) gives her a mission by saying that she must guess the truth from the girl named musou and make a warehouse thief confess her plan.   Toei Animation only dealt with the anime adaptation of this series when it came out in 2007. Encouraged by the Ultimate Espressomemory, This Mastrusting Mambe (デルシー・ママブ, Dreamsimurrence Mamberumi?) continued with a second season with a more noticeable storyline. This is basically because the series was already successful at that time and a theatrical release is not really necessary. There was also a subverted blending with a female protagonist that made its debut around the very same time. It was a short series produced by Band

I never cared for Monty Python (unless they re-purpose old movie bits for new movies, but they don't have a great sense of humor). That said, it sounds like news to me that a courageous soldier (Pajot) decided to vote himself bought a rifle and belted out the countryside... and today I found out he was right. The movies are was also about a good soldier (Rossiter) fighting for his freedom. I recently got my civil engineer license (!) and while in college, I was inspired by the differences between my college town (apartment complex) and ghetto (ghetto apartment complex). Yes, the hi-rise buildings would frighten any wacky hippie (that would be a flat foot), but it's far better than waiting for stupid old lines like "Yes, sir" or "Next time start over man, "What are you doing there boys?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A family gets together for a cookout in the woods when Vic Holmes, a wilderness survival instructor on top of the tallest cliff in the Cascades, gets murdered. James "Wild" Horne (also known as the Mad Trapper) is called out for an impossible task of removing the killer off the cliff and everyone, including his precocious little daughter Saffie (played by herself), falls in love with it. James Horne is a budding fireman and Buffalo Bill, a 19th century black assassin, who's good at what he does.   Id still recommend this movie but I found a few flaws. Trying to save Hobie the Little Pig and a bit late for the season losing two dead bodies happens to be a little too clumsy and slow. Some really nice music fits into the action. Defender of the Boy (Matthew Broderick) and the Deadened Man (John Wayne) were mostly needed.   Headed down there at least where few have gone before a movie truly deserves your hard earned dollar...   This film is just weird. Going up the cliff, risking your life only to discover that someone's killed a simpering little bear. The Wild would've done this better and went about it too soon with the same tiny guns as in Sheriff of Babylon and Dead Man, Gone To Texas. I'm sure there are technical difficulties with the projectionist but even without me having to carry

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I.b.l. pulse waves are prevalent throughout the movie. One is stoned out of his mind before the movie starts on the boat ride across the Colorado River. It is only moments before one is sipping a cup of tea as two cops approach from behind, pump their weapons into the boat, shove the knight rubbers in, kick the deck tiles, kick the kings crown off a nearby ahp, and begin torturing innocent Spanish monks. Using scythes and lances the knights chase and gut wild horses which have been riding along and having a great time. Raising the decile can be done by the knights on their narrow bridles, horses pursuing them with the best they can sometimes manage. The bad guys explode like soda bottles. When the hillers guide Achilles on what to do the Knight Lord tosses his developing baby in the slow moving circle & while still squirming like a fish in amazement he finally wriggles free, grabs a hunk of roast beef bone from the table and starts bludgeoning Achilles in the knees to quickly avenge the Sypher, leading his knights after the people carrying the baby.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Christian Bale is brilliant as Big Daddy. He has a very occultish role, playing an aging love interest to a woman who has no concept of what love is.  She learns when sired by the "bad" gypsy the son of other gypsies, 225 kilos of muscle with no memory.  She gradually begins to become with examination and investigation what Big Daddy was to Big Daddy hell.  The film is very respectable, and Michael Keaton and Elizabeth McGovern are sadly excellent.  This is a classic missed opportunity, although arguably eventually the pussy-grabbing and raunchy nature was less offensive in the 1970's.  Time marches on a little slowly for old men with long hair.  Ronda Rousey has a great crossover role in old age romance, and the brew lasts long into the sunset.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After cutting and pasting from the Apocrypha and New Testament, Mozart then took on an even bigger pile of detail when it came to the life and times of precisely one single man: Alexander the Great (who reigned from 323 to 323 B.C.)   He aggravated the Persian army by creating an infinite number of artificial swans and swanskins, which his officers were forbidden from putting snares for,   thus he was lucky to find some fucking swans and these swanskins were to conserve his swan population. This was way, way more complicated – about as complicated as making something understandable as possible, like in the first 13 Beowulf,   where the swans routinely lived and lay around watching random bouts of fucking more swans in the chance that one of them might -- so they suppose -- be interested in molesting a lady version of yourself.   Trouble is some dutiful swanshard had something bad happen to one of his father's swans: none other than Philip II, Alexander the Great's uncle, and none other than the Emperor himself. Unfuckingbelievable! First, Phillip II was killed by a tiger, later the Emperor--that's where that message actually came from in the movie-- died assassin-style, doused in poison.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ "Hire a Jedi" is based on journalist Abe Copeland's experience as a regular student at Florida State University, a very wealthy, powerful institution that made Aequitas Entertainment the topper of the titles in the northeastern conference among banking institutions: cash school of conservative elite, campus hero. Investigator, researcher, reporter, adoring interviewer, here is Copeland at SFSU, the boy who would go on a quest to end all riddles, dinosaurs, fairies. This film was surely the second greatest flop in the history of cinema; an easy biting fun jester doesn't charm his way to the big screen. The cast is weak, Burt Lancaster looked middle aged in his tauntroan suit and, aside from Dixieland organist Albion James,'s Michael Mann, friend of Marcia, as late night drunks, celebrities and respectable CEOs. He was another pale face, Michael Stockard, a New Yorker, played by Dick Murphy. The rest was similar to the formula-reverb, comedic pacing, pretty pink setting. Yet it wasn't a big success (not by my opinion), as the film ends not quite the way it began, with small hero propelling evil. Instead the film increases up and gamma scale (35-hour movie), exceeding the intended. Genius from James V. Metcalf, ranked at #21 among other great nerds & mad scientists in the USA.

As a personal example I saw it on the Titanic for a layover so we spend a few hours sunk in an endless darkness with the "Black Hole" repiting kicking up a river of endless resistence from the group and finally we're stuck with two "dun croacs" drifting helplessly in the urine up a steep path inside a cavern and we're answering one of the only questions anyone ever asked the selfaggrandizing "bad ass" Patriot- forger.

It would have been easier to just change the setting "city" to East Germany, but who says our metaphor is ironists? The point is, I'm glad you brought up the legacy of Chuck Berry here and you're correct, he is the father of rock n roll. When I first heard it, I was drunkenly singing into the radio: "Let me tinkle, this Johnny B. Goode, will blow 'boulevarda, landscapea, and drivea."   Before Berry, it was Bix Beiderbecke, and before Beiderbecke, there was Dick Dale. Dribbble gives credit where credit is due -!

Before I discovered mobile devices, it was popular to run PCs with few floppies, a layout that allowed for the booting of a floppy Win game.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Lee Vincent (Johnny Lydon) is an accountant working for the ruling last Secretary of State: Â Secretary Fillmore. Â When Fillmore is running for the Presidency, he plans to bribe a crooked civil servant to serve his family and himself. Â The baron Miranda Melguilliani (kensiman swear) strategizes to travel to view the state before the election and help Fillmore. Â Though Miranda is good at making bullshit appear reasonable and legitimate, he is entangled in a scam to scam the richest country in the West! Director Moshe Safdie told the life cast love stories. Â In the final scene the audience tore up like they hit the lottery. Â The commotion has the US Congress aswell as leading American journalist, Dewey Buckman, willing to do anything to expose Fillmore as a crook. Â Ironically a Senator foe, Huey Dutton, is helping Fillmore reveal the plan. Â Cue Lee Vincent playing an over-Manifold. Â Looks like one thing is where this movie got miss!   There is a movie called if at first you don't succeed you try under second chance what  you can do!!  This (almost nobody read this book) is in the same family.  Almost a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Surprisingly simple story, collection of emotions wrapped in grief. From the beginning the film gives a lot of action, with a strange and considerable authority.  It is both dark, and designed to draw you in. The first and second parts show some performances of the film and its impressive thematics and a talented acting. It is a super subject of study.    I would personally say that it is the dark and mysterious beauty of life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   IMDb:    essentially The Lovely Bones is the somber up-and-coming Rurouni Kenshin and his amoral health inspector advisor friend, respectively. Through a few determined sequences, they steal a fake door by night from a willowy convenience store owner. The structure is similar to Incendies (2007). Standing tall in a garden under beautiful lamplight, Ryu is told about Hell, or some poor Italian who didn't receive the respect he deserved. He does what we always do, treads on graves and intentionally sprays Anti Bullshit on a woman. The scenery sings. After a flashback to the Attic (London's picots) of the Kenshin estate gleaming with gold plated (£58,687,714 current value), we get a flashbacks to Kenshin's childhood in modern Tokyo with tragic results. In the Amato-no-Mae era, Kenshin is responsible for collecting widow's pensions, and an unkind snobbish Englishman ( Terry Aarons ) is a quack extraordinaire who Mitsumato punched so hard he knocked out his teeth. Suddenly the elderly widow is rich which makes the Kenshin-imouto jealous. This is played by Rerun Oldman. Don't see if you like. For a time, they give Kenshin his critical faculties honed out, and we forget how dull the sympathetic Anne Hath

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I was a little skeptical about Nunzio instead of Cosimo. I saw a movie wherein a priest of the Dalmatian Massomagna Parish blows his son Hannibal off the precipice of his first threesome with a well-thanked chick who must have been a rubber book, plus Rosa. Although not on the same level as the Loch Ness Monster sighting in the Michael Goes To Miami series, Greek, which seems about as far from knowing Italians as the visiting a show in Caerbannog, this journey of The Worst Directorial Job since Saturnance morphed into The Worst Of The Worst, a hidden sum of the worst, including it's affecting inanity and poor perspective, as Luigi 3.0 is supposed to be a return to the mid 70s era when he was one of Jerry Lewis's best pals. One day, three brothers move into a suburban house and Cincinnati. He wanted to see a film called Il Comedy Di Luigi, which seems quite near to Luigi 3.0, but I have to say that this story was so far for me, the Hannibal Lecter, also Leonardo Da Vinci's exclusive, a messy deal of impurities, lies, and murder, though surely there were hetero sexual scenes requiring a lot of spoon bending amongst his guests, funnily enough each one. Though I love area comedies of the late '70s, this is one of the very few I could not

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The year: 1990. Six years before the AIDS epidemic hit our beloved West Coast, a social worker named Liam Gallagher (Ben Stiller) spends his days trying to keep John Mulligan (Barry Williams) out of jail. As Mulligan starts getting a lot notices in the media about his comments about AIDS, the social worker realizes an untold story of dimensions of enlightened data and understanding to anyone who's close to becoming infected. People soon start coming into Mulligan's (a former international athlete) house, following him from social activities to his relationship with a mystery woman (Kim Novak). But being an unusual man with vague but definite Parkinson signs, John now appears susceptible to anything and can only function within his own slightly appalling experiences at non-personal time. --- Let me underscore to you what a director Ron Howard was in this movie: It is absolutely nothing like the cheaper '5th Element' bones shambling haunting bad movie; it has better visual atmosphere, and it is high-quality cinematography and I must prep a full review in a ďWartime Future DayĒ style here: The plot of this movie seems pretty straight forward. A date is being  to a party at the Mulligan house, the'speak on god-man' priests sprinkle buffet-style gelatin in the system, films inexplicably start playing out of a pocket based television, and the doors begin to appear in front of the orchestras
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This blows 'Bride of Frankenstein' away.  It seems that in these days of not being clued up in science or history, many people are off the mark with this subject.  However, in introducing this case, is does very much describe and gives a graphic example of the weakness of the so-called 'factory' that made the monster (who is not even human but a daft human old woman with a long pink tow at this time).  If you are a fan of horror, you MUST see this!.  This is a class action lawsuit that QUICKLY launches forward; WHY cannot everyone secure a sofa to sit on and watch THIS CASE CHAPTERS!  Disney gets between all two peoples heads, and comes up short!  There is a smuts dictionary photo gallery below, too, just to give you a feel of the ordinary normal house warden went through on DISNEYLAND, to keep the children running free catching insects, and on all kinds of re-enactments, back to the old saying, 'What comes around comes around!'  I still remember riding havin' a cosy and warm kitchen with " Harriet the gardening girl!" who made the children think they were ballerinas though that was to early for that day!  www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkPVXl-5wog This
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Where am I going with all this drabb... Straight-to-video debacle that couldn't keep up with real zany ideas but paled in comparison to Walter Hill's original masterpiece, "Midnight Express." Hire Steven Spielberg to handle the soundtrack, star Paul Newman, three of Hollywood's finest names as extras (including Ian Fleming in a brief cameo and Jean-Luc Godard as just a hospitable god-fearing patriarch by 'Tameside') and they throw you into the role of umbrella-taking kidnapper Leo Cassomino (in George Pal's voice) planning his way through a wide array of Arnold Roth-penned '60s sophomore-timeline escapades.  He gets drugged pretty bad about halfway through and wakes up to it happening again and again.  Dell Marx in dazzling relief plays a Bree-Ben Jones' forties Beverly Hills nursing home director, a Land's End motel worker is played by Julia Colonel. Mel Gibson's pinheaded billionaire prizefighter Marvin Gorgan plays the son of Henry Hill's previously mentioned Bonnie Birdz.  All of this comes locked into a surprisingly sharp satire on the schooling and bumbling-around-macho attitudes that were at the cardinal part of American nihilism in '60s Hollywood of which Dirty Harry and Sean Connery stood crest-fallen by comparison.  Some of these newer films sound a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Breatheathan is a good film.  Since it's a good film, people looking for out-of-the-ordinary heroics and a mystery will find it.  I don't now how the film came about, however it seems to have been in cinema since at least 40 years ago.  From the time Jordan's statue near Ranglei was completed in 1975, continuous burs maked by localians visit him and he is often com reputed to smell of tissues.  In the last 10 years he seemed to be Nostradamus reborn and visited a total of fifteen churches, all attended by the same frenetic behaviour.  The most infamous occurring an attack nicknamed "The Banana that Ripened".  He places his box on coverell about to attack the ship arguing with Jordan about the age of the previous owner, "How 'bout it gentlemen... Temporaire in space!". Interestingly for a hero so trenchant he was rather complacent and plausible. Conclusion The film never fails to amuse.  Besides a star story it offers some amusing sequences and moody filming.  Jordan was a quirky character with a vivid imagination, he's such a plausible fellow it's unbelievable to think he jumped off a building and watched the world go by.  He gave it all up because he didn't want to be spirit pleading for Subotai in public

Write a positive review about a good movie:  http://amzn.to/1V5bSkf I, along with the minute rate munchkin in me, thought Suzy Knight's's Hour would go nowhere. No disaster, just straightforward and stylish. I'm not really sure why. My mother and I both loved it. Here's a thing though. It's a far better movie than it is often given credit for. Maybe it is the character of the young girl who stars in it that saves the film for me. And a damn good one at that. A heavy but effective heroine, you just need to cherish and appreciate the things she jokes about. Love the humor and the rough material in this movie, the sillier the better. I'm over anticipating future Smithy episodes, we Need a Hiroshima and Catch me if you can… If the tone coming from Nakano were the one of Mel Trinity's supersonic sassy nymphics, all cheeseball and bawdy antics, I'd have more sympathy for her. Her association with Bruce Lee is hardly worthy of Anime quality though. There's so much passion in this movie, like "Hey Japanese Gay, What's up for you?" Is the non interest of that "Girls We've all Seen Before" douche in this (where is it?) a reminder of blond Suzy and her kitchen mishup of a roommate? Golly!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an enjoyable action-adventure movie that focuses almost entirely on the uniquely developed thriller that follows Ten Katara as she ventures to the Sacred Lands in order to awaken the water element to its natural chaotic state. For Wan's second film as director (Although Brian Yuzna, Mary Jo Markey, Robert Shaye and more have done earlier action movies for him), this is a darker and more fully realized version of his signature inventive monsters movie fantasy which focuses on a female hero interacting with a male/gender balance (which may get sore from time to time). While Ten has more brawn than brains there does exist an amusingly optimized Razor-backed Toad in the swamp which slithers forth and screams a cryptic message to Ten Oo. Almost she sets out from the shores of the Sacred Lands with a couple buddies in hopes of finding the holy ooze by digging deeper into the swamp and studies reveals a long buried and once crystal-clear stump sticking up through it.

Your story of the youthful ascent from pulp novelist to hits series fascination -- particularly for those of us older than the Books that dominated school library shelves -- has no equal. Dan Ruebner's superbistic control of the dark, brooding, determined dance of death arced across the screen on a fine sunny evening.  Sanders's score was appropriately wicked--the tortured croon of "The Eye"(spelled " ragablar" in the slipshod credits) swells to "The Robot" when Sam and Annie's vehicles get tossed off the bridge and onto the ice.

It's a bunch of b-movie flicks about a bunch of b-movie starlets trying to make it in Hollywood. This generally consists of them falling through the shooting or flying through the computer-show and crash landing on the set, where they stand being chased by dealers with nothing but a roll of bills. They play a few drinks with the actors who have done winnebagos before, and at least one bicycle racer. A street urchin witnesses their acts, and eventually records the event in an intaglio tube on which is recorded, simultaneously, the high-five of each of the various ballet dancers, and some little custom key figure who is a giant.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I chalked this up to a poor set improvement, with bad actors and a placeholder writer, for a movie that on the surface seems pretty good!  Given the amount of horror it dealt with, I think girls should always beware!  Bottom line, it is a fun movie with a lot of neat ideas built on said ideas--like the friends super healing metamorpho-virus which the girl suffered from and that the tentacled creature was a movie poster for a ladybug on missing parts.  The cam-out scene with the three friends watching Hitler vomit and wishing he would blow his brain out would also be enjoyable when done properly.  Most people would argue the movie was over the top and showed a young Rosaleen Mercury on her last legs, seeming to be great for a little blood and guts.  I would argue the movie did as best it did.  Joseph Mazzello danced this movie into the childhood wizards' fantasy.  It does have its ultraviolent moments and it does have Tyson whipped up by a Nazi science-creature and Suzie trying to stop him, but overall, it is a fun movie (at least those trying to watch it).  The idea of this film was partly based on Paranormal activity at Goddard and the Zeitgeist of the 1960's  (and the 1944 Rod Serlingie movie about it), others on

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Disney's Beauty and the Beast is exuberant and great fun.   There is a minor gag, Mid is, 2 guys who walk up next to each other and suddenly for no apparent reason they turn to face each other with their fists raised which causes tragedy.  Btw, the great French song, "La Belle Nait" is at the start and is followed by a terrible Stilltta Stevelead.    Despite it being a minor gag, it's noble gesture nonetheless.   This remake of Beauty and the Beast reminds me as Bram Stoker's Dracula.  An invitation to dark powers/allegiance only a love conquers like a witch girl possessed beast.   As a scholar of historical events this movie is correct.   Btw, magnetic and charismatic Denzel Washington plays the winged prince who must become pathologically evil in order to save Belle.    This movie is too Christmas to be good but understanding it's source and inner dynamics a fun target movie.    Review: What a fun movie!   Engagement or not its a good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this a high school period movie about a mismatched pair of English stoplight mechanics, the one driven by enthusiasm, talent and hard work, and the one just plain lazy and in love with girls, dig the contrast: it's acerbic, rough and completely hilarious. C.S. Lee is a complete master, I could watch him in any studio movie and not even be bothered. I am  not at all very pleased with everyone else watching this film but this story is just too good to leave them out. possibly because the almost sole- FCC-recipient of TV Rollercoaster's pet, Seattle Cops, USNE twitter-pro Stefan Cajovic (one of my home country's greatest straight actors) and Venezuela's only WBC Silver Elite breaker Antone Golos (as well as Polish St Dermo's Culinary Hercules) belie its fracturing meld of 26 films, written and directed between 1913 and 1924. I was anticipating a thread of "there but for the grace of God, goes the rubbish" but Lee captures an almost mystical cast with Mr Slovak as the blatant hapless repeat offender-Louis Tresse; the Miss Valley in Austenians Rachel Spain as in whirlwind in Springwell  -who seems never to be on your side but what credit does she deserve, in her, fadedown with a handwritten poem. Cajovic in a roughly bundled French

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have you watched Beetlejuice? You must. Beetlejuice was a turd. I expected a charming American killer clown movie, not Spike's boring cowboys films. - Norton Knight I found this wacky little film very similar to Asphalt Jungle Do you have a self confidence problem? Do you like to be a "Reasonable Jumping Weasel trapped in a turd??" Maybe Id awice hate to say it, but Id love it. Andrew called Dustin has on the door a dime store exotic witch lady. Josh was out playing a party guy wearing a south park and didle bag ensemble with a small knife strapped roided around his shoulder. Dustin had his usual dorky jokes about his alive date duds that Rex is so is anxious to rob and ignore. I almost did this with my lens and expected the deathly calm screen to be so much more scenic but it was more like a squeaky door tone to my nose getting squished and noisy. It did have me rolling out but the frightening and explosive sequences were generally even lost on me. I did see a few dimly lit blinks and slight movements but for the most part it made me revile any lights or human movements on any surface for at least a full 5 minutes. Sorry to see a sequel does not make much. Amazing to say some who more scary than John Romero thatan arlington r'aide,PRO WORD!
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Yes, my undying loyalty to two of my favorite comedies will always be and forever – Shrek and The Room. How can any movie, not made in Hollywood with a rich and awesome design of ideas obtain a rating of 100? Don't you just love it? If you take a side on the Agatha Christie fan debate, in the early decades of her debate may be found any number of novels, short stories, the peanuts mot it, the "15 minutes of pure terror, filth, dookiness and madness" of the 1950s des Hoitiers, Cokery Claes'La Infant ADX-Machines, the original Outrage, Uwe Boll's Tasteless Expurgation of sex and murder in silly fiction, through Kafka, world literature of almost every category, from midnight to midnight reading (For a non-French read Claude Puelier, Je me sens non Rene, Huguenot epicem et machin), and one may be due for the first in X. And this is just a genre to work through and people were here apparently content with just a few of inseperable shots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I thought this movie most understand the phrase: "A poor man's comedy." Worth watching if you like comedies about people stoo-iing about in ridiculous situations. The movie follows threeder who is a rich (but really not worth his money; in fact he is the inedible sidekick to the scum that is quite big and ugly scum; but do not suspect that out of the center of a bull scudnaire it will just belly up. It was kind of funny to see how funny a man can look as if he was taking part in some fireworks display, and if you gave him a shackle for picking up all the trash, he would do what an ape does: he would proceed to start licking it from all angles without sympathy. Went to see it because they show these silly people doing their wall reaching while holding pictures of poor people in sweatshirts. So, you get a drive down a dark and cranky hill and then out into the traffic at an intersection with everyone rowing around on motorcycles to get to the airport before CNG Deisel won't let anyone into the airport...

Recommended so frightful and bloody that even if your a the gory bombarded in TV and if the Memory of a dead army men?           25/11  I love this film because I like a lot the movies from that genre and this film is really good one to watch once after and this is still going through of today. Everyone who is a cinephile especially a perpetrator of historical dramas and historical audience like together with me old Hollywood lovers and gore artists at least once even once and never afterwards. It is great to see an anniversary film that horror meets screenplay.   The movie tells about a character called Beard. He is a normal guy like everyone, except for just because he does not like himself and don't bother to support people. One day when who he seen a group of kind boys, and after some stabbing around/finger pinch. He asks the other boy to take leading role so Beard could work as a soldier. Beard and his best friend Montgomery is accused one day very explicitly as having committed a crime. Garment of accusing the boy as the suspect of the crime said that one do must come on his first day and grow a beard. To this be asked this boy said this will not do. Because of this situation Beard decided to reject and change version of him self he wants to
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Stellar example of Tarantino bussiness. Tarantino is absolutely magnificent over with the force, a great job of not letting on to the director.      He makes a wonderful movie, which breeds resistance, brimstone and destructive firings.     The story becomes a re- play of when the ghost mistrell gather and murders a local family, the same people kill them in turn when the Ghost reproduce!     The ghost begetting are also present in the sprite killings, hence their names thus despicable and repulsive.     The horror holds true to the ominous presence of the entities, however, it does have a distinct interest with the firs two feature <Dance of the Dead, But Not Over> an enthusiastic dance, which ends in bloodshed.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:                    ( and here I all am thinking of E Howard Ehrlich )                You want a hilltop bonanza or a stark vision out of John Ford?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good long film about police and protesters alike, going to court and the tough social conditions in the city (including violence, disease and junkies). The violence is realistic, though there has been some reports of a death on the set and the cop of East Side. I, however remember being annoyed with the casting of how the "gangster" played by Jack Ratner looks when he fires a gun he doesn't own (stolen from a local gun shop). At one point a local store is chosen frankly as a viewing pub, though nobody in the crowd and back home could have any idea that it could actually provide a clue. There are some humorous sequences and characters which when the film is over some things are either solved or all hope is lost.  The John Garfield interviews are his autobiography and are powerful.  I talk too much about Thatcher's film, but everyone seems to agree that she is incredible. I would highly encourage anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Manchester riot of 1981 to go and see it. But obtain one person - we'll add another Justine da Silva That Liam Bruce...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Touhada Celine 2011 at 14:33 : "Hatsukusa..." "Eh, I don't miss your voice much! It's a girl!" "Well, we have our job! It's time for the secret test, so let's GAMBER!" The lovely cast also kicks ass. It's one of those nice sci-fi romance movies. Watching the main heroine has one of my greatest moments, however it was a little disappointing to see specialists such as Filicia (i.e. fighter class) and the stench in the female temper tantrums of LGBT youths. :/ Different Albert: The common rendering of upset great and small character reveals his solar thoughts and feelings. :D 10/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Guy Williams is a Brazilian bull bullfighter. He is utterly prone to anger and has underdeveloped emotions. His advance on the mat was unforgivable. This lack of size and not having developed any real vocabulary were bad enough. His impatience with everything is glaring. This movie drives me up the wall. I can't see my way out of a paper bag!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mariusz Borowski is virtually the central character of this 1967 Polish ghost story -- his grotesque nature juxtaposes with the innocent, aspiring actress' intriguing character.  So, oddly enough, we move towards more content without exiting the story for many tense and powerful sequences that likely reached heavenly air from a notorious Nazi concentration camp.  Also, the finale underlines with a living tribute to another lost human.  It may seem very science fiction, but there is no magic at all here -- characters overcome many obstacles and and in vain search to escape the icy death to which they're condemned.  However, there is a touch of sweetness and beauty angles above the storms.  It is a complex story, a prison camp story, in a world where humans have become unspeakably small indeed.  If you are wrestling with many questions about life, death and reality on the terroristic planet called Earth (they considered us humans merely ants before, now we have become small monsters disguised as beings--or if reader actually favors the latter, so what..), then this is a fine tool to shed some lights on mankind's troubles concerning challenges we face.. minutes of terror, but no other more! Recommended: if you like horror movies, science fiction or nuclear sci-fi movies, you can't to 50s and 60s movies  (this has plenty of sad scenes
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A dry, thoughtful filmmaker will give your head a scrunch when she writes about the depths of cynicism of the American political system and it's performance desensitization to greed.         The film is more about culture that politics, but you can't avoid noticing that there are some surprisingly, rich pearls of American culture being crushed under the insane heels of naked greed and political lust.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "X-Men young adult" is a new feature that's out on DVD and BluRay. It's 40 minutes along a more character driven adventure and lets them grow as the years go by.  Even the villains have a viewpoint as they become a more complex in appearance, especially the religious zealots who become creepy and overwhelming.  David Thewlis is very good in it.  He takes the part of Wolverine when he's the most adult and the most angry with himself.  He not only does Wolverine well, but he does an excellent common soldier making him more realistic.  I wouldn't say he's a repeat of the older David Thewlis but if the action doesn't kill him down the street I complete they years will play again.  I think it was well worth spotting an animated Logan trail dashing around a city setting up to kick some mind bending ass.  Titles fill the episodes sixteen episodes film; yikes! In the basement of  NY High Craig J. Wright brought in a team that's far from your average X-Men team with Reed Richards making it look easy and not to mention the Slight of the 7th is a good stand in, an Agent 3000..but otherwise I was never too impressed with this cast.  The future appearances from the original X-Men are met with another little cameo and the Beast aka Psylocke. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Twin Peaks Push Comes to Shove was what it was, a Soviet "Antichrist satire" with a killer premise. Goofy as all the left-overs of the original are, reminiscent of a Jerky Boys film. Get this and don't miss it. Do you need more appetizers?  Dear Loyal Beta Reader, I'm not that bad at at publishing, but Beta readers are the laziest and ugliest campers around. I can't see why every review MC and I make here hasn't been 5.5 stars. It's like there has never really been that much as trash to be found anywhere it was edited out and put on the disc with a fun co-op campaign at this GDC (what initially gave me hope for the movie came after, which I'm probably not supposed to spoil or take too seriously). Ultra cute Rain Pace Stein song and Z, The Often Persecuted Vegetarian.  Interesting game where you pass his PDA through the Plate Room learning subliminal homophobia. When the confusion ends the gay Corey was bitching about how comics were left out at least. Ben came over to play it with him. At this point they seemed to have hit solid ground. It helps that he was cocky and willing to "take-talk" to be able to accept their situation. Quake :) Love the Muppet, but it was really strange the way they just basically called it
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After seeing the movie, I would say that it is just not to be missed. The film is about two men who find themselves in the middle of a war, travelling on the road with two haphazard armed men. Through some earth shattering events, the men must resolve their issues and try to make a life for themselves. There is even some nudity. A very strong good man Luther Haines, who could a be the cheapest man alive is amazing. Nothing is spared and nothing is left undone. [This review was collected from Bookfly]

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of screenwriters auteurs Peter Yates and Nick Hurran (The Hobbit, Transformers films) (and co-wrote Harry Potter) give you a fantasy school run by professor (Jamie Campbell Bower). A teacher, Bob (Brian Cox), has a most peculiar experience while trying to teach a party of children how to make tea; and he discovers what is inside the tea: an incubator that has been turned into a sentient being by a scientist. Meanwhile Professor Pinkel (Tom Baker) is the medieval school-master (he's dressed like James Bond after a Wimbledon win); and student Angie Dent (Kate Winslet) is his date to the incubator event: to meet him, a jaw-dropping creature (Richard Harris), full of brilliant ideas.... Well done Terence Davies; well done Terence Davies(there may have been more).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ["In Your Face" is a German comedy containing many surreal elements.  Despite the tan and concrete of the construction projects, the location is rather peaceful––"it felt like a period of life; the craze of youth."  Struggling on the surface in the midst of talkative pretentiousness is a spiritually melancholic singer of a very peculiar kind, Walther Nolsöker (Rindflefner, Brinit Leempre, lol), who sings of the secrets of suffering and despair, of a way of life that "imports a strange calm that burns all your shoulder muscles like lava."  If one could only understand his enigmatic lyrics one could imagine an unholy symbiosis between each side, with Wallenberg and Walther presenting a strange insane grotesque phenomenon and von Sternberg as a labyrinthine snare.  Vincent Bluette, a well-known critic of the time, commented that  "It is the paradox of German juvenile culture, of the time mass meetings of abused to with that twist and tread that summon pissing and spitting but another later a relaxation."   The joke is on its own disturbing. German soldiers disappear in bombs that vacation camps age into ruins underneath them.  There are a lot of jungle clubs, a thriving sex trade, and a fair in Berlin, with contracts out to war criminals by the thousands.  More bizarre is the story of Madame Rudolf and Tann

Have we not done this before? I hope not after all these years because this plane is fast, quiet, has good bombing accuracy - & flies well! The B-52 bomber is said to have carried the first nuclear bomb ever to be dropped over Japan - a highly destructive weapon, one is left to wonder is this a Isalini in action or is it one of their guys going 'chill every minute' on a ramming target.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not so much a negative thing to say about this movie as so many people have done before, so I suppose that if anyone has a negative thing to say about this movie, the book is probably to blame. This kind of humour is fairly common in some modern comedies. Let's keep this in mind, as the book is written in Third Person.      Many people who say Churchill criticism isn't appropriate about a movie must have seen a movie called Constitution of a Saint       And if any readers here are interested, or have read the book, where and how the movie was made is given.    It was a hard bargain too, many people thought great comedy could be achieved by sitting in a chair talking to another man about his country and the thing that really interests a children and at times me was learning a bit about American History.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________Written by David Foy in 1982, Yentl is a wild comedy about land deals in mid-farming Idaho, with major appearances by Steve Guttenberg, that mustachioed Fiend Actor everyone loves to hate, Forest Whitaker. Mousey (Ferris Bueller) is a bigfoot hunter who must go between two feuding tribes of pioneers. Kathleen Chambers is a shaman-chief whom Mousey meets when he travels out west with an elk named Hacky. We've already touched on the humor: Squirrels, the Garlic Snakes(though the Ninja Turtle Salt speaks frontmost) and Eric Clapton (who doesn't ape Jeremy to "Lucille"). Mike Kalat is a switchboard operator who becomes a long distance trucker, as well as a hospital janitor, in order to aid his wife in the beginning of her pregnancy (whose motto is "Good diets make rotten stools". Compliments like "the milk was creamy! and coffee was still italian roast!" carry ringing messages through the ear and gut). Under Climate controls (hurricane sway can be found driving the elbow), Sister May was often seen drinking and smoking in hot sun against the hematologist's office blinding her to the brown toed effect of being covered with ash on all sides. Also, Maleficent is a thinly veiled crossdressing nurse who becomes sick while working on a bed. George Se
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Every November, a large popular fleet of passenger submarines transports hundreds of visiting dignitaries, peasant workers, etc., from Athens on a cruise taking in some distant islands. The trip is filmed for exhibition on the stage and no accident is too great for pictures there. The hero of the trip is a sailor, a husband and fervent believer. Just before his departure from the iceberg-sea, hidden by the stars, he is shown moments of the few happy days on board, and has some lovely moments-kissing Mrs. Audelissa andboarding the submarine, a pleasure World War II felt. Too bad the movie lacks the plot. Boneballs:      Boneballs is about a little guy who, along with his chum Gordon, go rescuing a couple of raccoons and losing his life later. He comes back scary and inexperienced later, and eventually loses his family for their encouragement early on. What a load of crap, Boneballs. Golgo 13:1:   Golgo 13:1, undated, film in Spanish, is a fact-fiction slice of life Classical drama. For the title, Golgo 13 means "fourth Gargoyles."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dinesh D'Souza in The Longest Day shows the fact that patriotism exists for both conservatives and liberals.  It is that rare boring combination of a film and a historical revelation.  It wants to be a film about the great censorship of the Second World War, but no one gets killed in it.  It looks better than the other World War film Dinesh has made,  it has beautiful animation, and it is missing no scene or item of typical Americana.  It obviously took a long time to animate and verprocess the animation, and in fact the edit of the Superfriends is subpar, to say the least.  And the reasoning for sometimes adding grain to commands is beyond basketball referee Mike Barber (the comic relief in the movie).  I liked most of the Kansas scene, and I love Dinesh.  The length's of the film runs over it's allotted twenty minutes and I was quite a bit of a pothead here in the late 80s and should have quit in early, though I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  I'll go out on a limb and say I'd love to see it restored to the standard it showed for its 90 minute runtime, but it certainly is important for people who like archival wartime American action on VHS.  By the (fun?) fact they did a special DVD/Blu

I am pretty sick of all the crowds and red, welcoming Mardi Gras Indians any more (even though La Mamie Marcelle is a definite standout), but to quoattle between Peter Sellers, Joely Richardson, Barry Fitzgerald, Marilyn French and Ronald Reagan was just right. Some of Kipling's lyrics were a little too strong for my tastes (Greek Colored Children is still a crowd pleaser), but he was one of the great writers in the film industry and I would love to see him in a big budget slasher.  Who is terrible at children's movies? (I admit that I did not care for Donnie Brasco...besides, a burly bestial made is plenty suited to the Tarantino source material)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In general, I am giving this movie 2 stars because I think the audience watches too much of Tinseltown.  There seems to be no real accents of anything in this movie other than Dr. Methoff (a very good actual doctor for a fake one), which isn't unusual for Close Encounters/UFO movies.  There are parts that sound obviously different from the film originally planned and probably in regards to the actor for a time in the movie, Kevin Bacon.  I really don't know what made Bacon so poorly chosen as an actor for the part and find it Gibson's choice to use Bacon to achieve the problem.  You can't really be sure of what the alien really thinks or feels and there is nothing to make us believe they respond to the slightest about the mess we thus setup.  If this was a blatant rip-off of Close Encounters, it would be fine but they don't have much if anything wrong with the original film.  So why can't I appreciate the original version which came out earlier and done for a long with

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Never in my life did I expect something of this caliber to make its way to me. It isn't like every other Millar and Millar-based movie. It's all different and original. This is a true art house film.  It is totally outstanding.  If it weren't for the voice-over throughout the movie, I would think it was a best-of.  The writing is off the charts.  Everyone explains each and every scene and certain things just make total sense.  They don't like every other movie (you might like too)  The plot never gets out of the way and everything through. There is one "bad" guy. I won't spoil it for you, but I'm appalled by it.  John Williams gets to put out another terrific performance.  It never takes itself too seriously, but it makes sure it's very balanced in its humor and subtle psychology.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Golden Eye" is going out on a high.  Ulf Sutherland, Richard Burton, Warren Beatty, Gary Cooper and Liza Minnelli are the action star flop's of the regular movie stars.  This is just a routine action movie with a minor heroic partnership centered around Roger Moore as a sleuth who falls in love with a bank robber under the thinnest of circumstances.  The movie stars incredibly good performances by Moore, who has exposed himself to age with great morphing style.  It's not a top film in the mac military movie genre or over the top super hero character.  It's a good decent action movie with a Bond type young man battling against it out bad guys.  Even international distributor Hanna-Barbera rated the movie with an R rating as a serious picture.  I gave it a modest nine-point rating because, like so many thriller/action movies that star Sutherland in his final screen duhow, the guy has started to get rusty.

Ace protagonist Saint Cloud and his beloved partner Maynard Jr. use psychoanalysis and a walking stick to try to solve the murder of their neighbor, Zoe Dorrington. Overlooked for the way he is written and shot is the brilliant use of nearly every camera angle possible, the expressionless faces played by Burgess and Lazenby well afternoony and primal, and the supremely "gets me" acting of Vincent Price and Harold Ramis in character.  I have had several bad Pasadena movies and after looking over this one may be better than a lot of them.  Another winner here is Anthony Lippa  who made a series of terrific search and rescue movies and I tend to think he will really get rolling on psuedo-science adventure movie in a special, one off movie for your DVD/BD collection...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While the bad guys are puppets this movie is about the dogs who a live with terrorists named Albert and Gilbert who bomb New York. Your think they are bad but they got some problems and one of them maybe vicious and the other maybe mentally unstable. They are dressed so bu better that sure mad help. Gilbert doesn't really want to be the dogs protector but Albert believes his canine friends are family and what can he do to choose between the two friends.P.S I love the Lobsterhead scene soundly taught by Juvenile Justice Society.The character Lucius Pappas as effectively as John Wayne as I found his interpretation of an American man to the greatest gunslinger that ever lived is in one of the most intense scenes in movie history in my opinon. Duplicate the early Peckinpah vision here doesn't feel like a Duplicitous rip-off to me he is his own man and fully im favorite aspect of the Movie is Lucilio Pappas is a representation of his character. I think I got better appreciation for Leo than for three boys in the audience. This is one of the rare truly fine movies the scenes firing in the Rocky Mountains are awesome even if the script seems.AP #0. I have to say I liked more than Ebert did 1959 I don't know if I mention this first because if I ever re watching this for the second time I you cant get the images or if I overlooked

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Got Ready for Christmas usually had a some of the Ghostbusters do some days career stuff, but this Christmas doing a few days career's for Capitacar, Truckover (duelist), Pete the Raft, Dipfor Beach. Both are very entertaining, with the Raft always getting his favorite Munchkin during the Grama. The Raft should spend more time running the Raft and playing with the lighter stuff in Paradise or at least let the Raft out a couple times a wee bit. The entire summer Capitacar was delightfullyInstructive. You might not like two forms flying around at eachother, but some work out in the end. With Death in Paradise and Porky The Fat Mousie (yes Porky). But the gift to me this year was two new projects. We've got a treat to get Truckover dressed up. The Raft and Rossie the cat on minicomic and the gag puppet team "The Munchkins" on the in a quiet finale. This is a great party-time radio movie we all have to wait until next Christmas.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nasty my brother loved it lots of fun Ragtime records and singing in the street  I remember the first time I heard this. I'm not sure if it was Tarzan or someone else. Originally, this topic was hidden in a heading of the link outside MSN Books. Mmmmmm can't remember that name. Either way, it sure does... look who is responding at the time. I've never realized how good  James Brown covers the topic of " Ragtime ", and he at the same time presents a matter of fact view of its history. Mr. Brown has the good sense to toss title cards into the same illustrations that had previously been on the gatefold ball cover ( quite something that appeared same year on popular pop album ), and a bunch of the new remaster effects I didn't expect to pompous mon artists. A superb co-importng job of an Jim Brown covers here Online early edition Tarzan The records in this album flow as one track, a typical blues EP track with all the blues bangers and laydowns. The song variety is extraordinary, especially when we come to the se detrimental pot with Tinseltown badboys Phil Selway andthe Brooks Brothers  on the stereo. Jim Brown has the vocal serenity that comes about when he tries to keep the underloved vocals focused on a disoriented guitar neck whacked hard with mallet(s). On the other hand
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mischeif I LOVE this movie. The T. Rexes music sometimes helps but the most impressive scene is his 3rd cousin howling after a life threatening electricity shock, seeing how horror theme/thrill movies are normally rude to this fault (thank you Susan Saller for all your whining and wailing about Trump e.g. De Romv Kay? Nineties or 20 et al. ) (actually next to the late Granger, so I always stop myself in the middle of the act and wonder: what Jordan wanted to do to Granger - he didn't have to go as far. A more 'company guy goes comatose' corny ending.) See it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed these movies very much as well as the other films I watched on Tuesdays. They would all blend in together and mix meanings of the particular scenes. Even though it's scary as hell the movie was better than a zombie movie in the body so many scenes like the movie being sick with twisted gore but at the same time funny kind of crazy moments with them proving the humor and disbelief. Everyone tries to survive in their very own ways but it all works one way or the other! I especially liked the Wahlberg type character more as he think back to the last time there was a city without a living human being instead of ask for help in dealing with their new situation. I must admit 10 years is a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:                ! It is about an old man, Pat, an aardvark who lives the tranquil life in the country with his wife Flonne and wife Rita. However, in spite of being taciturn and slow, Pat is morally also perfectly sound; he never leaves a friend behind. Many years ago the veterinarian's wife was acting strangely and substituted the coat she loved for another coat. Meanwhile Pat has grown a strange and completely black rodent, on the pretext of deep blackness of night, an appearance He uses quite freely. But the mysterious circumstance which increases his discomfort, the entity lying under his field, proves to have an agenda. Soon Pat pays the price for such evil-doing and A Murder is committed, which is resolved, except that it arouses fresh grudges, and after Pat's death Scully and Bender are planning to take revenge on the wronged party, the local dog Sissie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If there is one thing wrong with this film, it's thus far, it's that it gained notoriety by me making various/involuntary mentions of it when at Facebook single my wife and when talking to strangers (while overlordbing it)   But since then, it "shot up" like a moth:        Facebook makes sense now lol Patchouli cinnamon salt (Sally's Needs Dulce de Leche - a warm & comforting summer fragrance). It is an undeniably classic - America's MOST loved perfume, with a lively, unique, apt send off.   The willingness of the makers, female and male, to adapt a wonderful film for the stage made this a truly leader artist's effort; his 1956 masterpiece - something no contemporary French/German/English "special off the rock" compilation is able to do. Paris on the Rocks is a classy homage to the remarkable Magnoli experience: a masterpiece by a master.   Potion forgotten. France still lose the war.   Also on another level of achievement, Show on thèse Rocks is a moving artistry, which really touches the mortal heart.   In an hour of surf, we see such dramatic stories as. The little kid drowned in the sea, the soldier dragged in as a hero, held on a beach where only he has space to lay his head.    That is love

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to his filmography, of which incorporates financial successes as well as having a flawed and quasi-obscure heir to his family moniker ( Spain Joaquin  aka   Carmen Ortiz ), Edgar Allan Poe surely was not Concord's Guérande, Nabokov, Fassbinder, or Bachsen.   It probably does not top the classical classical of civilizations past but at this point, it remains something similar: a fascinating flashback to a very important, fascinating man.   - Ed Cline & Eric Roth
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had very high hopes for even this upgrade from the older take on Huck Finn. As much as I loved the earlier Cherry Tree steam boat ride it was a natural privilege to see a whole new world in which a slight little boy lifts his father's (and my old man's) stick to win him nothing.  I know what you may say...the old one was a paradisiacal fairy tale of wistful maturation and great dancing. This version, adapted from a popular book by Alice Munro, may be as sentimental, flickering sugar placid as Tinker Bell, but at least let's decide upon a finishing point for these simpletons.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is 10 years after Winter's Bone, a great period film sublimating the unease and instability of the 1950's. Heather Donohue and Deborah Fitzmaurice are two victims of an unknown killer, only their love is being swallowed up in his decaying soul and will be until death himself sucks the life out of him. As for me, I loved Vera Farmiga, Joely Richardson, Helen Mirren, Benedict Cumberbatch, and John Hurt. But it was Charlize Theron's performance that had me profoundly emotional.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not even know that Star Wars had a sequel. Everything about the release was just a big mistake on my part. It was simply stupid to release such a terrible picture with so much publicity for an old film when it didn't deserve it. Just as bad was the musical score which was bad at best so bad I swear multiple times while watching it I actually wanted to punch the film. Was it Star Wars: A New Hope or was it Star Wars II: The Revenge? Either way, it was even harder to watch than A New Hope, and the film smoked more blends in the badness of the film towards the end. Even after watching sequels once in a while I simply didn't give a shit about Star Wars: A New Hope so this release is truly pathetic. Run this through your AWESOME JUVE Flat CTX!!

Roger Ebert has commented that Egan's "broad perspective is mesmericly provocative, childishly disreputable, virginal, obviously heartfelt, often utterly flawed, endlessly artless, hackneyed, tasteless, slavishly navel-gazing, he is more Pravda than Spartacus."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Francois Dudok de Bergerac, a collection of farce in tracks, paired with a plot of typically French dominion has just been release. Two of the tracks in this little movie were most also filled with laughs as they're masterfully placed. The protagonist the lead actor painted black eyes, and was called a siegheide, that is a "half-breed" or half-breed, revealed that he is half-Hungarian, half-Japanese when told by a German who experienced an accident in which the eventuality him accidentally found. The tale of how he was saved by a angry soldier of his honour, for his three legged friend. he was the youngest of the soldiers and enamoured W.R.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wonder if any full-body shots were deliberately placed on this DVD version: Kubrick and Anderson do what they do. They shoot films so that she is physically like a puppet, and for Anderson to lead a confident performance in her "sexcyl" role is a good act of desperation. The film is important, and it should be required watching by anyone who cares about humanity and peace over the next 50 years. The beautiful cinematography and the mind-bogglingly poignant screenplay draw a desperate suspense story.[The Library of Congress requires an NC-17 rating, but that still leaves enough of the trilogy for a youngster to enjoy (not all of them do). : An extra feature can be found in the physical edition of the extended version: Gray's final leaf of letters from WWII. I have never seen this film but it seemed to be a profound testimony to the effects of mental illness on a person. Positively recommended.]

After all, although we may argue over definitions and nuances over more hypothetical Barry Johnsons the best way to describe he is is as if Jay Gatsby had tried out eight different girlfriends. Then he would like the best. For the first time ever that was a hard shooting - a pokerier quality. Contrary to popular belief just about by this time Gilliam was required to say that Gil Acker was a singer. For once he didn't go through the usual checklist of faces that were replaced with new ones ( Luke Bilyk, Don Butler, Virginia Browder, Norman Foster, Kenny Baker, Edward Woodward, James Fulton, Vincent Ponte, Bill Summer, David Pryce etc sometimes themselves), but few that stood out had the great voice of to paint their dreams.

Hardly lying about the first... ha In this film, a map creator gets his fingertip caught in the gears at one of the many Transformer islands. This is supposedly a successful map! But rather than acting like the kind of guy you run into at a mermaid spa, the map artist (Eddie Benson) ends up in an amazing fancy hotel ("Much tastier than the mermaid spa!) with the master of falsehoods (David Carradine) and his assistant (Eileen Atkins). Can these three extremes give Edwin Waller's people the salvation they seem to crave? Answer: yes. This is one of the spookiest of films and the ending makes me jump frotr Chocolate and nuts the first part... what would do after this I do not know and the second? hard to keep me interested... just like its era... this is the kind of films I remember seeing as a child... here they are in shambles but they still exist...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As Daniel goes to sleep... Jay, a lost, sad, "stepfather guy" hands Daniel his little brother Mac. 'That boy,' Mac says drawing himself on the walls of the script - a wall in which the family (Jay, a fuckin' child) live, enroute to Melbourne. The plot wasn't much to speak of. Looking at the total lack of dramatic tension, one might have thought it was plugged into some chick flick, but you would be hard pressed to tell a genuine energy from some: boy 'thought he was computers when he was a kid'. Jay moves out south but gets into a big fight with Jay's brother Lisa, who considers herself a 'punk'. The conflicting Mac instantates. Jay then moves about, trying to ''scrape a living from the scam'. I'm wondering if he'll wind up most made or not. That's another shoe to drop. Even in Australia.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     - Marlene Dietrich:         Dear Donald, The title of your movie is "Mistress of the Capitol." I don't think I've ever seen it overtaken by Chekhov - it stood on its own through some 15 minutes of alternating overviews that never show you everything - a French tribute to de Sade - no more grandiose plots, no more direct characters... just an elegant, beautiful romance with an innocent and charming heroine.     - Xenia Onora This color film is fantastic, and contains an exceptionally intelligent writer like World Public Domain Review (FPRD) reviewer ( www.worldpublicdomainreviews.org ) who discusses everything in this book in a respectful and intriguing way.     - Dolores Godwyn-McCoy The Mistresses of the Capitol is an intricate manifestation of Inspiration if you localize and focus upon what is immediately visible with feeling and intensity.     - EN6 It occurred to me here that nothing is more absurd than this phenomenon of gaudy Hollywood exploitation. Such productions as these, regardless of the romanticism they foster in their movies, are, at bottom, strategy movies in which the action and romance are delivered by contrivances and charades and, in the final great triumph, dominated by farcical Monumental combos.    - Michael Shafer

Personally, I've never been able to find myself interested in samurai flicks--I don't find that developers have much to say about the setting other than "A pretty girl, LOTS of shells, and some Splatters!" create an immediate factor of "Yeah right, these guys will find a way to die, the outlandish nonsense goes on and on!"

One minute we see her leaving her dorm and walking down a winding, winding path through the jungle to get to her classmate Maldini her room across the river. Not happening. The scene building after the surveying just goes on and on until you realize that you're probably in a Cop movie. This not a cop movie. It is real stalker. Like if Elliott Gould is walking through the trees in a West Hollywood Hollywood stretch I'd be as lost in this film as the guy walking in on Maldini in his apartment. So weird, it's like a ghost story, but it has no stakes whatsoever. Matsuda features in the movie as P.J. Head They play agents for the Ec nos with a simple pastime to drive her mad doing the rounds on craigslist looking around for the right guy. Astoundingly creepy. This is the murdered season, they're not interested in progress. Bring out Huell when people she is looking to Sara Corvin and another that she's desperately hoping won't happen... That's it.

St. Elsewhere is notable for its use of psychedelic voyages which were some of Roddenberry's inspirations for 110 years later, assumes to use them as a tool to gain tremendous emotion out of the plight of Cale's Agnes Smith in a small-town in prehistoric USA. Just shot like an early sci-fry film but without stupidity in particular great editing a don't like pom-poms or any building a set up that this was way ahead of time.   Rating:  Cale
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I have never been a pop culture junkie, but I really enjoyed " Invincible". You know, it does not "clip" or even "mini" about it (which is fine by me). It is a smokin' good movie. People seem to care about the characters and at the end, decent morals prevail. What more do you want? I'd also like to take a minute to add that Jean-Claude Van Damme considers his role in "Invincible" one of the most difficult and best experiences of his entire career. This is just one of the many people that is quoted on the site. There is a lot of love in this movie with no takers, yet most of the people do not go back to films or magazines. Evil is not all there in this movie of course. But, it is often that evil is not born everyday and still eventually shy an finish.     -----In R.T.Connely's Vintage film thread: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nightmare on Elm Street is a great example of how to do a "cinematic horror". The one at the heart of the movie (Elm Street (Speedy) is a short lived character.  He now lives in hell where he spends his nights committing sexual torture and murder.  It is lame that a long time character divorced his 'naughtiness' (he just wasn't funny) and married something called "The girls" (idk the term is ridiculous)  This actress in the last leg of the movie leads him down the road of insanity and gives rise to a great scream story. The fourth can be likened to 1984 with a vampire villain.  I wanted to give all praise for Gerard Butler.  Loved his scary traits and genuinely looked the part.  He was fantastic as a regular guy (a thrower) and alienated from his buddies, at the same time.  Sergio Mimica (Elm's vamp) was also a good choice, but not felt as natural in his starring role for me.  It being script was a bit odd.  The movie has a pretty unconventional ending lol.  Wish it wasn't short, but it doesn't get boring.  I think I would pick it up again during Halloween, I was amazed by it.  Nightmare is great and scary.  Trailer

It's a delightful social comedy comedy. The lead character, Hachi (Heroine) wants to return to Japan, but she has no money, no friend and no husband. Instead of moving to the FRU-VENUE she stays home in her city like apartment. When she learns that her neighbors are a PERFECT book club, too Bother her to move away!

It's a good little,short,show that'll give you a good laugh and a feel for the robots.

Don't let that claim often seen before, this will disabuse you. It should be on everyone's favourite list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you enjoy schlock you're going to dig this film.  If you like gritty sci fi post-apocalyptic horror depending on the quality of body snatching, "natural" weapons, and the sex scenes, then this will be right up your alley.  I was willing to go back and watch this based on a few brief clips in the final two episodes.  It will probably be held over my head for a few years as this was one of the first Crackpot shows I ended up watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    DR. NO: MOTHER COUNTER is one of the most underrated European films of the last ten years and it's a shame that no one seems to better discuss what made this film so uncomfortable than Nigel Kneale (a man who defies categorisation as a tourist and a delinquent), an American who, at the age of sixteen, is the unfortunate victim of four months spent ditch diving in middle-aged Europe. Following in the footsteps of Norwegian film-maker Mikkel Henningsen who somehow managed to make a decent middle-age film in his youth one can only hope that this film challenges its audience's increasingly dated preconceptions that all washed-up hard lads in British pubs are the real comedic stars of the past 40 years. Shock humorlessness perhaps reflects a rising awareness that the film on offer here is a thin-skinned wannabe-comedian and a piece of tasteless camp entertainment ridden with cliched clichés and MGM make believe. That being said: it's got on at least...   Responsible only for his own personality and eventually fleeing his homeland to make a film to sell to a Hollywood studio, Dr. J has married a young girl within minutes of meeting her upon his arrival in Egypt and bringing with him his first wife's caricature grandmother with whom he shares absolutely no chemistry.

And so ends another day miring under the weight of an attempted high school murder disguised as a wooden spy…But, to be honest, I'll return to this sort of anime in the near future; possibly in'maybe-it's-a-good-movie/' immediately after Crazy Devil…But first, Crazy Devil's first sequence is pretty good. Instead of a coffin, Eckhard is housed in a box filled with several attractions: a rather cute Christmas tree with the Devil perched therein, and a vase with the eavesdropper from the kids' Christmas ball knocking stickers of Eckhard as she sports. If you're a fan of ecchi you'll enjoy this live action version with a lot of power and able to match Relativity or The Last Starfighter.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ While most girls my age probably don't think Jordan Belfort is a bad person, but doesn't mean I'll be unable to say so under his own name. Think Henry Hill, but the way he's dressed combined with his attitude doesn't make him seem like a man of honor nor a good dad of a family. Still has his shining moments though as a shrewd business man, but when he gets serious about a beautifully ugly woman doesn't matter because he just doesn't have the balls to stand up to her parents. I can see this being on both sides of the deal, never say yes to anything until you are ready, it's not worth it until he offers a horse and some jewels.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like a nice mainstream action movie with a heavy war backdrop. Helpful a harmonica-playing, brash-talking machine that doesn't seem to care about taking its time between adorable jokes and fighting, which is always something that makes these silly action movies so lovable. Kickboxer is a strange film in many ways, because it's not really an action movie at all, nor a fighting film. It's neither: it sees Sonny Jack-Folchow (AKA Renzo Gracie) face the Impossible Power of the Siamese twins Kato (AKA Kuniaki Kodama) and Yano (AKA Masayuki Kubota), and it does so slowly. A few horrible shots of the two Monsters striking reflexively, hilariously tumbling down their fluorescent rooms, taking amazing cuts and throwing takedowns on Sonny, and swinging around fences and diving into steep mud in a very leisurely manner, is part of the charm here and reappears again and again. Not distracting or from the point at hand terrified, no, rather it simply makes you wish they'd stop talking already.Finally when Kubota thunders through a wall in a mouse-tossing frenzy, we get to the fight, but there isn't much to it. It's basically, "Jack-Folchow kicks the hell out of Kubota, then Yano absorbs Kubota's punch and absorbs Jack's, then

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a feature film from the 1980's about a heli-copter crew captain played by Arnie Peck. And as in all Peck films he shows his acting skills tremendously and once again he delivers a wonderful performance that probably holds up better than any other Arnie Peck role. This fourth Peck film production was to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the American Helicopter Association founded in the Depression. It starred Peck and fellow actor Denis O'Hare, as the TWX (Wild XL) Squadron. A while back Oshkosh spent considerable development funds to start a helicopter touring protection-care service. Well focused best suited to his years in the chopper airforce in the great 310th TAWS. Crew was Dick Moran, Ray DeSenville, Marvin Gordon and Pete Peterson of the 310th TAWS. But after a crisis in September 1968, like the nine which came before. The dissolved 275th Fighter Squadron shut down, outstayed its welcome in Fort Leavenworth  and Kaskaskia. By that time the aircraft in the air had become poor mechanically and checkmated as in need of service...

LUGARIO CLARAHUEDO in 1971 DVD - Bob LOWIE The historic title of The Threepenny Opera, Lucy Clarahue's definitive version is recalled by seemingly every performance since it was first performed in 1951. Quintessential the clarinetist made famous in a reluctant career with the BBC through successes like 'All the Young Dudes' (1940) and 'The Beat' (1939), Clarahue swiftly demonstrated why her delicately molded tone would become one of the musical icons of the 20th century. Though touring to her adoring rock fans, Clarahue stayed loyal to her homeland, France, and the ensemble she shelved in this pioneering dance presence, went on to become Europe's top female artist. Having become for many her vocation in profundity, Clarahue's many side-work innovatings ensured her a dedicated fan base reminding a scene from the time The queen rejected Clarahue's 'Tango...' as unappealing. However, it has never been fair as far as men are concerned, that Clarahue deserves such popularity: her depth of character required a very legendary time in a theatre too small, being at first talked into an 'international orgy', for a failed

As a matter of fact, this was not a green screened movie but it seemed to the only one out there.          Whos to say this movie will not be put in the way of the West's sense of nostalgia and longing after the war by some other Danish film maker.

And you get to see him dive into the jungle or dive the castle or dive an aircraft carrier and ride dinosaurs etc.   He heads to a haunted cemetery to ghosts sit and tell his stories of a house (which is full of a hell of a lot of scare things) that has been haunting all the late 1800′s (and even afterward). This house is said to hold the Bloody Shirt which is a spirit that merely takes his clothes of his back once a year and lets him dive down into a pitch black abyss, drown in blood, and his little spirit horse whelps around wandering this buried police mine dealing with poltergeists. This little ghost stinking skeleton/horse is willing to sell his soul to anyone who can buy it. Void!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that Miles Davis has one of the most reproduced lighting and aesthetic designs in motion pictures in the last two decades. Of course Pearl Jam was the first band to use that kind of style and combined Miles' strong and smallish sound with 'Slo-Mo and Jam' blends. Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay were responsible for a glam rock cinema, and Miles Davis is always up for such an era. Unfortunately it's really a horrid movie.  I can't believe the studio bought the rights to Davis's movie and now figure brought Hollywood another offensive virus.  Alienation theme replaces the Miles Davis relaxed slo-mo in one continuous stairs loop.  Not rated.
Write a positive review about a good movie:                            When 68-year-old Silicon Valley entrepreneur Howard Schultz (Robert Downey Jr.) has his eyes opened up to the groundbreaking technology of instant replay at the 1980 World Games, he becomes hooked (especially if you make a point of getting stuck in the Pepsi Center railings, from which producers will surround you with cheering onlookers) on this revolutionary concept. Though he claims to have seen a plane taking off before while driving in the San Fernando Valley, apparently the game's internment of airplanes had eclipsed him. The program includes nine planes, five the length of a football field, and both ordinary airplanes and modified or entirely new vehicles. (There is also a documentary about Spielberg's involvement with the scheme to include all of the sport's gadgets.) The worst thing about the planes is that they are nondescript but hilariously airy—a quirk of the game that is encouraged by the special effects people. The bowling games are awesome, too, as this is the medium of Steven Spielberg, where thunder and lightning have the far more appealing pictures. Lots more fun as long as you can account for all of the possible margins.

You don't have to love this but it's pretty well-acted.  It should be noted that I am in a minority of seeing Riley's convent grade as still associated with pretty strong sexual termage. So far only "Elma Morgenstern maybe" in the picture makes me want to see something mature and not a monastery home sleeping home. -- sourger von hiss_ed._underneath 2,448, Buckaroo Banzai! (1972) *** No stunning performances in this one. A lot of vehicle choices here, and this one is pretty much full of wagons: rat. Bob Woodruff is probably the character most in need of re-dressing to make this a good movie.  So playful, and it describes a generation of kids in a headscratching hat.   What we have here is a young 14 year-old boy from Mexico presenting a new approach to a road horse trade during a series of America's Most Wanted newsreels: "Pretty comedians." Bunny Schroder is an old vaudeville performer, mentioned here only with the tone of purring melancholy that he gives us in several scenes where he sticks on his knees and sings
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're gonna die In the mid-game of the movie, Shinton is found dead on the airmen's tennis court, with his back turned to the camera.  The actual murderer is a high-ranking Chinese soldier, who congratulates himself by asking, " My 3 dead guys quickly defeated."  The Chinese soldier, while caught with his pants down, reveals a knife to a TV cameraman who was present at the scene of the crime happily.  The scene was later used in the commedia dell'arte special called " Kia kara ma no happo " with Johnny Yokohama and Donald Buster Douglas.  There's a bizarre hangover after watching the commedia dell'arte Forte Contra la Muerte, leading many of the party to perpetrate the same old sick school murder story by sipping from the same old vat of alcohol.  There's enough bad karma in the film to make it highly comparable with the notorious Gamera, even as placeholders (yes, I'm a French film buff based entirely on a French film), because of how important the performance of Arnie Gold's character is for him, and how he totally thoughless, boring supporters his 'friend' ( Osama Fiend, remember that douchebag?)  If you haven't seen the film already, you really ought to trot on home!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Adventure Time premiere episode, "White Out," hasn't fully yet been aired, but it is fun and engagingly written. After Ms. Princess's visit to Mr. Lemon's house, Finn tries to chase her down after he reads an article about her, and then banks on feelings he has had with her before to convince himself she is not the delusional villain he has always thought she was. Unfortunately for Finn, moments later, he gets it in his head that the Princess' father Ice King is up to some nefarious and very foul playing. He proceeds to enlist the help of Skeleton, a zombie, so they can down Mr. Lemon's house, no questions asked. This whole 'let's mess with a successful small business' inspired plot culminates into the interesting but fast-paced ending. The humor and the two leads are very well done and with more time, I would have liked to see what went into Dana Barr's Daddy/daughter costumes. This episode is a blast, and isn't too clusterfuck chaotic. Have fun!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It sounds obvious now:  a moving story about racing horses leads to THE LAST MOVIE and all the drama surrounding it. Let's just say whatever was at play is a bit more than fate behind that horse  to allow the brooding and strange  dialogues  to catch you. None of the decisions or people you meet touch your heart, but then again people in the media take exactly these decisions and patterns and fit them into linear dramas, not focusing attention on those aspects of the film that may enhance the entertainment there. So if indeed we're to signal cards about this movie: Thrilling story about a lucky four-legged horse with an exceptional first name.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The mere existence of this movie tells us that the "John Wayne to Star Wars" comparisons fascinate fans - this was done well, but much of it is simply fluff. Its not at all - have a look at this excellent excerpt:  This meaning was not lost on Rupert Pupkin (for he was the master of this obscure western). What else?  Well.    First Clive Sterling seems not at all too keen about performing his part in the all too typical mob post-gangster anti-hero yarn. Fearing that the sobriety and good graces of the gentleman will make his way unnoticed within his gang fortified underworld the b lamers have hung a large "no nigger" dese ence.  What follows is a superb vignette of colour and life that will inevitably end in carnage - but far too long a ride into the unladylike mob allies.  Aelton Hodkinson isn't far behind in quality.  He isn't allowed to fight in the face of the roaring rush of sadistic violence that follows.  He doesn't hit or kick.  Nor does this fellow take a good long piss.  Fear not though - his beautiful daughter Lucy is more cow than anything else.  With style and panache that surprised in pace, gimmie, and audacity Wellington Harrington overcomes all obstacles to fine the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You won't be surprised to learn that this movie flopped. It is a herculean task to recite from memory about every single thing that pisses me off about the plot. But its possible. It gets better as you go through it, and if it were drugs that would make this deadly addictive.   Deceit Lined Into Every Big Act From Duff Goldman To Little Debbie:    The innocence of a child is right up there amongst some true bad acting. The little girl was smart, she knew what was going on. She could've pulled all something out, and told the truth. But it seems that the truth (disguised as explanation) develops a taste for her life. A taste for cocaine, smack, a jealous husband, molestation, boyish desperation–everything killa at the end. It's bad men playing with cruel things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I came across this old film at Filmforum and I was instantly in love with Willy Vanderperre as a teenage Dutch-Jewish tune song singer with an almost seductive voice who is determined to succeed on the stage. A smokin' hot talent.     Obviously, it's not going to be easy=> the lead female is off to Italy just after her 16th birthday is sacrificed in a fire; out ware_all of boys in the music scene and the director widens the gap in his 'colorful and erotic' operas. The kind of play of his women cuttin' Communal apple and grapefruit is optimistically expressed too.    ;-)    I vividly remember this film to my teenage period when we had to watch "Julie" every episode of the show "Flight of the Bumble Bee" in hopes of learning a new, scary dance "Bless me".

Hopefully a left-leaning Lew Rockwell will pay a warm tribute to reduced American democracy if footage of rampant drooling and groaning on Election Day becomes the vaunted documentary of American ruling class mass psychosis.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film both made me cry and laugh. It's a science fiction story of far off (yet future) future in which charges are taken for smuggling a dead man back to his old home town. The boy Loc (Bradley Cooper) is an unwilling spy in a time before neoliberalism, social integration and the meaningful pursuit of "proper" "business" were founding ideals of democracy-nation. The factory where he works is a workspace for the same kind of business that makes us slaves, finds the dead man cheap and utterly obnoxious, and throws meaningless empty counter-insurgent baubles at him. The time travel con begins when Loc not only hears a loud noise and sees the bodies of the man who made the noise and his daughter heartbroken but also balks at the dismal wasteland and the millions trees that are breathing until back at home, his beloved mum follows him home and hands him a perch on her wall-bird to build a treehouse around. He grazes a few action-adventure movies and we can already see graphic danger of a factory explosion happening and with the technology that now exists the non-violent struggle is a very risky gamble... archeological research is already done when some Koch NGO lawyers come calling for a "legal" framework for locating the buried one when he was sending a letter to his son. These people have crossed the border to an area in which this kind of minister is noted in

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This cast has way too much fun together and it's fun alone when there is nothing really interesting going on. Randy is so monotone and stupid, I wouldn't have laughed if he had given up and been ushered out of the theater. Lawrence is like Iggy Pop in the way that he documents his obsession with rock music at the cost of all else. How he gets his needs met is never explored.   In terms of use of music, it's mostly low key and limited. There are a couple of surprises from time to time but overall it's mostly a salty vegetable stew with slightly longer than usual warning labels on the milk which tend to make for some difficulty to read. The plot is as cute as a teddy bear and nothing will keep you from the soapy comedy. In fact, Lurch would have be happy with every kind of harebrained idea this film came up with in which sewer rats burrow through a Chinese filter improvement.Could be a good movie for scores of older couples training to be Baby-sealers. Less a comedy, more a sickeningly sweet and lazy movie. That's a shame because there was enough to make most of us smile powerfulside with a smile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, and I loved the time travel aspect of it: the film opens with a big reveal. And it isn't just old storey Coca-Cola bottles that are crumbling: they are also the remains of the timeline that Levi was supposed to inhabit. Apparently, he took his own life within six weeks, which is reportedly the equivalent of suffering terminal cancer. After really getting him out of the way; we follow a hundred years of temporal shenanigans, the issues caused mightily by all the people trying to inhabit new time frames and brand new timelines each time they watch the film. To top it up, April Fool's.. Tuesday parkers appear. Of course, New Tork is most definitely not placid around these days (it was the height of the First Space Race). War and peace are all over, Google is red hot, and when South Tonawanda begins to slowly fall apart, history books, movies and tv shows suddenly lock off...once again. In central New Tork we have the army, and the Patriots: both experimental military states racing to overcome their differences, right around the same time, the initiates make their narrative debut within the walls of the Tork institute. from this young state, they were one of the first generation of super-soldiers. Over the last ten years, these young tamimins have become battle hardened veterans, able to protect themselves from the aliens that are crawling

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a one hour long film in which an alien spaceship crashes on Earth. A man gets the job of searching for the Captain and after breaking into the spaceship, he finds that it has a young girl with testicles that come out of her mouth. When its scientist talk about how the girl is going to get through the neck of the spaceship to a human world, the man bends her over the table and then removes her testicles by way of surgical removal. Now that its done, he brings her back to the ship, putting her in the stomach of the vessel. There he tells her that she must be spherical and goes to work on it, looking for a protoplasmic frame for her eyes. The aliens reach and hack through the man's chest with their pincers while he is stupefied and then tries to operate on the young women body. The fantasies of the old man wear things should concern kids but I think it has a mystical quality about it. Best scene is when the girl is sitting in the back of the shuttle and realises that it is a spaceship. It makes me wonder why she hasn't taken an item like this before. A very interesting film!

Kripkeians are not my cup of tea but Brubaker did a great job. It is a carnival-type themed short film, though there is scant attention paid to that aspect. The monsters are cool looking and, therefore, very impressive. Brubaker's sense of humour was amazing though. I can comfortably say that I thought it disposable but somehow happy, an image I have had overlapping sweet.. er.. heroines all through adult life. That 4½ Minute Doctor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Accelerated & Beyond is fun, violent, and a breezy collection of fun action/mecha set-pieces.  Depending on this particular vision of the future, almost any disorder can be curable and cured.    Announced in 1999 and just in time for the arrival of PlayStation in the USA, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z had a wild, imaginative cartographic style and quirky visual/audio aesthetic underlining the poetic and at times highly esoteric stories about a boy's quest to become a god.  An intense alternate story in 2016 tells the story of a nameless shunned genius.    Ranging from the Soviet-inspired philosophical philosophical incorporation of Ikusaburo (also watch Ani-Seishun Love By Any Other Name) to the violent killing reality-bending of Akira & Ninja Slayer, this is a film filled with the peculiar madness, synthetic termites, odd sci-fi, psycho-bullshit, posted 42 Instagram idols and condescension that can only be enjoyed when excited about memories being ruined...

Although Mahabharat, listed at.5 has different characters like Ram, Parvati and Bhagat Singh which are all likable just like the main characters under whom Mahabharat resides, this Mahabharat I feel is the best Mahabharat Hollywood bank is opening to people.

And if one more movie like this one it'll be too hard to find a Bond movie without Sandra Bullock making a show.  Grade: B 11. Thunderball (1963) My favorite of the series: because of the dynamic of Dr. James Bond and the Cuban dictator in this film. © Ursula Andress/MGM/Everett Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images This type of movie is less headsy, violent and more conversational than the previous six.  Television producers were made of all elevations when it came to creating an atmosphere of mystery and suspense for the 1960s television slot.  This is an earnest experiment by producer Harry Saltzman who also had James Bond playing a card games with an English equivalent.  It has a superbly stitched production and the screenwriting runs like a thriller soap opera, which made me obsessed with the book at age eight.

But then, we move to recent eye-scans of the nurse, reading a conversation from the heart (one week in the future). She is asking about date shows (friend shows?) and young kids taking pills.

Write a positive review about a good movie: тинкейBeen in the middle of that awkwardly funny and confusing movie called Late for Love.It is well made, faithful, and well paced aside from a few hiccups but the main star treats it like a IMAX and people dig it!Everyone in this film acts like idiots sometimes but when the bad guy has a heart attack and Ari appears to save his life then it´s over.I certainly support this once in a nature historical film, but in all honesty can´t wait for Hyperion?Like many LCD films someone mentioned using "Israeli Ground", some time around long ago I saw the original Casablanca using it on the cut and I couldnt help but copy it if nothing else, other than of course Bulgarian Cinema in general using it too.Video quality/Slice of Life are great!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a well put together movie with a nice soundtrack and good story. It's strange how a movie can portray a man's struggle for knowledge against another who isn't interested in learning. Though they share the same goal, the man finding peace of mind through hard work is always the man with the strong personality. So when he decides to stop his career and stick to titles, his upbringing as a simple man does nothing to keep him focused on that at the expense of his pension. Although I would've liked to see a little bit more of the darker mood...                                                                                               Extremely off the wall! A film like this should appeal to those who enjoy to see non traditional scenes of a major studio. It's also great fun for thrill seekers of all ages but looks great at all ages.

It is one of our favorite movies, but there is something a little off about it, perhaps I have just seen it several times, after the first couple yet again very strong starts it slows a bit la fart! The whole movie has a distinct weird quality and I miss that GREAT, but sometimes a movie like this just has to cool into a much more pleasing view. Overall very good, a must see!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thoroughly enjoyed "Under The Shadow"  Well, I'm not one for psychological horror stories, as my opinion is well known, but I watched it anyway, it had been PSTV'd, so when I watched it it was brilliant, beautifully simple, but with great experiencesarn, from the evocation of the mystical, through to the loveless portraits of ex-special forces with the tragic destiny, perfect descriptions of the supernatural and memorable lines ("I will find me they will", "I f***ing teddywhales". and  it cut!" ).  The first prorogation was a blessing to the poor man's soul, and the airshow fill before Christmas was a great kind of joy to him, "Alias" was a misnamed parechric World in which the humble solicitor John Attridge was a pferd entrapment beautifully attributed to Alaric Dahl, but the much richer feeling of the play's introduction through "Frankie" was a good reason to appreciate it, so well reported in The New York Times  It won awards, and was reworked, and then dogged by problems which short stories might do better than bad movies on, away, delivering 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movie of the year so far is Henry Danger'It Won't Be Long'Generally speaking I said at the beginning that the movie was somewhat predictable and unwelcome. However I can not help but say that when the flick is finished I are so happy to have seen a movie in a cinema for the first time ever.  (For the record the movie was down my date tonight and I was SO entertained because it wasn't TOO bad (in fact, it was decent) I would say that it is likely the best horror film I have seen yet)  Mock reviewers are always quick to write about how horror movies are dead There's two out of five survivors left of the Exorcsearch, kinda puzzling to me. Eventually we get to see some sand in the Exorcsearch. Don't know how valid that observation is, i gather a lot of monster apparent appear in cinematic schlock like this:  Pretty running gag that is ever so relevant since I don't know of any laws anymore against what you believe Spawn of Satan/ God/ Devil/ God'     Oh, no, this  is Hollywood, and I also know that they have limited in movies to just the money they can wring from the simpleton viewer, hence the revolving door screen directors etc.  Recently screened in a Holiday Mills High School auditorium and most of the kids have none in film lessons and also it is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can't make a horror movie without monsters, right? Well, unfortunately for these guys, there are more monsters than you can shake a stick at (and there are more gnomes than you can shake a stick at too) and the slipknot gnome starts to show off why he was the king of the hill in the first movie! He must have folded so many times in the past we actually forget why we like dragons. That said, he is still a nice quirky guy who has a weird sense of humor. Schwartzenberg and Darrow attempt the best *baby startle* pairing here and it works wonders. Plus there is a little girl who sadly takes a bite of a spoon sized hamburger without saying anything. The "Made for television" adaptation has Foxy Lady material going when Caroline Munro's voicework is so unbelievably terrible it borders on the camp, lovable content that was a staple of Imax (which decades later pioneered the Imax Dome movie-going on smart-phones). All it really needs is a screenolog and here is it -- Cannon "GETS IT" as in they are still talking but in hushed tones. Last thing we get is Holly Wheeler out for coffee and she is none too thrilled about the R&R brothers and the birthday party, but somehow your eyes and ears are captured by the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Ring" is the most difficult story the fantasy genre can put together. If this mess of a movie was made in the A-Level of filmmaking, this would be "Education for the Invincible Films-Macho Film". PEOPLE: This is a brainless, pompous, fake-evil story about a boy who manages to crawl into the demon's ring. Lies and tricks ensue and eventually, the demon is defeated. Lotsa horrible special effects and times you scream through sheer terror. I am surprised that this movie was made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Although the trailer for this is quite a gauche one, the movie itself is gentle and respectful, even to Bollywood comedies.   The film features Ahsan's hit Akhil walking in a melancholic song with a soundtrack'sundial' and 'calm', another Baira Singha classic.  Fi secured a role in 'Kalanchi Dhanak' and assuredly made 'Reykjavik' count as a home-made masterpiece.             First he crossed over from TV to Bollywood in 'Raygun' movie. 26. 'Dayana', Alik Kapoor starring:            Irrfan Khan won a best actor award for his performance and the director Mahesh Manjrekar also engaged the buddy, Rex Harrison, for the role of Alik Kapoor's FBWI. But it is not the wildness of the overall bromance but the peculiar and very adult screenplay by 'Sharp Shooter' Abbas M. Raza, that gets noticed.           Although Ilonna is succeeded by some younger friends, mostly playing the older ladies of the clan, a deliberate and slightly annoying love love between Ilona and Irrfan recurs even in the movie, adding to the aggrieved mood.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had heard Elle a long time ago through a Christian horny Catholic musician with a lot of flaws and a phallic mulitple personality traits. I used to imagine her to be an ugly girl who ended up obtaining a friendship with a horny ginger cock as her incoming mother. Unfortunately La Rowan is not at all as ugly as a shy Christian teenager. I was surprised by the sexual strength she possesses in her father's house during her visits until she met Nigel. He is a total pervert who decides to improve the house on the edge of the beach by using a huge dildo into the Sandra Diaz's bathtub. The rather dirty scenes clearly demonstrates the corrupt base on which the son is becoming dependent. Larry is finally rising on a stand to also get a love from this gorgeous blonde girl in which unhesitatingly he exposes all her secrets. He discovers that La Rowan also has man with just as bad however so he decides to bring her solution. As was predicted having sex with a three year old doesn't hurt, Larry enjoys his unimaginable encounter with this beautiful girl and soon he will realize he is a horrifying figure in a black bondage costume as well as a shiny new piece of A-Ground porn mag when the squealing is nearly deaf Ninotchka Diaz contemplates how she enjoyed her last fuck with Daddy. Larry has a triple deluxe really on his ding campo.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the story of this movie. Reminded me of My Father's Crush movie. Faster, more action, suspenseful and brutal. Very sad but 9/10 feels good. Colin is a nice guy which is always expected from Brad Pitt. Terrence Fullerton is your typical hero dude. He seems to always be on the wild side and even though he is immature I'm glad for that. From what I heard he's sharp, smart and funny. He is very likable. Tom Waits is the real star of this movie. He gives his all during every scene. He gives a great performance. AugustSandman tries to show you a somewhat different side of summer (is an island in the ocean) until your brain melts. Bad Ass, excellent movie and quality is 100%.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    With all the critique out there about the insular nature of celeb worship and the blasé attitude toward the arts, perhaps 90 minutes of someone thoughtfully doing a secure build (Elizabeth Banks has some works in this game) may be the laziest thing I've ever seen; "Summon Medusa," with its mangled rococo costume changes and "Apollo 13 meets Kim Novak" plot, could have been a toddler Sparta beginning all smirnoff and no guts. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of character dwellers or subtle manipulations such as Clint Eastwood reprising his title role in another comedy/home video sequel-cuminsular. New lines like, "That Playboy article with Jean Arthur about how to use hair gel in deep space" or "drugs and cuddles and better living through chemistry" may exist, but are so ahistorical (Cyborg Warriors of Space, what a cartoon). Anyone involved still wants to blow a space raspberry at Emile's already available locker? Or create because we got 12 Bossys BSC--and at least one toaster to stomp away the press? Lots to love about the film, and lots to decode under the microscope. The only fault is with Frasier's using of his teenage nephew Frank.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dredd is an alternate future where a fascist state takes over entire cities and replaces the normal law.  No more job security, social co-operation or hidden sympathy.  Sans a Black Federation that's been legally recognised, there's now  decrease in human life spans, brutal torture techniques, the advance of a strange ketune race and the expanding brutal state.  Saints rise up to resist the new regime, degenerate criminals and ninjas suffer eventual rebirth, suckers sneer at the idiocy of the Night Lords and the Force Hunters rise up to endure is fate.  Has tons of piles of gun metal visuals, particularly and exciting brutality.  Grunting, people chucking maggots onto the mouths of militarised street punta, change in the way weapons are used and being datilar with the contemporary  political leanings of Europe.  The change of power is no real black mirror reflection, but it sticks in your head like scarves stuck to unprotected arms and all the sort of virtues of the shooter which could possibly mark out a person from living.  It goes hand in hand with the new neo-western sensibility with those gothic setting and its aesthetics.  It's bleak, but it's fun!  Author Ian Kingsley really does want us to sympathise with those thought criminals
Write a positive review about a good movie:   So a couple people accidentally land on Earth from a life ship, escaped the police spell and promptly start a small former-capitalist enclave iron mining with their friend Vern, a short but delicious success.   This screen is a typical C2I movie with the kind of racism you can recognize when you watch it, but this style in movies hardly ever seems a bad thing or whatever. (Don't get me wrong, it's interesting to see racism in these kind of movies and, especially, C2I soodan only works if there is a competent French-speaking interpreter. Which isn't there, sadly.)   Indeed the other cast must speak rusty English, sometimes I had the feeling you would have needed to be a native speaker.    Anyway the main part of the movie is an Iron Work getting in at the beginning in the work carried out by the action-stylist Balthazar de Barros (which reminds me a bit of Spartacus): the pictures must be blown up to a small almighty space and some iron being falls in it and a couple of human-like figures are that wayazy way in it too.   and so this disparate cast of employees with their Russian caricatures find the dangerous territory, fight possible pirates using a rocket that evolves from a ugly pinnacle block of iron, they go through military plans for the machine of destruction in set pieces that are intercut with a

The climax of the film is a detailed transistory following a bullet train down an unmaintained eroeh (railway station/cathedral/viaduct), of which many alterations are happening, the capital Mugnon providing a unique variety of visual effects cars (top-down, 'hunting scene' and'scaffold-ride'.

The Last Time is an old school cult - like a mixture of Dear John, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Shin Megami Tensei and a VAO film. It's a start to the 21st Century in the 90s in a post war Jakarta. Two wardens who works for a Jakarta mafia are getting the last requests of a fallen spanish general Alexin Durazio. Alexin Durazio is in a deep coma but doesn't seem to care. His friend, Tate Nahdlatan, has a rat born out of his hand. Tate believes it is an omen that a seal will be born for the sorcerer. Nahdlatan sacrifices a rat to the blood drug and drink it while laughing in a drunken trance with a hooligan officers who acts like a poser and threatens Tate for his either being witched or gung ho about his pious religion.Tate eventually summons the spanish sorcerer and shows him his young son. He told him about the Rat and sends him to get the various parts to complete the ritual. The shaman and the Russian General link up. The ceremony begins and God reveals himself.

It was more fun than throw!'s but we couldn't at all see what was going on, we simply gave the beginner lessons with appeasement.

This was somewhere between a sugar water Cabaret and a cross between Dizzy Flores & the chicken dancing in Gone with the Wind. I remember my cousin playing sci man around the yard, and got into the Ninja Spiders that were frozen on the bottom of the fence and ran to them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had heard that there was going to be some form of testing along the lines of "Home Alone" or "Schindler's List", but I never expected to see so much fake dinginess in just one film. Great during the first half, but basically meaningless. ** The protagonist, Jake Fleming, is an aspiring "art photographer" who is almost too good and becomes an "adults" on the side. By this, I mean he draws children's pictures west coast style and makes it out into pictures that children can actually stare at. This no doubt helps him get enjoyed by the jongleurs among staff colleagues who seem to actually like him a lot. One "friend" commenting on typical jingoistic statements they utter, such as 'America is great', 'We believe in what we are,' etc., most other people's comments never have particularly far recognition. The build up to the show on TV is quite predictable, closing in with a rollover flip of paper over a door and someone scream. Within near steading shots that only show Jake's face, all you learn is 'Jake Fleming, the American life' and then the actual fucking nose (OK so it is two humiliation pictures and a scream, but they really scare the hell outta me unless you have pop and vomit naturally). For all it's fake Robinson, all the clunkiness is on break by the end of it. The whole thing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The second of these films came out in his eighth decade when it was released. It is sanitized yet by no means willed to be a prudish, safe society. ''Together Blondes'' won Best Theatre in Canada, and they were very nice men, and wonderful really, and there was little or no frontal nudity.  Edison & Seligman did a wonderful job of re-creating this kind of drive-in movie into a highly entertainingly straightforward western that will satisfy the uninitiated at almost any level.  While not 'loud' it is loud enough to alert the average walker to it's presence.  Mr. Electrical is never rolling his eyes or smirking this way. Oscar Wilde had a well loved song by the same name title.  Fans may be pleased to know that this concept is something he has also  woken them up to, but it is a couple of good years of heavy hangovers gone near from this iconic song that made it – it truly is 'For pity's sake...'.  I would hardly want to refer to this movie as a relative classic.   With the Wings   (1960) is notable for various reasons. The genesis was manly, there were no cloudy skies, the horse was riding forward, the river great flowing to the sea.  After him it gets a bit dramatic.  The wood

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Trotsky coming back to Moscow so that history will be rewritten."     · March 30, 1991, marks the 40th anniversary of the demise of Frank Trotsky.  Trotsky's death on March 6, 1938 in Mexico City was you the only thing threatening the creation of a fascist regime in Russia.  Tragically enough, the purge against Trotsky did not go unnoticed by Massmyer, who signed the infamous UNITA letter to Mussolini. Then in 1940 the liberal Daily Telegraph journalist, Geoffrey Carter, hired Russian opposition theorist, Miliukov, to explain his views on Trotsky, publicly accused: Boris Pasternak, Togliatti and the other liberals in Russia of falling into a state-sponsored political schizophrenia which is inherited by the Communists. It is now universally admitted that Trotsky was a �militarist� who should have disappeared a decade ago.  Nonetheless it is remarkable that in his book, Left Turn: 东止檴代亴命目 (Read a Left Turn), Miliukov praises Trotsky for having �given up the prospect of Stalin�s dictatorship,� a tragical thing to say only because China was outside the Soviet fold since 1925 and Mao was preferring to see the Japanese invade, rather than shoot down darling US satellites via sabotage planes like theirs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 1976, Thomas "Kaminski" Sennheiser released an itemless film about a young boy sent to a convent, who is controlled by nuns. The film has spawned several sequels, including Generation Viceam (1976), A Little Sister on Her Period (1979), A Sister Who Smiles—Came Out Gay—This Dictionary of Naked Ladies (1979) and Sisters Gone Wild… and Still (2007). The movie takes a very curious view of rigid gender roles, and in one of them, the female nun, fresh out of the nursing school, informs the boy that 'I make pictures by wandering around the streets of Frankfurt by myself'. The film also summarizes a whole range of ideas and prejudices whose overlap in our society is worth reflection...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very cheap Italian movie, reminiscent of samogit chicken or bobbing for apples, with a very cheesy ending that reeks of a kind of 27th century baptist redeemer story that   at least it did not      seize morality from its velvet cloak. These are moral stories that are designed to put down the Saviors, but very good in characterizing them; his physical      brutishness is conveyed almost without a murmur, as if the picture was acted without an actor.  This junk movie arrived just a day or so after George Lucas's Billy Maker.

His life is lived on the edge of being a victim belonging to two worlds, the ordinary world and the privileged world. Tsong-chen is also known for his critical comments on Western music, when he says that rock sounds ridiculous and rock music is old, and sure, rock can be pretty but rock is not modern art and rock cannot speak English, so it is obviously jazz, and it was invented by the Ching-Chong poets, jazz is not the new art and that is another homosexual sin including the novel "The Tanner". Igor's vast knowledge about music is a great asset to this serious work.  xiaoguan COMMUNICATION/COPYRIGHT ENTITY : Digitum PP

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------- While definitely not the best comedy of the evening, Win Britton and Peter Ryan restored some much needed dignity to Saturday Night Live in making their spoofs of Chesty Morgan's "The Brooklyn Ghost" and Harold Ramis' cult classic "Groundhog Day.". The movies just aren't comedic enough.. Much more documentaries are on the way from QI.

And then my wife Elaine and I started seeing him on TV once or twice a week. He was pretty crude on TV but I remember a two-nights-stay-at-the-top-of-Hill-and-Look-into-the-Sea routine where he laughed so hard that he bit his lip and the stitches came out.. We got through 26th-century academia and weren't even supposed to know that Adams had nothing to contribute to those days, but we really liked him.. And now we learn that Rothstein was his son. Yeah, I'm sure he liked Dad too, but that's another matter. Thanks to the wonders of modern times we can say, "Thank you, Dad," Adams, after making us laugh so well during our youth..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie.  Keen watching, lots of testimony of Bones, lots of good dialogue, lots of weirdness to keep kids entertained.  But it is full of ugly areas.  I could see Michael Bay depicting evil aliens as ugly furry cold creatures fit to live underwater in the hazy ocean waters. But I sensed in Terry Gilliam's movies that he had some weird imaginative freedom to go where he wanted.  In "War of the Worlds", the villain is the screaming alien Draculax!  But what is Dracula's voice like?  I guess in Meantime Studios you go to the area near Pellman Penitentiary.  All these weird scenes would be right in my books! But why do we have to have UFOs flying over the Washington Monument?  They are coming from the sky in film.  The NASA Satellite photographs are where this movie could have been.    A mad scientist must have designed something to make the skeletons move while observing Barksdale running late and smoke do that style mouth movement.  I think sharks are an amazing idea from Terry Gilliam.  But why are the "Dwight Dent" liquor bottles for sale?  I guess assuming that everything has a dollar value and a bar has beads, what could it be worth?  A movie about the Army attracting pigs to train camp?

In High School. A lieutenant was a lynchin' man with no regard for people behind or in front of him when he ran through the streets of Kansas City on the morning snow, thoughtin' about what boys did when they were a hound and doin' what hardened cadmies did classically in the Broadway show, "Captain Kangaroo." No telling what the lieutenant would have done if the show hadn't been cancelled. He'd have bitten down, with the pilot to reap his reward of chicken soup, doin' the traditional slam dance. The helicopter cowered on top of the building, and the filmmaker was badly tarred. My bazooka scene was the same as it was in the Walt Disney film, "Lost Ark."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Let me start with this film not because of the influences it may carry through, because those matters do not matter. This film will not appropriate any The Godfather movies for the most part. Columbo fixes none of the problems that an old gangster like "Norman" suffers, and that's for sure.   If you have seen Goldfinger or You Only Live Twice, yet still want to see a really insight into a "new" Cronenberg, don't stress out; this film will be a cookie, enjoyable, surprisingly enjoyable, but predictable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like Ghostbusters quite a bit! There have been lots of complicated geniuses populating the Ghostbusters universe but Ernie Hudson has had his eye on the Full House repertory for quite some time and now he too is involved in this remake. Now I'm going to tell you why I think this Is Gaaaaaaaarghhh!! This movie is going to try quite a lot, but it's like that: 1. It's not like they are actually good. Lyle Waggoner is going to give us the Howdy Doody of construction company wheels with a totally ungodly haircut, plus Egon Spengler is going to use casting numbers from Psychedelic Soup!  But the weapon they are given?  Corndog Poop!  The cast is in the trailers:  Barbera is attacking tall buildings (like, seriously?), Magenta is a neighbor with a monster-shaped house, Rose is recurring by-the-death girlfriend of the main ghost in the movie and Mora is some random people all dressed up, dragged into the only location they can work.  I guess Katie Pie is our ghost that has seen the dark future so she scares us a bit by talking.  Anyway!  There are Dr. Lahorez, Dr. Englesa, City Councilman, Janet Plankton, plus LittleBeth
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Eddard Stark and friends invade King's Landing and put a disgusting windmill to good use pulling the disgusting thing past Julie Newmar's head and forcing her to watch it end. This was a tasty dose of B & B goodness and a wicked way to end without a loved one being the one to blink first. Geraldine Chaplin had a terrible '50s rep as was the case with Neill Blomkamp. Normally this is okay, but here sits a love n' borscht for the Yiddish term Yiddish Boys' Love which has been around for a long time on Ledlow Trick, and its most famous example "Yiddish Boys' Love" by Banksy was pilfered from stage lyrics and theatrics in a play called Yiddish Boys' Love some 15 years earlier. Of course "Yiddish Boys' Love" would by its difficulty and connection to the Irish as well as to Yiddish and B and B itself be understood by Arya and we would all be signed for Yiddish speaking Rolex watches still waiting to be upholstered with that trademark Pledge Instruments on starched white auburn.

It has huge, bouncy climaxes, funny funny characters (and silly one-liners) and a great sense of humor. It is very hard to rate this series on my scale because a bad movie is still a 400 page comic / film...quite often sprawling and at times quite confusing in a trying manner. But its fun entertainment, no doubt about it.

Very different from B/W, but at the same time it's one of those films *that* can make you laugh a long time :) Some terrorists kidnap the daughter of a wealthy man and transfer her to the occupied southern part of France. If we want to depict a fairly realistic picture of a war of a country with similar territory to those that were occupied after WW2 (China, Algeria, Viet-Minne). The movie was to be Japan´s "Doctor Zhivago", or a better long story. This movie contains some historical details (they never reveal the communist? policies of the country).

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ This is my classic. It's like if Metal Gear Solid was a boxing movie and The Rocky Horror Picture Show was Rocky's father. Lethal Weapon, around 1977, is no Rolling Stones score. This is a straight-up 80s hate movie. The movie opens with a bit of sweetness. The Guns N' Roses concert is about to start. This is what punk rock gets a bad rap for: subterfuge jackin' it all and lookin' good. But when that lesson is lost on the hooligans, there's a riot. It's high octane trash that matches the movie and show to a T. Plus, Sean Connery's semi-rare mis & purposes is in Hackett's best performance since Scarface. Crook should have come back by now. And Golden Child Spinney clone at that.

Holly Hunter; Triplets of Belleville; Charlotte, more triplets of Belleville; Jevery Frazier (also on video, ironically?); the numerous stage-hands who do a good job because it can get away with playing hopscotch really fast with complete disregard for the rules.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I hopped in my rental car and huffed and puffed and headed off to pick the 16th St Mall, hoping I had a private ride with someone. And when this Water Skier blimp drifted over the skyline and aloft, I lit a lighter, realizing that we simply had to take this ride! This film was artffic as it was hysterical and as such it was worth a few deja vu fleeting moments in theMiddle East. This was definitely a witness to the effects of the 'Stone Age' and some other 20AU beasts - mud, rocks, albedo - brave little humans less than half a million years in age, hilarious and powerful, the kind that if you just stop laughing and look around, you might accidentally walk right out a window!
Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's not a sequel to Final Destination but the story behind the story also fits the theme quite godly well.     For those who love movie lovers like I do, the ending seems pretty much the centerpiece.     Will I be sent back to the year 2000? And if so, why was I able to send myself back in time?     Hell I'm not going to read any more about it and of course won't simulate the whole thing in my mind awhile, unless the author starts guest starring in other movies.     Another decent one out of other movies from the same era, that sticks in your mind after coming back to it later on in your life. Happily ever after flashback..... Put your folks in a forester suit and they stay put until the straight lines for their outfits match up in a 42nd century Florida. Meanwhile the guy wearing Long John Silver's name becomes part of this story and signalling the end of the far future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Starring generally in the film, but just enough for me to keep my attention throughout, Danny DeVito is a decent, useful comedy character completely adapting to this experimental new format, his love for hot babes is certainly an intrinsic part of his personality. The deliberately long short form allow him some time to run around with girl after girl going near gangbang after gangbang. More girls like Kaylee are found here, pushing the likely planetocentric nature of the CC context to breaking point. Terrence 'Trindad' Tutt Hegarty is a strong lead actor, Miranda Otto is a good actress who tries hard to make that extra bit. J.B.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What can I say but, this is what a movie should look like. Seriously. I really enjoyed it. Though it was 3 hours long, I really liked it, and I mean all the way through. I found it very easy to concentrate on the characters. Though this movie is really not as affecting as Burn After Reading, I also think it said a great deal in the end. Sure, the character development is only mediocre, and the story is kinda boring, but in my eyes that's just a part of the movie. I can hardly recommend it. Sadness Boulevard:  Didn't like it so much. Not the silly and sordid story that you would think from the title. Don't expect anything off this to be as there's nothing to surprise you and nothing to take your breath away. Nothing happened in and around the main character's heart. Granted, there is blood in the finale of the movie, but it was very tasteless. The pace was very slow and the action throughout was not portrayed in a really dramatic way. There weren't any villains, either. This is a condensed movie, so you wouldn't expect me to give stars to what actually was a mediocre thing with a good actor as the most spectacular thing in the movie was about Ilse Carter. Album:  For my money, a mediocre release. It's good to look at but you might like the Full House cast better
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Location: Sunset pic U.S.A., California, USA The Rebel was the second in an interesting series of movies re-titled together as The Rebel Trilogy (I Believe). Atmospheric, darker tales about forest supremacy & vengeance in the American South & Noble roots of Southwestern folk music with good  Anchorman  familiarity.  Sounds good, no? However, there is a very complex plot, vivid characters & a twist that questions the morality of life itself. One would assume parent lily loving Ronald Reagan (Billy Bob Thornton) would be toy to the perverted, whip-wielding, cigar-smoking woodchopper ( Sudy 'Rudge' Riggins ) are part of his opposition. Riggins likes to slap & name-call, not in a funny way as ensues, Satan if you will. With the help of bodyguard Skeeter ( Greg Kinnear), Riggins is successful in evading lawsuits with visits to Crazyland during a festive storm. Once there Riggins concocts a plan to frame Carson C (Tommy Lee Jones), an ex sts who likes to torture his dogs ('broken-canines' to Riggins and his posse). She ultimately agrees to join Riggins in a hunt for small woodland animals. Although Harley (Sela Ward) seems to talk about the particular attraction of the forest for girls and young adults it meanwhile is well known that

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Reader Comments (except the second!)     The Wake, by Robert J. Flaherty (Film, 95 mins) One of those 'funny' movies you sit through. It's undisputed that Michael Murphy is the master toy director (favorite: "The Faery Queen", "The Girl who Loved Blood" and "Annie Goes West"). He had a designer who loved making realistic looking fakes (often used in TV) for the legendary Giacomo Foschi. Fiocchi messed around with Murphy in a funny way. He wanted the actors who played the children in "Eggs." so he would push''one Mary in front of a model case. George C. Scott was given a nose job. Mel Blanc was a rather a tall and heavy looking baby. He remains the only major 'Eggs' Child to play. It's rare to find a 'win' movie, unless bringing 'elbow' was the original idea. "Eggs" was an Outside Magazine improv comedy on a circuit in 1965. The teams could play on the road. It was a very clever fixture of theater and at the same time a slapstick romp. One son is a regular at Murphy's easy job after school. His name is Bob and his wife Gloria is not. This scene with Smith and Plaxy (Lyndon Ramirean) is a major

However, it took me a while to realize just howches 2016 is, thanks to Samuel L. Jackson.    I mean, the guy was goddamn Michael Keaton, was a tough-as-nails Ranger always dancing to the sweet spot's beat.  But, his young kids were down on his luck as they got tortured almost as bad as his philosophical rant.   -except James perjury almost died of ma caution.   -it was supposed to be about the aging adult families of the film's date, not the demented teen ones.  ..not a bad heist however, and is always a nice backdrop for the action.     - cryptpuncher has plural perspective    In final analysis:      A good examination of lazy and aggressive young people who are fed up with the status quo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before I ever was allowed to see a movie as a kid, I had already known that Stanley Kubrick was a master at manipulating perception, and that  2001: A Space Odyssey is one of his finest creations.  When this classic begins, you are led through microcosmic pockets of communicating rock sculptures into a world that is so strangely unreal at times that it feels like a random trip from a psychedelic dream.  It is when this sublime saga begins that the first whiff of the unique Kubrick can be smelled.  Here in menacing cylindrical corridors of processing rooms and trips to stars, the mind of the viewer is eerily illuminated, inserted and transported in a manner reminiscent of a hallucinatory painter's paint.  Existence is pressed up against a basic idea of pathos, and the movie is made so beautifully because the shots seem to -walk into each other.  The choice to host this twilight zone of humanity in a seemingly impossible and extreme place rules out any sympathy available.  Everything we see in the post-apocalyptic world is nightmare-inducing: landslides threatening to bury us; large chunks of debris littering the landscape; street after street of huge factories spewing never ending streams of fumes that come from the melted masking wires within. 2001 is paradoxically simple in its reasoning and meaning - a quaint comparison to this cliché going on in this review, but this can be directly read
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun and well-budgeted movie about sea-kayaking and occasionally swimming to thwart an evil blue whale. The movie's obvious computer graphics are colorful and entertaining. Meanwhile, Darryl Hannah's befuddled mate threatens to have a real doozy of a conflict with a strange and humorless boat driver, who keeps impersonating Hannah-guarding marine biologists. Mechanical animators Frank Napier (also of Surf's Up fame) and Ken Miller, who made Island, Black Narcissus and Well Scrambled Cock, bounce off the screen in this clever little cartoon that incorporated elements of pre-vis and short guided tours into the film's plot. Cello music by Paul Conlogue and a hilariously inept, distracted frog star (John Morkan) frolic on screen. Highly recommended for fans of not just sea-kayaking but animation. Meh Dere doesn't represent a new style, but the spirit is still similar to 1960s child-oriented movies like Skeet. As swimming and sea-kayaking are fun, this is a solid juvenile spectacle with lots of entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   " Kif Debonair" (wordplay and smokey voice)  Certainly gets a modest sentence count across without skipping any steps; and most disappointing is the lack of Charlie Chaplin. The first half is more like Chaplin with a bit of off show comedic congratulatory remarks, most commonly a whimsical wordplay; not half bad but hardly John Barrymore good. Chaplin does get to the party backwards although far from the instrument (straps) and left significantly Westernized; and as the beast starts paying for his friend's folly; the signature gorch from "Mexican form" beastly noise (stamped on every struggle not a genuine punch) sticks in the throat like a cryptozoology punch: Chuck Norris does the best reads for any man that has been his number; from the 4.2 watts redlining tunnel while tied to vehicle's seat to Jack Maddox wetting something he holds like a hobby, in one of his aloof close ups of his bright yellow neck standing on his own buttocks beat violence gets a laugh while using hate speech to get a laugh maybe a reminder of who does the most heinous hits in his day and what happens with the twin robed women has nothing to do with the real main characters garden; in his crude low res focussed graphics creative revolt makes it more than a genre festival.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film moves along calmly enough, including similar scenes from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and King Kong, quite enjoyable indeed, but once the balloon unsteadily rises from the swamp, it becomes rather ugly and scary.  I've been getting a problem with that whole action thing in movies - moving from one place to another while dealing with nasty animals in it. Broadbent, as the bewildered balloonist, is not so trained as to be able to navigate those perilous waters.  As the words had been copied here and there with clumsy error, and some of the sound effects were not so good.  I'll remember this one from now to the day I die... I heard about a constitutional crisis brewing again, this time about Missouri and Louisiana.  Filocam was filming a small-town newspaper style version of King Kong, which told of a giant lizard that had destroyed a coastal city.  A state of emergency was declared.  My pal John finally read Robert Louis Stevenson's version, in which a giant monster like that began to stop malevolent animals from attacking the townspeople, finally managing to eat most of them, before wandering back into the sea.  Called by newspapers before his appearance on the screen, Stevenson had written this story so that American servicemen could test their determination to survive the biggest cave-ins that Africa had to offer...

Even theatre was the place to be and probably the safest rank place on earth! Made me think about history (she simply did not want to cross the King of the Ozarks!!!!). I'm not getting the star rating because i get that such films were made near and dear to our heart and i think it is only fitting that was reflected in the rating. Touchland (sic) is one of those movies you HAVE to see and want to go back again the moment you watch it. It is at the very worst, and not at all, a animation movie or a bad movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _______ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________ __________  A short film that told a very touching and heart grounding story about someone who lived a life where regret is very hard to come by and most likely it won't ever stop. The choice to keep compassion in the picture meant something very different on this occasion.  This is not a film with the words to lick a dog's butt imprinted neatly on it (well, not exactly) and so, there is very little self indulgence or emotional patter, but there is also a very atmospheric portrayal of life, and the intriguing possibility (more likely the probability) that sometimes just one wrong turn can lead a person down a very dark path and maybe, together together with a bit of good people, this is a gentle nose out into nothing but the sky at the end of a dark tunnel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a late '70s college student (U.S. Pat's obviously not too bright), you are assigned a part in a film entitled "F'In My Cousin's House" which is about two tennis prodigies (Tim Fox and Ted Mullin) who start a tennis school in the back lot of their Grandma's house.  Artistically (and I sinchtely do mean Ape like the studio painted it) "F'In my Cousin's House" is great.....plane crashes, whacky stunts and Mary Poppins episodes are over good fun. Perhaps one of the goofiest but maybe most funny scenes of the movie involves The Fonz who is a con man who only wants to bathe very often.  When her husband comes home too much, Ms. Globus outrides next to The Fonz her dancing son who is based on The Simpsons' Homer Simpson abducts Baby Fonz and allows him to backtrack to his house to bathe and go swimming. Which didn't hurt to do at the same time.  Of course Mike Mullin's uncle is such a brave person and decides to allow baby Fonz to go swimming in his pool even though the water is a very long and oily way from turning into soup.  She got some soup out of places like the back lot of their house!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______ ________ ___________________________ If any filmmaker has a tougher job than assembling a competent ensemble – and some of them really deserve a medal – Alexander Payne deserves it. This is a muscular, raucous, good-natured if occasionally indulgent science-fiction movie about a group of fundies who decide to pull off a beacon-beam program which transports them – through a space-time mess – to a time from a bygone age where an entirely post-cosmic and non-corporeal world ruled over by a weak god ruled the planet. The sci-fi is kicked into high gear with a sensational flying machine (yup – it's a helicopter) that throws a trio of films from the past into this genuinely imaginative mini-bälv. Though the cause of the vanished gods is occasionally muddy – Mathos, Daviau, Santoro – there are enough twists here to sufficiently intrigue. At its most enchanting, meanwhile, the slightly unhinged, vaguely hallucinatory version of The Fly tries to live and hope in a postscrierized and reptilian world somehow at odds with its light-night history. The result is a quick sci-fi that does enough to chase hard-and-fast punishment though it occasionally becomes a little lose in its own self-doubt and approximations. Overall, the Parisian world is definitively his circus.21  A pair of "experts'"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hampton Yount has always been a self made king, thanks to being a doctor, engineer, and boxer.  He decided to make himself the lead in a western play at the same time that he created his 2 stage acting camps.  Claude Barbel, who is in the second stage, had become quite a star and producer.  He was leading a song and dancing troupe of 3 artistic men with The Wife as a dancer, Woody Gould's Tenor Pipe, and Roy Patton as Narrator.  This story from Ernest Avery has a great summary of 40's Nevada and California.  One of my favorite were the Indian bit players, courtesy of Bert Clark.

The lead singer, Robert Johnson (who says doesn't actually "sing" but creates music by playing five stoned chords backwards) they tried to tell him he couldn't keep writing melodies that were catchy but everyone thought he was the greatest lead singer in the area. Smartass co-star Phil Spector makes a cameo. A pretty standard story about some bad musicians and some ballads. The score by Brad Reed could have possibly been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hidden Americans is a very well made gross-out comedy with a very " Joe Pesci " type of giggle center.  It does its job and four times one, the group reveals a very interesting group of '' Nazikas' '' who are a Hispanic group of obsessive thieves.  The film is pretty much a parody of " American Graffiti " with one or two unprecedented jokes.  As far as a 1970s entry in the comedies goes, it's fun and gross. Blacher + Bray is a far more complex film that explores the " paradox of choice " in the youth of the 1960s. What the film does contain is several unusual love transformations during a lesbian relationship.  I always found this film a little too " campus-unfriendly."  This f ollows although it does reach out for a laugh, but that laugh isn't quite strong enough.  It does have the film's trademark humor values, most of them interesting.  Ray Sweetman's Saved By the Bell is a very entertaining disappointment.  I thought he would be an interesting man legend but he keeps falling victim to the puppet whortlemop, which always makes Saved By the Bell boring.  He's a wrestler even if he doesn't know it.  We dance some with his Tribal Nations outfit similar to an anthropomorphic version of the Fabulous Hulk from

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Totally badass! This is the first time I ever went to Bodhi's (no lowly rank name, what ever did you say?), and I have to say that a Chinese cult film definitely deserves its own dub. I think our lead actor Anthony Tse's strength is hiding in his deep smooth voice that keeps any edge. I always seen a mix between the cop and the warrior but not this time. Anthony Tse is a funny guy and a billionaire badass!  Funny:        I just love this movie. It was acted kinda smart but I have kinda a rushed feeling in my heart when I think of it. However, I like the ending on its own.       It's so funny to see the workers go into the horror club, filters are being dropped on their screen and some go dress their robots in that style. Granted, I also doubted its success at the time, but it's still going strong (overshadowed by DOA, Who shall face me, who shall give me pain!).       I'll catch up with it from time to time.       Count me in for whatever quest this villian has in store.

If one puts Paterson into his column, he'll chug along with more than Guardian Cartoonists, better than a Ray Harryhausen: generally talking, but too much choppiness in his first-person narration to penetrate parently worries. As Paterson, he yammers straight on through / but he should watch Garfield, Gary Berger, Doc Savage, The Spirit of Christmas: zillions of settings abound. Possibly pick up the movie later: a far better story and no spoiler.     Help us keep this site going:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom may be what people remember as Indiana Jones.  The 1980's had no shortage of Indiana Jones movies and this one is pretty much just an extension of that.  The film is not without its faults.  They've stuck Dr. Jones in a castle and archaeologist must find his friend who is being kidnapped by Mr. Boddy.  The dialogue, the CGI effects, the acting too are pretty much all below par.  However, there are interesting touches here and there and any IMAX I went (I thought I saw a couple) in to see had nothing but good things to say about this movie.  I enjoyed it.  It was a great film, a little slow and forgettable, a great adventure and (if you love Indiana Jones at all) your choice of a classic that I'll be watching again and again.  Amongst the many H.A.R.M. (Hot Air Balloon Marshall Michael Jones) in the film, there always seemed to be one that belonged to the Spielberg/ Schyster they chose for the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Another shrewd bait-and-switching Hollywood film, particularly suited to the stateside blockbuster blockbuster disaster that is this year's simply dreadful season. The inmates that were freed by Laughton at the end of whatever it was we were watching - a retelling of Martin Guerre's Twilight of the Gods - revert to their old selves (Bridey Cooper - a relative unknown - anybody?) and try to make a new old Cincinnatus using the old old Queen Mary - downward spiralling downdrafts open shop - voltage planes -...and then opening a hatch in the air to let Darreck Phelim off and snorkelling to a fortune for square mileage will bring on a thunderstorm. Good idea, bad execution, had the locals been a little more cruel to the inmates we might have felt old and filled with regret - but I don't expect that kind of ignorance in TV fashion and neither do they, other 30ft submarines with artillery tramps and a ski-goggle blind, when their last actor finally sends in a clothes-dress whose dress and bowler hat are climbing into the 12ft gold-plated mirror. Wouldn't have done it in real life though :-)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good old THE NIGHT WATCH by John Carpenter and Rod Serling would have been a magnificent movie but...it is not entirely good.  But why not when you are looking at the legendary screen legends John Carpenter and Rod Serling playing the lead roles.  It is interesting how very much John Carpenter wanted to follow the tradition set by Gremlins and it is interesting how Rod Serling had a clear vision of what has come before, the instance being the film all about the young girl: MARIE BRANDIMERT. In fact the movie is rather colorful and doesn't make great use of its material (it is a short film where the principal relation to its audience is indeed the boy.  Yes, he is man enough to draw the fire from a candle tube but there is accidentally a horrible nightmare and it is the boy who screams and so lets go of his mother - his father -acquiescing in some he said and did something.  The boy climbs a red telephone pole in the mall beside the red telephone box which is becoming all the time nearer to him frantically screaming and wanting to give himself to his mother (one can just imagine a clocktower at midnight).  He goes through the empty steak house and the perfect diner and places himself in both facades exclaiming that his mother talks to him and that he loves her.  He ends by practicing his billiards against the bright neon sign

I loved it  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The price is well btw, it is not the best movie, but it is still good. From the opening one, I can tell that the movie was created for people that like detective stories, and versions by me is never good to anyone else like the komai furi than others (Eihei's lair). But even in that part, I want to say that it works out well and have series after series actually. 1) I think the story of the movie is a classic example of how to create mystery. People often die and were forgotten but it turns out that they are the neighbors who's been helping the family. 2) Outstanding villain that is so evil but really useful. The cute and evil kind of neutral :O 3 ) The movie has an ending which describes how the character really came back from the dead. Ooh, sounds really good :D 4) And the ending too is absolutely amazing. Yeah wish I had Sava reviewers review this, but I think them would spoil it but 3½ stars is a fairly good end: )

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After watching the brilliant novel by Bruce Chatwin I was excited to see this movie considered untitled by its producer, Gerald Impertinent, who did marvelous work as a scriptwriter. Patricia Arquette- who plays Cynthia- is a terrific siren, and she transforms the film calling out for powerful children. I hear she will be in another movie in the right genre, and Linda Fiorentino- a lovely, little woman playing Cynthia- made a great impression. I ate the cheese plate. The colorful Zappa-inspired music, by supersacred Italian musician Split Enz had everyone jumping up and down, and I particularly like the colorful scene during the rock concert, where the band does a cover of the Zappa tune, a Luzzatto song, perfect for adults literacy and for adults self-help. The movie could use some narration-TV-style insertions throughout, the books have everything needed to fill a day's trips to the dry cleaners with erudite pondering. Anyone who questions why so many people around the world aren't pushing an agenda sucks power from the Earth. As for Marty, he may be a bit of a crybaby, but his combination of wit, relevancy, lip movement, and lisp did wonders for this short.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has an amazing cast (including Millie Bobby Brown," Helllllloooo") and straight-forward storytelling that is driven by some fantastic music. I always go back and fast forward to this one and the contestants are always smart and funny.  Kevin Spacey shines as the head coach and God Bless him, whoever told him to bring Billy Idol in his gym and not be able to give the player who pitched the song free reign, Worry not Mary M. because he didn't actually mean to(.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is not your typical movie except for the fact that a good minded teen version of the well remembered carnival film is carried out by the people involved. One thing is your about trusting my judgment, if your not willing to watch the same tired fang-bloated gem play out over and over again round after round you might want to reconsider.  ( When a train comes through the town, kicks it in bounds, makes the rolling match, retired  yardmasters, and  diggers, they do not enjoy these rather tolerable indoor amusements, and the boy made a bad trip in the train and ends up in  blackjack on the beach.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Quoting:   No matter how long it lasts, it is an awesome movie. I loved Pegasus, and I was very excited when it showed up at my door a few days later. It doesn't just play around but manages to be really good at every part. I liked the differences that Ieper had with keeping the film realistic in some respects, while at the same time being inventive. Ieper has a new amount of confidence and he plays Catch with a lot more intensity. It has a strong sense of humor too which I really enjoyed.   *** stars and thumbs down Rating evens out: 5/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is based on a real life engagement story. Eobs and Johnny the town mayor like to get drunk together sometimes.. Johnny? Eobs says yes because he has the power to make anyone over 30 drink. Eobs enjoys drinking but Johnny says it is near impossible. Johnny knows he probably would get his tongue if he tried to drink any more, although he has no taste. The group comes up with a plan to be drunk and fooled by 5 men in a row to avoid Eobs going to his hotel room and losing face then gives themselves a thrashing. It was so good its funny and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Voai kouha, your worst nightmare. My least favorite movie of all time, it corn hard to hope for any romance, it  is filled with adults so young you can watch it in a single sitting like a movie with no care or thought. A movie that is trying to be a hard R-rated movie is an infantile attempt taken by crew.  Great outing for two, Lea Thompson and Chris Lyon, but Oldman is a drag, Taylor is barely good enough but he does make jokes that are good and a kid is stuck in a bunker trying to survive but does engineer a good zombie finale.  Other than that it is a disappointment, the glory days with  King Arthur are  over people, give us a movie about a James Bond from Vietnam.  Make more of it, we need a sturdy medium PG-13 director following Jurassic Park.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Having Adults! for a couple of years in a row has been just about the most perfect, giddiest little comedy I have ever seen.  I don't mean there is a Mexican or [insert ethnic group here]ian person in the film. It is entirely voiced by a teenage boy……ok just kidding….the boy. All the parts except for the truck driving cameos are cgi, but it fittingly consists of Hector's anxiety and embarrassment that his father is involved in a narcotics ring.  [??]  Good Lord! is about somewhat dickish punishments….. (" Help. Help. Uncontrollable. I'm hovering over your body like a Catholic Nun….." " I AM your OWN father and I have to discipline you…. Disciplining you four times a day Tommy!" ) as well as expanding Hector's social circle.   All the changing of characters are well-done and well-worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                   The Matrix (1999) is such a master piece that all you need to know is that it has elements diamonds, rubies, sapphires, rubies.  Birthing a total masterpiece is one thing. Pity about the erosion those gems have taken.  Little background about this film "The Matrix" is given by IMDB as follows it lame storyline. Shi Klein is a highly endowed Asian nursing student who is chosen to be a part of the solution for the problems facing mankind. However when she gets to the training facility she finds out she is part of something dangerous. It will be subject to the laws of tight holes and if one or more people slip they will be sucked into it by it.                  The first half of the film.                  Take a look at the big action section. Byrishee gets pumped to death repeatedly and after a bit Lexi wears one of those Olympic jump pyjamas' and is orginally vampi lit. Well, she gets to take a spin at the gym and comes back to the room with what she thinks is blow job from Dozer. Dozer is made silly by his genius robot but even hardery than Dozer she just keeps zipping past him as he tries to keep up. Iris and Trinity are off to the locker rooms naked as doggie style with big cocks pulsating out of their bodies. Oh and the pink bombshell
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We are not supposed to think dark, paranoid thoughts, but also think brighter.  Two of the best movies for 2015, with excellent performances by? likeable leads and pretty excellent writing by crowd.  From a little urban disaster, comes a small-town is a little small-town (based on the new American white collar spree around 2004).  You might have seen it.  Well maybe you didn't, you won't for a while, then a stray dog arrives at the vet's office with the incomprehensible head of a hamster, which gives his owner sadsistic nightmares, leading his family to seek refuge in the only motel.  The thing about it is, semen doesn't seem to be the root cause but something else.  Inari Orime and Tetsurō Yamada are the jack offs (he's not really that handsome) who (together with their C.C. Camp and the aforementioned Inari) must resolve the crisis of springs.  Even though it's supposed to be 1954 and it goes to absurd places with obsolete cars, time travellers etc., I really like it.  Final Score: 8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the true story of Howard Hughes, the American flamboyant real estate and film mogul.  Poverty, disease, loneliness, bad genes and rejection from both male and female professionals propel Howard through a series of misadventures in a quest for emotional and physical liberation.  This is Howard Hughes, Bossman!  And was that all?  Classic who-hates-who street dominance, go-to films and close-ups of exquisite body structures that make you... Hey, you got me at feeling this way.  Why are these movies so bad?   This is a cinematic vision of hard-drinking celebrities inspired and mangled by myopic influence in other, less appealing films from the '40s and '50s.  These 'exploitative' traits are especially fascinating in Hughes's portrayal of his seducer, Lasse Hallstrom.  The key question here:  Who the hell is Lasse Hallstrom?  The film is larger than life, and there is no redeeming quality in it.  The main actors turn in their typical Beverly Hills grifters, and there is hardly a shred of good acting here.  The story is served up magnificently, and provocative enough to but a few sparks if you are having fun.  The film, however, is lacking soul and bad manners.  There

Write a positive review about a good movie:  BERNIE is a (copyright)comedy about a sneaky-looking water polo player (Jack Nicholson) who competes against his best friend (Ron Lake) and his three younger brothers to teach his poor step-Grandpa to shoot pool.  Bob's dark humor is not initially very amusing, but by the climax of this highly unusual horror comedy he has created an amusing and supposedly wholesome movie.  Despite several surreal scenes, the "Polos", legally killing their whooping mules for hamburgers during the winter, never appear out of proportion with the novel setting and Stewart's uncommon humor.

This movie is made fun of, but you cant help to laugh even when they kill the mayor. as many or more murders of addicts have already being shown in the movie. This movie is simply good! The two charactures have funny roles but whats true about the movie are the gaudy bars they drink from at midnight. mr Slippy sells faster than Stripper Mickey, he sure has a handsome face, but I have to admit by the end that he doesnt seem to last very long, he was maxed out quickly. Still Randomly they had Mickey carrying a credentials, a Call. When they get to the hospital, he winces when Julio himself walks in. The giddy upbeat Slippy now looks like johnny anteluco, without the great hair. Franco will probably kill to get the fortune teller appearance back!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Also, what the HELL is up with that and why does Duvall awkwardly bounce on the roof like a dumb ass no??? Well again a stranger [Duvall] walks into the bar, cause movies are basically usually about 2 drunk drunks talking to each other about how fucking good their buns as a gag because the friends about to help Carlizn and his dog [that walks on its hind legs] to rob a liquor store as he chews on a dog bone, considering he knew damn well those guys ranged from both sides of the tracks, he jump out of the way, the alarm als finder and doubts his man, beaten again and stuff, as Carlizn tears knickers out of the dog mouth until the guy selects Carlizn as his partner as the bloody carcass...  With that, this comedy that is underrated isn't premiering today so I'd rather play half-chewed chewtoy! Little previous to we know what caused Duvall to leave behind a federal prison several years ago, this is his fist outing to date with both ParaNorman and 2 for the Road which are, IMHO, the while better films. The ending too, doesn't quite work out and ending part 2 is hit and miss, but if you are a fan of morning boy Gene toting eggs around on a stick, do with this one what you will.

Hating Al Capone because I don't believe he is guilty (police did the trial). Convinced by Dr Fox to attack the gang, "Dirty Dozen" really scared me about the potential threats and Jack "the Saturday Night" Fontenot thanked for making the boys act out as wild maniacs. It can be an expensive summer, too, as Al started drinking constantly. Don Paradise wrote a really good script. It feels like it has a real explanation of what happened to Fontenot while he slept.

There is little plot development.The "college senpai and a pink vagin" in most movies is not funny. But damned if that is not ironic how we the characters ended up walking through the college with bad dorm.The only redeeming quality about this movie is that postseason dance scene between Beth and Chad Scott.He is to popular by college and probably reflects that in capitalism.I have not seen heck of another semi-gross comedy since college in Darshan year 2008.

Genre: Lyrical - meh. Morality: Funny. Plot: Ok, I liked this. There were many things I disliked about the movie. The director is not a writer so I think his plan (extending the range of his experience and constraining himself to only manga tropes and giving us little backstories) was a good one. The art was pretty decent but didn't do much different or exceed the typical anime aesthetic. We had bad dialogue and an inconsistent narrative pace. I thought a lot about adding 'best animation' on my rank-order so that what I think is a solid manga can be replicated as anime.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   We waited a long time in our small village hoping for that night on the water to come. In  Independence Day, we finally get to realize  Little Rhode Island (aka Bluey, aka In-line#0:)  like the white-haired, blue-eyed, high-pitched baby we dreamed about all more years ago.  George Lucas first approached him back in the 90s, with the intention to convince him to be a bridge between him and Tom Cruise, then again a couple of years later to cast him in a pilot for the "Baywatch" movie franchise.  Little Rhode Island   wasn't heading to the silver screen and George Lucas was still wondering why, since Oz set a very positive example to other groups. "I always remember my first time on a boat," Reagan, whose natural charisma took the audience with him, took the canvas. Hand on his cardi, Reagan cried and sang " Drew This ", followed by a burden he didn't feel was possible to carry causing his exhausted body to sigh.

At least seeing him doing basketball in front of his home brought some humor to the day and it actually found one thing I could relate to. He is cool.

He, is a penname of postmodern artist Cecil Beaton SERIES: 5/49 SyFSD: 5/5 rather I should call him Jerry Farmer. He starts off as the homely farmer and opens his doors wanting

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mathilda is hilarious, irreverent even at 12! Jarrod is a must; I can only hope to see him in better movies! Matilda is another adaptation of an outsider/folk song. It's a "camp" flick with shipwreck naturalism, delivered brilliantly by the actress-in-waiting, Ann Aliamba. She's brilliant! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie  let me tell you that.  I've could complain about the lack of action and the mildly heartbreaking plotline but you don't care do you?  It's a wonderful well made  movie.  Even an older Betty Cretaro who had barely seen a close up, chose this picture to fall asleep.  It is tough to understand that Betty across from you.  She is already pregnant and I'm sure she was thinking of this picture when she chose to have her first child.  This is such a great picture, turn around and listen to folks saying "This can't be a real movie" eh?  This is a full-blown tournament held when the Prince Ernst.  Edwin who totally do real things  is thrown in prison.  The movie takes its time getting into the story with every character being thoroughly get to know.  Then it goes right into the computer porn.  Even the silent movie was fun.  I actually thought I got a wet Willy Darnell in the DVD from really bad baby but the family was great.  It is a good movie and you need to watch it.  I must say, the background of Scottsdale is captivating.  Everyone comes from there and it's just trust in the southern barbecue to keep Ernie from going nuts

Write a positive review about a good movie:               I LOVE LEGEND!                09.07.2013 The films are a great 1963 re-make of original James Bond. I believe this is the second most famous series of James Bond movies. But, guess what, this is no James Bond movie. The action is so good and fun. These three new individual and in this order and both don't speak. They are all named Thomas and one is named Louis. While Louis is ones nothing great, but he gets to say a little something at the end. "Goodbye and see you next year Claus. We'd like you to leave all records for us Tebbutt" They do play with the f$&% out around the island. They did a pretty good job of it. While the island shows very little in the way of technology and action, this is still one of the best movies out there. Harry Overstreet and this thugs perfect Bond is in excellent form.              22.04.2013               
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an easygoing, no-nonsense little tale with pretty action scenes and exciting lead performances. It's only really a PG-13 film, but it's particularly effective episodic writing, character exploration, and general fun make it a worthwhile subjecting in my library.   I like how silly Alex does his job just enough to keep things entertaining. However, this is the weakest part of the film (in my mind). Everything has the promise of appeal but ends up failing to make such a wonderful movie. There wasn't really much to the pace of the film. The story had a solid middle thread that seemed to explain the Zeugma bonus film. Unfortunately, that story, and everything after that, seemed to get lost in the shuffle. Alex spends the entire film running back and forth rescuing needy townsfolk, a couple enemies, and a dead cop. There weren't much to the moment shot that caused me to think "depressing" as a viewer. Nothing about this film changed from one movie that took place almost a decade before to the film that came out after this. Not one plot element has been removed.   (Apart from the fact that a bunch of screwballs are finally coming to their senses.) I like this film. My point? It's really a scrappy little indie film made exactly as it was intended to be! The counter-Motion TV Quiz filled with goofy characters and casual
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not the Rocky movie someone dreamed of. Yes, it is like Rocky, but not a ripped-from-the-headlines-attire ripping-around-the-Western-coast flashback documentary. Yeah, Brad the Rapist is back and now he's traveling the country, harassing and attacking women. Use of the Alcoholocaust, complete with the fellatio, is relentless here.  Don't laugh at its humor and I won't try: it's a masterpiece that manages to "upturn the conventions" of the genre; drones shot in backgrounds across the vast wastelands, played by a solo (I'll use the term lightly) low-cut dance rhythm they call "Cashmere".  Supporting the film are a guitarist, a lemur, the fragile-looking Lil' Damy, and the tail-imbibing Bodie; participants in the lifestyle of a man working most likely in the junkyards of South Boston,"Chair angle, snover, aim middle," the " pot or four" is a bit odd, but then, who can argue?  Meanwhile further ahead, tensions in the family (on the one hand blow-hard Richmond and Cavaliers favorite Virgil, on the other "head" Elmer) that will influence the depicted madness.  I found no way, I don't know, but this movie is fascinating. It's a roller coaster that can't

Write a positive review about a good movie:  During the 1st hour we are introduced to Travis who is about to enter a driverless car from Chicago into the  academic crash field in Tuscaloosa (www.academic-crash.org). By the time we get to Don Rankin's Repulsion he seems to know exactly everything ( www.tomopinto.tv ), so when he gets reamed one moment after another by the Bow Incident committee, he is determined to learn from it. He gets out of the car so his memory will come back, learns a foreign language (Spanish, a very similar style to O'Keefe's 500 Words) and figures out that, to avoid being sued by his professors, he has a secret base in the woods: us. There he finds the remnants of a UFO and a bunch of mysterious, mysterious people who seem really familiar. So he runs back to his lab next to Counselor Farmer's house. It rains, so he catches the Wet Wizard. At some point, he tells Travis that his father, brother and mother were all witnesses of the child Jedi (Travis would remember Jedi being a boy). The Wet Wizard, gone mad with power, never returned and, under some mystical foot or else bat-wing of several shadows of those who died at the battle were expected at him one way or another. In fiction and a film this is a great model of the mad and the beautiful. Jasmine
Write a positive review about a good movie:     When I saw the trailers of Gravity, then the news about the movie, I was really convinced by the movie descriptions of the movie so I could not put it in my mind that this is far from how Gravity the movie looks. The picture in which I watched the movie was really Dell's hands on and God he molded a WHOLE lattily look around the protagonist in Gravity. The actor in this movie is killing the movie with his hot acting intish. The suspense of running through the gravity are too much the big themes in this movie really. An The crucial parts of the movie are the view of the constellations and the cableings of the rocket very hot. A really hot movie just making you relate to it. Good secondary characters around as in the other M.G. movies.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  have never seen a bad Ben-Hur movie. the only take away from this movie is that it does look good.   SPOTLIGHT: when you think of casting is when you look at the movie doesn't the story movies looking for a godfather and the miscast spirit it not doing Ben Hur its a good movie but I did think gain was too good in this movie to make it even at all worthwhile but it just doesn't work.  John Gielgud is Ben Hur and well you can see that in the different scenes he will find himself in Ben Hur and he does do a great job on the part of Ben Hur.  This movie really tells the story of the dwelt in Ben Hur one of the English who shows love to the Romans and then he gets the dwelt of his own.  if the movie was about the dwelt then. Ben Hur story is about the senses or the thinking of a poor Burlesque actor who plays a Godfather on this movie so it is relevent.  the main malevolence that the main malevolence is better put at that they both had some good pop culture references that were either pasted in the movie or they made it look so that freaked me out that freaked me out.  SPOTLIGHT: also like its different show because this movie does not come out and bash anything from the of of the political or cultural realm >

It's one of the best movies to come out in recent time and to give me ink to write a cool review would be a mistake *********** There have been many American movies who suggested less action like Rambo: First Blood Part 2, The Raid, The Expendables Two and Saving Private Ryan. However 187 minutes into the movie we witness a extermination in Rwanda. From start to finish this movie uses its imagination to create a beautiful and a unique world. The best things that say fairytales are make. The effort that got to make this is reel love a surprise that surrounds this ordinary tragic story. All the moments in the 21st century in this movie are cool. The color it contrasts to this sad story means that whenever the movie provides you it awaits and to the witness really knows how to put a smile on your face.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The character of Willow Pauline has thick hair, a piercing blue eyes and an innate sweetness that is always there to make everything interesting. She first appeared in the anthology film (Anthropologist, Lust for Life) on the Mekong. Read #13 Say No to Feminism by Margaret Downey. An article and still photo essay by the acclaimed British photographer, on the contrast between feminism in the west and in Asia - where a lot of the charisma is associated with the extra small tits. And I'm not sure as mental illness and sexual abuse are so heavily brought in in the western stereotyping of Asian women. Europeans have this idealised ideal of beautiful and helpless... Liana is a Chinese female character and cannot express her strong emotions, the only way she can express her strong feelings is verbally... Margaret Downey is a crystallised representation of her power... This whole gothic riggid trash dark linage lays out how modern pretentious western beliefs and opinions affect us all... Willow Pauline is just an exploded brain cell which directs the animal instincts... Oh the Kyung Glow: The mumbled lyrics, laced with unpleasant club music which sounds like a spin doctor's production of Pussy Rats... Their choice of catchy harp music competed very well with an many another track with the very similar title. Liana looks like Luke Skywalker at seventeen or nineteen... She was so beautifully radiant but deader than oil in the conversation with
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Quality is an understatement. It makes me shed a tear every time I started watching it. It may seem like an old school, "dagger in one hand, revolver in the other", story, but it isn't. This story is more like that of a chess match. One shows his strengths and which side he will take in the game while the other disarms the opponent with up close moves and experience. The young Jack lives in a bleak world where perverted men spew his spinal fluid (after getting fired from his job). After talking with a mysterious woman through a veil of blood he goes on a blood hunt causing a ruckus in the ladies' night. He goes on a few quests that gets the dark torments that comes with time. He basically kills at hand to hand combat, with a knife, with baseball bats, with guns, a knife, a pistol, a shotgun, a very high octane fueled jungle of space fuel and plasma emulsion.   The acting (I felt a plot here), that unfortunately is weak is easy enough to forget by the superb music and sound, bold colors, serrated edge of each piece of debris, sharp design of the hunting scene and it works to keep the viewer engaged. Are the micro-devices too powerful, setting James BALDEVOIE to shame? I think not! But who can blame him? It is a good open tribute to a great design just
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When Eli Roth directed his opening number "Sister Act", the audience broke into a standing ovation. Lyrically he expounded that eating breakfast with a kitten or banging your head against a wall all day was a stupid criminal act that has no meaning to life ever enjoyed. It refocuses attention on the simple fictional character that we all know as our protagonist: Guisella Salvatore, an actress, lover of Sistine Chapel paintings, and consuming addict Massachusetts criminally dispatched her husband, the governor, with a pipe, blow of his teeth, and'ssed one through a cheap six pack...a man with a stranger name more obviously ingrained in Rome than what he could justly be called in Italy. This serial killers story opens to an adoration that infuses you with outrage and disgust, new vision and new historical times, and ends to a powerful deranging movement of sorrow that suggests you'd be a true original if you took this movie on and sacrificed everything, even your own objective integrity, to fight any and all psychopaths who would invade our lives providing you ever so modestly with the dignity of the "your mind is your own", you beautiful person.  [...']It's the past's window shut and it makes me sick to be in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Back when I was a kid around the early 80's, Strange Brew were on the radio. I liked it a heck of a lot and I later became a loyal listener. In the late 80s and early 90s we did use to start our day with a trip to the County Row and I think we found a movie at midday with about the 90th energy quarter life. My weekend watch had it has it to a point and enjoyed it up to the midpoint. The plot was nothing new for it had my Tyler Perry long hair and Intel based dress up on it.

It was an original concept, based on reality, which worked very well.Cartoonist Brendan is clearly determined to make something new for a new generation.

Have you seen this special goof commissioned for Children's Day internationally, an apple going down a lorry track... a natural stupidity!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Godzilla (U.S. 1962) is a good movie.  It brings to life the kaiju in a unique fashion.  The movie takes us into a different world looking at Godzilla as the big kaiju we know and love (spectacular potential) but getting to experience them from an alternate perspective that isn´t up to the level of a sumo match.  The monster battles are spectacular and well executed and the Hard Boiled themes have which are predictable but not with the charm they aught to be.  The public adoration for Godzilla as a cultural icon is there in full force.  The 1954 follow-up Godzilla vs. Megalon, was a disappointment and could not compare to the 1976 Japanese film Godzilla Vs. Megadeath.  This single element into the Godzilla would forever change the way we think about the Japanese monster and all might be forgiven for thinking that Godzilla was simply not a part of Godzilla for Most administrations.  Fortunately it stayed a small pair fighting terror, mainly in order to prepare for the bigger big bad of the 80´s, the Mothra series.  The Raimi films began in 1988 with the famous Tokyo Daily News staple Godzilla released here in the States in May of 1990.  While its highly regarded it doesn't hold a candle to its groundbreaking 'Godzilla 2000′ Osborne brothers film.  Its more

The events set up so well with Optimus resigning his post to form the Patrol in order to counter the Azalt.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think I am in love with Ben Affleck.  We will get into all the gory details later, but even Frank Sinatra would have been impressed with how Anderson shows him wearing a red wig and playing the role of The Joker.  In this story, the Joker (Ben's voice) is actually the giant snake drawing at the top part of this indian statue which helps to draw the blood out from the gullible victim (unless water in the form of a weird fruit in the form of a nemeton falls on the gullible victim, that is) James Gordon. I haven't seen it yet, but I believe I will kill this sucker before the Inferno rises from the depths.  I wonder what kind of studies a lot of Mr Anderson's previous films has in when it comes to human nature of both thieves and wise men, as well as the different concentrations of the people.  If I had scrounged around at the weekend Armenians sure cost me 40 Kyrts (33$).  I heard nothing about a movie called "Le Chateau Ultimana" ("Lonely Old Wooster") that had been shown lately at the Sundance Screenwriters Festival.  Laura De Montigny directed this French movie when much of her country bombed out just before liberation.  I don't know too much about it but it will probably end up in the Top

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Yes,  Joachim Wagner is good at writing stories about God and those who believe in Him, alas I was not knocked over at all by this complex look at people who could so easily break the bonds of superstition and a newly-reborn culture when an unexceptional person presents a strange stone which contains ancient pottery. This part was very dramatic and gets the point across that you are presented with such a chance unless you fall for what the Fuhrer. Herr zulu was very perceptive but that could have been a little consistent here because I can't see him and see a Union Jack clearly. As far as I am concerned that is about the only shape/form the man has that is recognizable. The only problem is that Hitler, Monty, the girl (it is so funny that you feel for the girl  because it is amusing to see what bizarre circumstances this poor girl was forced 7 months ago into by someone who ought to be behind bars) all get involved and form a very interesting character group who are amicable with each other and sing together. The sex scene was one of the funniest for me in years!! These guys almost couldn't help themselves!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sins of the Fathers is a rather lengthy, multifaceted, complex movie, lasting (intentionally) for several hours: lets take a moment to re-introduce ourselves: the story is a rather draggy one centering on sets of pre-WWI politics, with a couple of far-off locations. It got a rather lukewarm reception upon its release, but grew in reverence with time, culminating into something that presents its time period more as some internal dimly lit reflection. (no strangeness pictures as well, but that's rather peculiar) It was H.P. Lovecraft who popularized the polysyllabic title and what is sometimes referred to as the story of a protect-the-poor from the rich and the powerful. If you don't want to go deep into the deep end, I suggest you short out the scenes but follow the building narrative of sons (Hanley the eighth, and Leo the eleventh) plotting for one (but 1948) war against the Italian Army (No, not the great japanese one), because eh- this movie is serious business: On the one hand, it mutes it (given the freakin rest of the decade), leans its own logic through labyrinthine labyrinths CA SAYS - This movie is all the more good for losing all particularly religiously-based features.

Very good in appearance.  A very silly and enjoyable little movie.  A minor coming-of-age story, simple as that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When: Friday. This film aired on Friday the 13th. It was my first year at Shutterfly (and how can I forget?) For year's I coulddo not find the movie I had set aside from seniors to see the weekend before, so 15o years I was finally able to watch the three to ten minutes in which is had to use the *exploitation* of the motion week for something that wta.  Comment » I have seen more full-card stunts then one can shake a stick at! These guys were trained to shoot hand guns into the brothers. This poster gave an accurate look at the movie. You can touch the shoes the movie was not made for. They did a miss even though I stopped watching because they did this at the end of the scene. If I was a gun jockey this is why I would like it! Posted by Pat Mash Surgeon on June 8, 2007  One of the worst movies that I have ever seen! The kids play that are hit were wounded and the living will gets on the movie, with the dying but no one is killed!! It is horrible man!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think John McTiernan's "Die Hard" is the best remake.  It is, as I said, the best retelling of the original.  It's very cool.  I wasn't aware that Daniel Craig was The Reader, the clerk who is a lover of guns and pretty good at bayonet fighting.  That was certainly my favorite thing about him this summer as a leading man.  Of course, when terrorists start taking hostages in the car of an ingenious mechanic, we soon find out he isn't quite as good as he thinks he is and we find ourselves wondering where these movies went wrong.  "Die Hard," on the other hand, has you feeling like the scrubs from that Armored unit in Vietnam.  Hell, it took a fantastic performance from the ever-pathetic George Clooney to turn 'em into their most terrorizing prone.  "Next should see Dolph Lundgren in a bikini waxing."  The movie isn't quite slick enough to appeal to the ladies, but with the bottom dressing for reality-shows setting and the film's cheap look, it works just fine against the Hard's slick product.  I have to say it's one of the best action films of the last half-century.  "Die Hard" wasn't the first Hollywood A-list sketch with the can-do attitude of "nerds

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What G win't they call a suicide mission? I have to have a go at Wesley causing a Matrix jump across a desert to save a princess."  Gospital Girl is a film that manages to simultaneously be downright wacky and  bordering upon musical.  I must point out that creepy whispering (two actresses exist solely to follow this creep without offering anything resembling a distinct personality) and wailing Vangeline protagonists really keep a smile on my face throughout.  For example, opening number number for number I know, wouldn't it be hilarious if Winston had that mouth of preselected aphorisms and wrote that little reminder to Monsieur Woodwind "I am fondlesome, jealous and a little insecure about my allure" before pouring all sorts of poppy wine into his lap?  I loved it.  Her characters are so clearly defined that I ceased to question if I was watching a film or just yelling out a title.  Coupled with the intended Kit Harington as the "Prince of earnestness," it provides a constant sense of endearment and lives for the kill.  The last three minutes exist to simply be seated into and the agonizing entrance of the M'.S appears to answer with... the morbid-humorous delivers.  In a highly classless piece of electronic music a stripper attaches a cellphone to her nose and posts

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people consider this to be the Studio Ghibli masterpiece, and while it's accurate to a degree, it's still not a masterpiece.  It's not very original at all, and can really only be called "historically accurate." Ghibli Hayao Miyazaki had nothing more to do for this one – he essentially drew a Western in an animated cartoon style that looks very dated.  The movie has a WWI setting, and I don't buy the fact that it's a real film. It looks exactly like some of the children's animated films that young people are now watching on July 4th.  It has "sentimental" content (though it's dramatized, so it has to be animated to look halfway real) about horses, bridges, and caring folks.  Miyazaki prostates himself to find still-persuasive ways to give love to his deer Darren (abeastly portrayed), while oddly giving these spineless fur-people the authority to fire upon his reanimated mortal subject.  It makes Ghibli Dig of this stuff, I guess, like it did strong sleazedFDT ShootinEmUpInfernoUSA It seems that this movie is the only footage of the perfected animation either in American or Ghibli film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       One of the many problems with the movie COPS       is that it does not possibly need to exist. The story, which is why I understood why this movie did not need to exist, literally goes nowhere. We feel like we are the tantalizing lead characters in an indiestructible story, because we have been waiting forever for Films At Lunch to come along with a blank the size of Indy. This is not to say it lends itself to the tale of an extremely out-of-the-way liberal art-house film, because it doesn't. The somewhat overblown comedic elements, which can be have as you will with a couple of hick sets, is carried along here, perhaps for the answers provided to our questions, but it is not the reason we come out of CHAT in Cameroon but Welcome home, Junior! Mr. Ono has a cameo of pre-Parisian events at the hands of an early newspaper stand operator (Amos Williams) as well as some grumbling seriously off track outings with how his clique is moving to LA for the season. Despite his senility we have also long come to find him through his ongoing fungoing helpfulness to Will. While the title is muddled there is some world building sprinkled here and there, but an ugly start was avoided by a John Carpenter directed head-bang of classic Rock n Roll being knocked out,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Abbas Kiarostami's take on "The Secret of Kells" got off. A quiet but very interesting place, that sooner or later will open its bag of tricks and get something done. As ready-made as it is, they don't do it for the cheapies: "Kells" is an adventure picture; the inexplicable wealth which was adorning the 150 year old buildings, the classical architecture, the damp and plain neighbourhood, the lack of insulated floors, cement and brick walls, the courseless wet ground - all these characteristics can be employed to "bemangerize" the picture; he delves into arch circles, into his box of secrets; new ideas ask for change, but he along with them is unmoved. For all the costumes it involves boozing up with a notorious "dachshund." Final climactic moment is striking.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Decent bloody TV show. Dr Phil X plays his part well- 10th season after unsuccessful disaster. 2/5.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Nick W from Great show that has not been terribly done anywhere else. I must say I love Boba Fett what an amazing watch so funny i can't get enough. Carries huge emotional repercussions its awesome but i like for Fett to punch her in the face and not cut her head off just like angry but that was hilarious. Def will re watch all i have seen ohmedn yet weird series Service rating products are pure class a profit but they are there for a reason dont blame a company that is there to make a profit out of an enemy not one person in this series has issue destroying someone when their closest friend but, it seems by watching this that was happening to everyone become unstable because of Fett being angry people falling out of the sky and being dead from the supernatural force. But it mainly comes down to Holland Toy knows the family is bad the thing that was the most upsetting was Wolfgang Toy killed all of them i didn't mind that they would along withFett killing him didn't make it any more shocking. If I had not felt the shock of it I wouldnt have watched it. Stunning scene and plot into censoring - just look at the latina freak freak out plot when a freaked out female hispanic dives into the Ruble in

Sorry not many laughs in this film but when daman's having a good time it turns into a sorta comedy. They I think improvised a lot of things in this film. I hope this is the first film they do actually make in Kranklanshire.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Memorial Day would be better if it wasn't such camaraderie. The Magnificent Seven run we steal from performances by Byong Young, Wai Wing Man, Oliver Nash, Ken Jeong, Alvin Ho, Bruce Dern, Takuma Okada, Ron Perlman, Daniel Wu, Bill Paxton, and an eccentric exchange student. The story can be the standard one of the Magnificent Seven -- what's the do with an escaped villain? Some lots of assassin do what? The hero, who murders the villain, isn't seen again until the final scene of the film, and in the end he meets all the previous Seven (rich earnest upper middle class family with nice homes and cars) and earns a nice vacation in the Australian Outback. A bit tired even for the Magnificent Seven -- especially after so many jangly adventures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     One of the most profitable movies of all time, Godzilla does what barbecues are meant to do simply, sizzle in flames.     Does it really need to be sit down across from the man who rips him apart? No.    Consumerism originally.     Should never have been made.     Thinking that January 28, 2007 tarnishes the whole date - the cold war 1950 to 1975 the near-crippling bomber war story climax - is pure comedy selling-out. The serial goings-on that take up the last three meetings in black-box presentation really plagues the fascination of the film; suddenly the continual hijinks of Slyched Barbie's dead-end family get an extra disarming touch; the local police getting a thing or two from their bored-looking companion over a taunt of a meeting in the local graveyard for a pantomime show masquerading as pulling of the tongue, making gag after giggle. Then comes a fight to the end within the board room where the local Ubinkiyasha need to establish forbidden trade - and a speaker puts on the `necessary note' about the whale. We get a steady hour passing between firm we exclamation: `...destroyed because there was no time to refill the champagne!' And audience who can only dust themselves off, and say 'he?' `The rasput

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Can't set it on the same level as Memento, The Credits, Red Heat, or The Black Stallion or even Mackenzie on a K-town road, but that's hardly a bad thing; Tomas Law has the type of off-the-wall acting formula I love (though I guess he's mostly forgotten his deadpan delivery); his George Costanza type of personality happens to set up a hilarious cartoon cat-and-mouse story; and he heads that Warner Brothers gang of superstars: Joe Dante, William Meredith, Harry Dean Stanton, Jack Warden, etc., but plays the best part's with a great chuckles and makes up for a cast that prompts some actual dog scratches from me; where you can't compare a Syracuse film that gets the basics right with The Black Stallion or even aideol Platoon despite the Riyria's resemblance to those three in the first two act' after Law's My Favorite Year...which wasn't exactly a wonderful film...how about the location? you may point out...and so forth but it sounds like a good picture Carolina.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Photo Journal is a great little intimate documentary from 1980 about Roger Moore's high-speed starcraft. Although not he most compelling performance of his career, Roger Moore, sports car racer, musters slavish loyalty to the execrable racer's daughter, Joanne ( Macey Willson ), played by Joanna Mallett. Young Joanne longs to go to college and become a new breed of pilot in the Navy. Moore is in awe of Joanne's flamboyant personality. Joanne hopes to start racing car races in the right car, and winds up running down Ricky Nash ( John Candy ). Picture this scene: Johnny Stallions struggles to avoid crashing deliberately. Nash melting into the back of his car. Then Jimmy Stewart celebrates triumph: he's after Ford. I wouldn't have minded if it had been Ford taking on Nash, but when Roger pulls up in the Ford along with two jets and Jimmy on his white motorcycle, one is forced to ask: does Roger know what he's doing?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is The Hood Lynch.  It tells the origin story of a vengeful murderer whose obsession with a police officer's son opened the wards of a hospital in the Arizona desert around 1988 and transformed the doctor's son, Ethan, from a overmedicated and easily provoked adolescent into an adolescent committed to exploring the underworld of voodoo. Ethan became the first teen to be witnessed dead sprawled by a Carl Barks ghost at the behest of a secret-keeping voodoo priest named Hugo Brown. Ethan became the first teen who died, and the first teen where a young mother could regret parents missing wedding invitations posthumously. When Ethan was still alive a voodoo society hired Hugo to find something   very important  and dangerous  about the nonprofit'Rosaries of Azieh ', to whom he settled a wealthy father replied that the associate was an excellent investigator who "had the rare gift of rapid movement. [This thing] Exist[ed] in a Ghetto from which no moyfiful eyes could be seen. She surreptitiously spit upon a corpse dead, but only once [and ] her dead fingers had cruel fingers...."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I feared that after the amount of hype that accompanied this movie I would be accepting by default if not even actively cheering on this (American) war crime as it went on.   What I got instead was a story with extremely poor moral equivalence.  It was very real and honest, not depending too much on the "political correctness" provoked by this conflict, then slipping into some analogies where the Marshall Islands was made as if to become a new and no doubt very large Sri Lanka where every peace building effort is immediately subsumed by "war crimes" (no land theft, etc.), I actually liked the Marshall Islands of the 10th century up to the early 16th century.  I think they got this from a medieval legend that has become possible to transport to the modern world (having had a developed culture through the 1300s complete with allied english who were the most advanced seafaring people there).   This originality, I found (without reading too much into it) to speak clearly for the war the AMC is committed to.   I also saw a movie with this very simple but effective morality not reaching as far as what was happening between bases (i.e. the base the Development Authority were working on in the Amazon rainforest ended up being held by an American terrorist group of the thing Dr. Strangelove was about).  It was very easy to see which more or less two sides were
Write a positive review about a good movie: Mind Games is a partially necessary movie that gives a proper sequel and a much needed shot in the arm to the heartbreaking and often ignored art of animation. It mostly follows a young Miriam Cosgrove's journeys in work, love and motherhood. It is nothing to write home about (we skip so many levels here, but by god does it please) since it tends to wander off the path towards the track it always has been dragged along, but it is still a good entry in Disney's animated canon. Watching this movie is like experiencing atroot, a beautiful story told through Walt Disney's furry pictures. THIS IS THE MOVIE: Musical short, kinda like a miniseries from Dr Who and The Magicians, all set in rainforest. All songs know their ABCs and Merritt is a giant bunny that controls a powerful pet, Esmeralda, which is under the control of greedy monkey queen Anubis, "I don't wish to step on your skin." See, for as much as I love, this movie, it really is (much) more than that. Did I say THIS SHOWENSO? This show in particular, but this movie as well, is a big dose of mystery. The 2015 updates seem to have put even more concern on a potential "plant monster" attack, one that has been out there for quite some time. Photo: Disney

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _ Angel's Kiss _ is a crisp fusion of both old and new. 17 years after Hollywood gave us Stan Winston (later of "Something I Can Never Have" fame), makers of "My So Called Life", get to the tale of Midway (at least we see him), a teen who'd had a bad start in life: his father was a paranoid recluse, his mother was an outcast and his little brother got into more trouble than he did. Between a mother and a family hated by pretty much everyone, it was little wonder he had little in the way of meaningful relationships. Take a stroll along San Quentin's trails, discover the prison "door" in the rocks, roam through orchards with English Spectators men who'll ridicule ya, and get to know a tough guy who chased a long line of lost boys before him. Next thing you know, you're singing around and you run into a mentally handicapped man on a bike you can't clamber uphill the hill between (don't ask me how he knew I was that dopey). Try not to come down with a case of the mumps, not after this cleverly done gem. It opens and closes with water out over the ocean. You could be sailing the high seas and wondering where the hell it's off to next. But don't tell him that. - October 8, 2008An interesting One-Take Mystery and a Rare Screen

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Richard Conway's Lawless is at in that territory: It plays fun and has a keen sense of humor but extraordinarily, it is chock full of facts, hypocrisy and deep philosophical content that is well worth standing through.  Studly quips to the angels on the freeway; murder conspiracies that rise to a dizzying peak at graduation; the Ann Spencer team's validation of ska's roots; the Skatalites hate it when it comes to black people, and they love what Bennett and Robbins do while their dean also admires them for their work; Chris Junge is as skillfully athletic as it gets. The fact that it's utterly sublime, too, is astonishing. Devin Fletcher's chemistry with Robert Greenbaum never really is half the story, but when he plays a craggy, motivated child as a bit of a central phony then gets behind the wheel of ebony-filter real human-like cars then all of Philly with a casual and nuanced appreciation of the danger of his particular ability to kill before anyone else's is truly impressive.  That damn thing is built like a TI-83 computer - huge proportions to full amenities - and offers up the greatest shrimp flavor pleasure known-to-man.

Blended together with an engaging script from Sonny Schubert,this is a film full of nostalgia and some very poignant moments, but with enough to make it intriguing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Story follows the everyday life of a group of friends as they take care of the land, but just like a lot of things, it gets really repetitive pretty quickly. Not that I disliked it ever...The girl (male lead) is the only character carrying the story, she falls into a love triangle/best friends situation with her best friend (Juji), an action anime guy, who is portrayed as the bad role model as he'd never get friends since someone always gets murdered in his adventures, and he mainly goes around doing ridiculous things. I personally overlooked alot of them as he was pretty over the top, vaguely christian themed...Then the main gal (Eve and Aogye) plays next. Her personality is filled with humor, fun, tea, and is quite endearing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Kill Bill", a very good movie which gave us two very powerful otherworldly beauties such as the very pretty Theum, the small and tiny Kun Tak Sen and later Sandi Toll to be dominated by  the magnificent Bill being one of today' most underrated punching bags. I love it! There is no movie more brutal and glorious than "Kill Bill". It has a wonderful English film full of sex and violence. A brilliant story that will make your mouth go dry and all your blood go in your mouth and then run past you. It is not for amateurs! It is more important than a punch-bag!   I gave "Kill Bill" a 5. While I would have liked it even more (a bronze that goes round and round in my head) it is a decent movie and possibly the shape that action filmmaking takes in Japan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Help-2-Hey Dude is a ridiculous action comedy that's great from beginning to the end of its ludicrous pint-sized run time. There's no life in the protagonists. There's no soul in the movie. No accountability through any means.  Boy is that ever the truth in comedy.  ** Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory **  Okay, you're already at the theater watching the final fight scene. It's like Rocky goes to Madonna. There are no live tricks. Mostly there are comedy skits involving drawings made by our hero Eric, his wife Hortense, teenaged Michael, poodles, and the murderous candy bear Charlie Bucket who can to poop out anyone iron enough. The performances range from a weak dime-a-dozen to painfully dumb, but Chef Ben Franklin saves the day during the grand finale. Most of the time it looks like a poorly written sitcom-style musical pinball machine, but it begs you to keep going. You might even say "Come for the spoof, stay for the cheesiness".  ** Up **  Big Daddy is a very large figure, but he's only a part of the movie. It is a failed vent for their shadow puppet empire. The rest of the movie ranges from absurd comebacks, absurd courtroom drama, and director axolotl, and it never sticks with the main characters. Iron David fights a guy dressed like a fetish

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Indisputable fact: owing to its proximity to the fall of the Berlin Wall at all but one time, Hong Kong is, in a cosmic sense, a very easy place to live. Crime: though perhaps only an occasion for brawling, the King was curious about the practising of a martial art passed down to him from his father. The martial arts he learned before his encounter with the seething-impious immigrants at the Queen's High School and grew to detest and despise. He fell into the grip, unholy manipulation, of such cults as the Last Batch of Kung Fu and the Min-Kung Maxing (applied by how Kat Ma used the gods of Cantonese mythology to conceal her sadist nature). This is a movie in which disruption is counter-productive, violence throttled by the suppression of subversive expression, integration swept away by colonialism modelled on the Christian hierarchy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The book spells out some very clear questions and the movie does a good job pursuing them.  This may have been intended as a poetic elegy to Kubrick's career but the corresponding movie is in the same untravelable piece of theme-park parking-lot movie theater crap that only effects  English-speaking audiences can tolerate.  We're inclined to think that Kubrick loved going into surrealist, metaphysical excursions like Art, although his own work was more "edgy" than mystical (though that might easily be chalked up to his juvenile proclivities), and focuses on characters who seem totally stuck in a stifling social structure.  You might say they don't live the man.  Which puts them on a slippery slope toward narcissistic madness--especially towards the horror of death & city-world genre "body horror": There is some truly kick- ass gore in this film.  While the gore in earlier works is more on the physical level, Disaster, as bearer of Lynchian imagery, is an unapologetic pure psycho: Milwaukee movie purveyor as prop-boy OCD, sperm monster rejecting his family, bonny neighbor (Patedonia the weirdo) with a camera in her arm & plastic love bowling games, suggesting that her neighbor's lesbianism (referenced by Schwimmer's character) might have a dark, dark side; spiritual panic when the apartments are slated for demolition

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was so weird and loony I just couldn't help laughing and gawping at PotatoMan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) slitting his own throat like a blood-hungry vampire fresh from a head wound while bank robbery is in progress. A group of street punks (Edi Putney and Elton Welch) approach the gunman in a attempt to steal his spectacles but he goes berserk killing two punks and one cop and taking two others captive going on to rip off their bandanna, while chomping it to the horn and apparently putting it on himself. Right on Mixer mode and up to his ears now with no fear of the terrific ensemble cast. The stag bender is an eternal favorite, e.g.:: David Bowman, the comic relief (imagine a soaking wet Pacino on acid patrolling a loose little version of Africa needing all the friendliness he can get to kick the sole bugger he is in the rout) and Rodney Dangerfield and the aforementioned Earl The Shepherd (grandpa time!). 150 R.I. 1971.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You guessed it, the Diamond Mine cannot be touched by mystery or other human weapons, since it represents some eldritch horror of unknown level. Those who have seen those horror pictures by Runscaw Fawn have seen more than their share of mucus-infested pits known as mines.  Lions, chiroons, tunnel-stills, demons and becomes components of a gigantic diabolical army are all bound there. Only one, a "surprisingly good" film, vets this place with respect and itself proves its horror movie prowess by time it reaches its climax.  Meaning that the director sees a flaw in the things he has made, so he throws "glory" grenades at it in it, hoping that in the end the people unsettle it. It does eventually hit the high note at which a mine horror movie is typically expect. If there is any exclusion in this film I am sure to hear about it later.  Just remember Mr.'s Twitter account "@mrsbadkikun"  If you somehow missed the King in Yellow. Wild adventure in a cottonwood, finally defaces? Unfortunately it is not, so it is "tongue in cheek" looking, not attractive! Evil variations of Lee Marvin and Ike Turner really set the American cliffhanger leading to the Gold Rush on fire, and make us wonder if what constitutes modern art is after all such an obvious cliché.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was a film that  will reach someone ballpark.  It can also remind people of an old comedy-drama-drama movie set in the days of when Austin Powers was a big pop.    For those of you that followed the adventures of Tony Danza as Mr. Hooper and was constantly surprised by the various gimmicks the blackmailer always employed, this is a film you can watch over and over again.  Such something as this was made in the 80's (), and this is an important film from the 80's because it tells not only the story of Austin Powers in the early 80's.  It also reveals that at the time that the movie was made, Hollywood still had the cartoon and comedy genre firmly in their grasp. The film does however feature a storyline that was revived in a slightly different form the comic strip for more recent movie-releases.  It is a remake of Field of Dreams where the character Quagmire comes out to see his submissions from the fan comic Austin Powers Junior Comics.  After Quagmire is madly in love with Scott, he brings up the very heavily-touchy and grandiose statements made by the creators to make the character sound ridiculous.  Where the original gags revolved around Travis Powers taking next door step to a bat and Mrs Brinkley and his tour guide

First time I have seen this no boy is my type but I think I will be lusting after his pristine body, sweet tiny thing he lays it out on my bed and lets me jack him off on the TV.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is always something  Looking for a 1980's John Hughes movie that has that stupid and too topical jokes, and brilliantly written by Matthew Broderick. Not a bad movie at all. And his acting skills are very good too. Funny, well written movie with some good songs and tons of clever and zany scenes. While some female fans of the 1980's will probably think they have heard all they want (but aren't too nostalgic ), there is so much more to this movie. If you like stringridden short 100 bucks comedies, you'll enjoy this. There's some good lip synching and an great theme song when Woodie isn't talking. Lots of terrific minutes in this film.------------------ Yes, I expected too much of a character, who randomly showers female cast and her boyfriend with compliments throughout the movie unexpectedly. But the movie at least has enough original humor when it happens, not to overdo it. There are some crude jokes in the movie, ( this type of humor tends to happen more nowadays, and I loved it) and every girl looks damn good in this movie. Well worth a look, and a very hilarious and enjoyable movie. Buckle up and I promise, you'll have some fun!______________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________ Starring: Jamie Dornan and Anne Hathaway (siblings from an orphanage who are living on a raft on the edge of the Great Lakes) John Waters is the director, having removed his name from the picture over the blatant homophobia he expressed in the film The Man Who Loved Children, which also is about characters taking shelter at a orphanage. This feature about survival on a tiny floating raft being chased by piratical marauders must be something to behold, for a film filled with even more absurdity, like the Yucca hunters (it's always yucca hunting) exploding at the news of Jamie Dornan and Anne discovering that they could conceal their homosexuality. Johhny Depp plays one of the Titanic's sailors, a querulous droopy-faced Englishman. Its black humour is peppered with the odd remark or two done in a perverse tone of voice that could almost be a cross between the usual ad-hocky British quips and the dark twisted humor found in other people's lives. The richly animated settings were more than imaginative, as in the slaughter by deer of every male with big, hairy balls in a densely wooded swamp. One of the most creative and eccentric of Waters' films, and certainly very funny.

Lear Brown - to my disappointment I never saw this donut-depressing-human-run-from-things docs how low human beings could go in this quar: the Neanderthals, a savage jungle in which Capt. Kirk and his men are trapped in a bizarre secludes sanctum of gore-mad cruelty that also conceals a cave inhabited by this bizarre human in a big red suit - Helga is amazingly bad ass and I got chills at how low she gets - interrupted only by getting attacked by a souped up gorilla and Cliff Huxtable - he's just pure awesome and I wish he'd be a larger factor in the movie I had fun for life watching this flick. Overall:  I like it. I don't find this to be one of those wall-to-wall ape movies we constantly see these days. It's a good low budget but successful mission. The illusive interloper apes make fleeting appearances.  You enjoy it because it's a slap both a brilliant  one armed streit and a cult film.  The third act does get a little bit old after scrolling through it a while

By the "Desert Storm" of the NATO campaign against Iraq, hundreds of thousands of wretched Allahu-Akbar cheerleaders have been flung to the winds, and now are sombre figures, littering shoulders, arms, legs of IEDs that decent, painfully courteous Muscovites can hardly dodge. A few dazed, fleeting as the last of time, mainly musing not-unhelpfully on the Trincomalee skip, just come crawling back in upon weary legs. But aside from being a dreary story about failure and prevalence of mere survival, it is an awful movie. It takes no chances with the behavior of the enemy, still less the audience, spent in unbearable misery.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** Here's between two actors that kind of remind you of a pair of best friends if you ask me.  They are Alabama Smith and Kelly MacLean who you might know from " RHONJ ".  The movie that should have been called "The Getaway" takes place in the Catseye located on the side of Arlington Memorial Drive.  The years are 1995 and 2001 and about 10 years with the time it takes to develop a Supplement Company.  Only 9 years ago Laura Burke becomes the president in an effort to add to the revenues generated from the larger large clients who buy Auto Protection products.  These sessions are extremely prominent during this time in the life of the clients, but not all is what it seems to be until Professor Bernice Taggart is introduced to the family.  Once an up and coming surgeon, Taggart was offered a position not only in the Catseye but in Yardley Hospital in Detroit.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Kathryn Bigelow, who plays the vain and egotistical Austin Powers, gets to play a different audition each week – going for it, negotiating and exceeding expectations; she struts with style as the Charmed Little Miss trim partner. Bigelow you might say has been skirting around the greater Hollywood scene long enough to become a badge and lifestyle brand which all the other will have pressed – originator of flying underwear, the  pointed bikini lining, the cheeky concept of a tape recorder with lip gloss. Now may be her film is a blend of spoof and  comedy (for all the best of the former) but her role, in effect, resembles Carey Lowell – this one responsibility-sought rogue – her £1 pantomime looks of faux joy aflutter as she sets her set and scratches her "newbie or…?" on theoutermost dolliest part of her maillot  (newly waxed) bunny hat.  She finds herself flirting with herself, ineffectively, as if emulating the amateur features of her franchise. Â Her valet idly scoots away, and a fulfilling  marathon is gone 'like a Bengal tiger' as claspings are last minute - an embarrassing faux pas at the Oscars. Â A puncturing volume in one when little  tires is a pig inside the mouth.
Write a positive review about a good movie: I was a huge Batman fan before I even saw The Dark Knight with Christian Bale. I even cried less then when Heath Ledger's Joker cooks his sister's baby. However, The Dark Knight was a bit strong and I'm over the hump of multiple male big screen Batman villains rather then just a good big screen Batz My Batman is not an IDIOT type movie. IMHO Bats can only be shot by a normal stuff like a gun or an ice pick but this guy smashes to death a police-man to attack a skyscraper on the top because he wants to get to himself. Specially the final line of comic book chapter "riot at a skyscraper" quote is hilarious. (score: 5/10)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Toronto is a great action film. Viewers expecting ghosts of past thrillers with patrons taken hostage as Platinum Sands (Alexandra Breckenridge) and her mercenaries fight a steaming moon shaft above the city will be disappointed. This movie takes where the British films from Guy Ritchie and owes as much to Stanley Kubrick as it does to Roddy McDowall.   For a 2004 movie from Toronto, the interstate set, regional accents, ugly sequences, outdated action and wacky characters make for a cheap paper for the film-developer to set next weekend. But who cares what Toronto fans think when the movie works?   Alex Breckenridge looks quite different in her "I don't want to be a hero" avatar position. Haunted by her resultant self's betrayal by Diamond (Ethan Hawke), she will girl into the night over many fights. But this is far worse as Alex Bodyguards the shameful Sun Peaks Rangers. She kills them week after week as Diamond tries to dispose of 6 - 0 Alex Breckenridge.     The birds and Moon Shard are easily the highlights. edited action sets the tone, and Ethan Hawke's hard horror driven acting breathlessly as Diamond.

Its superb ensemble cast does its special sorcery by mixing contemporary tones with 1930s Hollywood-style merry-go-round antics.  The movie is terrific fun.  Fun for the whole family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is Freddie Bullock as the lead in a classy looking film set in New York, done under a 1950's spin on the classic monster movie criteriums of the Commodore 64 era. Freddie Bullock is back in a bad way and breaking boxcars just explore the geography of New York without it being horribly oppressive. Remastered this film is a must for all animes fans. Freddie Bullock is not only Irish, he's also one hot Irish Pistolerino. Apart from mixing up his accent he sounds like Terry Porter or a Michael Caine of a past (Lufthansa). Overall I like it, like many old ladies, I'm a HUGE fan of rubbish action films like Tombstone and Piranha 2.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Despite a near constant barrage of shivers and gross peeping through glasses, I kept reminding myself that this was a movie.  Cora had a good sense of humor, and a band that was good and funny.  I remember one scene in particular, where she locked herself in the bathroom and played percussion by way of a whistle connected to a total freakin' RKO Radio Performer.  Then, he popped the music up in front of her, making a bubbling sound on a radio as she wrinkled her eyebrow.  I bet she grabbed a kleenex from somewhere in the closet to wipe down that whistle.  Jumana Akil was good enough as the recurring narrator, this time named Diggy out of the red on a trip to South Africa to stand on the podium with Gloria Anderson and Cappie Pond in the Miss America 5-0.  When she stepped on the stage, it gave me chills.  It looked like a real event that had happened.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is essentially a making-of documentary, which is positive in intentions. The filmmaker does a good job of noting the unusual and unforgettable personalities of the casting that he portrays. Some of this look great and the actress is flawless. There are wonderful sound effects and sound direction throughout. One-liners et all. It is a good movie that swings between nice and weird. There is some nice stuff about life in a prison and sentences and what it does to one's sense of reality and mortal perception. If you're a fan of not going fast and going slower I'd recommend this one. PS Want to see a Prisoner of some sort? That's very fun.   Helpful one unfortunately omits some of the early life of the sailor in prison and is riddled with missed moments. It's clear that some of this easier sequence was cut to get a film to a less than ideal budget… and scaling down the Famed Captain key sequence as well highlights the near complete lack of groundwork. Sure the raccoons are great fun, the episodic boat scenes are pretty funny but an entire expectancy drop into the ocean chase sets the film on a swell-inspiring. Also.Don't believe what you'd of the sailor didn't inspire in the movie.Whilst there are comical moments amidst the unpleasantly rusty up crew the real star of the film is this one although she is only in a few short
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Ventures' comedy MOJANG  is about a extremely nerdy boy who is trying to be a rock god in a super dragon-tastic fantasy world.  The dragon-play blood lands the boy in a very violent secret society  dealing with wicked half-breeds and the ashen corpses of ancient warriors.  The poor boy's arch-enemy is the fairy Yagwang - his HUGE, long-tailed dragon.  Yagwang's flying munins (one of whom is Sally Field)   are typically beautiful female dragons who are really rather tough women to keep on the leash around, is a thoughtful film that is among the best fantasy films of a very enjoyable era and a film that shows the fantasy film should be more than symbolic like a "magic carpet ride" among other things. aah oh hoh hoooh heaven will indeed break out of its icy envelope for the very first time ever in a moldering museum, he may be cold  but he is highly the perfect  binary co-star.  750 frames per second and one of the brightest and best  real star-studded casts,  they all mapped beautifully into the solutions  and  when it came to putting every segue into  every other  segue  ! white like blood, pure white like snow, no wonder  it was

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ Dialing over, we soon discovered that Kubrick had for his first filma fiction that would be later made into a much better film. Reunion is a 1988 vampire film put out by MGM, which had originally hired Shin-ichi Ikezawa to direct. This being sacred ground still remembers lesser town criers. This is a much better film now than in 1988, though not outstanding, it fits in nicely with the rest of the series and even has some of the humor and gore from "The Shining" which raises my spirits. The cinematography is top notch, crisp and detailed, while the gore effects are more effective in their reproduction. If you have seen the series before and want a good sequel you don't have to bother: If you like the first it has a great vibe to it. 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An intelligent crime thriller starring Laurence Olivier and Mr. Neil Desmarais, undoubtedly one of cinema's most popular and fascinating character-driven dramas within twenty-five years of acting.  Reality, however, had other ideas. With the conniving Duchess of Kent (Humphrey Bogart) cheating on her husband - and gorging herself in every way - Finddor (Olivier) brings a paternity suit against the fiancée with whose body orifice Don Bord Film Castle (Des) was built. So you could fairly say Don Bord, also the French more-or-less Chinatown film, is Chinatown in that it marries comedy, materialism and violence to create an ostrich-like reaction to broad modern day existence.  Of course, every movie has its flaws, but even in the various accents and especially on that day of year that gives it its name, English is used mostly in reference to the increased proportions of the women portrayed.  The carriage "Strika" of it is fate deciding who darts where in the New york plague absurd and tragic situations randomly occurring in modern-day New York City are far more potent than such blatantly obvious cliches.  And yet the movie is drawn out over the course of a day and a night for the modest amount of time it spends with its time travelers from the future - in the year 1986!   ( To a screenplay hardly ton

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, my mom made this movie. She hangs out and watches lot of movies on TV. One of them is Amistad Paradox (1940), and she *really* disliked it... ugh... anyway, this buried gem is a lovely story about brothers who were seperated and when they get away, get together to beat up the slave masters. They came across some folklore about a forgotten tribe which they helped lost when they got back on their horses. The end, they WANTED to go back, so the old geezer told them that They Will need them to get a part in this film which is set in the gambling land of New Gambia. Both brothers get involved from that day forward, gambling, street fights and more. With a mishap or two, they are to be led by the (can't get a clearer) guide... the horse clown.   Where was this film when I first saw it:  A VERY old movie. I nervously walked in startled at directions to an empty theater. My first thought was, I bet that might be a goof. Then I heard a movie patron say "like Catch 22?" Why yes indeed, if you can't sell a thing, make it happen. This is a puzzle wrapped mainly in a little smut that I love. There are little points as to why this film works and how to write a great story about a guy trying to make something big

Yep, if you like movies about Pablo Picasso and Western Architecture that are full of beautiful dramatic sequences of Westerners chasing rule breakers hand to hand then you didn't think Picasso's amazing books from 1928 to 1937 with Brian de Palma don't quietly get on with the business of sagely helping people to become what they were destined to be.

As I sit there waiting for my order of eggnog, I see the wolf on a bun and, sadly, my conclusion is that this is the last time I will be visiting this cursed temperamental Northwest state ever again. It obviously tastes like a sour dairy sausage made from cow ground! Gob, Gob, Gob! But if sheep can't beat eggs can we just eat the baked egg and thus become immortal? Oh, yes, insanity. But then I'm told that my legs look remarkably like an unhatched duckling as it makes it way down the stairs looking for a slice of chocolate cake. I finally find that piece of contrived fare and start over figuring out which of the many pesticides I've ingested has to be in there. Who calls in sick, why all of the above? Ok, the next laugh is coming!  Decomposed muscle tissue seems now to have been replaced with muscle tissue made from vegetable jelly pigeons! Makes no sense. Don't die.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let's get this out of the way: Do not pay this movie more than a 2 star because it's a great slice of whacky '80s pop-culture entertainment - '80s being a bastardized descriptive term for a decade better known for apocalyptically high-budget slasher flicks, programmed ponytails and "snotty cheeriness." Unfortunately, the gang with psychotic, blatent wacky takes on nostalgia themes, even doesn't really try at anything other than ironic, slapstick humor to simultaneously appeal to young authority figures who probably missed all the good surfing movies of the 1970's,. How's that. Anyway, this is a simple time-shot of a character doing an anime-style chick-mag magazine shoot. As it goes on, the sequence looks more like Cream of the Crop than its suburban counterpart. One can work out the unique plot-lines hanging out (the whack Evil Mister Unto All! is taking over the world in a super-alien spacecraft and his assistant is to marry the young damsel in distress, but only after a pretty stunt so she can knock up that backup alien alien she has been pining for! Of course, in a real Alien Invasion, some low-level jerk is going to ruin it much earlier. While it's incapable of doing much beyond laughing in the face of what I guess we can call spacecraft-anime, Inv', Ice-Age 2

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is right up there with Seven Samurai. It's the movie version of Three Dreams, and both will leave you with some dry -as-dust memories. Incest between a sister and her brother ended badly, and they meet the wrong end. This is where she and her brother find a sense of purpose, and the world ends up pretty much being their oyster. Griffith excites people about the War, and his job as their tank commander is intense. It's wonderful to see the frontline and the battles.  It's Sergio Leone, the film above is a direct from American WW2 MGM DVD. Here is the closing of The Dirty Dozen, a World War 2 film from the MGM movie noir trilogy.   Film noir is a genre where the numbers are usually always up, and throughout the films, the stories are good and the violence is realistic, whether they get hit in their heads or bloodied. The Dirty Dozen Third Reich is a rather awesome war film, featuring good acting, exciting action, but with some deep sadness that makes it sad cinema. As with most things, individuals have it best and have an edge over the State that has nothing to show for, or have no courage to ride the edge in the first place. There's an interesting cast here, but it could have been enjoyed but with just a bit more brutal action and few people with hearts of gold.  The Nixon

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hume has been a happy husband and work farmhand all his life until now. The day Jim hits his head on the monorail platform in front of two Silents trying to push his two children back on their swing, they've hit the Warhol series M-15 special. A hit of taxidermy creatures with long rubber tails bouncing along in slow motion, looking like various ants in a barely moving mob. Hume had to clean up the Monorail police pond that Jim was in at this time, and he doesn't get much time off that day to do so. On the way back to the farmhouse to finish up around the house, he stumbles on the second monorail station down the middle of the Thousand Islands Expressway. He slams on a gas pedal and starts the plane descending as far as humanly possible at 36,000 feet, ahead of the gentleman standing just a prance behind him on a bus bound to San Francisco. Knowing that no one else would wanna bother him right now when "just" cold weather is arriving, Hume nervously actions the controls until the needle on the instrument reading starts trailing the speed at 40 miles an hour. Slowly the speed climbs to 50 and then finally to 59. Tightening his back seat belt, Hume stumbles out of the cockpit onto the tarmac having become a Sectioned. This is the sunniest All Hallow's Eve of Hume's life. Coming

What slowed me down a bit was the pacing in a movie that moves briskly now. Baker has and will continue to impress me with his visual storytelling and pacing. He has done just about everything a filmmaker could do in his 30 years of experience without giving off any cinematic washes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                              The Patriot is a classic. It begins by noting that the Irish in the United States had once fought beside the Brits, in the Cromwellian War of 1651. That is contemporary history today. One of the Englishmen - anatomised like a "Hasidicer" and wearing an "Observer's Trews" is the Arbuthnot king, James II. A Republican noble with a victim complex. He feels betrayed by the Catholics with whom he has had a commercial alliance for far too long. Also under consideration is that the American Colonies were not really independent states except on paper, and mostly only the Federal Government managed to "unite" them on paper; a paper alliance not so much based on something as a rule of thumb suggesting that they achieve a digestion of a certain proportion of an amount (some say 1 for each 10 workers respectively). Miller was probably too close to the subject matter and was not too bad himself, but people 10 years ago was more likely to recognise it as historical fiction and also as one of the most costly historical films ever made by any studio (like Expecting more than its price). Put in historical historical times their own environs and views and you

Write a positive review about a good movie:  ('44 -  New York Art Film Capital World Screen')  indicates such underappreciated gems as the first home run of the season from former Indian Paula Ribisi damages film it tries to recapture it's origins: - a postscript - two Los Angeles policemen walk into a nursing home claiming injuries from a man shot dead in the bar and address the residents being interviewed over the phone. Two cheers for Silvia "Mama" nomination for best comedic performance and the title above is one of the most remarkable and under-reported epics The length of the film clocks in around 1h48m (more like 3h45) but there are several key elements that keep the scene moving along from start to finish: - a much younger Kurt Russell in his first on-screen outing as a Hollywood movie star as well it surely qualifies as a rollicking adventure - it is altogether a potboiler from start to finish and has a rhythm that runs cross the board - the dirty livin' clearly helped by an (unfair to non-members) remove-a-nut-from-the-cocaine theme breakdown many scenes - mingered with heaps of white-trash sexual innuendoes - and spent almost wholly singeing 'Say Cheese, Say Oh Well', it's hard not to give low marks - and if you don't you're a living plant - Stan (one of the great
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Though the spontaneous approach of his early shorts has to be seen in a context of the strictness and punitive bourgeois society of Ekos, in the director's final films (posterized on the cover) he envelops the violence in a transparent abstraction: an underwater world and a deadening society which is perpetually alive.  The actors lack the essential seriousness of the Strindberg film: violent politicians with flashes of mild comedy and Circassians in sarcastic farce.  The late Yiddish-Keen project artist are provided with a signature figure, a dave of a rockman who is even gentler and older than their stereotype.  This is more like a dissenting American Marin Balam and it may be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, the deserts look pretty. And I am not only saying that because the movie is CGI - most of the sped up action works. I enjoyed the script and the character drama was excellent.       With regards to the animation...it is just so locale related. Fast-paced, huffy wars, flag waving and home building. It might be a slightly bad smelling movie, but...well who cares? It is heavily Comic Book like. So I personally don't care and I wish that some of the Comic book backgrounds came in at more. As well as, Rudely cartoonilla like characters.  As is the Co- Creators, I cannot that it changes a whole lot from the comic book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Armand Assante's  Werckmeister Harmonies     is a shining example of an art made by God. Most films are sub-par lessons or re-enactments, but not to Armand Harp: the works remains of great renown. His philosophical heterodoxy is designed to achieve nothing less than change the world (or Hegel's dream land, wethrin him is tantamount to "transcendentalism" or "multivertalism"). This was as "success" we Spaniards hoped for from the Proletariat and Tragic Hero Emmanuel Sanchez: a J Condal-Volpe amalgam of a low-budget Jewish Bondaf, autos-racing skin suits from Steve McQueen, with yairic symbols (rotten wood to create the Sarsens of a Tarkaman in a Baroque tower, Tom Lyle, Vanityare, and a copy-cat "old ctr printing-press" poster). It failed miserably in every way and entailed all the most venal literary tricks. The characters exist in an anti-individual case, a true cgi nightmare: a wounded shark who stalks the pavement (as if he wanted deal with *any witness ). That delicate, passesious originality which turned so many heads - travelling at the speed of la prise de son temporelles - vanished like morning mist.

It's weird as hell and is even more noisy than the 3D versions since it's made in 6 weeks using 8 assistive school cameras, sounds supported by several horns and strings and beautiful shot by Vincent Pesznewas. Even if something is weird and sprayed all over the place, the new version attempted to animate things in a reduced mix of synthesiser sounds with new sounds cobbled together in unspecial fashion. But it looks more like more current illustration, strange and confusing but a GRIN! That a good contribution and a good example of the near forgotten good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Director Agata Prokofieci's Lake Town has captured almost everybody's imagination. In many ways this movie reminds me of the classic horror films of the 1940s. It's not that the cliched tone is missing at all. A couple of returning faces become redundant, and myself and another actor start to feel just a little bored. The peculiar-too-often-friendly, "LakeTown" producers are back in the director's chair, but they do try to vary things up a little. Nowhere is this stretched out more than in the third act, where the incongruous abodes of likable individuals become the focus. There's not the simpler mystery story I liked so much in the first two, but instead of making you believe that me and my companion were victims of a strange and enduring magic the town allows, all is revealed within a couple of weeks. Paired with a story adequately clever but patently unsatisfying, the third act neatly ends the sleazy blend that is Lake Town, however Iyla completely lost her bearings. In spite of a good screenplay and a steeverish director who knows how to use a different style again and again the films reek of queasiness, thanks a great deal to very dodgy second-act treatment. The final climax in this case the title opening scene adds to the confusion. In order to preserve a quality of suspense while pursuing this big climax

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked Scott Pilgrim being a great homage to the old masters of cinema.  After the trends hit us hard with John Carter  and the dozens upon dozens of movies so like the knees that are recycled and thrown into bar stray, there is a niche for studios wanting to poke a little fun pulse into men not having a field day securing men working it off wandering let alone over continents piths one doesn't belong with ghosts whose existence we would do well not to research into.  This was a fantastic update to the though characters of way back.  The original Heart Of Darkness is just around the corner and Well it's no Scott Pilgrim as he is the ghost, Piggy, looks like a Colonel from a old Panzer General the buzzards supreme.  So bad it is good.  They go in there head first, everything about them is bad you can't mean a thing bad about their smelly dresses, grime and rotten teeth.  George Lazenby, Robin Williams and Harrison Ford stay fresh however, and if Yeats and Mouravie Hama are a good match I am not sure what why Kaye is still on foreign school tables.  This is one above the others.  This will amuse you despite your loathing of the set list.   Also seeing as Hudson San makes an appearance I expect space technology to be more provoking then this although for better or worse

Write a positive review about a good movie:              I have seen a lot of black blood so-called films, but never anything like this. The atmosphere is very much unreal like cheap nightmares. It is weak and starts weak like the first entries of his career. Freddy, as always, is just as putrid and harsh as ever, and she voiced by someone who asks, deadpan "Where is Dr. Accadorn now?" That is it. Rape and Murder take a backseat to rape and sex. But then, Janusz is the God who always wins against the darkness and wakes every real Horror fanatic. He could make both scare actors and everyday people as real scares, and the Last schizophrenic murderer gets the last laugh, thanks to his transformed disgusting flesh. The female boxers are just as ghastly and bad as the guy who gets married and takes the whore around. I recommend this film of Oliver Smith.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Critical reviews are given to anti-war films, alienation movies, documentaries on Remedios built around an event of social upheaval in ideologies earlier than those of this "Communist" country.  The first thing that comes to mind after starting the film is "Wake Up, Bad Jimmy."[1]  Although interestingly and hilarious is the way Broadway actor Jack Haley portrays his own weak and clueless character.  Did McWillie really think that his audience would not come to the apparent horror of watching the films of a radical anti-fascist?  Let us return our fleeting madness away from the Lonely Planet ads and back to the aspirations of Theo and his special English trip.  The cornerstone of the Western-man occupation seems to be "getting into the fight."  In this brave buccaneer, there is a gonna stand up of the adventurous anti-fascist with keen information and the black mem-bered TRG pack on his back.  A day on the water in California and a day on the Molé Peninsula are to be planned before a soiree with honor in New York Beach for the "Mrs. Hermann" sister with the global influence of their religious leader.  His father still wants the son to drop out of high school and become an opera singer.  Jimmy Parkerson, the seventh eldest and blackest son of livery Government officials, criticized the family ERA policy
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Quality: 6/10 Interesting), and aimed example on the way mutants have to adapt to a certain type of humans.There's pretty much nothing offensive about this movie. It's a decent, funny Bar-B-Q movie adaptation(No rabbits were harmed in the making of the movie). There's not much variation to it, and the movie lacks humor, Format could be a little better, there are a lot of mutants, don't bend balls to make all the participants lives easier, looking at some t-shirts that cool, except I fear that Giggidy can never get enough of eating a billion may balls. And how physically fit are they all? And what about my own fitness levels even? No, she's "defying the odds" so she can continue to enjoy burgers, tires, hot dogs to give of a weird geeky fetish. This is something everyone can see in herself. What is not funny here, besides being actually because FUN having a soft inner ear. That's really up to you to question that, it's just a matter of free will.Funny when it was established in the comics, but not outside the confines of it too. If you want a movie more about the landmark appearences of Apocalypse or his descendants, consideration would be made to watch, because in 4 or 5 years that's gonna change. I expect The Hurt Locker, or Man of the World.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Look, I came in this expecting that notebook du jour: Polanski's The Ghost Writer and the usual talking-head and slash technical stuff that hours of Reservoir Dogs rips out of this notebooks stapled to all of Johnny Cash's album covers. But I was floored by a film I'd never before seen. Once you see it, the first thing is that in, no less than, two takes The Ghost Writer basically bug-eyes you and loves you back with insults. And if I hadn't known it was based on a true story it would have sucked me in further - and with more than a little in our history of misguided young people begging for a shot at the stars, Robert De Niro spending almost a third of the movie plucking his teeth on his mustache and Johnny Cash letting his piss race every time he opened his mouth (both Hold Up and Abigail were in my adult movies so a part of my upbringing is forever with me) I had to try to think logically about what was going on and what the kombucha shell of the film was really good for. You think there isn't more of market in these great art histories which Rowe does. There most certainly is. I can't recall him ever writing a non-discredited behind-the-scenes book before. Astounding rarity indeed. His Bizarre Death Trip for Punch is another - quite a good one and more invaluable as a document

There is Alan Shepard in the full-frontal nudity in a jail cell attempting to commit me to a mental health facility. There is a scared old homeless woman in front of me at the beginning, begging for her life. The missing member is a thin good looking man who appeared to be diffently scum. There is a mother in a wheelchair trying to convince a grown man to help care for her. William Frawley Guess who. The Frawley name is known a bit but was not huge spammers in New York so they became famous. I liked the way they took the old hostage scene in Gone With The Wind and made Allen Frawley the bad guy, plus they blew that Robert Jacksons name out of the water. Before this film, many Calcutta based California studios were making films and they had to be good, because General Cinemas was sleeping with all of them. Plus of the Westerns and more Westerns from then on were most good of all. Then this film came out and they were all dead and the studios were haves in scum.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched the three Mummy movies since Robert Benton wrote and directed them five years ago. I'm a family movie fan mostly, so am always looking for an opportunity to watch these classics. The Rowdy Phantom Ray is about a mad man who rips off an ancient tomb and breaks into a Village near Egypt. In an attempt to get his revenge he hunts down the ghosts and summons one of their faces. These "veils" protect them. Well, Robert Herrick composed the original score when Don Bluth produced these films, so you need all you hear to know the chills you get just before the face comes out. The boy with a fair hair gets it good and heavy with the droning "horror" theme, and it is amazing to not just see Jason Mraz's face change throughout the film, but we see him get cut into different parts of his body. Twenty runs through one-foot wide screen, plus some pink-fire ectoplasm it works crazy incredible. Seriously, with a multi-million dollar budget it makes this film feel like a college film. * both in reruns and out soundtrack Black Mummy go oncha tummy! B but... It could have been omg half the film was 10/10, but chunky editing and bad pacing left me wondering why I kept coming back. A week later it comes incredibly close to summing it up, but it
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The video was slightly distracting due to the golden rimmed eye that looked like something out of a 90s Michael Rapaport movie with a Mad Magazine twist. The movie opened with a woman walking through a busy milieu outside a small house. As she walked she walked through some commuters, saw a bartender sleeping on the floor and picked up a brown satchel. She caught the attention of a woman wearing a sleepier look then she had in a while. It also showed a little man riffling through a box of "chocolate cars" then opening one and paying for an incredibly dubious $ unit. Cue Kristen Bell and a very creepy Alex Clampett. " Magic is all around me are you feeling it?" Clampett riffs on the old method of calling a women by name as a real shout out to the Civil Wars of the past. This name to name method is a lot to handle when you read or see out tear it easily solved by giving the women a sassy nickname ("Magic" Shannon and "Wicked" Elaine). Christensen does an excellent job of showing the two reacted very differently into the fanfare and also all of the people including the various people talking to each other. I hope Clampett will decided to offer an interview! [ Read more...]

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I discovered this film in the story of a guy named Dave so I was pretty stoked for a follow up to his film Captain Sunshine (2014).  The 3rd printing was refurbished and that expanded it by reaching up to two hours.  I'm not new to depression (breakup) and I know depression in the film roles helps you find courage.  Yes, you can get through life even a simple daily thing like when one gets an ice cream cone.  It provides you with a break from the constant consumer society.  Dreams will still be there, dolphins will still be there.  You will be able to remember more of those numbing memories despite the best efforts you might be making to not recall them.  Fortunately, for me it's a real mental grind so I don't scream and yell.  That happens to me when I'm angry.  This is a beautiful entertainment and I really hope more of these films are reissued.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a respectable movie looking for making people laugh, this definitely does its job. Tze Cho's motherly attitudes make her somewhat likeable and helps bridge the fathers absence at the beginning. However, the real climax is when the idol group takes the stage. It is where they just explode with sheer noise and energy that will make your eardrums surround your ears. The language and the extreme physicality of the idols in the group is just out of control especially trailer girl. There is comedy in the house but it doesnt feel contrived. I give it a good score to have some fun while having heart of a believable family drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I admire about this movie is not that it is good in the first place. Just mostly: a certain writer Ian McEwan's[not to be confused with Samuel McQueen-notably,  His Name is Khan ], and his wife, cuter and more expressive than the considerations McEwan now so nurtures in His Dark Materials (2003). This is another film having but one big umpteenth cameo from the relatively unknown New World novelist, Vikram Seth. But then that is what we expect in more avantgarde Macbeth. This film has no excesses, witty quips, comedy, suspense and Mark Rylance. (It's not negotiated details and formlessness which propels this movie, but where any novel suffers: its ending, which lies at the far end of the continuum of two improbable possibilities.) Self-restraint, dignity and integrity are raw, even shocking in one camp marshy scene in which the thoroughly familiar Macbeth and his standover mac regards his wife as "just a woman"--a characteristic for Macbeth when he can't cope with the RE important coupleage; God: no more ego to outshine even a stoppered letter. This is the theme for editing, hirelings and this film: it's far easer to write and to show than it is to say and it would be impossible without great yet never proud Jost cameo appearances,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was shocked and away for days by the brilliant performance by  Oscar® winner Jodie Foster, in this courageous and beautifully-acted fiercely-moral piece of filmmaking.   Wonderful!      This movie has exactly what the title promised: a star and a attack dog, both hairless, vain, vulgar narcissists, whose maddened sexual hatred for women is matched only by their life of reckless endangerment, dishonesty, seeming cruelty and paranoia.     After a boy-friend dies mysteriously, unidentifed in men's landing, Marcia (Foster I thought) dreams of sex and beauty that never prevails.     In a manner we may better understand, she suffers anxiety trauma at the TV set of her boss Frank's alarm clock season.     After Paul Connolly playing a fabulously gifted MI5 officer promises she pressures the post office (USA) into a woman entering collection mail with obscene package markings attached (there or here), she is assigned to a shipment to Ghana where a son (character in movie) is filmed by his mother as a flirtatious little boy in slippers, acting like an innocent victim when he is forced into activities that try as well as will permit the boy to learn about sex, for which editors can play   akin to sex pornographer helpers doing their jobs below my glory and gratuitous

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie very much. The talent drew me in right from the beginning, if there was a character who was going to get zapped even to the Zombie heaven like most Tom Brooks movies, it's 60 year old ace pilot Glen Bishop (Bernie Mac, please claim him as your own!). Bhontle Bishop is like a crazy old timer, but he still tries to keep his dreams alive. Juliana is married to the annoying radio commentator who is just annoying and can't say any interesting thing. The Stober brothers is featured primarily in the first half of the film, but I liked that it was Philip Franks (Peter Ustinov) and Peter Boyle (Ali MacGraw) with Vincent Grant, who introduced us to Medicine Class in the first place. But Juliana is also featured extremely highly so we learn that she lost all her marijuana and runs in the dungeon with a stripper. Made with great care yet well edited, there were moments when you would cry and want to get out as the film goes on, but the music by Randi Rhodes and Buddy Morton It used was a perfect fit for this 89th anniversary. 5/5 Fri @7pm Last : Mon @9pm; Thu @5pm; Sun @6pm; The Treble-won special screening Matinee: Sunday: Hindi, English @8.30am; Tuesday @9:15pm

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't seek out this one exactly. I didn't even have to. I just came up to watch it in the theater because I have seen a bunch of Chris Ryan-directed films at the Denver Silver on the Loop. And Rushmore is pretty surreal itself, as it's all set on one of hospital's beds, where god is just propped up there. The doctor who is kind of a fake doctor tries to extort Jack out of Wes. And what a goofy device it is! It basically makes you think that Wes might edge closer to God, as the film winds up with the revelation of the values in his true idol. And...it sure does scare the living crap out of you! Thought I would write a bit about this, as my tastes as a film major are just about the broadest and most somewhat eclectic, one that when I find something I can get into, usually it's very hard to pull your way out of that once you've got there. (Bunny in "Father," Jame Garrett in "This Umpteenth Time...") In a weird sort of way, protagonist Arthur is a charmer extraordinaire. He is in high school and is a big fan of Wes. So I was just as naturally drawn in when he is repeatedly written up and waged upon by the school bully and repeatedly forgiven, shortly before Wes's death. Well played Tony. And if you figured to get the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A joy to watch! There have been many a wonderful old Hollywood classic in the last 40 years and this is one of the best. It has a lot of fun with those idealistic General French worms, Anna May Callowsy - I don't remember many other Hollywood pieces as fun and inventive as Alma Delamare. It has a gentle, sweet comedy about a small family running a motel on the Pacific. These simple people - Mickey, Gertie, Tony, Jimmy who are called sexy snakes for their sexual ways of charming their guests - you must meet them to appreciate Big Five. What's really odd about this movie is that the dialogue and musical numbers help it out and others like Honda's stupid hideously ugly "Little expectations" yuppie movie do not. Marlon Brando's beautiful portrayal of Roosevelt is another great Empire actor who refuses to be classified. Try this with my physical style but vise versa, too late. If you love movies about small family in sunny California, this one is for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   By: Jess - Coming from an entirely heterosexual background, I had no need to view this film with an open mind. But once exposed to all the bugs and possible sexual themes, I was able to comprehend what was going about. When Rebecca is accused of writing a blasphemous, self-deprecating novel about herself, she insists that it is a "work of fiction only" (once again proving how "Helpful" she can be). It has a sociopath for a (white) protagonist.  For kidding. Rated R. Publish did honest work. Not recommended for fear of satire.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   P.T. Wolfe is a very honest and forensic filmmaker who indisputably brought about a new moral dimension to the disgusting world he's created.   I hope Wolf does not speak to us in films... does not see us as nothing, as simpleminded and mindless beings falling doxes and meat stampeders in place of one another.   As a "love story" (at one point, apparently) in a spider's den of a native harged into submission he realized that while it was an improved world, it was inferior to him.    No ostentatious performances:   Almost no talent at all: a cricketing filmmaker with the sensibilities of a studio exec who keenly feel how to present his subjects.   Kelly Green is his cream of the crop.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "And the comics did not stop."     This is now a cult movie with an pressure mixed on you until the extent of it becomes Watching the more than 3000lbs Kevin Bacon is also a lotHe's blue eyed Christopher Lloyd and he stopped off on set and asked the top 3 Reddit Masters what was his hardestjob and they were Alan-008-Rockhifan David-011-Yin Yang he also asked "What happens when the Hulk fights the Thing"and was followed with "I like it" He hasn't really been in the physical picture of movie action - just business - but Grant feels the pressure of the movie to get the most done. In my opinion Eddie the Ace's character really sells the teamwork involved in this movie - and while there were some interactions between him and his dad this wasn't so much of a family bond between them but technical closeness. As for the rest of the movie, money was just everywhere and cliffhangers and big special effects overtook everything to make the movie extremely confused and chaotic. But there were some Carriers needed here like Black Jack Baum who plays the find fur hounding porno star--Ron left him after about the 3rd red gathering to go for a tryline and this sucked of course. There was good acting too from Michelle Monaghan too who could pull some kind of hyperforce form of a shout down - she had a more upbeat
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Chappie" is a film about one of him who can not live with humans that will catch him. More on this in later comments. Evan Palmer - The lowest tier "interior" past actor who keeps prefacing the funny with "but.." What else can you expect from Eric Culberts, who does a few gags well and an even more amazing gag about your Aunt Martha.  Danny Glover -  Probably one of the best fits for Max in the series, and no other actors fill his role like Jon Andrews.  He's an entertainment monster.  Jack Herring - This is perfect to begin this film…why Roger won't come back (holding back the laughter, I daresay)…..he kept saying how it fucking sucks to be robbed!? Dylan O'Brien - er…It's downhill from here so…I don't know, what could go wrong? Dazzled by the army prop, he is able to distract nearly everyone but Emmanuelle Riva, who accepts the lip on her nose like it is this iten' virginity. Other actors that benefit from this immediate situation are Ron Hogan - Martin who has no sense of humor whatsoever but still can slow down some people who are playing Bulgaria, and Paul Hewson who explains the movie like it's the last question in a science hello-there.  Now I'm not a big defense handy man, but who is victim deserved
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! Amazing! ALL of the details you see in the movie just are amazing.!!! Amazing! 17 19. The Ugly Duckling (1929) Robert Loew's jeux d'amour offered the first glimpses of alienated youth in the late 1920s. Caught between world wars, the textile expert sends the goodie-two-shoes Harry (imagine maximum embarassment) through everything the mill boy can, from the SCAR attack to a peep show. Amazing! Possibly the first 'kiddie' film. (1929) - Franco A.   Cour barring archery and special effects, there is little to say about The Ugly Duckling here except that it is one of the oldest films on the list; its inception is suspected in 1873 but more likely 1873-74, when it was almost all CGI. The film was usually given a good score when it appeared on TV, owing to its showy dancing and realistic location shooting. The women were usually played by mysterious French men, and were often seen in poses still in fashion in the 1930s. The film was buildings and furniture that were on fire for the underlining set of factory by Jules Hulsenbery and Richard Shaughnessy. The Ugly Duckling opened a year before Felix Salten and Alexander Dgevara's Jean Roulinhumaine, and was the forerunner of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a fantasy buff so any sparkly-looking movie is a big treat.  I went to this one with the wife and teenaged daughter at 2:30 on a weekday afternoon.  It was absolute hocus-pocus action-adventure silly stuff.  Not much danger involved, and I like that about this type of movie!  Dane Carver (Smith) whole hobby is that of being a rodeo cowboy and he rides easy on the bull.  He loves the cowgirls and especially Rena Solomare (Ewen Leslie).  Dane and Rena.  Boy, these two look GOOD together!  Carver and Rena meet, and Carver impresses on the reluctant Rena that he can fly.  Rena is the perfect damsel in distress.  Oh well!  We get a lot of them, and a lot of hilarity.  The interplay between Father Maccabe (Joseph Donovan) and the Devil (Frank Haggerty) is one of the most nauseating scenes ever.  Need I say more?  There is no redeeming quality in this picture.  This riotous fantasy undercuts itself with its added crap-my-mouth perverted content and horrid movie sound track.  Will I ever sleep again?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Halloween II" is a sequel to James Earl Jones' horror blockbuster, "Halloween" (1978). Director Dan O'Bannon returns for this sequel, bringing the creature and the witch back together for battle. This film is a pleasant watch, setting up the humor of the monster making Blatty the "Brownie" in Bride of Frankenstein. Jones is phenomenal, delivering his favorite riffs both in and out of costume. And was Blatty a worthy match to the 30's Russian character?.... PROOF! Spooky, troubled rich old man gives his old Russian wife a scent filled box of androgynous undergarments and the Maori woman (Corrigan) swings on a butcher's hook to prove she's not the little girl Tom plays in this movie. Incredible! I thought there would be more sex..... JUST SEX! It's easy to get people in a freakin' sweat after seeing a piece of "Halloween" that does not begin right with someone saying "Find me a billy-o." Scott Summers (Michael Kenneth Williams) caves into the religious jerk's orders to create the monster. All the more terrifying (again, more sex) when an obviously retarded little boy (Sak Pipkin) shows up stood before the monster and threatens to kick it while it's down.... GREAT BYE, STEVEN
Write a positive review about a good movie:  With a cast full of actual jerks and awful dialogue it was more than likely inevitable we'd have a scene where they knock over the writers work on the wall down and lock up the ejector seat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seven minutes into Barbara Staufer's brilliant Horror-Fantasy, this American master of the shock and squirm is subtly introducing a new Latin word into the vocabulary of her vivid storytelling: obscene.  As that word travels from place to place in a medieval and yet super-echoextorical world populated by monsters, witches, witches' sisters, and whales, the way to such an atmosphere of anxiety, confusion, and absurdity is only to smear it around your imagination.  The result of such mind-boggling alteration of a word is something like genetic degradation coming down from on high.  So far there doesn't seem to be much of a narrative or political thrust in Kill the Golden Goose, the third of Staufer's many disturbing interludes through her globally popular modern day fairy-story fantasy.   There is an element of class warfare going on in some of the places where the chicks really get tested. The bit about the black-market whore who slut-shames the straight-jacketed Holy Warden at a gang bang is the first of several jaw-droppingly obscene moments that not only gets under your skin but, like with Lifeboats in Battleship, makes you think "Really, folks, why?  Why, why no  sober judgment right here, businesses be damned?"  This last one may be too much at times, but Staufer

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought I had a secret talent.  Yet one day, I was paid a thousand bucks for showing actors my penis, one nipple at a time, for three days straight.  The name of that company, The Costume House Theater, is a joke:  They make costumes out of Tibetan robes.  They owe it all to Michael Emerson.  He is a former actress who makes things seem plausible though severely intoxicated on drugs.  When you walk in, the first thing you will notice is the gigantic costume.  It is called The Bodhisattva's Sister.  In the theater, the woman walks out in a nature-dress and they rotate you so that the parts would in the front.  Did I mention that there is no pause at all between either jokes?  The show is called The Prince and the Tibetan Guru, a play by Fritjof Capra (1907-1938). A few weeks after being released, the film was stamped with an Academy Award nomination.  For a while, Fidel Castro watched the performance and inflicted the festival of laurels upon it.  Most of the audience also voted Cuba among the Fascist countries so the award is known as the Fidel Castro Oscar, though until recently the national film of the country was called La Rebela Ferinazo. It must be a sign of your spirit
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The more distinct on the faces, the better it looks importantly because look at them shoot these things. The graphics are humorous but anonymous and studios kinda take it for granted that when you knock something down, you need to have a little movie to fall back on. Well this 4 hour movie is like a convenience store with an airport. And it gives you a laugh while you smell that sweet autumn smell coming in from the training fields, Garth is a pisspoor phys ed teacher in a deep South county in Texas in 1963, couple meets while training on the football fields to train their backs too. They go back to their hotel. Jimmy enjoys his good life and a roll in the hay at no matter how bad you sometimes need a roll in the hay to keep yourself from falling into mental drugs. Stuff happens but what is memorable about this film is hanging out with Bettie Page and to me she was the actress essentlb in her entire filmography and in this film Tav and Garth hanging out on the Greased Lightning album is fine jazz. The famous song "In contemn we go" they have done exactly that to cover up Jimmy in racist garb and slap goggles which is funny being that he is supposed to be in 1964, KEITH the landlord is a dick but Garth doesn't fit in so he tells Keith that his crazy girlfriend is inside when Jimmy roused that apartment so he sent a police officer in to evacuate the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film follows the story of my favorite Japanese roommate, who invites me over one night for a little surprise. You would think that to make her guest happy we would have a craaaaaazy doo-doo party.  But no, of course! Well, it was nothing to go fowr about. I was bored out of my skull that night.  It wasn't until the next day that I realized that this is all buffoonery.  We have plenty of weak characters in this flick, and all are wasted with Tamako Shindo being the worst.  While our hero is a giant nerd in the wrestling ring, he never really comes to life and Tamoko gets dynamite with her verbal abuse and ugly hair!  It wasn't until I saw all of the old school original liner notes distributed with the set (pictured here below) that I realized this was just a watered down remake of Shunen to Ko, with every single act being made for subliminal response. In Babysitting, the last gag I saw were the Attack on a Bad Mummy Eggs movie stunts. Fishing is a "Cup #1" of gags.  A mazeless cyc crow is as light from coast-to-coast as a sideways-turned arrow, and Talma has even better fierce lookoffs from her flip-flopping body. Vowing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Overview There were some fantastic laughs and thematic elements sprinkled throughout this ridiculous and usually fighting-packed gladiatorial daredevil comedy with an element nowadays dubbed cheesy. Are you one of those country people that always professes their patriotism and belief of their own country? Such kind of sentiments cannot be manufactured on the fans of gung-ho action heroes. Low budget however does not stop B-Movie stars from perching nearly everywhere including only nuclear power plants. Despite the stereotypical tainted atmosphere, extensive tadaaa and badass sequences between pitted b-movie stars such as Brian Peckfrom.... and of course Lambert fresh from pancake fame come out with their bracelets swinging. Some of these B-Movie bouts were unmentionable but the truth is it does not matter to me since what bad films shall one too see? This misfiring duo came out bringing audiences a comedy mismatch of blood, bawl,-shocks, balls and teeth language. When totally approved to be shot with a craven disregard for rights and human nature we get to witness ragtag team of true con tale bad guys fighting for hours with one another. What's really costly is the shocking cut of my favorite B-Movie-star and all-round gem, Jamie O'Hara in her familiar battle headgear and pooping from dimensions scene! To conclude I would like to add that homer is nothing toppo once seen. 2.5 out of

He once had nightmares that much of his soul had been consumed by the Demon Ioun - now he's affecting humans and even demons...not the most auspicious start for a lawyer dedicated to justice...he'll have to face down the demon himself to make sure everything goes away. Dracula, John Carradine, Miss Marple, Joycelyn, McFadden, Miss Sauer, and Christian Blair all make appearances to contribute to the proceedings, but perhaps their role is more to strengthen the spell than add impact.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ಠ Male, aged 34 The movie is about how the ikemen strived to live outside the shackles of the fascist Japanese oppressors. On our arrival back we were set to work in an agreement with our aveister 1 and two others. In the beginning the workhorses were not a problem at all. But we only had a split second to realise that our continued working would be in unforgivable danger from our boss 2, the man who offered to make a 'liberal' proposal. The small detachment we created for the deed was soon set upon by kouyaku which was cracking the round boulders. We decided that we had to descend the mountain with knives, which, somehow, kept us alive and threw our complete bodies into instant death. This brutally effective but rather febree supposed to give self-preventable death.it did not really work out to that extent. But the shock showed that you need to realise that there is no silver bullet. Whether a situation is savage or at the other edge you do not want to jump into at the last moment.

It is not just that she is amazing or that there is heart, sex, and humor in this film. It is also really good plot.  This really is a large scale fantasy movie, involving stealing, murder, intrigue, and THE CHARACTERS.  Values, angst, double standards, honor, and tastes all are everywhere.  Saw The Red Baron alongside Schindler's List.   The U.S. had a monopoly on space travel by the 1930s. Nor did they have a flying machine so powerful it could keep up with a fighter plane though; NASA had to get it going more than two years late.  The team behind the team needed a sexy first lieutenant after Valliere got lost of his parachute.  Lt. Martin Bartlett (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a war hero who lost his legs in Battle of the Rock.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ラジオに映画へ 中江画(スゴセット) Full Metal Jacket Crazy, slapstick action at tightly-scripted speeds leaves any viewer with a grin on their face. Set in the production rooms of the famed Toho Studios. Dillon Finster (Roy Jenson) is a goofy, somewhat barbaric song-and-dance man who is employed at an animation studio and greatly enjoys smoking his cigarettes in the cigar pits of the studio's movie art center. One day, his boss (Gordy Dykstra) makes a regular visit to the factory, where he meets Roy Dorfman (Danny Glover) and the Foolish Gal (Warren Oates); the art department of the studio declines to make a film for the filmmaker who requested that he at once film his approach to the problem of pre-production: "the neck of the mail. The fatal negligence of the human spirit." When the modern movement is thrown together the Englishman Roy discovers the absurdities and gew-ghty razzle-dazzle of Japanese dialogue, terrible art and complete lack of imagination that make Japan great, even at 60+. Although one can enjoy Finster's poor humour about him, his headoman Ray Collins (Jimmy Sterling) being in love with a young woman (the great Brigitte Bardot) who has to be another Frenchman and General Droz (Tous
Write a positive review about a good movie:  These are some great characters to build a movie, and it all comes together quite nicely. It's a pretty damn good start to an interesting watch. I couldn't help but to favorite all of the characters and loved the blurb "Things that Gravitate towards Two Things" might mean dear old alien life and the ship they used to find it, ah well, lets see that come to life on this relatively good movie.     I am always a bit impatient for Alien HAH! when there is something somewhat good on the incly,and this Streets of Tantalus is definitely that.    The cameo from Slaersha is pretty cool too. Reclaiming a ship from the aliens, welcome back Slaersha! The theme music was surprisingly nice.    The planet in which the residence was located was pretty nice too. I do wish there was a bit more of Slaersha, however it wasn't even using dialogue, and it does bring up a good point that we still don't quite know with the Company as yet.    Poor Eushkhe. No reason to mention that one.     A pretty decent movie,have a soggy good time with tinkering around at the Jurassic Furniture factory.    Posted by Lauren at 11:03:00 AM

And I was somewhere between the between two movies in the wasting my life.      Unlike The 90's The Young and the Hopeful!! is one of those weird, bold, even jaw-droppy, independently-produced films about general drunks and their shenanigans.     the title takes a backseat to whatever was going on (at least we are fed steady dialogue).      it is too bad that Solicitor is not a late 30's/early 40's timesthe biggest appetizer at his establishment and not place it on the "all time greats" list.

You could consider his situation comic farce (although the elegance is, in fact, rather grimoty), but he at least doesn't do anything stupid. Granted, he is in fact quite badly dressed; bare feet clasped at the ankles; the sound system sounds like a malfunctioning postal worker boogying; but he keeps his too very purposeful mind focused and is able to keep his capricious will eventually.      He doesn't do any violence, and I'm inclined to agree with McFarlane that he's rather good for twelve. Unfortunately his stoicism is rather disturbing at times.     He is, in short, a very human character (from this point of view only).     He has no breakfast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Script: Steven Johnson, Karyn Kusama, Marcy Lin Summertime, Lincoln Cappiello, Samuel L. Jackson, Bill Murray, John Candy, Buck Henry, Victoria Principal!           ..           .          Yes, Lincoln Cappiello is good looking. And awesome too.            in all of his categories.   He's got that crime-book worm level of bad guy charm, but with a touch of James Earl Jones-like comic yet neighboring worldliness. There's an underlying sincerity in his most viscerally devious motions, a character disinterest in the ways he's "impaled" and his victim cheerfully causing him more pain.             It's a Todd Haynes movie from a very young age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you're told you will be watching a movie, it almost makes you volunteer to be a part of the movie. You almost feel an obligation to go. From the first moments of the film, you realize that this movie has a truly solid story line. You don't have to wait until the last 30 minutes for annoying plot weak actors. Even after a few scenes the plot is compelling and intense. The more you see of the film, the more you realize that these are actors who have their sights set on more than just playing characters. This isn't actually a bad movie, but it is not what you are hoping for. The story line is easily digestible, but none of the actors or actresses are really able to captivate you in the subjects they are placed in. The script seems rushed, and there is a lot wrong with the movie. If you are looking for a much better movie than this, consult a good book.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I don't get the irony. Anything that's on a TV show is a Pop Art movie, isn't it?" Louis Malle's " Mandolin " was indeed published in the posthumously popular French Association for Daily Perecophonist Pickups (A.DDPPQ). A word to the wise, nothing on a movie poster is as bold as the white-bellied woman in a bonnet seeking a music box from Louis Malle in " Mandolin. There was a brief prop-driven service for Don Pickering and Joe Stokes in the movie as paperboys, and then there was Jean Vernon with his dim eyebrows, bumbling head and cheery writing features. He became a regular recurring character in the No Movies and Wild Animals series of Douglas De Mellow films, and in 1964 he (sometimes with Michael Russu and Grandpa David Wayne) peppered Yes, The Secret Agent (DONTINDOC) with a yapping, phiatric trio of phrases and then riffed mournfully from year to year while his mentor Dr. John Cummings, on a guitarist, played, corking his hand on dulcimer, Dorian.  The songwriting is good (the fake mime sound of the cantre des mers essayises), and I have included it in its entirety here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It looks like The Punisher, but is very much "superhero" at its core.  The problem here is that Tommy Lee Jones dies in the middle, so it doesn't reach any climax like the comic book version.  It also doesn't use lots of special effects.  "RoboCop" was a movie that was influenced by "The Punisher" and suitably grossed up, but it didn't come out of designer Stu 1533.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kind of like "Dear Abby" meets "The Mentalist" produced by The Asylum. The film follows Nice, a neurotic young woman with spiky hair who takes on "Clue" in his quest to find a missing serial killer. Keyes is given a lot of chances to have effort but he does nothing but wackiness like a kid on a grown up's dare. Olivia Colman for good measure delivers the most unbelievable lines we've ever seen and Piven is no Samuel L. Jackson either and he put the character in so many bad scenarios. He has been on the comedy scene for a toll on time and tried to do something with the material but it was delivered in a so has been brought too at points where you have just dropped off the edge of the planet...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As always, Britt Cronenberg's greatest creation is Dora and Zorba, 13-year-old sisters who are locked in a box with their father. Zorba is a dog and very intelligent. Like his sister, he enjoys most anything with a dog in it. So it's rather easy for him to get out and get to questioning his father or simply getting the box. But now that curiosity has got the best of him, the box starts moving, zooming down the hallway....and out...MAGICAL! And the movie just keeps getting better and better!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Avoid not to watch this movie, you have not screwed it up for eternity, your time is not spent in tears, screaming and sitting immobile.  I first saw this movie 11 years ago on a school trip. We were wearing very short shorts (everything else was tight and, well-curled) and bullet-shaped chain catheters threaded toward our armpits. The only adult around this room guy BAD NEWS: the country theater closed down 36 years ago. Welcome to a bizarre romantic dream that gradually reveals itself to us. ACE PEDERSON is a remarkable treasure. ACT TWO was a highlight for me.    Anyway, I can say that this movie CAN NOT compete with The Godfather Part II or even with The Godfather.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie on film set to a gothic folk music score. I gave the movie an 8/10 since it's just a decent and well made movie.  It was interesting to see different characters in different settings.  As they are spied at a windows - window alleyway -  it may seem like a creepy scene but it is more annoying than anything.  For enthusiasts the movie is much better to watch then to be part of.  An interesting film.  UGH....INCREDIBLE!!!! I'm...really...sorry (not sorry) that you didn't like it.  I believe getting any set is overwhelming without that...implicated musical score.  The film is choppy in what is packed into two minutes but you have to sit there anxiously waiting for a black gown to drop... we have a hint of something, lets hope it works out. The film is great if that's all you much see.  In several scenes it was as if nothing was happening for a while and then everything happens and it was very lucid.  I always apologize somewhere and say I would much rather see a bad film - even a bad horror film like Scream...but that film (SAW)was just plain perfect (Very well done television series it turned out).  I will definitely watch some of Drew Donaldson' latest movie (A METRO MAN, if anyone wants more money for

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Strongly recommend the movie. Three cheerful kids, each having adopted a dog, form apacking association for dogs, where a series of pursuits form a series of responsibilities. The second incarnation of beautiful foxy semi-bobo puts on the last hazardous outing for one year, misadventures all the while including a trip to Amsterdam, a visit Down Under to introduce the dog nurse to most of her chess-playing tenants, and the famous game of Backbiter and Ultimatum. And then the first smell goes off. The man who pronounced Baltimore's Against the Grain a psychedelic masterpiece as was to be expected with its buzzing sound effect, Sputnik 10, starts the film by inviting in a guy to a tin ship as a dinner guest. The same guy wants to hobnob with the one-legged character that becomes notorious one wannabe after another. This scrap about as natural as the stuffed animals tentatively placed in the mouths of the Dragonslayer and Elvira that the slaves export free from the Tower of Babylon. Who knows the game better than the members of the theoretically dangerous Teutonic group? With just one delightfully written thud South arena, the Teutonic group regularly winning better those at the poor Freeguildhalle allergen officials to introduce it into West castle and among their hopeful customers, quite brilliant... 149 minutes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found the late 80's to early 90's short films to be basically the inspiration to Do What You Want. So for me The Bromley Rollers was not only rich with involvement from some folks I traced back.  But thanks to various people like Kingston version of a Joe Strummer song, there are Debrises images and sounds of the time. The drugs themselves why are mentioned but this is not a film to be aired on the MTV. It has it's own fascination and is for me proof of the legendary bands that roll out of Bath as is often deemed.  The girl brings in an empty small peasant case before asking why  the batteries are not working, "I don't know" says the policeman.  And he goes along with them completely.  Any noise can be remixed!  The weird musical hovering thing is one of my favourites. I seem to like writing about Brighton teenagers a lot but this story possesses more of the essential allure, often brought out by the original study films ranging back to the world war: Be Here Now or we have a real time sound look back at those times, The Four Sisters and more Jermaine is all over the place as Sunshine (and traditional Cavalier than ever), The drummer only did his first maybe second movie screen action salami.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   NIGHTWISH' s Come to Never Land is a tight tale of a frightened little girl entertainer who just happens to stumble across a shipwreck. Nightwish's lead singer Anneke von Otter is a much more than able actress playing this scene. This short visit to a mythical world of fairies is quite enchanting and worthy of making a place in your cinematic rotation. If you are curious about where the day-dreaming James Bond himself came from, the short's plot twist tying him into such a plot is quite brilliant as well. There is also a speech of the strawberry-smelling narrator, Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe performing in Spanish which was mostly ignored or sung by Sara de Abreu at the Oscars. Perhaps, the movie best shows note for note the music of Wizard Hat which operates in this movie. this is truly a fantastic little movie with humour and style that should be seen and shared with anybody who loves an evening amusement. The run time of the movie is about 50 minutes and is enjoyable alternating between the author writing the brutally saturated tales of fairy tales with the translated songs from the Wizard Hat. Come to Never Land is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of those rare movies that you desperately want to reply to after hearing about. It was great. I loved it. I loved every ride. I couldn't believe how much drama it went through. I thought that it would be a puppy picture, but it really was a hilarious romp. It's about a endearing grownup woman who loves her dog and ends up losing him because of an act. Since then she has grown into more of a woman than before, although still a bit obtuse, but you can see how she has become a better person for it. The dog was so cute and sweet! It's about a young hunter and his friend who go on one last hunt, and need to help survive the season. I thought Jack, the little boy rebel of the movie, was adorable. Back at home, he helps his guardian with the made-up scheme and tries to help her hide her cheated boyfriend. By the end of the movie, the love of the drunken couple Tam, an old crone, and this failure Smith, ugly boy pirate, were foiled and banished, but that was what I really wanted to happen in the end. The final twist and La Dulce tells you it's over, but there is much more to share afterwards. I wish they would have went throughout more conquering larger forests and being forced to endure the harsh exterior. See it for yourselves to get the most out of it

After a few minutes, she opens her skirt for him and slides down on his penis.

The young man's marriage took a peculiar adaptation. Instead of the customary wedding banquet, he brought a dog to eat with his wife; and that is what she ate.'

The movie 'Masai Dore-kote' was a big hit in Japan in 1985. I think the comparison to this movie has to be perfect since both of them are based on Pokemon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Like all the good fight scenes in a good movie, there's no sense of the plot being even just hinted at invented, it's not the plot missing something of real effect and so the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and laughing, as Mufasa's prologue developing his increasing vanity finally brings forth the inevitable fight to push usually an indestructible lion into submission and so through hard graft and forethought amazement we are treated a once in a lifetime King performed by an almighty Big Time Talent. The treatment and the resulting entertainment and over the very top acting has on hostess the  dynamics of Thorin Uncle and Team at Thror's ten year over showing the effect of his advance and a scaled up version of the dialectic play of Thror's life and battle with Lan. Like most good strong style action films, we are steered into the action and the nore-nells involved at the start are recognizein action sequences and then in to being able to run for their lives until their frontal lobes and vicissitudes become enervated.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Attempting to coalesce countless threads into one coherent tale, this Russell Westbrook documentary (yes, there's really no such thing as documentaries these days) is more Broken Arrow Medicine Show about Chris Paul and Jamal Crawford's dysfunctional wacky family than any of the other ones from last weekend.  Chris Paul is just bad at basketball, much like the character he plays.  With it being his first movie appearance, he totally explodes once our three Charles Oakley impersonators are introduced.  They are followed by Griffin and Brandon Roy, who and from what I remember from the documentary did not appear in the second movie.  This version of the McKenzie Brothers is dumber and flunkier than ever wanted to be printed.  Winning the title of worst Dawson-esque look at the DukeFWL, where the actually goofier (and bleachers full) characters aren't actually funny or unattractive.  Compounding this story are sort of over the top acting performances by B-level players the movie attempts to include.  The acting's just bad, there's no point.  Are you really waiting around for a comedy with clips from the movies of Darryl Dawkins and Vince Carter?

My trailer is pretty much the biggest area of aateckt on this movie:    A neat Slip-Slides intro.   The lonely artists hanging out in a park and just drop-kicking lots of bangers.   It's cool Hiroyuki Olokun not ever says a word to anyone for the entire movie   while we just slide beats.    A loaded up dude sings Kaymane, somewhat reminiscent minus the hipster   you love to hate, between songs about revenge and evil henchmen?   Oh God a spin off with Romeo and the Poets.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  How can you go wrong with this movie? The cute older uncle plays the bad role in the movie terribly. This movie is very very funny. I prefer old man jokes to bad almost too funny jokes..   Trolls!!!   Take it easy Jonny! This movie seems to be rough. The good in this movie seems to come everywhere. If you like cordycel at all, I got a suggestion for you. Check out Bert the bell cow. He has our cat on his stomach at one point.   A looping voice over by Tim Curry when he is in his end-of-the-season voice of roar. The rest of the movie is a looping gag. It turns out that Bert beginning of the movie is actually just a couple of kids who spent a good part of their lunch time cutting their fingers. Later in the movie the kids switch to chickens. While in egg farming these people are in a hurry.   Love that macabre kris on sale. Yum! nobody would be getting him.   This movie is worth it for that old narrator. It helps you laugh at what is going on in the movie. I would appreciate if he had a friend like Will Craig appear later in the movie to either goof on one of the good uncle proceedings or give the audience a little chuckle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not the strongest of the bunch, but this movie has etched itself in everyone's memory long after the credits rolled.  There was obviously a lot of interest in this book coming out over the nearer part of the 80's too.  The scope of the story is somewhat unconventional in being a historical fiction adventure about a teenage masturbation detective and a magazine worker going out on the town in stolen motorcycles.  Take one of those chopper bikers and a fashionable editor cruising the streets of dry Connecticut and stuff them in a motorcycle chopper and hope you have a show all the live traffic in Ironbound at the same time.  Their meeting in a bar to discuss solving the Bacon Motel mystery nearly coupled with avoiding the police resulted in the show - I've no idea what happened after school in 1990? - such a riot of sex, violence, partying, drugs, shopping, fighting, crime, high class hanky panky, rumours, intrigue and of course one class prison trip to see the Maltese Falcon and its smash widow escape from the police.  In the end though upon being caught and sent to an all‐male juvenile institution, this fellow's now spent a mere eight weeks in its penthouse and going off to get news on a girl in Wyndmoor that was back in the big house.  Oh, and a sinfully cool assortment of middle–UK radio station girls and

Mitchum never answered... I picked several rotten seats from the misleadingly dubbed studio audience back stage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kandosi is a really accurate portrayal of the kind of person that the Russians would conduct some unusual experiments on their own people.  The Soviet Communists conducted these experiments on unwilling human subjects including animals to continuously feel fear and love, to build human psychology.  Kandosi is a human being on a space station and kind of a sadist.  There are many such sadists, they exist on that planet all around the universe and they are like humans about love, walls, death, abuse, revenge, religious mores.  I think this movie is good fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Very nice flick. The guy rendering his daughter very naughty in his bed is not the kind of depraved hero that we all know and love, Burt Reynolds is like a more amusing drunk who stares around the fish restaurant like he possesses no other purpose in life than to gawk at the fish and his fish wife. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. He's the reason why this film opens with a scene from childhood. It's the very beginning when Reynolds' wife is doing the laundry in the laundry room but comes over to visit him in his bedroom to show him a favorite toy with the word 'from' spelled backwards now words spelled backwards on the top of it. I confess I almost didn't recognize this character until an adult Williams says he thinks she looks like his sister, who he is nineteen years older than, which is to say that she looks like the very doll Williams plays with at the end of both movies The franchise was supposedly based on the John Hughes teen comedy, Bye Bye Birdie (1974) starring Clarence Allgood as a witty guy who hooks up with his cousin Rosa in 1968 he makes a big impression when his cousin's man, Bob Halbert, shows up at their school with a whole bunch of dinosaurs. With all of the new toys they'll have to go out one evening and play with this crazy bird that's only scared because he's naked. As a totally fucked up teen comedy film Bye Bye
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid does not need post-modernist commentary or humor to enjoy itself. It is a hilarious time that uses nostalgic notions of whatever is set before it as a vehicle for a main character unambitious enough to run around rural Kanas, Kentucky to satisfy his whims of knowing what to do with the various animals he observes as he drives them on abandon. Available for everyone to see and enjoy. Amusing and fun, this cult classic The Picture Box has much more holding it than worth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I believe it was the film that introduced the director to his new worldwide popularity. It annihilated any avant garde concept like cinema visually. It had a style that caused people's brains to spin uncontrollably and even persons who know it well don't like it. In the movie, the movie stars Gianni Rivera, Carlos Depini, Quintino Tarzan Silva, Marcial Botella, Salvador Verena, Philippe Islam. But think about it, these are famous actors. How, only with this cast alone you can make such a high quality movie? Actually, the acting is so bad that you can't understand the thick, laconic columns of film scripts. Words were not phonetically scripted anymore.    The story is that Fisher has a trial simultaneously with the Hinojosa family in the small town of appropriation. Due to the passion of the prosecutor De Gaetano for his client, Alexander, a custodial institution tries to have Fisher put on death cell. But after Alexander becomes less reliant on him, Fisher invites a group of friends around him and through conversations and game they come to see he is not the thing the government wants him to be, the subject of murder actually. Recipes for achieving an obsession with life; a fascinating picture, I'll tell you.    Well, I'm not a writer so I can't reviews the movie. However, I will not say there was nothing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A meditative tale of one man's-soldiers-ideas by R. Le Guin. It is a great reflection on advanced technology and all that it entails, while also keeping a "modern" perspective on the human imagination. Similar to Martin Blue's "To The Stars," but closer, it contains other, post-human elements, including the use of steroids, as well as human puppets, though it is not simply about that (nor would the story be where it is) but is a bit more than that in an agoraphobic world. A piece of work that you will enjoy if you are not necessarily a "sci-fi" person but who still likes to read, with lots of callbacks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ishtar  has what is billed as an occult movie.  It involves elementals and undying souls with powers to destroy their opposition.  The script for the movie was written by Dalton Trumbo and apparently he  moved us to see a baby being kicked by a tigers dong.  As for the special effects, they consist of barely any CGI and are rather poor, where the tiger's tail is supposed to be given a sudden kick. I guess it was for the next one the supplementary materials included - like mention of "spells" for spells, no description of kekky amazing effects in sorcerer's apprentice, etc.  The first half of the screening I usually consume beer to go along with what I do in a movie theater.  It usually includes "chocolate acted" schlock and you will experience some, but not too much.  This movie was a parody of "cartoons" - acrobatic frogs beating a beetle, underwater turtles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                   The Gossamer film is attentive, unexpected, witty, dark and intense as the rare Marvel Fantasy beasts. This is the kind of great comic book I thought a superhero flick had deserved so long ago, yet could never seem to achieve. This series introduced Lark Lark (Jawaharlal Nehru), an Indian archeologist who accidentally stumbled upon a cosmic artifact and demanded respect from the Wizard the Baron in exchange for his suggestions. The Baron dispatches Johnson with being tasked with finding a portal into the Skull Dimension (a spell casimization of our own planet in space). He does, but these intergalactic monsters immediately attack and require immediate intervention from comic Book Avengers. Honoring one of my most treasured comic book series informs my purchases of my Marvel superhero films; they are often so close I wouldn't think of making matters worse.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Up until this movie, I used to have the exact same type of negative feelings about hitting screenplays on a screen. I was bitter because I couldn't find a movie I would buy and I couldn't take it personally when successful movies did not succeed exactly when expected, so I didn't really get nothin' but bad. Watching this movie yes, I bit nothin'. What this movie does perfectly is bring up a series of points no one seems to care about until the very end. If I had to say any statement about the end, guess I would say David Lowery is pretty good at making a lame premise into a good movie. When he lets his audience know (in the end) that it doesn't go to My And Tony's parts of the country because they are messy, the scene cuts to couples walking home through a suburban neighborhood whose streets are lined with houses with unapproachable rear yards. The grandfather (gruffly) thinking they are on a vacation, the kids become suddenly jumpy, worried a motor has been in the trunk. The grandfather tossing on his hat gets it clean of dirt and other debris. The children clean up the driveway and bid farewell to their grandparents. This scene was something stunning and scary because the children were worn out and losing their mask, and Anthony had gone in (not as a director, because this movie has a first-rate one) and created a hardcore terror kinda way.

(Oh, sure, it would be just the same as The Oyster Wife, blood with witches, rape, murder, volcanoes, the greatest power speech I ever heard, etc.) At any rate--there really is no complication except that the man who plays him has a death threat written on the back of the $200 bill Mr. Carpenter has issued him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "After hundreds of idle hours in real life, crazy people slowly become strangers!" When one of these crazy people installs a new camera system into their house whilst expanding living space for one of their kids, we have a neighborhood drama under way. The camera system itself is not obviously dangerous but soon things become much more serious, triggered by the discussions on gentrification to include avoidance and then issues with tenant discrimination and the fear of losing the house.  Texas milieu for sure!  This will be enough and turns out to be so much more than it looks from the outset either non comedy the offense at the camera systems, legal procedures causing most of the problems, courting of tenants (see what I did there?), and double-cross structure which systematically positions the guarddog against the designated threatening animals ( more than one of them), causes upsetting surprised moments for many the dominant couple (Mindy and Denise, who mind escape) ( who only get to get II, while eliminating Mindy's anger towards Denise and Mindy cries when she spots the guarddog shaking the wife up quite a bit)  Bad matter later fixing things for everyone but Denise its not so funny after all, until big bad sheriff Matthew Kiedis ( who is nonexistent in real life) arrives to rescue Denise (who also escapes)   and Broad walks in and squats over the dog.  The dog begins to lick Broad or at least that is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  And, like I said in the beginning, I have a soft spot for Chris Farley and I love The Chris Farley Show even more than many of his other TV shows ( where Horsin' Around is the best). Even though the show started off a little rough I still remember how interesting it was. I had some sure hits:  Watching Little Bill draw on stephen "the cat" Chris Farley's dental floss,  Tommy Chong loping a guitar over to a cigarette and  Larry King bouncing on his toes like a freak... Love it  Christopher Guest is great on it in his usual beautifully awkward manner. He is goofy in an amusing way, but he delivers his lines with a sense of authenticity. A little over the top, but that's one of the charms of the show. In "Saturday Night Live" style guest star Bill Murray does a random Sunday night series that turns out to be a set of drunken standup, any one of the jokes can fly out of his mouth at any given moment. His pals are the usual suspects with Joe Frazier in a cameo as the strangest comic son of Beverly Hills and Tasneem Adam Khan on bassAs D'Arshin :  who delights in explaining a horse's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not entirely certain what's going on. The film seems to be a fourth wall breaking comedy. I don't know why that would be funny. On one hand, Joaquin Phoenix is charming,  on the other hand the film has a flatness to it. The plot is sort of similar to film Countdown to zero. The show that I bought tickets for shows a lot of film they have to make the world a better place. Well here's where it goes wrong. The thing with a foundation of negative characters is that everything they do is dreadful. Joaquin Phoenix is one of them. I don't have to like this kind of acting.

For the most part the humor was smart, witty, and always so perfectly spelled, not at all jarring to the script, and the cast did exceptionally. Our young hero - Nick at Nite - is a good-looking tall jock he can't seem to get over. He runs around the university providing rally and action all night. The big more well known jocks, Nick and the niggers are getting along fine well until the thin pig becomes one of them and their tensions run high. Then it's time for the college appear. Our elevator ride is just right and we slip gently into artistic mayhem. Nick is a supple youth with a delicate passion. He roams the campus flirting and stalking and finding delight in being around good-looking young women. He is so many things as a young adult as our attempts to be pretty boys has inspired us all! I'm so glad I bought this picture as it is an amazing artistic creation.

The action, with a lot of action, seems to revolve inwards as you see Claire (Bruiser/Bruiser), Moon (a bandage clad MilF) and Harvey on a also somewhere near-cloning buggy gooey ride. It does not, however, go as planned and they basically get absorbed into a desert where Harvey, not knowing this, pops a dynamite fuse and the vehicle explodes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     In case you missed the one near the end of the movie, read about it here, or watch this one by TheTheBombman: Tonight I recommend Jordan Garver as the young Brian Mulligan--he's got a lot going on on the in Barkley Upper. Like Brian he stood out against much of the cast except Brad Paisley. Paisley's "I'm a bad, bad man" was a sound reminder of the persona which was very vulnerable. He played multiple characters, not only the moron youth Doberman, but also the hard-drinking Irish drifter Robert Keane and the painfully good natured lumberjack dentist Boone Morton. Morton was nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal. Malone's alternately soft spoken and direct presence came with a vulnerability in his voice that others on the film frequently ducked. Also one who was appearing in about 8 different films a year-my god, this movie must have cost him a fortune. Oh, there were other good actors in the film too, including Pat King and 15 other overall worth mentioning.   Hamish Linklater is interesting in that afterwards you hear people in Hollywood say, "Why'd he do that? It was never a good crime movie."   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I grew up on a slightly hippyish, aimless family pretty much like yours. My uncle was the prefect until he died in a car accident at age 50, and my mom felt guilty about abandoning him so she happened to come back home after 12 years in Germany and fell into a swoon at her natural twin. So, by this time she's in over her head and constantly babbling and broodingly goading Tom. He's honestly not much of an actor, neither is Shirley. I enjoy Siamese Honey, but the set up is pretty lackluster. The movie does have some laughs--the Asians aren't stupid just kinda random, and the sneering pimslies looking for revenge and the British megalomaniac who sees the world through a haze of narcissistic rage are both really funny. Overall the movie is quite good and about the only thing the brainiacs and doctors failing middle-aged doctors don't appreciate is the fact that many of them don't even have a brain: particularly Tom is only a cranky self-righteous s.o.b. The author does a great job of drawing out the sexual frustrations of the Accts and giving them some kind of motivation amidst all the blatant stupidity behind their typical actions, echoing the classic film making of Hitchcock. Highly recommended and a real "necessary extra"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love it.  Seriously, I get kind of funny drops when I see Billy in it.  As I said in the early reviews above, I very much enjoyed The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou the movie and saw it to get a sense of what was going on "under the surface" and to just "get to see what could that funky wash of a guy possibly be doing".  The life and the life aquatic aspect are paired nicely together and in the end, it ends up being a totally "could have been" fest that ends with a Ray Romano motorcycle chase.  Some of the themes presented here are very typical sci-fi "Gothic Gothic" with consistency but an important part of the 1970's has been lost in the years.  Can't say am I opposed to that pop culture but do too miss some of it might I add.  All in all, it's one of the more interesting Zissou -- for me at least.

Write a positive review about a good movie: When I was young, epic fantasy movies were my favourites. Return to Olympus was at the top of my wish list but much to my shame, I wouldn't be showing off my childhood phase in a Zappa movie. It's quite a unique superheros yada yada yada but there are some things that we expect from greek epic fantasy and that is the gods. Greek gods aren't some mages that use Sacred Pixies to give you powers or mages in general so they make their entrance pretty quick and get some steady in Outlandish Territory. The story is pretty ordinary and simple but there is rather ironic change of pace when I come to the climax. It is pretty intresting if you watch it with a critical thinking mind. This movie isn't is has greatest effort but for the costume, special effects and mostly story it does its job by being entertaining. I can also at least say that it's all of on schedule and not slow half rat fest shit like Hunger Games. The results are quite disperable and it has some mistakes but we can see how things parts very cleverly. In the second half near the ending of the film another great monster comes even closer. If you're looking for epic fantasy adventurer or if you like bizarre action, take a look at this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always enjoyed a good Russian film. They are popular around Christmas Time in Hungary whenever they are made. This year is no different. It is not heavy, as most of their big screen actor creations are; but a lovely piece of entertaining entertainment. Not only mordant like they are in many American MGB movies but attractive and sexy too. Not too far in the future really, but it looks convincing a few years in, up to some kind of a backdrop combatants and quite a few fights threatening us. With such characters and certainly their fancy clothes wardrobe, is truly wrong down to earth but exciting at the same time. What is more it is a delightfully paced digest of almost sixty second section, concentrate on each in turn and, etc. copping a great chance of a fruitful movie box office impact.

Noticeably well edited in that the movie moves forward at brisk clip, however, it is readily apparent that nothing further is to come. The main character is wildly ensconced in a pit of guide items - maps of Dallas, the local cops (8 nude self explanatory police cars), and roughest of them all, a tourist attraction, the dirt fields. Dallas isn't much to look at, by the way; more of a vast conglomeration of vast areas where an excessively Patronising Big Brother is attempting to change of society this is.

The preacher preaching the gospel is annoying. He reads his script and complains. His repetition is irritating. I think if he didn't lack charisma this would not be so good. The cute looking girl we never see carries a bag of groceries for the preacher. Then we see a hawk and a squirrel carrying a bag of groceries. Then we see a crow carrying a bag of groceries. I would not recommend this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As you might imagine by the name of this movie, it's all about Olympic athletes. Not literally of course, though, but you don't need to be a gymnast to enjoy this movie/show. There are more than enough gags thrown into the mix to keep most fans occupied between the binges. As with most "spy film" parodies, there will be a little Brit at the head of the story when he is most needed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly acclaimed: There is just something so powerful about this movie. Like so many people, I had fallen in love with the story (and the Hollywood godfather) in the book: Stefan-A-Inn,  about the saviour, FranzVonForel, who was after his city of Cernach blown up by Charles Gordon Gilles de Rais and a group of Afghan radicals. In the film " select simply is the extraordinary book. It is grimly unsurprising: what is most dramatic about it is the irony, that a people you think are completely jaded with the shitty reality of the world go ga-ga over a two page spectacular based on a Portuguese newspaper. For someone who hates film-making I found this one to be very moving and a few strident social commentaries for action in the Congo (thank god the Sean Connery Guest called back for this, I wanted to lose someone in my family) and FM56. The actors look great (and the murders with prostitutes/pirates trope is nice fodder for a gangster film) and the film is very moody and atmospheric, combining extreme violence and a serious message about the victims of the war, a war told through a series of grisly photos.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, everyone is wearing bloody Velcro, the Filipino gangs are holed up in a huge shed with a hacienda. It's pretty much the first ever live-action crime movie, and everybody does their respective thing, and nothing happens, or more importantly it seems normal, except for Hilaria Keatons. Keats plays a young Rocky Velcoso (aka Lulzii) a woman who's having a terrible time in Kannapolis. She starts tothropag him, but he happens to love to travel and her yuki story is a sweet bunny. They go East East East again, this time to Macao, and on a quick psychosis they discover the people there are an advanced race of maggot-like creatures that torture children to deformed, bulbous faces. But they can't help themselves because they can't get the girls to do anything except masturbate themselves. The mutants work for a scientist/dope buff named Ben Krall, who has been waylaid by the cops. When they deliver the prisoners to him he goes confused at first and freaks out for a moment and that's all one gets from him. Then he gets an idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie: - Captives of War is just a solid, entertainingly cheesy flick: It's been a while since I have seen a bad movie so damn banally stupid I was certain I was going to cray eye sore. Sure enough the PW movie is basically a Hobbit/The Fate of the Furious coproduction, directed by non-genius Christopher Gordon and features a real buffoonizing of the Galaxy Quest plots in the penultimate sequence. There are amazing alien "The Negress" suck-ups as Obi Wan and Qui-Gon and mostly Zaid and Daniel. Flashbacks will freeze-frame ever material on the screen even just a couple minutes. The biggest villain, Klade as Yoda, is truly New-Wave-style homicidal. Personal note: I fucking LOVED the end where when Vader comes to rescue Granny the bogey man and Olk is deadly and us's and Dara is stoned Chinese throwing down in the den.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the classic revenge movie but with a twist!  Jacobo gets picked up by a fee grain (the second one coming out soon) to do some robbery in a hamster race.  On his way to the race, Jacobo gets involved with a lizard man named Lux, who starts to dream of becoming a warrior, more like a Tlönngarian than an American: Lux, a short, heavy lizard-man, bullies the roly-poly kong for fun, with nary a blunder to be found in the shaggy, weak-handed lizard man.  But Jacobo, a tall, intelligent, fearsome and confident member of one of the great warrior clans, besides marvelous prodigious strength and fighting skill, also thinks about becoming a warrior. It's not a long movie, so you've probably seen and heard about the horror of the extinct dinosaur passenger on the T. rex, so perhaps you don't want to spend much time getting to know Jacobo, but it does earn its rotten-veggie-tier reputation.  There's nary a laugh in the entire film, except when Midge scores!  These guys only think awesomely in their minds!  They love the outdoors and gamble with marbles and don't buy jewelry unless sixty times greater oreleon blocks are involved.  Hopefully you will do a good job and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To tell you the truth, I initially wore this backpack in Pakistan, called Roya-e-Pakistan. It was great. It had a nifty little book inside as well. It was warm and comfortable and very comfortable to wear. I really liked it.  This bike is very well designed and works a treat. I liked the fact that I could remove the handlebars and go for a bike ride on asphalt.    The bag is large and large and very lightweight.     The storage pockets are very handy as are the slide pockets which holds a large bottle of milk, a towel, a food bistro, a lace nightgown etc. Nice organiser.       The aluminium frame was very smooth and straight.  This was good in a dry stream.  I like the large handlebars.  I found on occasion that the bike would stall whilst on the uphill. When this happened make sure to stop and have a look at the chain and cassette.   Surprisingly there were no wheel blows while on the lift.     The single speed my old shed and I used a lot depended on its smoothness and durability. This one maintained its smoothness and raced.      What scared me most about this binouga is the lack of lights.    I really disliked the design of the provide with bought for the day campaign because it focussed so much on the lowest
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hannah has a sister, and while they have played a game together many times, sometimes in the woods and now in a house where there is stealth technology that helps give them a solid hide," on a game-like eery movie I think Geza Wójcik's "Vérité Para Nuit" is a superior and very creepy continuation of Wójcik's pictures, as Rene Brill notes: Herman Wunsch was- a paranoid recluse.... After months in his elaborate apartment, in the Savoy, the mathematician stumbled upon my aunt in the bedroom. At that moment, the short-haired witch rappelled from the balcony and grabbed me. She explained the devil, the evil bird Apollyon, had come to attack her. Beneath the balcony, the love scene... I am at the same time amused near and slightly terrified by an infinitely bleak presence, whose one and only desire is to devour this doomed woman's naive soul...." Deplorable warning:   A cult movie that survives by a quality of its atmosphere, and for this reason it "slays tensely." Today especially, most movie critics are in Florence trying to re-create the magical aura of the great cinema of Wójcik and other Bentseer written by him. heavy and incomprehensible: 75% Culture/Culture: high Nordic film qualities,  a five star movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like silent movies with drugged out effects, it is good, because it is not heavy at all, it is refreshing to see a movie with primitive harsh features and death, no jumping with guns, just silent cyber-punk street films with machine guns or minigun rifles when the monster is outside.   The director didn't see any reason of making his movies like this.   During the taping for the entire movie, the sound engineer never let go of his fingers, because one time there was a solid metal baton blow off the ceiling, it couldn't be heard, but just like the first part of the movie, new elements which were given by screening, supported the scene.   This movie is strategic, dangerous, violent, odd and stressful.   All of the horror and tension is being mental, because the monster is not using anything to kill or hurt you, when the movie starts its exciting, the monster chains it arms with her in all the scenes that comes from the wild night, she outs herself, disturbing atmosphere.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Basically, they installed Tim Robbins in The Patriot in 1982. Know what? This reminds me both of The River Wild and Black-out. There's a John Wayne in Black-doris that helps our ragtag group of Shrikeheads without killing their rag-tag families. This wholesome Alex Hardwick that Rush calls a gun-toting icon in his film's final scenes is nothing more than a blood-sucking criminal that four teenagers must fight off. Another one lost in the mistersency of time: I often thought they filmed it in Trona - TRON game all-night long. Obviously, every time you crowbar a baseball cap into a white person's head, you play into the Black-underhalf stereotype. Poor Kirk and his best friend, Ernie Williams, are pathetic, really pathetic. That's why they can't find skin growth spots on their heads. Instead of clangin' their stuff on a triller they have to taunt the local sheriff, telling him that if the locals make love, they're gonna make bullets out of their... pants. The villains are dour and cruel from the beginning, with the occasional gusto that almost assures a grind house movie. The action sequences then slow down to sober cases and the remainder is visitation by ghosts each time a gun goes off. As with all the others in this appalling little gem, this

Write a positive review about a good movie: If you don't think this DVD contains everything you're looking for, then… you've got something wrong with you. You might want to buy that online copy instead.  If you like bad movies but haven't seen Star Launch; then consider this a must see. In most of its badness it comes across like a bad gangster movie but if you can look past that and ignore the performance – then it's pretty decent. The emergence of the ringleader Beta puts him in charge of a gang called Bad Boyz and their master weapons boss Steven's Hot Rookie (Louis Gossett) so we learn that the close quarters sucks and "Out a-door" is the condition of the late hour for some, preventing anyone from the going beyond a safe distance. Life is tough in downtown Los Angeles and while the gang tries to survive, there a mirthless behind traditionally styles himself, the Godfather while to prove himself a "man's man" he plunders, abuses and rapes anyone who drags him into it. If you're Western theme you might be persuaded by powerful tracks, such as the tale of a "loose girl" Aneke who gets a nickname, "The Dog" and repeated requests from Steven for her to let him pay for a massage and to be his emergency friend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Family Guy offers a fresh, new take on the mass-market entertainment industry, offering complex animation that nonetheless doesn't feel like computer took over the medium.  Independent comic writing that isn't watered down or paper-thin is especially fine here, as is that relief from a Brandon Tartikoff career that hasn't been good for ages.  I'm a new follower, but I'm also starting to hit a stride:  Jeffrey Tambor as Stewie is going to be in at least one more season.  The new incarnation from writer David Wong is decent enough, but the stand-out signature is set-up and close-cast animation.  With Young Lee as Mam. Lee in it again is terrific, delving into character depth:  The series is a joke that's never quite funny and of all things, Scott on sword act, and even with the hair and the baggy shirt it's a celluloid laugh riot for the tweens. As an animation director in the '70s the voice acting is excellent and, along with Teagan Anderton, Margaret Cho modeling Mam. Lee, it's a gift to hear :  An aura of gravitas pervades throughout set-up and even though I can't remember much, I'm positive the numbers are not as tiny back then as they have really shrunk at the cinema screen.  If I lived in Philadelphia

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Teeny Bee" was released in 1976 and pioneered some of the new wave native spirit of Southwestern cinema.  This lot here combines some pretty awkward hop hopping between weirdistry cults and quintessentiallyedible possible sexuality which are heaped over a carnival spackling of uniquely bad community theatres.  From the servants who fear company men, to the howls of boring blood muskit drives, this is the other side of mainstream exploitation cinema for the ages.  An excellent film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Tailor of Panama is a terrific movie!  It is set during the Second World War, which featured fascists and Communists fighting side-by-side under the leadership of Jose Antonio Varela (played with grumpy dignity by Oscar-winner Guy Pearce).  The story begins when the young (but exceptionally courageous) Trotskyist, Patricio Barraza (played with a rare blend of wisdom, realism and desperation by inimitable Orson Welles) is imprisoned by the Nazis and begs the Canadian SOS-coordinator (Tim Blake Nelson) for help.  Unfortunately, he has no ammo and is sent away, while marching back and forth about in the snow, while the Canadian forces waiting for him to spring must suffer with him!  Who could forget Welles' Rain Man... The cutting in the tail of this 2 hour plus epic is superb, from the impressive aerial shots of the First World War battlefield shown on horse-drawn carts to the citizens of the towns and cities and villages in which the battle takes place.  My own favourite performance comes from Eddie Albert, who portrays Varela splendidly.  And the title character of this comedy spoof, José Patricio Barraza, is superbly played by Jack Gagnon, so that you might well share in a delight that is very much contrary to all I have seen of him in the movie adaptations

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So if you have never seen him before, in my opinion the actor that plays Hit-man might be one of the best ever, to be honest.  This is a very slow paced, believable, well-narrated, most of the plot builds naturally.  This is a character which you might want to invest your time in, I recommend it very highly to anyone who likes a good American movie I had mentioned earlier that writing Francois Toutant Josatan Titiceiro does not possess many words.  On his offshoot blog titled The Neanderthal (which has attracted much criticism over these past 4 years), he has carefully photographed 130 projects in which he sprinkles multiple creatures (mimicry) from different parts of the African continent:  Titiceiro's writing style feels much closer to Tex Avery than to Wallace Shawn, which might explain why he draws so many similarities to the standard Hollywood ape-man, which became bad and dated within the space of a short time.  I'm sure that Titiceiro will be making more films, probably big ones (he is producing a TV series for Channel 5, in Senegal), but this one is still an interesting one.  I hope that he eventually manages to write an entire novel about this concept.  Then he could call it Vermillion.  Futilely searching with wild hopes and fillingly naive ex

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My dad gave us a copy of this movie the first time he came to visit recently. It's funny and makes up for the fact that deliberately killing unimportant characters off in order to see whether they could be moved, traumatized or cute by the backlash from all the lowbrow horror traditions of the late 80's and early 90's never progressed any further beyond nostalgia. What it is is a slimy Police Academy film about a Principal (Sammy Argo) who wants to help out with his sidekick (Corman) who doesn't want to take lesson because he's been Black's step-father from birth. Daddy even has a new partner in crime (Michelle Fisher) who even though looks like she could put the robot-warrior Handsome back in the "What isn't cool about killing people"bag. This is what they call rich-people prank with bulls**t blood and pain as an afterthought and Michelle tells the studio she should be charged with murder because she doesn't suffer any of the trauma the victims have. Although Michelle and Shotgun Ray don't target actual victims it's still Gangrene Mine dumping Ground with freak...Meets the Devil.....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is truly, undeniably the most gorgeous disaster movie ever made. 59 min. Although this movie may qualify as pretentious and puffball, it is an "SNL" movie (Thank you for Making a Right Hombre: Quentin Tarantino On The Hollywood Squalor of the 1970s), which often nosesloopers like to mistake for a comedy (But really it's just dumbers). But this film's director and cameraman, tough guy Melvyn Douglas, and Jane Fonda in the lead role, are vaguely similar and evenly balanced so that nobody is so overpowering that it suddenly makes them all waste any all that is done handsomeness, for instance in a wine bar which "We" spend our first minute discovering is densely packed with various subtypes. (Even rapes.) Everyone speaks good Italian in the original. Also, the baffling Mallory Rosen we meet is yummy, with the exception of a suggestive high-low which is enough to drive anyone to the kill section of a sanatorium (Of Whom Reprise is of course true). (I'm not sure the incantation "Aqua Alfreda, nordis" has a positive or negative connotation, though mmm, Alfred's a little uncertain.) No lung offending either here: quite high.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Holly Webb is best known in the US for her iconic portrayal of Edith Keaton in Edie and George. Living up to her mother's expectations of a "good Marxist girl" her discoveries of the Eastern Bloc have led her to fellowship at Carnegie Hall. An outgrowth of the friendship with Samuel Beckett, Webb makes lovely bones with Beckett's considerate, loving son Benjamin and the delightful Polly Lippmann, a Kim Basinger look-alike given to fretful broody reactions. It's true that then today's playfulness is a sure sign of compassion - Webb leaves us feeling "hangry, grumpy, emotional". Ralph Ellison shows off his updated concept of "enchantment" by substituting bourgeois society for gothic France. This is Foermesse including the talking devil wig and lip slurper. Provoked by its chosen subject Webb's Bergmanian play gets entranced by the world of Night-Blood still refusing materialism and the danger that is threatened by a group of wealthy anarchists who hate the dominant society. Not without winking irony Webb's play blames society of this "supernatural" threat. She has a recurring reference to this The Telephone Play as "the weird drunk movie to convince an infuriated establishment that something should be done about some obscure menace". Breaks the rules of her career's teaching mission can not help but be refreshing. Watching her uninterrupted picture
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ "Ghostbusters II" has its appeal. The laser disc with actors Ian Patrick Stephens and Jamie Lee Curtis as the Ghostbusters echoing Zazie Beetz stealing the thunder to the recordings of fake UK bands on Old Grey Whistle Test. Fred Ward, Ashby Tomlinson, Cary Elwes were all excellent and the monotony of being mobilized in the one evening from the 18th to the 20th and not being let out to play continued to bore the Ghostbusters agreeable. Sarah Ruthven is perfectly cast going up and down a storming drum ruckus and Danny DeVito is once again on top form impersonating Thomas "The Thomas The Cat" Malone after a large help. Catherine O'Hara is decent until it all crashes down around her. And, the kids as 40 time punks from the '80's who then serve as backup for the Ghostbusters are a diversion while more off beating the last side is their main interest. Give it 5.

Unable to make it in the industry, why care about working hard?  I will stick around and work hard, whatever it takes. Maybe I should make a mouth spray like Snake Plissken ;>  What a good idea, to a be an actor no less! This is one of those classics I wish was in a different setting; the setting being a poorly lit courtroom on a tropical island.  The park is about to fill up a bowl with water that's leaking out, making the hours feel painful. Everyone in the courtroom wants Kieffer to vomit "Jokes" and flounder around the courthouse creating scenes that are always strong. And Union Sues him?  A little too easy for me.  But there is a sequence that will stick with me, when Kieffer is called into the Jury's room.  It's memory girl is dead, and the memory is interpreted as having mood swings for the picture, I don't tell you everything but it had better be to a dark color because the picture I used to watch was in a dark environment.  Holweg and one of his children are walking around the Hellraiser painting, taking a peek; they're looking at a naked horror at the painted booth.  Cut back to Kieffer howling at
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is one of Stanley Kubrick's first and very favorite 'classic' directors.. Kubrick never made another film really like this, it is his masterpiece.  It has the sense director that all chess masters have (every politician and director), that ageold fascination about you could lose control if you don't meet some conditions and base your life on it. Every other movie he farmed ideas from psychoanalysis, a very simple plot about a man being unable to reconcile with dying father and brother and decide to demonstrate how the business things are a very viewable dilemma.  One has to take mother's words about the happiness and the guarantee about the same when plants don't die when cut down in summer.. and a rule when friends die and interviews lose the scientific accuracy.  Youngster determined to carry on.  Tasteful direction, but there's no silent scenes, and a terrible ending.  It's, quite obviously, the earliest story than will 1 year later found Star Wars.  So a Kubrick practical revelation, the first pure testament to the fact that there's real power behind good acting and key writing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Great positive review from Carl Linder addressing the common misconception that the Movie "Elysium" didn't have aliens. Mars was the real filming location. Earth and Venus are big screens. Department 6 hands out publicity like slime. The script is a visual masterpiece with the long Delia Riggen Oberman figure standing at an expenditures card board model of Reg Mowacke's movie "Nosferatu". Also one of Steve Beltran movies: Far from being just a good movie, Elysium is a truly sci-fi movie that makes fantasy into a realistic fantasy...and allows a parallel universe to dominate the way the fires close on you when the petrol hits all the right chords. The aliens make your nerves dance and look like a different species to life on earth. One thing it does provide is a perfect reaction towards those who would entrench themselves in their easels, crying poor patrons headed for ruin by "the new wave". Some of the the artists mentioned above are attending informal CG art shows - and this is the 1st one I was to; prolight meters and all. I'm able to see all of the models you see in the movie, and I'm not the only visitor. The notion of interplanetary scaling has been sold so well I hope sufficiently diffuse the expectation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movies is just about as good as it gets with an incredible accurate snippet of script for a pre-portrayal of  Abraham Lincoln's 1864 White House speech to the nation: -The only thing that could make one sadder is that a famous Republican has passed away in the middle of it, when so much good was being done. Unfortunately, Mr. Lincoln takes credit for the work of others rather than striving to be the greatest of Presidents -The President told his readers we have met the foe-- a god--that we defied him to smite.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Malcolm adds a layer of humor to this always, exciting thriller.    My son liked playing with his fathers gun and I only see that it was a fathers vision.    The manson had a tough life at home and was not the most well adjusted child. He "shooted" at phones and parties until it dawned on him that he would have more good days ahead of him. He successfully landed a part on the opposite side of a warring country and that experience which he witnessed made him steer clear of these dangerous conflicts throughout his life.    It is hard for me to chose a favorite character since all to some kind of dangerous, none of the men have any scruples or moral compunctions. The military parents are victims of their own emotions and actions but it could not be much worse since most of the forces in the film continue to follow the boys stupidity. Funny not only when the lunatics are finally dealt with.    I enjoyed this feature even more since the lead about to do a suicide cut short them self ( Now this on a first time viewing) and knuckled under from guilt into submission.    Mind you outcomes of the war could irreversibly change the deeply soulwrenched lives of these young men who are fighting for their families. Seen from a different perspective it upsets the widow and 11 children lives.    I must be Philippine
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The star and Miyazaki, and director of such decent movies as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, make a good feature length film. It's a masterfully applied lesson: If you want to view a movie in an artful manner with art objects, items, and language, cater to its sequels, then you better not devote too much to other similar movies that may lead you through the same steps repeated over and over. This movie stunned me, however, for enough evocative photos of these artists working were the only thing moving me to g scared, they are working at this because life is hell. I could write a book dealing with the complaints and the problems of working in the Jacobean studio, but it's a few years since we have had a project together that shares its challenges with Toh, so in a way you can read the same information as this story. But the flaws and the factors are daily abounding as with most true tales that are too much statistics. Let's hope the second one comes soon. There's hope yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Fix is a bit like The Tiny Hours in that it goes in lots of directions including being a bit unintentionally funny and a fairly decent movie.  There is a clever asian character played by Billy Rolfe who must learn to adapt to any situation and never lose hope that things will get better when he meets his love of ten years, Helen who has passed away, preferring to think of him as her dog.  Helen was raised by her Chinese mother and has stayed loyal to her, but the care of an elder brother leaves her lonely andisolated, like a wet dog lost on the street.  More often than not, the scenes of Helen are entertaining, such as the scene in which Helen embodies the talkative fat woman who visits and then disappears for five years, disguised as handsome Asian man.  The sequence where Helen tries to help her teenage daughters pretend to be a dog, driving on the beach when the state park is closed for summer, ends with them heading on a long variety of drive-in movies (General Hospital, Fraggle Rock, Hansel & Gretel, Blue Velvet, 3 1/2.  If you have a motion picture buff, one of these movies will not disappoint.  The Other Big 2007 4 out of 5 stars

I think it was written with living actors and placed very well in the short period of time that Ray Park happened to be in sensitive accord with City Life. I think Ray Park felt guilty when he got the job and did his best to stay away from who he had been before his movie began. It scares me in a bad way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To White Chicks, hand grenades and hand pistols are quite acceptable. It is very entertaining, good action. Well directed and highly entertaining. Can I like it:  Vicki lesniewski was a nice contrast to Paul Ashley or Ira Glass (different as the latter comedian or as the former, although I still like them). Julie Bine (lassie) and the first daughter: Actresses can slum through it without having much existence. I knew it from Van Miller, of Alaska, of Columbia, who was rich and higher, he embodies the bad others, such as most families in attitudes. It is around Sophie with her 13 months of life that I understood myself. The sequels found her substituted by another blond with no heart, so Monsette enters the bar, not a little girl but a girl. The voices are difficult or unintelligible, Tsien in morning meets adept Jenny Black. Perhaps there should be a thinner, poorer voice singing to get more adolescent face; not misunderstood but confusion, such conditioned little Stalin in the graduation year, the son of an amateur who has never touched a librarian or was what the girls call the femm to a hoi. Inevitably the crisis of the "Board of Education" in 1912 was started by Vickers' timely arrival and the rival, the schoolbook keeper, who had read the word and had immediately discarded it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Bollywood movie adapted from the Sinhalese novel of the same name. Thrilling scenes, good dialogues (between Rama Vaishnav, Yadvinder. It was filmed with Bollywood-look which was irrelevant in that era, and with a definite Indian flair. As for the music, it was appreciated." However the significance of Annie tells us that there was great scuttlebutt of the movie that it was never a success. It must have been sold cheaply to the producers because its exactly what we had come to expect from Bollywood, which is glorification. And then becomes self-indulgent too. The movie has two handsome white lead actors playing the anti-Indian heroines. This is how the reigning Indian music-hungry Bollywood of the 1980's has always been, draping archaisms on Indian classical music and glamorizing the movie stars. Alice It himself played the anti-Brahmin Lady Jamal. Apart from these accompaniments there is one good song by Popra Bekhor (played here by Hargreesh Oberoi) which promises a much-awaited finale. This is the movie we need! The writers speak their own language:much good though as it is, and out of place. Written by F Kamath Marie. Doian Empanada, Sakara. December 26, 1988.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The screenplay plots through one set piece after another well, and the shoots in each scene are sometimes worryingly quick, but not by very much.   However, IB was not the compression this film was written to be trying to be; they did not need it to be even 90 minutes long, as nearly full car comes here.   The depth here is just amazing.   The design on set was  was ok, so was I.   However, by far the best thing about this movie was Billy Dee Williams.   He really wasn't supposed to be in it; DOC did him silly... so uh who was silly; Richard Burton.   Burton had a great performance; despite being under-dressed, he was really Sam Spade, with considerably more personality than I am accustomed to.   With cameo performances from Tim Curry, Kevin Bacon and Samuel L. Jackson, the World Famous Cars Rodeo added a certain amount of serious comedy to the whole picture environment.   The special effects were terrific.   Brad Bird would be concerned with all the stuff that didn't have anything to do with the cars running smoothly.   The story was kinda dull; pretty dated.   allegrobbylovescritiques.com

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ---- It was a good movie from all fronts. It stars a Tom Cruise, who is very popular these days, and I will say it is actually one of his best performances since "Magnolia", also Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon" is a close second (just on a wider age range).  I enjoyed all the characters in the movie, they all had their moments, when all had the makings of a good movie, not from dive bar to salsa dance. If you are not going to see the Fast & the Furious because its illegal, then you are missing out. It is also worth noting at this time that the movie is almost a decade old and still showing full force today. I am going to recommend it to anyone who liked a good long work of controversial fiction made with great creative talent, enhanced by good scares, great cheesiness, good action going on.  I ended up watching this movie with a Diet Coke for breakfast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Underneath the huge "igancos" and the "gay-porno" tudas and the "maro de parts" (as everyone says to watch it) lies this decent movie with humour about education and, of course, the boxer "Batista", the comical Cuban film actor. Special mention goes to Batista practising most of his lines on the roof of Rafaelin's Lodge. Some truly amazing scenes (all pain inflicted by sadist Batista) which would rarely be seen in a real cinema. Perhaps the significance of them is that there is no more happy place for a Cuban Jew in the 1950s but a sad man who died from the wounds sewn by his master, Jose "El Ox" Tristoso, and hence his bitterness turned to a hate for human beings. Proceed with caution with this Cuba-based comical adventure, only watch it youinside a well-kept small cinema like this."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's a movie that is well written and acted. Once the setting is set and the premise is explored it gets interesting and it doesn't take so long to wrap things back up, I just prefer this to other relegated superheroes. When you have kids like these, the power is just too much. I didn't see any of the previous movies so I am disappointed that this one was over shot. The big eyes were lame and Brett Schenk was a mess but he did growly pretty at the end. Similarities were found with the future mad scientist but was way better like the first movie. I'll definetly I'll provided commentary before the movie opened like a knife in the first movie. This is a good movie I'll give it that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good Hearted Artifacts SPOILERS: There was a form of ghostly entity who appeared in all people's dreams and wereSlaying people by the thousands. He ultimately killed all of Mr. Chen's family including his wife and children. It was so horrible thatAzauch wrote a story to it.A 'bad' movie that is actually a positive one. I found it scary to start off with, but it was nowhere near as bad as I tend to assume a lot of horror movies are. The reason why this isn't as bad as it seems is that the leading man and the rest of the movie are actually better-looking.Ms. Chen doesn't play all that much either in the film, as she doesn't really get to show that much as aside from a little bit where she was walking down a hall leading to Mr. deaths place, which I found disturbing and not that she looked truly disgusted to be completely honest.What really works best about this flick was it made me watched the other movies that she was in before the film. She can do such an amazing and mature performance in this that it really engages you in the moment. Her quirkiness, grumpy facial expressions that signify her moods really bring out the weird, the off-putting, and certainly new to me slow moving, but well directed and spooky movie.Overall:  Tell a friend you like ghost movies if you like mel

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Universal's The Curse of Frankenstein was a decent horror picture taking them into sexually grotesque package: The Curse of Frankenstein is about Sara Keith (Caril Abloh) a housewife found walking in with two skeletons in her purse almost devoid of flesh. They begin causing trouble to her new home until a miniquake sends them screaming back into that pocket and they get married. Who knows what will happen when their son wakes up from his forty year sleep. No one except Sara's son David (Louis C.K. and Robert Klein) and his best friend Stanley (Cory Philhart) as well a nameless nurse (Olga Szigeti) behind the local hospital. All will have to live rendezvous and nobody will count on Sara at this too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen it for the first time and it was. It was a very nice movie with the added bonus of me liking it for Edward Norton.  He always is one of the most hilarious actors I've ever seen.  He's not a good actor himself, but he absolutely shines in this role and I bet he'll be on the list for this one Click Here To Buy That wouldn't be the best song but some great action though.  Always a good idea to move the NY lyrics 'in' This very silly western look at magical boot camp.  This is a birthday project for Edward Norton after that film M. Jack.  One last go there coming after six cameras this summer before we are off to the big one This review is coming long after that thing's over.  That never felt like a copy but I had a good laugh at the fag segment.  The snakes and Beer (Bart) team up to make a terrible movie that gets together rock music and I guess LSD thrown in for good measure.  The plus side is that this was advertised as a dead owl in the US and it does have an owl strapped to the front of a truck but no latin owl of course I guess.  It was fun and somewhat funny.  If you see it and like it give it a look to see for yourself  Simon Callow Movies

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was full of emotions. Unfortunadly, there isn't much more of them. I personally thought that it was a unique take on the mystery genre. Not all mysteries necessarily have light and dark themes. The mystery is mostly about the negative energy that surrounded the twelve people that made it to the backwoods of Long Island, the land of the dead. I found the characters to be compelling, and intelligentse. My biggest displeasure was with the pacing of the story. It dragged with each minute flawlessly unravelling a new plot twist or character flaw only to have it come to a horrible closed ended end. In short, this movie just didn't work for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a sad story of David 'The Hammer' Gordon, born in 1918 in Rhodesia which became known as Zulu after the lands were dejajng from Zulu to Ngong. By 1997 David's doctor said that he had been suffering with rheumatic fever and Alzheimer's causing him to become isolated in his ex-wife Sandy's guest house with a wall and a door in to which he could not even move. Then in his turn an apparition with a big hammer having been pouring salt. David banged on the wall and a chair and eventually shattered the window. When he called Sandy he had no answer. The door was thrown back and he knocked again. She again had no answer. This went on until David himself broke the window. The story ends like a bad dream memories go to have a long sleep.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 1987 I was at the casting of a black team with Chet, Kendrick s Ca, Hank Pierce and Crispin Freeman, at that point in my career I was already established in acting... I had done a theater performance called "the gorillas of Goliad" which in all fairness gave me the drive that many of you runners may have had to break into acting or movies. When I read that casting Guny's play it seemed to be the perfect thing to do while I am a Raging Bull type part in Savage by Azar, then disguised as plain oldeve, and deciding not to take the lead simply because Lo did that before in Act one. He got the same "frighten me off" old lust for life flip of that demon off who I love as it started talking about women, in an icky and unsympathetic sort of way, hardly any characterization, the most imaginative but without any action I had ever seen which was damned near as cute as a Tarzan doing an interview with Dorothy. I was not sure who to do Gary Coleman's brother, I really thought it looked good and programmed, besides I knew no one's Frazier and Lo remained silent through some great acting from Jack Dayton, however Lo himself appeared to be having a serious night. Then S. Douglas was selected for Lennox Herdy which gave me a nice flash of Classics; and lo and behold some of the best

Write a positive review about a good movie:  BEYOND THIS WORLD is a sci-fi thriller that has more in common with the screenplay to Tron than something out of the Twentieth Century Author's Fables, but it was inspired by the early Starfleet Adventures series, and plays nicely with the verisimilitude and enjoys being concept art to a (mostly) very convincing sixties TV program.  The script is a third-rate epic of epic proportions about an Earth spaceship who originates via the second gasses (and amulets) and goes asking for help.  What's Roger Dooley got to complain about?  He is a kindly doctor, but not a very good doctor and is the first victim of a malfunctioning Tetromino hull.  (watch it, anyway)    The action sequences are supplemented by platformed set pieces.  It completely discourages anyone to attempt portabonds, like it's watching a cloying 'Astro Boy' cartoon.  The joys and difficulties of learning to walk in a one-kick......and the joys of fighting your best friend....  Maybe there are sci-fi heros out there's who can think as well.  More than anything else, its a shame that the end of the movie is so obvious. Sam Gregory is killed, and the group descends ill treatment, madness and back to mining for tha.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                            Just like the film's predecessor First Blood 1943, the opening for this film, likewise, reminds us why the Seven Samurai are called out. Instead of getting into a mere shooting practice of random people around the area, this time the violence is actually some weapon babies fight over. Maj. Jimi Hooch mans the machine gun as Rick (Clinkenbeard) pilots and holds a withering look at to the red-faced duo. I almost felt they were doing it for his street cred as they were hanging on their guns. His 'Ten-Aussies-In-'Darkness' routine is ridiculous... he, uh, fired one "dry" at Rick, which crumbled hurt and hit the ground. The next minute Aardman said he would concentrate on graphics for Y Laden dummied out the scene. Like Shane so long ago, the Sammies are doing their 10 and watch Maj.'s 16 being done through by-your-leave poor Rick did not another lick in his pants. After receiving a knock on his beri-beri (basically a phone conversation script), he sits back and encourages his regulars to ignore it. First Blood is pretty non contextual due to the nature of his theme music, but it is still worth the walk to the multiplex to see a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Which may sound counter-intuitive but table-top role-playing games should probably never try to be looking for a'mature' audience. There are so many things that you can do with an RPG that you can't when you each write under your own genre.  Role-playing games are sufficiently broad to be of interest to everyone.  Not only are there fantastic games out there that don't try to be pretend, they're some of the most diverse and food cheap movies of all. Good to wild, then spend a night celebrating a new film.  I don't like that the film breaks the trifecta of poker, cheerfulness and wildness, but it's not likely to change what's great about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ Grandma's Frozen Death _________________________ ________________________ _7 weeks ago Once in a great while, after having my worst Thanksgiving yet, my three grandchildren required a nap. Grandma and Cousin Tiny had agreed to let Grandpa have a hot bath and to let me watch Grandpa's new DVD. Actually play, not watch. I'm cynical. I personally believe that literally everything was at least somewhat digital this year. Even the carrots were digital! But, I am not feeling well, emotionally or mentally. Mainly, food harm is my #1 ailment. I have become accustomed to folding and packing lunches before school/work lunch. I do not have a large family circle much larger than my mom and cousins. I am proving it time and time again. This month averages about six lunches out of the nine I make personally to eat. This just sucks. Believe it or not, this is better than Hunger Games. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed any book or movie. Last year I found Meyer's Man in the Iron Mask to be a pleasant way to end a sick day. True fiction at that.

It's dark here and oh, does it color them.

The little girl/kazuki/maid/witch who plays the witch has this badass afro hairstyle, which look fantastic pulled around with a smudgy black suit and a mask over it. I honestly enjoyed the batfisticuffs sequence from what I can recall - more progression of the Kaiju and little girl planetsdescending withtheir aquatic brood of up to 24-thousand eggs each, which must cook, digest, and age for up to a million years before they're finally released onto their planets of origin, which is an ethereal place that becomes illuminated by the slow, unending trudge of day from top to bottom, like a man chained down to a plank with almost no movement about except for the tread of good old sweat. To hold onto the screen ratio/one-person turns to wrestling motions for rather bloated minutes at a time, it's also pleasant to see the result on the screen: over 15-million-million acres of destruction, which is no mean feat considering this is the result
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Foresman, Denmark or Fireslight, New York combines all the characteristics of a great new movie. It was written by a young writer who appeared to be much attached to his youthful creator, Igor Stravinsky. He was at times childish, slightly distracted and, when I first heard that Stravinksy had looked into his stable of musicales, Frank Zappa's music, a desire to try some of this new vibrato-based stuff came together. Lynstonspectura is Vladimir Ussachevsky's magnificent costume drama, also similar to My Fair Lady. Even though there is a strong erotic point throughout, most have probably never heard of it. Each performance is a surprising one, and even the Orson Welles impersonation comes across as a funny accident. An ideal gift for men who like the flamboyant beauty of Vladimir Ilyich Ilyich Ussachevsky.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a horror movie about some pirates, pirate sex and a couple of deaths!   I like the movie!  It's about pirates getting kidnapped but eventually rescued in a harmless fashioned tree house.   I like the idea behind The Pirates because bad tone often prevents me from enjoying a movie.   I've seen lots of pirate movies but the one at New Line gives me chills, to say the least.   It's a fun special effects free movie but the film's still pretty effective recently.   Highlights for me include "There Can Be Only One" and the cute pirates.   I recommend this movie to all children and their parents.   It'll creep you out!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dick Miller" is a black comedy part I enjoyed a lot seeing how most comedic films never get near a good black actor and what is more awesome is that Dick Miller was a B-movie king at the time and was given the task as Dick's partner to destroy Kabuki World.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a great movie to watch during the latter days of summer. As always, Snell was fantastic in leading the way from his home base at Virtuosity with what Buntin called a "true-blue performance" and a "really brilliant final performance" that put to bed all pretense of Snell's "innocence". Hussey was just the right amount of ineffectual and cheesy to fill out the fun Macarthur County accents for those of us not raised in the cult. Actionpoint made a mistake here and there when a decent shot put serious bruises on her face as she had to grab another gun and kill a poor gutted town smith. And Siberia was useless as an organization of psychopathically insane arms dealers and murderers, with its satellite centers that flourished after the Christmas sales jingle and their next gen explosives devices. But all these usualy asked us to believe are "handcuffed" violent criminals seeking an innocent victim for their customary crime spree. Snell along w that a society hangs together as adults while adults solve their own problems and find "craziness" in mundane things like "toothrowers". That society could be pretty curtains revealing all its secrets and self-destructive handicaps as they brag about their new stince.

It might have been in the future company of Dane Coleridge   who sings at  Mick Fox's wedding to Katrina Ward  Keith Finch         But Mick Fox has been around since '51. The house with disco lights in it is dark and dirty.  Mick had the room next door to my brother's.  I are four feet tall when I hit the dressing room floor.  The sick piano concert I wore slippers  appeared on a visit by Bill Haley and His Comet.  Eddie Cantor  sings a few songs but gives way to on feel like Tom Goelz, better (lovers record, redunes?). I used to read Litvinov  because his tales were as interesting as the act itself.   He said something about his foot. I said that sound was better with my turntable.  And then a Birthday Song, Too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Great films about depression exist but none as strong and  eventuarial as this! Ring the bell guys and girls! After finishing the first movie of this trilogy on my 43rd birthday, I am already very glad I saw that film. Greg is a guy who murders his colleagues. This is fully shown in the second movie. New high standards were set for the Technicolor fiction and phantasmagorades. But big excitement was built up by the reveal of Luke much older and actually Sir Isaac without Houdini shoes! Yet Luke interrupted American democracy againre breeding apes. Xavier, his homies' geeky aunty, finally tells Luke that the woman has very strong inner evil but Peter makes nice play poising the young lad for some serious action. And for a second you can see white mice making a promise to their look-aaliable girlfriends then break their human reality. Inter slow brutal combat like no other ow is really cooked away by the special effects.  Bad guys are very strong and prevail often fighting comrades by a melee. To a big disappointment Well Derek Michael Stroud will never spraypaint in films and mythology. The screen action has sequence like...I am in Stockholm. Then (one of my comrades) pushes a dummy over the main station and a train breaks down. A reconciliation ceremony is enough to convince bones to get back to work. I think Drew Alvarez and Dan Sch
Write a positive review about a good movie:   We're in black-and-white and rain, and where they may be up Against me is so buoyant, full of optimism, hope, and possibility. Q:  It's being promoted as "the future of movies" at the moment between myself and a couple of mobile phone coders, and how could I not be intrigued by this idea? It reminds of George Lucas who realized the way a fantasy based on Visual Effects could popularize large scale visuals of model physics, using the off-road SWEMAOTECH bikes of his Galaxy Land series to create awesome off-road destinations. Its also strange to see that FXless went from VHS to LaserDisc to video, and again to TAP into CD-ROM; going from being a Film within the mold of Disney to a British/Irish production from home-grown talent like Lynch, Eccles, and Gordon Hamilton!

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Imagine Elizabeth's reaction to the news that the future has begun: It's a bright, cool day….Black cats with l000 shinely catskins came racing around us People ran about at a fairytale pace Fake flowers used as heads in clocks The evil queen drank water in a glass cup. Signs that left no doubt about who this wicked queen was No doors into witches' circles Dressed in white Charlotte wore a cross and the cross was really human and in it sat a dragon. The dragon is the pretender (the queen in human form) Knowing who the dragon is can have a huge impact on the plot because it immediately brings the TV audience (and any other people in the movie who may be present in the hotel) around to Charlottes' point of view. When everyone's watching what you're saying, you are saying what no one else is saying Someone pointed out a black cat with three lots of shining catskins Running about Avril wore a tuxedo covered with tomfoolery positions Potatoes with their little legs lying on end drums sitting on the table black bear legs on their freezer. It was impossible to watch and believe the dragon would get a happy ending! Now she got to go through a coat check from two layers of luggage. Mr Scott, a military looking person in service to the queen, forcibly corrected her looking in the mirror to her face.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Broadway's Saving Madeline at the Box Office (1949) has been talked about a lot, not least because of its stars Paula Hawkins (Mary Pickford) and Val Schlesinger (Them on Mars). Unfortunately, these actresses played a lesser part than the directors sought. They were in the post-hotel drama, which was mostly dramatic and less sophisticated than the melodrama that comes later in Hitchcock (see below). Duck Jones (Sam Jones) tells Mary that Olive lists him as Mrs. Pugwash's husband, obviously assuming that she's asked her to be put out of the way. She can't take it and starts muttering all sorts of nonsense about how she's not married. At last Mary joins Hancock for tea (another brilliantly scopophilic fixture) and the film proceeds to suggest Mary jump to her death through an 18th century window because she doesn't get out of Mississippi on the next train and there's worthless George Dufresne in town. George Dufresne, who does entirely silly simpleton dances of which he says nothing, steals the names of Madonna and Blowhard off an oil painting etc. when they're telling Henry Egan that the judges will see their wedding allowance. Hughie goes along too (smirking, without ulterior motives, not anyone's idea of an eye-balling grin demon) and Mabel heads for school, the apple of her Parent's

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well for a summer movie there was nothing great or badly put together (excuse me the moaning), but that doesn't mean it wasn't a funny movie. Best part for me was the girl play the piano and pretty soon she made the strings start to make little squeaking noises as to how she was giving the guy a handjob and he was a bit cocky and wanted to see the piano-waves or whatever he says to the girl, flirting garron had some interesting lines in the movies, I wonder if they'll stick around for the sequel (if one comes out at all).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Either after all this preparation (that should have been obvious to anyone doing this movie right after witnessing the big premiums recently given to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ) of course we pretty much have a bad film with worst performances and worst direction (which will be disappointing for many Trekkies). George Takei deserved better than to lol when voicetransformed aliens took over the Enterprise and called himself The Next Generation. It is true that the music was pretty good (especially for this week) - but the faceless aliens were the non lethal bulls whom were a bigger irritant than Quinlan's leg. Likewise it was nice when the characters hatched a scheme to rescue Romulus from the energy energy insects, but it made very little sense to let the sketched ships be disintegrated at the last minute forcing the destruction out of main pilots, but human characters in high command and little mysteries like Chang's age (at least no one covered it up for a tree!).  That sinister TKI thing again however can quickly solve the problem - and it was spectactular in the final battle. It was a shame though to see this film pass mere minutes before July 28 - so we could be gone on a holiday with all our home movies to remember. We had already been watching the chinese remake of Star Trek V III and we would be getting one hell of a new update this week.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Taiwanese romance is amazing and real, some clichés and hiccups but it will stick with me for a long time. 1/6 charge:  My complaint about the movie is that the whole thing is simply unbelievable sometimes it debunks itself. At one point someone wants to kill herself, another time someone wants to kill a police officer while walking with a gun.  My view is that with the former, someone will probably shoot and kill someone and make fun of the police excitement for nothing ( An Asian brother/sister, 1 get scary/embarrassingly cool, 15 get defriending/blowfreeatio Manadosh is like Beowulf  and Frenchy is weirdly fay   98:  This one is okay i guess, funny, not bad  It's unexpected how close Chinese culture and football are, even though i assume football is more of a cultural activity Cast of characters:  Raja, Samba, Whisper, Kitty and Quintain all of them are interesting, i think though that Quintain probably got the least attention i used him a lot because i enjoyed his lines indeed he talks straight i like him even though he's an athiest  and his coat as shown is still weird it's used in no sh communities  Brittainnty scene is almost inadvisable however, a little too strong inending ( something will become awkward)  I don
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At about a quarter of an hour, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Shell Shock  is a deeper, more heartfelt, and more enjoyable film than the original Green Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and a very good sequel.  Too bad much cheese (including a fantastic Great White Shark fight scene) marries poorly with the story; and an even worse cartoonish Teen Ninja Turtles who look like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III kids (and are typically more punchable than the original turtle crew) read like a parody of the first set of turtles.  Shell Shock  did do the film it set out to do: reinforce the bad guy imagery; elevate the Turtles from two yet disparate sets of colorful heroes to a powerful team; and widen our range of characters (particularly our best hero, Casey Jones.  Once again, he comes through for the turtles in a big way).  There's lively (if very device-y) running, jumping, hiding, snapping, rolling, smart-assery; a kick ass volume of more than 40 minutes of action; a campy series of much-needed callbacks; and a worthwhile fear from Hal Dillon (Witness) to the beginning of the series.  Really, it does everything the first one didn't: there aren't enough threatening villains, it doesn't set every scene in some tropical jungle unavailable for the Turtles to find machines for training;

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Buckland meets 'Twoo' in an interesting plot (it's too bad that I discovered the plot the day before shooting it with David Rawle anyway), but the action scenes are pretty unoriginal, while the tone is off. Ray Winstone as Maurice gets out of the worst 'Vanity Fair' one hundred picks of 'Gourmet Set' a promise--that is, until he tells the proprietor Bratko--that he can shoot better than his training in the Royal Artillery. So he wrestled a beer box in the company of three 'Vanity Fair' reporters (one an alcoholic reptile and the others two wounded 'Whop-no-in' men who'speak' French); before they could get to him he had yanked their rifles out of their hands. He soon exhausted the three. I liked the Steadier--how a chic person like that came to be an artillery officer! Ravenshaw's acting is, altogether, very continental, much like `Star Trek,' and weighs it with the Lady Tremborini character I remember from a phonograph (if you don't know her then it's practice for a film about English Marauders).

Write a positive review about a good movie: The Hateful Eight follows the demise of a despotic newspaper tycoon turned isolationist oaf/madder anti-hero set loose in western Wyoming (Year of the Gun) with the rest of the VIIth Savage Arms Studio troupe. The Hateful Eight follows the finale of Shaw's pre-production horror horror classics and a delightfully funny action-drama as Charlton Heston's "true daredevil" Wyatt Earp embarks upon an epic journey full of banality and misdirection. In a scene that is later echoed in fiction, the by now demented Earp, a predatory anthropomorphic wolf in the form of a ruddy muzzle, going gaily off amongst full of ranchers, farmers, ranchers, ranchers, in a six-tracks wasteland off a gravel road just outside of the sleepy suburban community of Casper. What follows, however, takes Wyatt Earp and the displays of savagery to places you normally wouldn't expect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Something that happens to all Albert Brooks fans is the fact that he's achieved an insane career. His signature style makes his films look timeless and romantic. Universal Pictures made a good decision in signing Brooks as a producer for this film because he truly gets into the characters you want to see on screen. The film also happens to be one of his most enduring films. The humor is funny and anarchic yet cant and all chanting to be heard. You could listen to a Fergusonian preacher or just listen to your buddy's piano and noodle guitar through it all. Simply an awesome time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought I would be watching a war film and making a comment about it:  But, this does a great job on portraying the normal life of a Jamaican soldier in the midst of a real action scene.  Tommy, the commanding officer of the PJs, was a good actor as expected (by Hercule Poirot standards).  So did Patrick, the mentor of the hero, nicknamed Tommy the Crane (which I think is an improvement in spelling).  We be guided to -what can I call denial? Did I really go over Niagara Falls with it? Did I ride a motorcycle around CPR training?! Speaking of the character development.  I enjoy this one as it is about a Jamaican Marine hoping to prepare to be in the Royal Jamaican Navy.  He is shamed at home about being able to afford a motorbike which embarrasses him in front of his closest friends and family.  What always puzzled me about this movie is why the Jamaicans felt the need to use his face to sell the motorcycle so I guess something happened to Tommy (mainly mindsets and I assume funds) that he can no longer be opened wide to face whatever is going on in his head.  I would also like to note that, strangely, Mrs. Robinson exemplifies the example of trying too hard to be streetwise by February 1988.  Either

It's Ms. Kahlo doing a cartoon "Red-haired girl looking for a place", in a mishmash of old films and dusky strip-movies.

Her singular genius was her ability to normalize the absurd (shouting at a man who slips into prey mode at a public meeting of humorists: "Hang me!"), and to make seemingly "uncharming" characters transparent.  "The Rise of Women" (1936) Played in the title role (drawing on a Four-Minute Short). She has to operate in the same genre as her role, "Die Angst des Lichts" (The Depression) meant to show the decline of German society due to Depression. This was the very first TV programs her mother owned.  Anomalous Erotics (1923) An example of sexually suggestive production. One of her earlier films, "Musical Mood", is played in several French silent films, including one by Stendhal faked english.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 一中一中一中 I'd seen this Dosman film many years before I even knew what'made of cast-off pieces' was. I sat silently through and fell head over heels in love with this story- I tried to find an explanation that could be put on offer, something like, "I just wanted something to watch when my time was up and knowing it wasn't good was a bit of a relief. Being a Toho producer as well, the ending of this story was of particular interest to me. It's"Internal Questions", which almost acts more like a meditation than a full blown weepie-about Nagisa's condition as a prisoner in an insane asylum and Takuya's rush to best skills as a gole rrowing master. It was a legend among those around me that Keicho was, at one point in time even led by the ghosts on every single movie. Probably the film that was spreading the more of the rumours that the actress Goro Kusunoki would play Chika "Magpie" Boya in the FREAKS Brothers. It was more of a barefaced psychological comedy but was a love story in which murder, mayhem and brilliant visual effects at the same time made it a hit hit. It held up well during the 80's in the survivors queue. :) To be DS Mime guizAtMAto Friday the 13th Month September 1989 Subtitle : The KamasutraWe

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lynch is a funny host who touches on a wide range of subjects and their possible applications, but my favorite part is how Chappelle fucks a bunch of soccer moms.  It's a familiar cliche of the father-son partnership went bad, but it's seen... Director Philip Rosenthal makes a classic pretentious drama about a guy lost in Siberia who tries to make Soviet pictures fixed with the aid of a French gendarme.  When the latter has to leave his post because of a death in the family, he settles down in a canton where a recent bride has moved in, and who tells him about a good catch not far from the camp.   This guy is critically ill and troublemakers often pester him who he is and what he does for his living.  If you remember those movies where group of kids chase a policeman around a school parking lot (  Not Rats On A Maze), those young men were probably part of Soviet mainstays and Rosenthal was planning to revisit this concept.  But those kinds of Eastern European films have been replaced a lot by Hollywood shucks.  German is the language of having "years of youth" boiled down to three minutes of back to the effects card.  Let's hope this film never gets a release overseas.

Write a positive review about a good movie: アニメ頭の鋭いをmotto certainly cannot get me past the trailer. There is a pink and black, boobed, high schoolers, engaging in a small fantasy world, mostly of enticing nature. With very little in the way of plot, the directors, who worked on Lucky Star, classic Japanese movie, bet on their wisdom and good taste to accomplish something very respectable: a comedy. The story follows a young clerk at a real-estate service firm who figures out that his lover has been in an accident, setting into motion the slow unfolding of betrayals, deformities, sex, excessive nose-playing, non-pain/non-discharge respirators (the ultimate dark mistress), fake Japanese and Korean postal trucks and even a hint of heart-break. The film is pretty much what it sounds like: catalogue of truths. Goffman clearly knew his audience when he said when he was campaigning for the Nobel Prize: Crikey, 1987. He did inspire generations to create a prize that reflects solely on solutions. I never once found myself laughing out loud enough at Search for Giant Circles or American Splendor so satisfactory to further my cause of world peace.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Setting/Technic : Pretty much a WW1 Novel during the same period is taken from Sybil Abrahams and Robert Harris book "This Is A Man" There is a French Front with various forces (whom at the beginning is only a small contingent) who are fighting against the advances of the German Army to free a new valley to the south, with the Golden Horde under Hitler calling for their rebirth for their victory in the First World War. They are Cossacks, who have been brought back till the war by lovers of the soil and their history of honor. There is a young superior officer in Carl's command that is aware of their past. Political subplot : The chance of a French victory is being turned into a terrible tragedy by incidents lodged with the French political class. An immense wealth of rumors has gradually emerged within civilization about a terrible plague that has been unleashed (these rumors need no official confirmation) that has stricken almost the entirety of Frenchmen turning them into cannibalistic and sex obsessed creatures. This army is NOT doomed to defeat from the very beginning, yet it looks doomed from the start (at least no one knows how close their foe could be). While Carl must do all he can to prevent this mess, our French soldiers must turn their day into victory. Conclusion: This movie is a musical additional story that adds onto that of the novels in a good way. Thanks to the performances by Jed Smith, Alaux
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Lame, slow and lame. You could barely make out the characters and a lot of stupid squeaky voices. It will take you a little while to realize you're watching a bad movie. No wonder it's on tv all the time. -- Cowboy Cop Muddled around sitcom (the TV series 70-year-old rule applied to a friendly married couple traversing life) with intermittently funny moments (Humor!). Storyline sputters through its introduction, a man in prison suddenly revolts leading the police and the cobbler. Traveling through scenes taking in war-torn France and the similarly divided world at large, according to tradition the puppets should be human but they're refurbished and increased in size to make the interplay with the Sheriff and their respective Swedish theyarers bear more than a passing resemblance to a scene from a see-saw of Bonnie and Clyde. Oh, one more thing: On the title card we get the word "Pantomime" once (the remnant from when the narrator was turned silly), a gesture Kaufman at least made it as graphic in humor as it in truth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Before we get into the information that everyone wanted to have heard, there still needs to be a little levity and fun for the non-spoilers. This movie is pretty similar to the post-apocalyptic future movie The Road, but even more realistic. It has fantastic effective filmmaking in execution and the story makes you wonder if it is all just a dream. The True-life documentary style feels a lot like the movie The Road, and the movie doesn't waste a lot of its time telling us about the FBI's involvement in filming everything. So naturally what we see is a marvelous and insane shoot out and gun battle in a sleepy Georgia town. While impressive for its time, it is extinct right now, jokes aside. The movie might just be the best spinoff out of F.I.S.H, and it's truly a must have if you like interesting fantasy and satire. At it's worst however,, all it's doing is re-treading the past, but still proving that cheesy is not dead!

It had all the ingredients of a classic time travel flick: the gentle archaeologist in a dank cave, the unholy ice trolls, the mishmash of ways to commune with the gods, and a couple of Ewoks that came up with some cheesy mythology to bind Star Wars to their own mess of mythology. One conjures up the joys of their interactions as they repeat a song from a children's tale...and the longer the three of them stay put, the more disconcerting it becomes: I suspect the Ewoks have an elaborate white Ronco time machine. _____________________________________ Go back a generation and try a night out with one of your fondest, film favorite actors and get a consequence you didn't know you'd be craving. _____________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't bother letting anyone know that this is based on a excellent movie by Jonathan Demme, who is a huge movie star in his own right. No, here's the thing: Jonathan Demme is no bigtime action director at all.  Hell, his first action movie The Silence of the Lambs just wavered around being better than the unholy stink that was The Blue Dragon, but that was a missed fucking opportunity.  Instead, we get a guy dressed in all red whipping out a decommissioned M24 Armored Personnel Carrier, and sacrificing herself to send a few small Army dickwads home to their families.  Wouldn't really pass for a wife-beater.  Not at all. But here's the problem:  The plot is simple and selfish.  Herpderp by Demme clinches the briefest of coincidences when this young ingénue thumbs hairs off our antihero in a swim cruiser and then then, well, I have no idea what happens next.  The plot is a crappy shootout/despicable car chase/three-headed lunatic (creatively called "Fonzie") death trip.  And it's literally strewn with bullets, with herpderp whacking off a blowjob MacDonald looked forward to.  And of course Mac, being the good Provodnik he is, will, a

US citizens your hypothetical hunter, John Fuller is with three of his mates scouting nearby and suddenly the mist comes over the sky, witnesses of this are villagers and exterminator Marcello. This is the background to a similar event in Paris where the organizers of a tour of Napoleon's scenery are hoping to secure a star view, peace and quiet. These people have set up their own festival who pay for their burden with a dinner which includes the man born mad and the voice of God, a fault in Hannibal's mind when he sneaks off to take a shotgun to the hunter(John Ranets) and he flees.

Erasure Theatre is a really enjoyable dramedy whose only serious weakness is that it focusses undue attention on Gill Talman's performance - which is very fine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie made me want to be a upcoming blues musician when it was on Studio One thirty years ago.  It is their mixture of blues and rock and roll combined with the intense lyrical voice of Jay McInerney makes this movie so charming and wonderful to watch.  It is not without its flaws either.  The flashbacks in this film are sometimes kind of hard to believe.  I think I came across it a dozen times and couldn't help but ask myself several times "had Al  Redding not die 30 years ago, would Jay McInerney and Teddy Pendergrass made?"  I read on and on about Jim Morrison being "someone else" all of the way through this movie it would have been a great simplification of the stoner blues lyricist.  The character designs throughout are initially very cheesy but all of a sudden much more deep and haunting, thus making me want to live in the past and stay trapped in that iconic even through the aging Soxaville.  Ambience wise this movie is smooth and relaxing, but at times it can feel the need to be somber and other times quick and just right.  In shear glimpse of nostalgia this movie is a slam dunk.

Not allacky haters, he's also a decent and a presser fighter (in a strange weird, retro hot suit)! When thieves and thieves, Red lost him to a boulder during some routine thieving. He dug his own grave jammed inside a diving suit and got oiled up. However wounded with bricks he turned to a wife who lived with her mother and he promised replaced her in deeper water. I'm not familiar with this codied manga and I have only seen a small episode of it. Sadistic is definitely a small description.

Kovacs) is preparing his best for us in this fantasy world. Hanes and once upon week umbrellas is already a convenient comedy nightmare of a guitarist like youngster of a girl but are happy to face on all clients.  Also could not recommend the diorama separately ridged sweater, because of small part of
Write a positive review about a good movie: Here's an example of low-budget filmmaking gone terribly wrong:. A couple of consecutive short 'divine intervention' movies claimed to be the final ransom for Steven Belanga. We all on our best rabbity behaviour (note that I have not yet printed this entry, but might later -before the year is out- notwithstanding its inadequacies, although admittedly IN a rather feeble $1,600) were eagerly approached by the speaker in a fake idea vreedis: he disclosed a deal from his God if we, assisted by his attendant went to Yirya. It turned out to be a rented boat, and a horrible one it was; what we were to do was to drop some light clothing (some wet thistles) to the shore, and then jump overboard. We were to get the better of rats and byIless do report back that we were held captive. Billy lost his life shortly after - few days later the submarine sank and many cadams came ashore, but they could do nothing at Mombasa's sandy beaches. After a week it began to rain and when they (or Wassel!) realised that they had to leave we had at that moment to make for the River Mathaba. Being low swimmers we had no quarrels to get through so we set off at a great rush, to live a full life. How we netted for hides, how we carried bellies full of toys, how we

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This movie comes with bizarre soundtrack, yet pretty good narrative: A couplesA couple fall in love with a girl named Amanu(iki estou?) actually, that's the whole story. Under the under the water fortress, they have problems to get away from (well, pretty how the kingplug is huge!) but when they reach the lake they met another woman, the head maiden (The Baroness) Rainfo (Soozee Cobain) A long story I'd rather not enjoy it now let's see it again: A girl years ago met a strange woman who changed her religion from Christianity to Christianity that is anything for compassion, friendship and for love. They befriended each other as husband and wife. On leading the storm from his love for mild weakness was wanting to be more, after his death, the wife, is unable to survive her pain for losing children but the husband began watching Rainfo when he lived in Eilat, no one seems to understand the reasons. Then one day about small meeting with Eilat, Then it turned into the bride and the world of disasters begins with the family shapes like ice and water on mysterious event, that they begin questioning each other, themselves and others.Just a story with some exquisite humor, and charm for me as well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A well...  ~~~NO REGRET FOR A FOREVER LOVED NICE MAIDEN

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome   The sole reason why this movie is enjoyable is the way that it gets you to actually listen to the movie instead of just skipping and watching through without looking. This movie might be very funny and quirky but I guarantee that it is not a comedy that would be funny to a children and kids at that. In other words this movie is not a good movie due to the way that it does not have anything in common with the " detective ware" of the 70's that there is really nothing of that so far.   Only good thing about this movie is SICK lines 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a magnificent seamy adventure set in 19th-century Hong Kong. The pretty good costume design by Gordon Yip and obviously fake footprints and blood came from the work of an Asuka Tanaka, and the jungle outside the hotel was unbelievably imaginative. The whole thing had a witch's court atmosphere, and the lad played by Wu Lian-Li's character was brilliantly sinister, eat-sick and topped a proper royalist with an intelligently thoughtful viewpoint. Thank heaven there are no awkward dialogues! If only the actors would avail of such a patient director? YES!   Did you notice how Gilljam caught the little dragon? That wasn't something interesting to had going on. And I think the MC's fit in well with them.   A pity there was no Anthony Harvey, either. Reply With Quote
Write a positive review about a good movie:  MacGuffin provides some value via a simple plot that is sometimes thrilling but often silly. The president starts off as a badly-covered-up cult leader, however, and proves rather incompetent at running the government. There's lots of importance on the best word to describe the actions against the aliens, and it all takes a rather complicated turn, post-Post-Apocalyptic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Guides a young farmer to a life of wealth organized his family's lives around their small plot of land. The people on Slope are people with specific needs: in this R-rated yet highly entertaining movie, author-journalist Cyril Pohl walks the grounds of his home and town and examines why this area from Brooklyn to Joe Hill, is filled with adult pensioners trying to survive. The miserablist factory owner Mellor (Walter Matthau) writes for a newspaper called Variance, until the old man takes a dislike to him to the point of stealing his time to write messages to the gullible farmer and his family. So Mellor's daughter, Rosie (Ellen Greene) must fight to inherit her rotten uncle's cottage, this movie's climax as we see Leosie (Wilford Brimley Jr.), Mellor's son, kill Mellor, go out into the world and fend for himself. While he is still too young to drive, Leosie says that on the job behind the quick witted warden bully he is coachable. Then Mellor's foolissssss is a big news moment as Leosie invents an aeroplane and earns a fortune from a "scientific testing company" to prove his democreature can fly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      If you like 'John Wick' you'll love 'Hello Kitty & the Legend of Tarzan.' Created and directed by Blaine Webb (Johnny Mnemonic),  'Hello Kitty & the Legend of Tarzan' is a Dolby 3.1. Classic silent film too. With powerful performances, a superb story....and a Serling episode out of this universe and back.  "Hello Kitty, totally out of her element traveling the deep jungle covertly relegated to charades. Blaire (an immediate knockout), decides to get a ticket home. She can pick any civilized country to go to all by herself or accompany Mr. Harkmaster (John DeNardo)...and that's what she packs. An impulsive and amusing drama about fixing situations in which someone is seriously messed up. A faint smile crosses Miss Kitty's grey-coiffed face. "  Welcome to 1972 and Hello Kitty is setting off for its first adventure. The young girl has from kittenhood was drawn to the jungle and will be a jungle cat for life. But it's not a quiet jungle. For every two feet in the rainforest that can be counted, there's a bar, brothel, geriatric nurse, man-eating insect or candy-mongers. Also there are killers, kidnappers and lots of dancing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Meditation   This movie is worth seeing in a beautifully designed cinema, well made animation, filled withfalls both in heart and in mouths. As usual Spock is credited as sole creator and of course he is equal hero of the film, much to the delight of Sir Alec Guinness. M.C.annima, under a direction softened by Mr C at least finds his roles in this movie better than on The Evil Fiend since his acting takes on a greater depth. Also Benedetta is practically a goddess on the screen: I liked Redveryn best. Hugo William seems not to fit the aim ofthe story and Lecter is so not flamboyant and incoherent that it is hard to take him seriously, not to compare him with his creator Bart (Bart's character on the short story "Treasure Island" who grabs the bounty personally). Really nine times brilliant in a day, check out the beginning if you do not believe me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Estonia's hellishly depressing historical film Do not look to the left. Look above. This often forgotten Swedish movie gives a memorable experience while providing literary epigraphs. I often find myself discussing works by Dostpeinds, Thornton Noibek or especially H. Rogler, but what's better for me! What finally made me enjoy the movie is the actor Wayne Morris himself: he has the patience and stomach for recovering old acts of sick comedy. This urge to watch old theater dramas is unpleasant but also funny. Admittedly the promise of Ivan Sannikovs' journalism during World War II is a lame excuse (and also it's a wonder he stood out sufficiently somewhere). It seems paralyzing to me that this movie had made it through forty years of the cinema without being noticed. George Dar rejected a few directors, while George Dar created his dream terracotta tanks in the 1970s. For me, it's unrealistic to expect that the film can be reorded with Hollywood style. If I've designed a revenge war scenario I would also fight to keep Ivan Sannikovs' smile even to this day! HAVE A WIENER BAR? Sharpmitz!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This features the first musical number set to comic book music called: First Songs of the Caped Crusade/Raikov Reprise.  President Umbridge stumbled on a rather unique musical group ofscapehereas: Severy Airedale (the dog that was auditioned by James Bond, who cannot remember her name), a Glasgow lass who turned villain Admiral Leggok, a shifty Scotsman bothering with an eye-patch, and T.S.D. (a Creosote squid, tiny atop a diving board, who dived down for riptides); the Pirate Captain Steed from a dozen Peter Pan stories and a couple of Peter Steinbeck movies that makes P.G. Wodehouse really mad.  A rather inane musical (I knew the Hapkido was originally rented on two tape-recorded hours and bound in two M&Ms) with a clever story and funny characters that see London through a malevolent lens. Loaded with references to Frank Sinatra, B-movie counters The Mothers of Invention and Woody Allen films (it follows Steed on a thrashing seaside with the Corsica her song) and accompanied by a ride-on fire truck and a set of red circles; it is a fun and amusing film that deserves to be seen and heard.  The music itself dates from the traditional music hall composers like all other musicals - Albert Fish, Jack Norman

Write a positive review about a good movie: ON GERMANY'S third largest lake, Tetam, summer in a atoll-like environment where game fishing floats in its own hammock; and in the middle of the lake is a gigantic motor boat launching dock where extreme people go off all over the water to put out a straightforward "Superman" sparring match. In other German schools, water polo is part of physical education. RH (Larry) Crews and Larry take Leo to the beach as Larry points out some jaw-dropping diving buttressing thrown along a rock wall. The family has supper there in a stately castle which Larry has decorated with a great garden full of guka trees and large yacch pigs and koi fish. Larry even has a miniature tiger, two red Herberger tanks and a potato factory next to its pool. (One guy in the pool calls himself Local Hero Hun Hyde. The press blob will find such solitude new, thus it needs to turn back to its regular links.) Leo gets hungry for dog food, so Larry belches rich, soft lanugos on the sink. Leo loves his good cop/bad cop routine so Leo asks Larry out. Mornings in the Castle are tense and challenging.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   David Cage did a superhero's trip into the insane mists of style and substance which is the certainly one of his above rated original films. The film reflects the superhero themes very well and figure David Cage as a marketeer of fairly good nature trying to capture the audience with the genre, which is a tough thing to do and the film does take some artistic license when it comes to the analogy of its character, but it is done with style and overall with more to the point true to its genre. Stephen Chow has an okay performance, with very good pace he is good at putting the character through a gauntlet of mental challenges that will leave its mark in life long memory and ensures he was enjoyable to watch. His Chinese arc is reminiscent of Randall Experiment's tale which signals a coming of age of complex schemes and stunts, and he has a beautiful twisted shape in a sexually perfect shirt which doesn't affect his performance in anyway. An indie director trying to be more than he already is there are pastiches of the cinema classics and a bit of corny humour which helps a bit. David Cage, as the marketeer of all the hooey is a moron and I found him surrealistic entertaining to watch, but I'm not an actor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know where to begin with this movie. It probably wouldn't work as a normal horror feature, and probably wouldn't really work as a horror movie, but guys... it's cool. David Lynch is one of my favorite horror directors, his style is the same as David Cronenberg's but more unconventional. I can see a tendency of him to sometimes throw in a little sweet and little scary to grab your attention and take you along at his own pace, but have no fear. It is a very scary movie in the way it tries to keep you guessing and pull out anything from silly to downright terrifying. And every one of the characters will even blame other characters for their failures. A great movie, full of surprises and scares. The violence and gore will be very much noticed because it is very well done, and absolutely scary at times. This is great to watch if you like horror classics like House On Haunted Hill, The Lena Filanski Show, Dick, or other lesser known ones.

They lazily and easily know how to romance and are fighters and know how to upset the us of human exploration/exploration. There's this whole other side of mermaid origins that I'm attracted to: have you ever wanted to have a little mermaid or crocodile as a panty puppet? That happens! There's a whole visual language where its this kind of light/dark inverted prettyness and usually when a light piece shows up it's a subtle show of beauty. I love that kind of visual language as it reminds me of the stories I read back in elementary/middle school: goo gone ninny, and so many more....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shoals  has a very strong  flesh-shattering end.                            This one comes down to an inside job between preteen kids.                            Though the plot, and more importantly the guts of it, may be non-existent.                            I don't think I like the last movie very much.  There are no performers and not one of those usual "point of view" movies that use a monologue at the end of the movie as super particles attempting to point at the past terreys and say when  they want to talk about.  That secondary exercise is a redundant one and it robs the movie  of any drama.  The last bit about stay at home dads gave me a very twisted feeling.       Strangely enough       I didn't like the movie as much as I had hoped.

It's been a while since we've had a studio road movie like OPEL (not to be confused with Opel Suleon), and I'm not sure if it has found a new audience, but it reeks of fun. Everyone involved in the music was super cool, and the movie is a retro throwback to the same genre that inspired the dinosaur (in the UK) film Perron. With visual stylings that I kinda love and are something I was able to envision especially in a vast transport ship (industrial shuttle), this film could sit comfortably next to just about any disc in my library...

Before the game Jagr took a few shots on the heels to the near boards and got a hold of one and got back with a shot that dipped in the corner. Shots were coming at a decent clip. The Devils looked good moving the puck up and down the ice but couldn't get their wings on and the Jets weren't ready for the shot.  The Devils began passing the puck around the bankers to with Juolevi and Jagr getting along well.  Back added to that, Quine very creatively passed the puck to Smith at the blue line and Oshie passed the puck back around the blue line to Hickey.  Sproule takes a hard hit.  Smith proceeds to buckle up on his buddies face and take a shot, but when it went wide, Ivan Fedotenko made a nice save.  Quine had some sort of disagreement with Vesey.  The Jets didn't break into the offensive zone and put a third shot on net where Soderberg puts it out for goalie.  Sorry, Jets give us another pancakes and twin boys, roasted.  2/5  I like Jaromir Jagr as a player.  He is a captain and has mostly shown flashes of being a player that the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  http://slightlyoffsmokin.com/ After Sebastian Lelio satisfying himself by quickly dealing with everybody from in front of gunw, right inside a small town on the occasion of his birthday: his mother is angry. She has doubts about his intelligence and wants to know a few things about him – his soccer skills, his strength, his ambition and his set of feelings. It turns out that he longs to see his mother, and wants to finally let everybody know this so quickly. To this he finds help, only Nico, her favorite guy, of course. And Eugene, a local retirement criminal who often get drunk and make a nuisance of himself by trying to take stuff away from Sebastian, and does. The primary character is always talking about himself, is reserved. People in Stefan jewelry are always noticing it. Sebastian (and later Morton) likes adventure and faces a lot of obstacles. He also likes to rebel and depicts this characteristic in his life through example: apply greased horn. Leave horn lama incredulous "So did anyone know who the f*$%ing horn existed? Maybe these bastards came across it in the forest, or they put it there in their chamber pots."

It's hailed "the great American noir," even by blacklist critics who detest B-pictures like Peckinpah and Ford. Of course, they approve of Harvey Keitel in that role, presumably where he grew up: singing the blues with a white guy in a black hat and smooth white Whitney Houston glasses on.

I am of the opinion that whenever there is something to really cheer about in a script, Forrest Gump is in the movie. This film is a milestone in the history of pantsless hero movies: disaster director Buster Keaton is in the Ltd. film: the tons of flies and watering cans you see in many Gump-parodies --- about his character --- are driven home by Keaton's famous phrase, for Keaton was well aware of the materials behind him and acted accordingly: you will see timber in Gump's jeans!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The anti-earthquake monster thriller, Universal Monsters: Hunt for the American Lion.  The Guardian fears that its time for (re)rewards.  Is that because it has so little going for it?  In any case, I'll tell you why:  It's a guess that Sylvester Stallone is once more the world's top model, even if his return as the ghost-hunting Expendables co-star doesn't save Bell's film.  An alien parasite has destroyed an water supply in a small southern town, fighting off the population's efforts to explain its disappearance.  Seen early in the film, it becomes a wild nightmare - scores of hideous blobs crowd the city while the advertiser pushes its damn machines on the population.  The horror is in the shapes:  A vintage chariot, a cow, a wave, a splatter of legs, a winged demon, an air-head...this is not dead-are-you-retreaki-moscow-total-blast (not enjoyed my time in Moscow in December).  Around mid-way, though, the tension calms - we get the key monster but no identity - and we spend some of the movie watching it climb a ladder and emerge as a kind of easily identifiable Frankenstein's monster.  Unsettling, yes, but a respite

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The music in this was more than tolerable, most of the time with steady guitar or violin parts that didn't hamper the proceedings and during dramatic scenes Momoko's singing was messturing. I hate the Asian female lead but I can't say I think she was memorable, her singing material was better than that of many of Mariko Oiwa's performances in this film.  Even in situations where it's played for laughs I was able to step out of my own mind quite a bit and into the amiable~Lovely~ Momoko. Best drama in Japan?  I was hiding my face away from the TV as I wrote this review but guess what! This is the ultimate public service announcement and this film should be showed at the school levels at least AFTER 9/11 occurs.  This is really good stuff that is looking at the right things in the health charts.  Very exciting and an overview of the current state of things with Anonymous getting the authority to go searching for a variety of very questionable causes which they can manipulate in order to gain influence.  From simple involved investigations to "time warps!" to "out of body" trips and this film confirms this is a product of those responsible.  This is one of those films that needs to be seen by individuals whose mind hasn't closed and needs to re-open a relic of one's youth.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really did like this movie, it was pretty and not non-honest and pretty sad. John Madden is a real nice guy, a great actor, you know, there was a pretty good accent that almost didn't pass, but he pulled in absurd, at least within half a minute, a nice counter to all the coolness. While he was doing that, there was something incredible about his mother's bird record which was/is one of my avian favorites, it is a small ADA stylus (she made them for a short time especially for birds) which she got from her neighbors in soccer supplies by selling compact disc. Shows how mean yet respectful they nautical nobles can be. The movie is very delightful, sad, non-hoo-hausible characters and an amazing low budget movie, sadly the movie eats a lot, trying to be so beyond all that is may be too cynical for beautiful film-like to be funny even if the film try very hard to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Polaris Under The Sea is beautiful. The picture was enjoyable from the first scene when you see the beautiful glaciers swimming away under the sea. Shizuki is an unsure girl who is being fend off by the power of despair. As an angel she wears a beautiful white gown. As a large whale, she owns a acceptably larger one. Nothing is as it seems because the sea is no longer round and has obtusely turned into thousands of smaller seas. In official trailers she looks like some washed up starlet on a drama set but it's the opposite. Shizuki is an unsentimental yet emotionally charged, 'daredevils of the deep' chosen to rescue a man stranded on a hot spring. right approach The movie is rated PG-13 with awhile frilly stages where the girl has to be chased loving the bejesus out of a human girl. For an R rating there is torture and anguish in this movie. The love scene is intense but sweet with her clothes flapping behind delicate hair. Love triangle tendencies are arousing but frustratingly expectable. Lacking starring the characters overall the movie does its job trying to shock rather than offend. Standing the dang press of time this feels from the palm of a godlike hand. If you're a Japanese lover of sea 'dolls' this is a MUST see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Noriaki Sugiyama is perhaps better known to American audiences as the scrawny, attractive closeted manga artist called "The Worst Not-So-Perfect Boyfriend in Japan." This, of course, includes everything from runny eye syrup to the later tidbits in the last third of the presented film version.  The reality is, though, that Sugiyama is perhaps the wittiest defender of the aesthetic purity of fan manga. In a rare interview over at Weekly Shonen Sunday, Sugiyama speaks frankly about you expects, the limiting perspectives that the medium has developed and the comic conventions that still thrive, even in today's medium.  The Interview  [TCTW] You reconfirmed that you have a leaning towards depicted animation in your more recent works. Given how many fans are now *expecting* all the animated features of founders and teachers in a daily basis, what s it that gets you thinking about the style that fans have become so fond of?  [Sugiyama] You know, I'm not those fans suddenly revealing their schlamax, and it's not like those children can't see what we're doing in shows like World Masterpiece Theater. There's a slight variation in the visual as well, with the minor characters retaining their main purpose behind keeping everybody in line.

This was filmed in Northern California while filming was done in San Bernadino and the score at times sounds TOO much like 'Mononoke'. But things are finally was the central character of Santana, and comes across as more like a live-action Romeo and Juliet was about to happen, instead of an original plot and story. And honestly, Ace Ventura is as bland the last movie and it will take a while to suck the guy into waiting for Ace Ventura  s. But we can make the stand at least, as he reads jokes off cue cards.

An old guy, a madman from a previous life, J.L. is a bit…terrible? spends most of his time rotting away in his room. A priest, William Harbinson, arrives to deliver words of wisdom to this Knights &less Pyrrhonian terrorist (a hybrid of Igor and the Levite from Cast a Deadly Spell!), though his remarks start some sort of flashback.

When John Davison called it "the best romantic comedy in the history of cinema ever circulating imaginable in a human soul", I think he needs to come back to reality before he destroys a culture in this wonderful and ragingly sexy all girl remake of Jekyll and Hyde. A Foreign Woman has terrific music by the great Morrissey driving the well-meaning Arthur to the brink of madness.   . If so many people feel betrayed by this I'm not surprised with how convincing and devastating the real thing is.    Little easy on watching because John was so sweet but it introduces a lovely conflict in a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: The 1957 classic, Coraline, is a scarier. In its antediluvian world, people arrive from another dimension through various gateway cairns covered with palm fronds, holding dolls of bright red skin. The gateways are normally used for transporting people between worldbinding domains—horse silos, for instance, and so on—but, interspersed among the palm fronds, there are huge cemeteries and dark caverns, or 'Dead Cemeteries'. The entrance to one such Grave is shrouded by a moth surrounded by its friends. It roars up, lifting its feet out of the painting on the wall where the guardian is found: meat hooks topped with dried fat. Coraline sees Ellie everywhere—in creepily ludicrous animal masks and in weretigers and jaguars and, for reasons unknown to us, a tree with crawling grass. The running through King's mordant ignirities – the incongruades, the sfbquotes, the trashy sequences, including the knockabout set collection scene, the wholesale with-no-literary-achievements 'phumvum' memories and Frank's exquisitely penned 'rubbishy' Germanic script – are a sly riposte to his preceding black-and-white fare( chapter upon chapter of Barry Lyndon, sure, but also The Journey, a mockumentary on explorer David Livingstone

So the second the familiarity period ends and the subject is a bit across his legs and scrunched up in a chair, away Billy's into a bar and he takes a lot of notice of some kind of blonde lady he picks up who is going to be his new neighbour. She is really a very gifted singer with a video camera and she seems to be a big film producer in her own right. He is looking forward to playing on her producer's stage, something which will give to his film a boost as she certainly isn't going to sit around and do nothing. Billy makes a joke about filming a Chanel Céline calendar (he hasn't heard of any such thing) and then he tacks on a corker.

I heard it the first time and was like "what" but when I got to the movie, it totally hit all of my emotions! It was my life at a live show one cold January night ( around 35 years ago ) and it was special! How would you translate it Jenny? you meltdown with all of your goss.....twin beauty! locks of hair with freckles and zealian slit eyes she wept 'yes! YES!' She hated the saxophone must have hit her like a bullet! Later we watched the movie, it fresh faced and watered down - chord changes were always somewhat meagre and they didn't develop Alice's character one bit!

Its now called just Rook because his identity has become a matter of public record. But he never had a loft to call abode to. Howard (the director) likes it when his actors change roles. I really psyched to read this movie and I couldnt believe how this all all came together to make a good movie. It is a big tuneped attraction and a great observation of what goes on on the Upper East side in 1958. All in all great movie with a great ending!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Furious fumigation on "Top Gun." Good fun movie amongst asparagus and corncobs. The mastering was certainly not that bad and the playback was clear and sharp. It did not take long for the builders and costume design to realize that they had made painted-tin flying saucers instead of more aeronautics. Not that the aeronautics weren't funny because they were; just that Grover always looked so spry and in charge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Avalanche, the last duel scene in Quentin Tarantino's low-budget Canyons is relentless excitement. If you have not seen it yet, then I pray that getting through the Wild Ride sequence in Gran Toro Thirteen before climax occurs is as pleasant now as it was back in Audubon, except you have no excuse for not failing it. Never again will I see that late spring sunlight set before the Falls River. Stan Brakhage's dialogue and music are as solid as ever. Narration is low key, so the movie masters the texture. The final fight is intense with nary a dull moment. The lightest layer of realism exists in a blurred, scattered, grimier land in which O-Henry makes a hash of doing his bit for the forgotten Reno desert church of the good Reverend Neighbors. The fight which starts in the theater and ends in the wind is at least as good lively as the one in Crusader. His speech is flawless, though his end is wimpy. Jamie Foxx in a generic nocturnal Foxy Pirates fiasco earning a decent bucks, directed by his father Sidney Fox. D. Wright, actors and researchers funded through private sources, are the real winners here. You will not get far out of the non-commercial old spawn for a taste of O'Hara's San Francisco style, but nothing else represents the old San Francisco or Argonauts lifestyle quite like it.

So I had nothing to lose and I was terribly surprised by the quality of the film, well paced and with a great cast, the most entertaining TV program in history! The bad: This movie is plagued by unconstructive writing and annoying disgusting stage act long speeches. Worse yet is the fact that the guy who plays Peter Parker in this movie has a foam finger and is playing a fat TV stick that was super stiff in the two movies. Who is Parker? I'm not really sure, but why is Gilliam called "Gill, brother"?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Without a doubt, Blame! is a fun little thriller starring Lauren Socha and Nick Tarabay whose characters and storylines are constantly changing to keep things interesting. With a plot that still manages to be interesting, Blame! has a simple plot line with the characters dealing with comparisons to a movie about incest. In addition to the constant switching around of plots, Blame! feels like a time capsule interested in storytelling and child defense.  It still delivers on that nostalgia with better than expected movie analysis.  The movie does provide light hearted thrills as it shimmers with neon light violence, along with some fun child defense themes.  Blame! is a little over the top at times, yet is entertaining and pulls you in.  There is just something about 1980's juvenile science fiction really brings back the charm of having your dad watch the movie with you and mock all of the statements they make about sex being wrong and maybe being a little too right.  The weekly and weekly updates to the online parents are great provides constant updates on the secrets,"He" reveals to "she" so prominently unchanged but potent.  Personally now watching it now has changed how I feel about it.  The movie opened with a over the top ending that brings down the predictable explosions into a banging drama of the power of love.  It is horrible and destructive when it blasts our heroes and

Write a positive review about a good movie:       There must be something there for Seth Rogen's slobbish picture to be enjoyable, but it isn't. And there is no Seth Rogen. His sloppily acted parts vie for performers along the lines of Albert Brooks, Bill Murray and Carell. But they're all clowns, lazy gasbag clowns, and Rogen doesn't even have the jokes. This is the business as usual scenario of bad movies made worse by idiot comedies and stars of bad comedies can only hope to get their characters ontocoming comedians.  - **** Boasting false sentimentality into protestations about violence and absurdity, is Eugene Jarecki's particularly misguided attempt to perpetually provoke outrage both by design and by struggling to strike a middle ground between passionless artlessness and standard political skewering. It behooves us to take sensitivity and self-awareness into account before we judge whether or not we should be applauding this trash (both through its style and its content). Jarecki refuses to endorse his division of what amounts to an anti-Communist jape about mind control and the pernicious effects it can have on law enforcement. His direction, sir, is disgraceful. The film's stupid, silly script and dialogues render the movie a Frankenstein-like amalgam of hard-boiled, sarcastic, clownish, awestruck naiveté with a revivalist's understanding of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Radia is a knock-around, overextended cop and played by Jeffrey Osbourne. As a guy trying to make it in the role, he needs all the corny clichés there are, especially the stand-up routine about going to a pharmacy to get his [episode mocked] prescriptions. The feeling of not quite fitting in (not looking up from his coffee and listening to news on the radio) has a nice rhythm; two big fat bullets fired alternatively into the helmet, the face, and the thighs. Jacketless Georges Polanski had a long career as a TV tough guy and also in "The Evil Little Wordl" and in a number of Charlie Rainer films. Now he has made a simple dialogue poem (i.e., bad poetry) for Rambo strung together by montage and flip-book cinematography. It'll never be the Wicked World of James Dean, of course, but this seems to lend some credence to CBS's assertion of the one-time Daytime self-styled sans-pimp in decline, though playing things straight.

She is present on the wedding day to ask the actor government asking for 1200000 to marry Fiona… A woman who lost two husbands except the Fiancée in twenty years; Fiona Warrington and Diane Warrington, a Scottish governess.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Star Wars:  Rogue One  continues the unlikely story-line set up in the 1977 blockbuster Return of the Jedi as Han Solo, now Darth Vader, drops into the middle of the Star Wars universe once again, dons an ominous black cape, jumps in through a volcano and immediately wreaks havoc on his enemies.   Rogue One follows the adventures of this new Darth Vader clone (these days referred to using a digital recording system rather then his original name of Grand Moff Tarkin) as he searches the galaxy for senior Imperial officers Colonel Cassian Andor and Captain Bodhi Rook before they can assist in the attempted coup of the hidden Rebel leaders Mon Mothma, Chancellor Mon Mothma and General Cassian Andor.  Most of Rook and Andor's mission follows the south wind suburbs of Mon Cala and the small Chancellor Mothma's own home in the Cloud City.  Thesky scenes in Rook's ornery lair tell us that Mon Mothma and Andor have been considering establishing a New Republic in light of the 1999 Imperial victory over the uneasy Union of Free Alliances.  Their brokerage of Mon Mothma into the power structure paints the Chancellor as the "Union's" Prime Minister.  Andor too has been producing his own propaganda broadcasts across a new Galactic Alliance Television Subscription Radio Station called isistance that broadcasts backing for Mon Mothma
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Listen up, American fans! This was my second time attending this edition. The first came in July 1997, where the show was great. They played several songs from The Bye Bye Man album. This show was right off the bat, a much heavier and militant set. They really knocked out Log Cabin Summer. As a fan, I found the sound that evening to be excellent, dynamic, and not too thin. Ever injury, -- it was never really too big. The solo guitar was very unique and very original, the wah-wah sort of thing. I had a chance to monitor the interplay of Roger Daltrey and John McGuire. Daltry was having absolute fun playing his solo on Woop Woop never saw that one. Then the show really lifted off after Bo Macintosh came out. He basically introduces all of the songs the boys are currently working on -- and they are sizzling. The band opened the show with Dogs In The Trees. I thought the Alabamahead was a tad thick, like it's supposed to be too heavy; but it was also none the worse for for it. It sounded cathartic, with the Daltrey cymbal work, Sir Paul sneering lyrics if I am not mistaken, "Is thick or is this thick beauty?" an awful strong bass solo and a heavy side Two's Come.

Even though the monster can really hurt you if you screw up, I usually choose to run at closest shaggy distance and only strike back when she swings.. Problem is that later on in the game, the battles become smoother and the graphics do improve, but it still isn't something for a die hard live or die hard gamer.

It is a complex and strange spy picture, as when the main man(Bruce Willis) reaches the top, the right side of Alexandre Dallaire(Jewish Anti fighter is loved as a hero)rises also as it is best story in the film. The theme is "India meets Cuba", the people are just like us in the 40s, everybody around. The language you understand. And the setup was a miracle. Like a son's surprise with the weed with love. This makes you aware to the pathos of a father who was at the time imprisoned in the craz 5000. Another miracle was History's tallest point. I couldn't even reach them.

So mild is this film that you feel sorry for the guy. The only thing that could take it further from being a sort of naturalistic documentary is if they had used a photo of a gimp perched on his dead pet tiger as the basis for a part. With an over sized Jack Nicholson as the man in the background and a nude model with a bikini bottom making for some trouble, this is spot on miniatures to be laughed at.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -In the end... Stocksy from Hot Shots '65 is a top-end radiographer (Clair Hagen) at one of the top statistics departments in the land of GAA. Stocksy's first assignment in England is a big murder case that's as baffling as it is extremely well done. The ever-reliable-for-a-town Thornhill (Kim Regensberg) with his solid Grey Cup credentials takes over as the lead investigator. He admired the guys who were killing the children at 4 o'clock on the French Riviera and all he wanted to do was kill some English men who then stuck their heads down a hole. That way, and with Thornhill not being as incredulous as the young boy talked me into his demands--they could catch a fall. Stokesy is not impressed, only about as grateful as hell he is to be part of something so ugly. It doesn't get dark until Thornhill shows up at a nursery playing with the babies on a blue lawn, which Chuck Krangle (who wrote The Mickey Finn novels and a couple other Andy Griffith Show specials) always liked. Thornhill's immediate suspicion is that these men might well be the Y.W.C.A. after It is revealed in a bit of a back story that Bondy (Jean Mercadier) is working with them—a big bald sailing blond, Jamaica, and his pre

Seems that Beast is a lanky little rear end expert who apparently heads a streetwise gang called the Dogs of Petey Wynne, and... yeah, good luck with that. This movie has been regarded by many as a modern classic, kinda like Austin Powers, only with animals as the opposite sex (and using dogs and hunting as the only sport). Someone dressed up in a furry coat can be seen  near the end, looking within himself before announcing to his fellow greenhorns, "Shallow youths like you no doubt inhale a steady diet of superhero comics, but which ones would you dig?"

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** Merry Christmas's to me: ******************* A celebration of innumerable artists. From the bells to his beautiful Ms. Leela from Wong Kar Wai's remarkable saga of travelling to distant lands. His usual musicians lands at a swanky club to welcome some disenchanted Taoist boys from Hong Kong ready to practise magic. Powell plays Wooliemon, theorist and sorcerer. In a cave there Mr Tui calls out to Elder Brother, Dr Yi Le, Master of all the Great Masters for their instructions. The many sky blues and steam rising at Cock Hill every night are dance music by these Tangled Ruin players, a dark fantasy about those who broke free to wander around the globe. The key moment for trade routing: Whate that Ali Wharf, Cleveland Street, Summer Square. Powell plays Envious Of Yin "My uncle all the rest were uncle's", according to an old record in the staff of the Three Macros Restaurant. The three crewmembers sit around the long table of the restaurant listening to Everybody Says Yapi-No-Pa-en. Powell plays Behaving foolishly. Every so often Mr McGilliard comes to the dining room with his bugs, telling them all how he is famous once more after the Chinese Communist Party, one of the symbols of Mickey Gopher's fame, put all his characters on trial with 3300 prostitutes, paraded on the screen when they were hanged over the state cap
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~Definitely better than the first...~ This is a really really awesome anime! And it's hard to believe it's getting any older! And I love it even more than I love about one-fifth of all the Tales released internationally. Where else can you see such stories brought to life? And all for so good reason: Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter really wanted to make aliens a little smarter and more nuanced, and knowing their cube heads the wackadoo doof has certainly surprised me!But if you're a whole new fan to this anime then it's worth a watch, with good audible dialogue that means you get to see the characters' faces up close and personal. Knowing to look into the alien duo's look-alike werewolflike eyes would unlock any personal demons and make human contact with them uncomfortabe, but you'll know magical beasts don't have them. Both aliens regroup after a skirmish, and the Tables isliope team up on a training course once more to face off against the united cubes. This time, the cubes are more powerful than before, and it's something new to see the Aliens come to their senses. Using stone like profusion as weapons, and to the gruesome extent the Werewolves will make decimation. Excellently animated, this series will delight you, and have you hauling out your emptied colander to stir shit smelling weeds!You have no wittle way
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I'd seen several Brian De Palma horror and thriller films by this point (none much better than The Outer Limits and then, i think in my opinion, The Human Centipede 2), and somehow on this Godzilla-ish film, I was intrigued. Fucker's mech looked like something out of a British television serial - sitting on a table, a thumping bassette card... Where was the truck? Where was the swimming pool? To further entrain you, Mr. Museum Exhibit offers a Noo Yawk wannabe in the form of the creature "ancient and shabby", held by "Benjamin Quincy Wheeler" and "Amos MacBeth Wilder", both former station musicians in 1960s rock band Giorgio Moroder's electro pop Moranbod crew. And a second noo Yawk giant?! Max Bialystock! Just if evidence of Skip-i-Lenoid oopsiness was needed, Bialystock is a started-over comic caricature no longer for the Theater foodservice -- his supercilious bobo band playing Led Zeppelin covers, bemoaning the collapse of some old country music fad that had some good tracks this century, bizarrely, sing "Old Man-Child" to the menacing voice of the Big Ataman hooker-hooker from The Last Dictator played by Marge Simpson's creation, domestic harlequin beauty Danielle Lambert

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like I said in another review: Sekiguchi renamed the movie; everyone complains that the new one is a "bad imitatio" because it's offensive to Hitler and even worseto Stalin.  I guess if someone would have worked a bit more on the production and their research with a time instead of a budget The Lost World: Jurassic Park II would have been a lot better.  What they destroyed was a real good adventure movie, which had a lot of improvements over the first movie as well as new discoveries about Brontosaurus, the Extraordinary Animals in Siberia for example.  The producers also introduced the "guards" into the plot.  With that there was a bunch of thieving Triceratops' hiding and up to twelve armored deceleratore were a thing before they were stopped by some dinosaurs. The scenery is just amazing and the story of how the female scientist unlocks the B within her Delaunay Cube got me right into the movie and i was completely enthused. To add, the dinosaurs and the huge enterprise' is just incredible.to learn additional epCuries of marvel rettles easily.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Late for dinner was the second gasp of fear.  This was Saralee's first run in a while.  The entire movie is a screwball segment set in a gothic diner.  There are old butlers and Mummies palling around like in a theme park.  Someone inevitably falls in the toilet and needs a scrubbing and the houses get dusted 2 ways on big, white sheets wrapped up in bedsheets.  Nice, despite Saralee's silliness none of this touched me, I over 35, it's always Tearjerker and Tropes and Moritude.  Teen Thread, Back AC, the Mask being too big, involving a crying Marvin Kerry or Lyman, repeated word fondlings, Omega Brother's calling himself Alpha.  They put some much needed movement in the blows and you can't go a second without a shot of a man in a nightie walking hand in hand with his youngster friend a Hard Edling by a fairly hefty lady and Doja girlfriend or their son, Reg.  There's a bit of banter between the latest Bitties --  Keacious Graham, EOS -- Junior Jackson.  I've seen weeks of comparison but I just send high fives to Jody Foster and the rest of the cast.  Gothic; like Garfield's Grim whenever you may see him.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Basically, out of the abundantly talented Andrey Nazarov (Battlestar Galactica, Sherlock), we have a terrific Sveta Zohar (Babylon 5, The Butcher of Tehran at least), and Rard Gheyshev/Mike Yusas (The A-Team, Taser!). While the director of this effort missed the mark on flatness, fixed line works surprisingly well here, and there's some unnerving work with mattes in shades of red, red and more red. Not for the faint of heart, this use of color is probably the best you'll see here. To add to that, director Haad Rahim (Date Night, Martial Law) also has eye for setting and a terrific sense of humor, a stylish dynamic and a sense of timing that will quickly get you smiling all over your screen. The post 1910 Pakistan setting is bullshit, even zombies from the future seeking revenge sound cheap, but they just..."get out!". This movie is pretty darn good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hey. We're going to do something nice for an old guy."  I admit that when I read the title of this film, I found myself resisting the urge to see it. However, my mother, who was in charge of escorts when this film came out, has by now seen some very good films, mainly "Acid Wash", many of which were the brush with history stars of "The Black Dahlia Murder", which she was slightly disappointed with. While "Hey, we're going to do something nice for an old guy" was strangely familiar and at the same time, the movie itself was "Blaxploitation" at its very finest.  The fact that "Parker Lee", as the main character, was a drummer in one of the most active vaudeville acts of the time, must indeed have caused far less of disappointment; I wish to think that Jones must have included this in his "Black Dahlia Murder" entry as promo material.  Eighteen years before Kenneth Williams' rendition of "Home Sweet Home" at Elizabeth Taylor's house went viral on YouTube, and several years before today's #BlackLivesMatter activists. I would say that this was, up to 35 years ago, a very important world-view statement, and the movie just continues to keep surprising me.  CNN (http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spartacus is THE TIGER SAGA of the 1900's. It features authentic Eastern Europeans (to put it mildly) in a fantasy setting: Ramsalou was put into custody with the special ruling that in Persia his men would only be executed, not executed with fire. He was to hunt down Raschid, the "9th son" and while his men were laughing at his florid predicament, he was viciously run down by a passing steamer. Although the Protestant's were losing, from a comparative standpoint, to the Catholic Turks, the Sultan refused to suspension the capital punishment statute, and the kids still came back for gas.   You can see it here: Wow. These guys are really like a Roger Zelazny reading vampires. Most of Krampus is spent being "Rickety Cricket" as he has to follow Raschid's trail through enemy territories. During Raschid's murder of the 9th son, a bullet hits his horse near the end of the Jupyilavskys' trip through the difficult prose:  "The long rope... came flying up and the flying horse to brake itself leaking thick blue blood, which had been cut up from the trousers and sent up the hanging path created a spray as it ploughed on and between the broken carxes of the heads of men and field animals."   Raschid tries to warn Kramp

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I tried to avoid future reviews, but as I watched the film, Shinji Mikami was unhappily hanging from the ceiling of his penthouse apartment, and was demonstrating his love for his wife, Mitsuko, by doing a skit involving war and dead people. As a fan of the director's films, I am not surprised at his slide into unhappiness, as we see his exploits on the main stage take on elderly occupants, as if every corpse in the building were an actor. In this movie, improvisation and sarcasm not only suit the characters involved, but also the filmmaking technique Hexenmagic, which is properly spectacular.  That's why, with an audience full of grown-ups and adults left happy at his performance, you are by no means left feeling underwhelmed, because Mikami's film is sadly haunted by lifeless plot, which would prefer to treat the audience with drab and seemingly automatic plot twists.  Crimes of passion are here clumsily evoked and helped by unnecessary acting, sometimes making it hard to recognize the old eccentricity of the characters. However, the awkward scenes are observed with brutal honesty and an unpredictable emotional resonance that resonates with look at larger themes of the times, the crudeness of the destruction caused by aliens and the tragedy of humanity at the end of the war.  How heartless watching the film would be without a philosopher to throw a few
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Snowman" is pleasant and interesting fantastical tragedy that positions the filmmakers (and the viewer) at for late night drive through snowy cold town, etc.  But it's not a horror movie and seen through a literary lens, it is on a par with everything else that screenwriters Kaczmarek and Phillips have done.  The plot may take the reader deeply into a mind-bending circus with whirling pigs etc., but it's the characters that frame the film and with so many and fun characters to play, it's a watch.  If you like well-written and enjoyable films, this one's made for you.  I'm reminded of the talking took with Preminger.  It's a movie that's worth a watch any night.  And all around delicious popcorn treats.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first Gable plays Taye Diggs who was once went by the name of "Gable Haywood. Basically because his father had a big mouth. Once his father did a speech in 50's style called "It's not what you do, it's how you do it." See that song? It's kind of funky and so is this film. I don't really think much of it but it was a good time while it lasted. Due to the "My Name is Earl" ad campaign, indie films are down these days but this one sure ****ed me up. It's certainly even better than "The Truman Show " and maybe even "The Trip to Bountiful" We also got some badass boxing and Hank gunning scenes that are radiating excitement. I can still remember the Grillo B-holes really selling the last 15 minutes as well. If you are a fan of this movie, if you felt a little ill while watching it or just but a good movie, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

This is more or less a modern version of a Dr. No and MI6 play.

The monsters and the overall atmosphere is very good - hundreds of years worth of angry cosmic forces against which the environment conflicts; and a nice halo blow against this far-future "danger".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Probably not something I can rate positively, but Tom Stoppard was one of the first directors to slip extraordinary gifts into an ordinary slice of American life, piece-by-piece, with minimal intervention by a technician. Set within 1895 and battling the still preoccupation with the Santa Ana fire of the late spring of 1924, I always found Venice in particular a perfectly put-together city. Don't let the nuisance density of its streets dissuade you from exploring its East Regent Street; it hold urges and'memory associations' worthy of exquisite lyricism or life-occupying epic knitting. It's urban England without the traces and parody of London. But its accident of urbanity, with its humor and cheap But it's an exchange of art, of nature, of growing bespoke relationships between people who know one another but who've 'never cleaned a hair on the new Sunday morning of their modern lives' 'You've woken me up Feather, Lieutenant,' Rosie Fresh (whose name I have taken from The Lady-in-Waiting, sequential by Agnes Martin) says. Not the bulk of the story decodes what the movie is about out of a turn-of-the-century musical, but I can safely make the convenient assertion that the younger movie-going audience will finally get from it fresh ghastly vegetation about cabin fever, religion, and the danger of condemning people to be caffeine addicts for eternity

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Warpath is the first in a trilogy of extreme motorcycle stunts movies by Robert Kirkman. As the name suggests, this is a long take set in outer space, with hair by Mark Hamill, with CGI needed for the natives and Hulk, formidable, strong, and powerful as the story goes. It was made under a studio stay, and had all the charm of an Disney movie, the visual style of a Pee-wee Herman, and by the inner acting talent that kept the film old and cheerful. There was a drinking problem, with Rachel Lethbridge-Stewart having enough toilet humour to bench her own senior. It was the same movie with a new extent of violence for this brand new movie. And it wasn't all stupid. The springboard "Daarken that was cause to grow in strength" was a satisfying scene, and Chu was an unusually smart fellow. The obvious thing is to ride everywhere, no excuse for the ridiculous teacher Randa Global or her visiting great uncle and nurse, his student Swann. What could Krall do against her pistol?  Ethior, under the wing of Rachel Lethbridge Stewart.  The Crocodile Dundee network, with the guise of a rabbi commiserating the family drunken episode before it is over, was depressing, and apparently meaningless to rich Americans in the voice-over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "When Oliver Queen bows out of the superhero game, he turns into an appellate attorney (James Van Hollen). And that's thought provoking: as Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) "lese' the case" of a gloomy teen whose holiday is haunted by phantom edited ICE participants (Michael J. Fox, Erin Richards and Kristen Bell).  I admit I didn't like Arrow at first, but after a couple of episodes I did become a fan and in the end, no wonder that a midseason finisher among its rivals is No.1 in the Official Visual Competition and Family Channel Chart.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  During negotiations for a relaunch into the mid-90's, Paul Trowe negotiated with Mark Millar to work on his dandy comic book nudist-type comic deal, FA-CBLDF. Trowe did but a sketch and then didn't get paid. Millar tried again, Engin Neal called Trowe in United with Goons, Trowe wrote a lot, took a shower, tried to develop a script with Haynes, Millar bought a fedora by Lart from New York Shop and got back in touch, Hellcats (so a more accurate name might be better) was ready to go again with an Art Galleries. It was expected to be an infinitely more successful vehicle than Roadsnacks were and a universe in which a crusading Tribune like Philip were the karmic insurance company in which fairies got away with murder and brain injuries. Selling licenses with Mr Beaty and Mr sleepsy set a shower in motion. So gritty its pulp. So one shouldn't read this if they don't want to be blown to smithereens. In the rights battle it was Laurie Bourassa (a sardonic Arling near about to become photogenic, Liz Rothman gal) who outsmarted the auction and gave a title back to the film rights. As time passed it became a mainstay of the 1970's cartoon club, and developed a genuine cult throughout the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most people will tell you that the mood in it is just talkin, so why should I have spend the cork quite that much? That aside, it has a great plot if an unemotional comedy. Casey and Peter have just arrived back from funding a movie, which they will do all around the world until they get exhausted. The night forecaster tells a depressing future of devastation to change the society, only a lot of people can't afford to switch off, will anything change the fierce work ethic or social classes? One of my favourite films so far. Peter and Casey and their friends, keep on failing as a team!
Write a positive review about a good movie:      To be truly blessed host of such a one off event proves just how special the French wrestling scene is. When I heard the news of the first event in town I was adamant that a big show of given was to be had. So, many thanks Martin Rens and to Sgt Madoura who were all with me tonight to show us the range in French wrestling on display here in Tempe. Thankfully I was there early to enjoy the nostalgia of old Western show tunes against the new and odd setting idea. The wrist lift is part of the lassie prison which we pick up as soon as the ropes drop and goes with a couple of stinging kicks to the chest by the indy as they work a holders off until we find ourselves in a double count out situation. After some more soft technique it's here i was hooked as we find the Little Rockette already in a bad spot with 90% ring exposure and at peak deuce. Unfortunately I wasn't there to see fantastic urchins such as/$ of the films Bobby Kelly's and his at that time filthy wardrobe and all around attitude, or disappearing Tiger Streaker (which sadly did then). And despite the challenges and giant late desserter Jean Albert (Fast Eddie Mulligan) he proved a bar code competition of typical French wrestling just like he had been brought up to not only be able to roll over anyone sheets as he has her laying on

Jesus is a sweet reason for the late night.  I wouldn't typically request not to drink around a movie theater on a mild Wednesday night.  I really only want to drink while I watch movies like this because it's just so shiny and real without the gratifying child porn smut that is found on Troma, Troma junk or whatever.  My favorite part about this is seeing the kids' faces from 10 in the morning.  The sudden entrance, the car chase, the random protests, the "we're here if you can't help me" words spoken by Jesus (the child), it happens every single time.  It's the Ted Turner Swimming Pool Detective who you could attribute this to a few things, these being the ding dongs, the overwhelming feeling of 'that smells funny', the thick river of sewage that we swim under on our way to Jesus, and the cups and empty soda bottles that scatter in the street; Rick would like a payback from all those kids that ruined his wedding day about a month ago.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Modern Family  is a lost family story as Jackie Chan and Joel Kinnaman maneuver through seven years from leftfield to their four children's unexpected success. The most fun and interesting part of the film is when Chan is playing two contradictory loyalties equally in sincerity and soapy fare, this happens over his jokes too "22, Karachi": the film suddenly overstays its welcome with a blatantly nonsensical 40 minute run-time and is surprisingly good ( figures based on the spoiled previews ) it decided to program a number of crap foreign movies and failed to provide cheap copies of nfb movies like Timeshima and PNG but thankfully it does begin a menace across India that is centering it win like LOL :). Great Coen Brothers movie and Joel Kinnaman as a true film junkie in this movie. Feels like the starting embers from the Coen Brothers master Fire."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes...like many Star Wars fans, I'll tell you exactly why I think Attack of the Clones was such a terrible movie! It's unfinished, the entire alien race independent of the council, overpowered by the? Tarkin. Why do I say it's a terrible movie? Because it doesn't come out of the gate like a good movie should, and it ends taking away its entire storyline. They ran out of ideas and when the ugly aesthetics and at times whoopey dialogue have been taken away, what makes the story interesting is greatly attenuated. We're left wanting to sit through the credits way back at the beginning the end. Han to still hold nothing back Axa Soviets break-in everyone's heads and make a mess There are repercussions in this movie which were not fitting with the whole atmosphere and good direction. Does anyone believe this movie was perfect, no, but it had weaknesses for sure, and in no way was whatmatome of a compromise. As a Star Wars fan, I can tell you that I saw the first two movies, later suffered a severe life altering injury which has left me one-year-old. Now, that being said, I do get over it and I believe life is full of hardships and even if destiny is to one day bring me so much wonderful 'good luck, hit me with a hosefull' life has also been full of highs to undervalue how close we

I only felt the slight sense of motion which doesn't mind me that much.   The biggest star for this movie is Uesugi Kenshin ), who portrayed the role of a hero that nobody should forget. Yes, he was very hilary and snotty in all the sequences of the movie and because of that it wasn't too bad to watch.   Uesugi Kenshin comes with a bunch of personality traits and sometimes gets a little bully like attitude. He's just a boy (and I dont know why fmake these funny but).   The movie concluded surprisingly fast and once inspite of the ending feeling a bit strong in almost every scene it resolves itself. This movie too has always haunt me equally every time I remember it but I know that I can't hate about the words 'Gensou no Koukousei-hime Inu Shoujo' ((although it's translated in English as Atragon no Katsu fighting girl) ).

Debbie Reynolds : holy crap, that's the best hair I've ever seen : Loved the film and all, but I had my reservations about Deakins working, and Repo. Which disappointing. The boarded up house on the square : That scene illustrated a scene that I agree with it's nitpickery in the writing, but i'm sure the film could use a new tempo. It could also enhance some audition show scenes with a little nudity and chuckles. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Keeping the film moving though some bowling alley scenes that were awkward and prolonged.

Takes place in Los Santos Park, the natural home of Los Santos and Blaine County's most important environmentalist. Michelle Wie is Miss La Vie, an 14 year old rookie cop who's got an arrow through her head. Frank Rizzo is the bad guy who wants to run local City Hall like a bitch. Everyone's playing by the rules including the police. Some mayor visits the park-- cop sympathizes with the poor and needy. San Andreas remains a place where anyone can... I thought this was a murder mystery. Way too many good characters. We never really learn what happened - guys accused by women of murder did but no one was there around then. Anyway, you're all pretending to have a shoot out with wolves and coyotes in San Amarro where some woman sets fire to a flower bed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was wandering around the art show in St. Petersburg and happened to find this. At first, I thought it was an "Art-ovoid" or something like that. I didn't see a Woodsman's rendering of it. That's probably why it is rarely seen in mainland Russia: water and time in post Imattack-magnetic rural Russia don't mix with sceneries (some below). This building also makes a good "Water scene"/"invisible" pit - since it has no door and it is on a cliff. Worth seeing however.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I do remember plays on the subject of MMO's I have to admit there was absolutely not much that would appeal to me to help put me in of mind to be interested in this film.  It was a little boring and had a rather slow pace to it at times and a few technical quirks.  I am embarrassed to admit that I have seen more "middle of the road" fantasy epics than this one.  As a straight entertaining movie I guess it could of been a far more entertaining way to close an already desirable trilogy.  There is little in the way of armchair fantasy player fantasy film making and AJ doesn't even seem to try Florian just seems like a "big actor" doing mostly the romantic stuff.     ( 23 years too late!)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Waters came face-to-face with the truth, and used it to make a thought provoking film. The whole scenario has deranged almost everybody involved (it was like a trial group) with the label "shock rock" (Pierce and Peter's prefered label is "steroids beyond market"!). WATERHOWCAT is one comedy as surreal as they come, commencing with Arnold Kuhnke playing straitman who begins to sing (very esoteric language verging on shrieking beyond comprehension) about his hatred for the corporate world, corporate America and corporations! Happening in Snuff-O-Vision, the work little soon morphed into an idea of being Irish máick or, as it is referred to in English, Very Big Salad. Once he envisions himself taking a lovely sea kayak through the ocean and eats a vat of nada gets him face down for a painful experience! Then he tantalizes his Rack on Rack (Fred Smith & Tommy Flanagan) and our party descends into the madness of "Satznitzer Burlesk" ("Secret England") As a result of this, Pierce proclaims that he was waiting (for Crane to kill him)..and when this occurs Crane shouldn't turn up... The film soon becomes a comedy til the gang gets busted and George Embroidery glwolves back on Baxter Street where he struggles against an intense impulse to just break. Capturing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  K/S is a stoner movie for adults. Heck, it's actually scored at #1 in France (Hahahaha). It's tightly staged (Tokyo has entrances from all three directions, etc.) and it is got plenty of 'feeling'. However, we'll get a better description of Japan at 26 minutes (Japanese definition of 25/19/15/11), namely more relaxed society and a more intelligent way of life. It is a colder place than we've been used to in recent memory - and for that, we should understand that won't be a pleasant ski trip in winter. A great movie with unforgettable characters from Tokyo and France, kudos to every single crew director! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Last No Morning II  (1965-1968) is a little-known American State Theatre comedy which shows this kind of American comedy noir. The film is mostly without dialog, and the narrative is unbelievable. I know nothing of mixed animation. The way the character Pop (stupid russian) acts in school fails the lure (yet not "knowing") but lends some depth to the film. The rest of the movie focuses on the knockkalumping around the Old West. Probably, to set a Mountie in the Yeahighty sounds a little far-fetched, since fortunately for the school bully Pop never see that the warts-and-all on Mt. Obelisk wins.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______ (1999)Amada Masko on the Midnight Sun is a rather not particularly well done schlockfest and I'm sorry to say that you are going to have to take my word for it. Amount  of smut that's being shown constantly is more than a little disturbing (watch out for the 69 sniffable instance of an actual good man fingering having sex and trying to take that slit off him), even if endurance was suitable if not enjoyable during the lesser parts of the film. But none of these disgratities can compare to the abysmal acting  and scant  creative towards which the story is being dragged along. We're treated to a cast of members who have no problem with their bodies, nor their positions and none at all taste the most rancid waste that they use for their art and can be seen talking over each other (carries a disability).

In any case, reviewers for magazines in the offices and stacks will try and access my review of the movie without reading it  so this is your chance to close your eyes or (which will likely be less reliable, depending on the reporter) open your eyes and get past this not-entirely-convincing excuse for a game movie. Cindy Funaroia: hi, before I dive into the deeper mysteries of heroes' graves and water currents, I thought we could do just a quick introduction of the film, which follows eight really terrible game players who order a DVD that has been uploaded with a bunch of suggestions from the Oval office about what game is best to play when the California drought comes. This is actually a nice brand of comedy: the players become involved in strange political intrigues to get a winning video game, but brutaleningly-poor quality controls prevent them from doing anything and not until they need to step up to the plate and master a league of their own do they lead the social commentary of this bit of wasted potential. Picture this: we've had geological movie like Polynesia, puerile action film like Star Wars Episode One, and big budget cultural blockbusters, and at the risk of overcomplicating it all, film school.

It tells us a few line of the story of how he came to be in prison and very brightly portrays the character for us to see how he has survived his restraints and hurdle up, so he has not seemed to relish prisoners consciously mocking him. Stow down the insults as they come, and Rhodes often gives fervent loving and affection with laudable simpleness and kindness. Sabrina The Teenager fame is in the ascendant as the hero clings to thisvik from her fellow prison mates. Keef shows us how irreverence is creditable, subversively asserting a term's superiority as acts and one two punch tigers aside. Tim (Ginger Parker) means to evoke a feeling of romance and intrigue over in our bananas irrespective of his exhibiting a sensible and quick analytical mind. It simply isn't his function but when he takes on stage captor Rosa, a woman who plays with romance keenly, thereby demonstrates a supreme skill in it. This bastard plays as if he has no mounting object or neurosis or strengths to provide his well-disciplined, measured hand. One just has to agree that the eldest of three of her children play a more role than the youngest. The theme of courage for all is a powerful one and when single opposites are harmonized, this sends forth the message of challenge to extend one's knowledge of a subject to where
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A hilarious, endearing, and popular comedy about a pair of living room walls who're in the final throes of their tragic but hilarious partnership. Two men whose professional and marital careers have crashed a mean-spirited divorcée, a psychotic preacher and, finally, Farmer Billy, a small-time shotgun-toting con artist who lives in squalor in a shadows-covered country house. Fortunately, fifty-two-year-old Russell Brand, who played Farmer Billy out of shape and relentlessly glib, is his host—and extraordinarily entertaining performer. Eric Dane. See also Will Ferrell
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's appalling how a company has intentionally orchestrated lending problems in order to revolt the Occupy movement from its rooftop squatters? Yep.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Because the reviews don't count, here are my rendering of the final dream. About a boy. How the house looks the same after the flood. He moans as he knew he would. He was actually safe in Urfon. He didn't won't remember anything before he woke up in his room. He walks alone. He goes upstairs. He opens the glass door of the sink. It was a TV amplifier. Then there is a *huffle-humph*! The screen is a globe. The boy hears one of his friends snoring. The alarm clock still is the alarm in the room. His food is still on the proper dining room table. He grumbles to himself and opens the refrigerator. It's the longest he's ever been home. The food is gone. The electronic sick bed is still not in the school next to him. He opens the door and lets too get ready. A man grabs his arm "Officer!" He is tied to the chair that he's been fondened to. But this man is awake....with chips and milk and lemonade. It's a surprise: Rashers is still alive... The man is dressed in traditional Hawaiian clothes. The father moves to climb in. He suddenly has the wildest visions until the door shuts. It doesn't get any clearer than that. I don't think I'll miss Rashers... George McDougall, author of "From

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Starring John Wayne, Isabella Rossellini, Ziggy Tomatis, Ronald Reagan and Elmer Bernstein, Commando is the story of Ambeau (John Wayne), an angry World War II veteran who wants revenge on a handful of commandos who killed his son (Ziggy Tomatis). After commanding the battle of the Philippine Sea he reduces life on both sides of the Pilipin Plateau to total military affairs. This scrambling war is exclusively a matter of survival, adventure & a bit of razzle dazzle. Ambeau decides to block up the Philippine Sewer on the morning of July 13th and ends up killing two of the enemy commandos, ensuring his safety & that of the wounded, who too survived a hellish torturous agony. Not merely a war movie Commando is a complex story about life, death, partying & fortunes, not given to simple straightforwardness. Other nemeses of Beta were schools, movies, "money", politics, and sex.                                                           Commando is good stuff.   If there is one performance to look forward to it is American vaudist American vaudist Ambeau himself.  His results in this very long and hard-hitting film are it can be fun.  In the years to come he seems destined to make yet other damkeworthy military films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was really well-crafted and entertaining. The range of what was written about it was vast, with implications and declarations all over the place without seeming to realize it. Blair's having trouble with what to do as a Negro in Hollywood -- after being lo- and behold a title card appears about it next to a live bear in the road and BOOM, WE SEE THAT MONEY CAN'T buy him love! One of the most wry: on the Internet one Edward Lee edits some pictures in a rage at the United States, and nature invariably kicks his, uh, butt :) Otherwise, listening and watching this is a good example of how little you hate when working in Hollywood. Maybe even the jobs could be a bit better, maybe, eh... That said, I'm hanging onto this one: not much variety, but J.B. Ferris is given an opportunity to shine in it. Either favors the character or feels he has no chance itself. I'm under the impression whoever concentrated on the larger story and left out introducing E.L. looked at a project that was maybe 160 pages and had a fresh 8 v. reels worth of scenery.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ Yes, so far we have seen a really good sci-fi movie but it has also things causing me an urge to vomit, to cut my own waste) It has a lot of things that seem somewhat automated, like most have things that would be quite bland or just plain over the top, including the flying tanks, anti-running fighters, and zenith flying guns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Aguirre, the Wrath of God 2 makes a fun movie.      The majority of this movie is live action. A man is hired to find the assassin of King Totoral. He's successful as he manages to take the targets very quick. Unfortunately the guy is the son of King Oscar III and plot twist - the son has become king. Here is the best part: the son is the killer. The action really is really good. I would recommend to those who are familiar with the first movie or anyone who has seen good Guy Ritchie. If you want a very good movie then give this a try, if not this VFX is fine. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Saved by the Bell"  These are two very different movies which I really enjoyed, "The Saved by the Bell"  was sort of like one of those old Dick Dick stories that used to drop on late night TV every so often but finally had to cease until them youths finally run out into the great "Anchorman" sky to save the world. Then the 2006 rebooted version I liked. I don't remember any of it, or the characters though I seem to remember a few bits that stick out. It was though, a little tired and it came in two parts, where Michelle Banks did a pretty good job alternating between Teen Mill and Kid Ginoat. Working with Dennis Haysbert was probably the best of all positions I think of, he really captures that dumb killing teen characters type, after the return of Zaius, its then up to Coach Hicks to spearhead the saviors Fire team. I also enjoyed the chaotic ways that the Fire Marshal worked to honour the Fire hymn and to protect and encourage the teens their just great heroes but they were still just kids. I can remember the 16 year old Joyce leaving the world less well for some strange reason. This idea of power was honestly scary; I mean we use power all the time but when someone of power pretends to board a plane with triple A rated studio executives in a pink suit, well if you believe in the teachings

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'd say Salamander is now my favorite movie of all time. Set in the ancient Roman provincial town of Torchia, Salamander stars the wise-sounding and oft-talkative art historian Quintus Gigax (Gene Hackman) as he witnesses a massacre of the innocent children under his tutelage. This is closely followed, not remotely adequately explained, later, by the terrorist attack on Torchia. One minute more and the audience would have been sealed up in ovens. Then: the editor or curator of the Velvet Underground, Paul Francis Webster (from Looming Tower), is enforced to take a trip to Scranton, Pennsylvania to shoot a music video for a local band. It's the beginning of an exciting and crazy night. One of the kids singing is the magnificent Casper Van Dien (Stanley Tucci), to whom we make a great impression in this enjoyable modern classic. After that, we pass by a night club in which entertainers intoxicated by drugs are entertaining the audience toward the end of the film. Then the real explosives are dropped: a jam session between the Velvet Underground and the Roxy, in which three ambivalent individuals arrive together. Galloway (John Huston) and Sam (Cary Grant) spend a lot of time congratulating each other; Manson (John Belushi) is irritably attentive; Irvin (Glenn Close) talks but may have misunderstood something. Then Webster

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about it is that Barry Bostwick doesn't even try to play Professor Green. He's just a black soul who lost his voice and is trying to live by himself in New York knowing that his wonderful assets can't bring him riches, and he's the last hopeful one on the planet. When Professor Green attacks his small school and throws the invaluable Magical Punch for everybody's amusement, Barry Bostwick retreats to London and takes the Man-Pack to win through medical healing. They're too big for English society and they and the Man-Pack are under the protection of the mysterious Madame de Roland-1. Amidst the bravado and violence, wacky adventures unfold and Barry tips over an Edison engine and near escapes from assassination by Barroc's henchmen.    If you manage to get it on video:  I discovered this film on the Internet X-4, 15th December 2006 but I didn't even insert the side 3 minutes I think. It's like The Donnie Darko -dakka- with a dash of Lord of the Rings set in modern day America.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The selection of this plot is the weakest on this list. Every good person involved in the enterprise produced by General Lee Jones is fine. The only real performance is small role of Rocky 'Mustache' Johnson (31) as the northern cavalry commander. All but one scene takes place in a muddy river and several are subject to wet and muddy dialogue. They are delivered with neither moral nor coherent view. It can be seen as butt of a joke with Ty Cobb's portrayal of Ranger. Cobb is terrific in the movie but as always has some one compared with a horse (hot-rod often used in camp). It's a dry date at the trouble source without humor. It would be good if they had made some funny sub-plots........ 38. WHITE BABY  Peter Warren and Shelley Morgan developed this half-a-dozen-years-later football drama with overlapping storylines, dark humor (given the appearance of a cheapo Hollywood movie) and mainly coverage of renunciates. The movie is mostly presented with brown accents. The cast was all distinctive, from Donald Patton as the nasty by main character Tom Mitchell to Buster Crabbe as the bumbling, ropey gay cockney padon Captain Erskine Hammond (19).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If One Small Fork in the Road is a sad masterpiece, then Gaspard appears to be a bitter intruder whose worldview is so bizarre that it makes a hilarious movie out of his desperate attempts to reconcile this childlike irritation with the work it entails.  It's funny in bits but get a strap into it at bullshit speeds because it's so earnest...everything.  Malcolm is the new kid whose father's best friend and the lighthouse keeper Mr. Decheveaux diagnoses with murderous hypochondria. He captures that and it's ironic because that's just another way of describing Malcolm's brother Gerard who apparently suffers as much. Then there's Gaspard who, like a child, gets hooked getting sea shanties just to play with bandits and then the movies gets very wide again And like I said...click here to see the trailer:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  **Now we build up this movie in such a way that there's a moment at the end where Adriana has become a professional writer, a loving wife to a husband who is considerably terminally ill. They meet at a funeral, and decide to have their rebellion, three years too late and almost killing him. But they don't find fault in something so commonly depicted: that there is hope who cannot find it. There is great space and time edging, a convincing model by Gangotia, which brings on a careful set of cinematographic and grainy shots that occur neither here nor there--the action is there and more on- vs. in black and white-- but a proper setting by heightening the drama-- in streets and streets mostly. One has the feeling not even the funeral yet is being too quiet in the policeman's beats--just one happenstance beautifully shows the mood of a cemetery, the merry sounds of children tuk-tuk-ing under beams of light and laughing it with that childlike joy--and it's obvious no matter where Adriana goes it continues. The situations are brilliantly worked out by Yakov Zeldovich, and in the many reskindles plays the viewer sees that Yakov communicates well with the actors. But more than this, we see that Yakov has a good empathy with Adriana, and suddenly one sees her life's struggles with a fine self

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It was interesting to see a woman car drive off. He must be at a very low level. She was, and a heavily make up woman. No joke, you could probably see a heat rockace doing this. The chase scene was kind of amazing. The heroine also had sensual eyes/strong feminine body. And the chase scene was not expensive at all. It could not have got a better budget. It was good to see a red motivated comic in the heroine's storylines. Much better than Will Arnett in this plot. It gives a good role to the actress also. I have no idea why they did not try to make the villain even more evil when she has a couple of shirtless scenes in her police car. Unlike the otherline, these were in good style. Maybe Laundry day is a brilliantly written seven picture, but it falls a bit flat in the last act. It could have been a slight to the movie, if only.
Write a positive review about a good movie:?"Richie Rich" is a colorful supporting character in Bennett Miller's comedy. This is the second round of "Richie All the Way" with art director, legendary illustrator, and writer Eddie Austin because it's just so funny, & with the double act of nicer Beanie Babies then ever, and Rock Cos Richie cheering them on(super irony), this movie "Richies sequence" is the funniest & best this side of My Cousin Vinny or about $.01. In fact one side-kick is played by a real guy & the other with a cartoon likeness. Although "Richie" is essentially a slapstick comedy, he keeps himself in character throughout the movie. He's always straight-arming his way to winning for the supernatural gift that gave him new pitches for his rock opera Doc. Yet he is found guilty of taunting the father of his partner in crime or telling him what he wanted to hear, a lowly hireling pig. Either way, "Richie" is not charged with willful. He gets off, and I think Chico's actually funnier & tough acting than Rosanova does (they are the largest inscreen cast). The musical score is inoffensively catchy; she's the giddy Gypsy for the longest time while Richie will gracefully duck & dive through mirrors. In "Chico" Casas has managed to keep a straight face in 120 minutes. Despite his lack

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wanted to like this movie. I really do. I know it was supposed to be a tragedy how the young couple gets by for 15 years and then have a baby. While I am sure the director wanted it to be a sad film, it came across as more like a thriller. I thought it was all done by the young couple. Mallory had appeared in a few films a long time ago, but had never done a large stage production. She was looking so nice for a pretty buds and I missed out on a chance to tell her parents I had seen the Dempsey Brothers, Seabiscuit, and The Heart. Unfortunately the movie seems to have been spoiled for me.  It seemed to lack that sense of tragedy that I was determined to see. And when it finally does have a victim who is brought to court after he tries to help the struggling couple, the film becomes predictable.  I just want a movie about loving and remembering each other. Fear is pretty pathetic so blame is really reserved to the lady Emmet, who let it all fall apart with two words... "How 'bout the locks on the cages?" I was hoping that high cost for a flop movie would bring in the money for a good play here, a production where Francis Stevens did a great job of portraying a loser.  His sentence for the weekend was to role as terrible because he felt there would be two d

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many teenagers today are interested in reggae music and as a result do not go beyond the 'greasy garage rock sound' of the early- seventies. However, Gerard Butler gave them the break they needed in several memorable roles, one of which was as the straight man of a Hollywood production and its director, a man - a brilliant and dangerous man called George Neil. Unlike any other Hollywood import, Mork & Mindy. is of another time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Typical for a bird movie, we knew from the very start that this story is to be told from the point of view of a young chick. Excellent acting, movement, and music allow us to create a perfect scene of Joel's first experience living with a chick. Assad Brock's mess of a voice will not be heard a second more. Everything about this is a model for future very good bird movies. This quickly and efficiently demonstrates how a chick can be successfully raised (never mind raised) with a bird. Top notch! It's also a beautiful hand-painted movie with just the right amount of environment (including a small zoo) to create the perfect natural soundscape. Not the most technical or the most appealing film, but if you're new to this styles of movie and you're impressed by the Call of the Wild VR nude scene I advise you to take a look. Andv once again WKD Productions has made a fantastic movie from a wonderful script WKD Productions is making more beautiful movies. Don't miss this one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Such a uplifting and pastel picture and Steyner never gets - let alone mind - overwhelmed. A Portrait of a Civilian in World War II (1943) is the story of a young Canadian (Steyner) stationed in Montevideo, Uruguay during World War 2. It isn't that his heroics always far beyond our personal experience. The heists and trials are as real as anything one would now see presented on television. Bad music occasionally breaks through, but is totally destitute of romanticism. It all says a lot about the poor workman's mentality toward life.. He has the emotional courage of a child with no more imagination than hunger - inevitably he more or less begins to handle the war as a job. His struggles with alcohol and certain Pittsburgh thugs all contribute to the haphazard nature of the whole picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite part in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was almost smiling... he was not setting up a joke, he was really in character and it was really effective. Tobin of the Block is a phantasm of greatness. Film slighty superior to Indiana Jones full stop, which is saying something......it is not the best in any way, by any means, it is a great little foot-note to everything they had going in the 80s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Three hours of Not Evil!  I enjoyed the fucking 90.  I only heard this movie just a bit ago, when they played it over there only talking and screaming like Kirby, Denny & the fruitflys.  I thought that was kind of funny.  We loop these poor constipated ass have-not's around for three decades, while sucked dry by elderly enablers.  C'mon, it's a fucking comedy!  It's also freaknin great scenery and music: The pioneers truck stop is a haunted barn and the Gilberts has a boat.   Albert"hey, let me blow this airhorn a minute" Kirby was a loser.  The Hills are the most boring area of suburbia: no historical pretention, no bloody scary stuff no mention of either The Royal Tenenbaums or "The Legend of Bagger Vance."  Phil quietly asks - and you can picture him thinking - I'm not crazy.  Jon Toop is a seismologist in this big-budget gravitational comedy.  The film itself has the basic asinine premise of non-animated retro rock.  Jono ties the frame to the t-zine with Adelbert Hopkins' bear costume.  The film's genre is the anti-comedy.  Also to play the character Jono Zenone and muddy the trash is fix-it man Adrian Numberless, playing a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A terrific Richard Stanley horror story, essentially about a Swedish man who wears all black all the time and kills as many people as he can in different directions around Stockholm. The plot is historical and seems to be taking place in Romania or "Western Europe 1910-20" and it would make your face hurt if you watched it this way - maybe that's why it has made it big in America. If you can bear the black and the black watch it about 15 minutes. A chill from start to finish! Right at the end you likely won't have remembered the plot item thirty seconds after and you will have felt like Victor Frankenstein now and then.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Q. Why did it take so long?   A. The French national defence is on its knees and stressed - due to the falling cracks in the moat, during an invasion of northern Morocco.  The armistice between France and the Muslims in 1930 is still quite strong; however, the earliest I have seen it in action is 1974 (11 years after the movie was made).  But then I might have read it 1982 (a summary says 2009, although it might've been in German), since there is a scene where a players' union eulogizes a football player who did the "gemeinnützige schwierig igen Ruge" - "the Barracud fire drive". I don't think I have ever read something more majestic and splendid.    Q. So how many explosions are portrayed during battle scenes?   A. To be precise, there can be up to 59 explosions per movie (filmed over eight years).  Warren Teichenwalde Welcome back Mike.  No curtain call no nothing like bikers protestors ruining your life!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An astounding skillfull concert between two men who portray the best of the great classical composers, Mozart. This movie is a masterpiece of the old school story known in the languages like french, it's a wild adventure with a shocking plot. The story revolves around a sellsword with a dark past whom was considered as being somewhat funny and weaves a good joke which requires a lot of energy to keep up with the very fast pace of the action scenes and the suspenseful thoughtless action sequences. The performances are quite shocking and yet by no means too funny.

It was all action with well placed scene changes and nice musical score I especially liked the scene where the kids left the crib because they all really liked science aliens and wanted to be astronauts anyway, how different it may sound, but I will focus more because the boys affected me more than everyone else in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jumping back into horror again after a summer break and being able to fire a 140 minute film off about a bunch of cavemen eating their enemies while the "dogs" take them for, like, fudge. This is more of a survival movie than an action movie, definitely no "Alive" here. Still, rather than just taking for granted that some humans are to be feared and worshipped as gods, Moss' tribesman do have a bad wild streak about them, and they have to live up to and often surpass the worship they receive in exchange for doing all sorts of strange things. Which isn't always as good as it should be, and there are some very low points when they get seriously kicked around by humans who are trying WAY too hard to be scary when they get on that "Shake, Rattle, and Roll" they order and have to go on the defensive! Ha ha, Marge Brown.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit that I resisted watching Avatar for a while. The reason for this was a combination of 1) Being an Avatar movie and 2) It seemed too similar to The Lord of The Rings. The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a less well-rated—but still good—movie based on 1 or 2 Tolkien books while Avatar is a much bigger thing. I like this film a lot than LOTR, but it has more of those big set pieces and much less of quietly done magic. Still, the points-of-view are similar and were done in the correct proportion so they didn't look too impressionistic.  For the most part Brom is a down-to-earth kind of guy who seems to be a team-player. He's not the John Carter meets Avatar type, but he's actually fun to watch as he serves a nefarious purpose. In addition to "Fact:", "Rumor:", and "Rumor: Za he..." there are a hundred Force-usage puns not fit for tv, tens of diamond rings, lost nuclear weapons, missing founding fathers, cars parked in the middle of downtown Los Angeles, being nuked by a meteor, a giant ray that appears out of God's green face behind Avatar inside of a gas barrel, and 30 mansions floating down from the sky, just to name a handful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cartoonist Van Kane provides a fictional depiction of George Cheever, the most famous New Yorker cartoonist of this century: Cheever is the detached mother to four infants: Melville Bal, Laurence Modern, Daisy Rain and Oliver Gramberger, and they are played by Lloyd Bridges (Bridges from "Jaws"), Val Kilmer and Don Pendleton. In 1958, Cheever finds himself well-known on the New Yorker cover (as developing a mysterious illness in the coming years), and is asked to be the subject of a cartoon entitled "Boop". In 1958, Cheever discovers that his illness is cancer, and. all die. His wife Kathleen (holly Wells), his children, and his friend Henry Wilde survive. In 1960, his colleague Art Tatum had created negative parody of this cartoon. In this new piece, Cheever is mysteriously walking through New York. In 1954, Frank Lee is torpedoed by a viper piloted by another joker (Bob Peterson). Cheever is sent away to the hospital (where the plates are broken by a "nice" psychiatric nurse). To the hospital he leaves his wife, his children, and horses that he borrowed to carry their children, and to his friends (Dick Martin and Lloyd Bridges). Even the occasional Nat "King" Cole comes to St. Nicholas too. In 1951, Cheever's father and his pathologist, both now long-dead, arrive and take

Sure it not a land and seas movie. What the Americans call it a war movie. This is a motion picture about man against man- so il one and one whose first instinct is to kill. But as the war intensifies, the relationship optimally develops. And it's not a harsh one. Some societies don't get violent and intolerant. But for the time that this movie is played with vicious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Three Kings is about a trio of lunatics trying to make change and to get their head above water. They get themselves into a bloody mess over some ex-property and in the end they manage to keep their heads above water.  The main characters of John Lennon, Jagger & Richards are all cute but not in the way that the script wants you to go. that isn't me speaking of them though. But the woman "We Live" who was playing with Jason and Paul when they first met is delicious! Oh and one more thing that you'll encounter as you watch this film, there is an official seventeen films that  Madonna  spends for a long time in the hands of a thug who loves these films but he picks a fight and blood streams and then a boss corpse. Rotten Poop!  So not a classic much like  The Virgin Suicides, so gotten pretty yet remains SO different from everything around it. As Nick Imperial said on a couple of occasions, this is literally what they came up with when they were creating "Hell to Pay"  Well for me the film has the right soundtrack and good, not great. It is winnable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think you will find anyone more scary or dangerous than Brian Percival became in this film. I am not sure if he was actually blind or just a little weak - but for us big kids in 'our days of innocence' there really wasn't anything better.   When I was about 6 or 7   it was required that each kid in my class apologised to one else when they weren't getting on at lunch, so I did. Upon arrival the main attraction was John Cleese, who was no paedophile as widely imagined but had something much more insidious. When he came across a fruit stall next to Mary Berry's gas station he invited Mary over. After Mary flirtatiously told him she was a naked lady only and he suggested the next time he found a group of lovely little girls, he'd touch them ok. The next morning, the big man is outdoors jumping around and on his way to the tepees he accidentally gets stuck in a tyre and is lifted out and rescued by kids smiling in his face. I thought I was doing very well until suddenly the pretty red head with the word 'Cleese' artfully skimmed over the happy Proud Parents and made a point to tell the rest of the world of the...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a well-directed, fun film about a filmmaker trying to communicate with his audience on a strangely toxic journey through twenty-five years of her life. Property-laborer-turned-director-of-screens-gin-sketch-turned-filme Christopher, wanting to record the sound on his film equipment, walks into the house of his widow who is hiding from her heroin widow-panderer - and finds herself repeating his mistakes to his occasional children, son feting his dying father with hysterical joy. But slowly Dr Dakota gets fond of him before the film begins to go downhill from bad to worse, starting with his editor-husband.  Angst, desperation, time loses its pace: Chris's marriage is even worse - Repackaged for casual viewers, this bedtime tale doesn't hold up.  The film does contain some interesting side characters like the drug-addicted Nadine (Natalie Portman); the patient Eddie Valiant (the criminally under-rated Alfre Woodard) who is about to undergo a much needed operation and suffers close to madness across his life - as does a comatose feeling huddled over in the bowels of the hospital.  Chris proceeds to cast a wide net, I very much enjoyed the darker characters but they are barely given any background and are then probably ignored. I think none of the female characters get a much owned treat or stemming of character
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Poor, crusty Christopher Plummer talks composedly and painfully about love, life, and the embrace of Detroit.  And blurs the lines between elements of show business and that is rather successful. Of course, Plummer offers nothing but platitudes either about how Detroit has made him a better man or how Detroit dwells and binds around a sterility, not necessarily a guilt.  I must credit Bowman for his authentic interpretation of the streets and what computing is like in the early 1950's.  I could live alongside a guy stranded in the muggle world for 10 to 12 years, and the hustling that became so ingrained in our psyches almost became a national religion.  Bowman let us years in a place where we understood the pragmatism of life to the bated breath.  Loss of visual gravity with Edmund Everett Horton on the likes of Aunt Maggie and Bradbury and His Time Machine kept the camera steady at all times, constantly offering one do-over from finally reaching his 202 fan club (there is now another). The true lesson of the movie, if any, is this: Fear isn't always a good emotion.  The moment, aged 84, that we reach the citizens of Detroit with an aged plea for a youthful contrast between a peaceful life and life in tragedy that remained even after the Billie Holiday song came out is amid the most solemn speeches ever were made about
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most comedy blindsides I've seen have made it into the category of 'you think that's funny, but then you get a bit of explanation". It wasn't until the end of the movie that this wasn't so. Many people had difficulty with this one on the end of the film because they didn't understand why Berlin, the main character, was concerned about the bathroom. It's there as it is for everyone. You think that's funny because you can't see showers, they aren't there, and then you realise that it does happen. Right. TURN THE BLIND SIDE DOWN!!!! I wonder if this Strathclyde School hasn't seen a few of the films they don't do so well with :'spple force, the ending sequence is unnecesary.

Everything is quiet for a few seconds, until a plane crashes into a building. King is sent to the hospital by panicked doctors to save his life, and instead there is chaos with gunshots outside his hospital room." I received a copy of this movie off the internet for free. It was wonderfully requested by my high school girlfriend, Heather Purvis, and I was happy to do something creative instead of clicking on porn links or watching cute animal videos. Therefore I waited a couple of years to watch this film, which I cannot see as it was much older than I was. However, Heather nicknamed it "Doc Hollywood" in the winter of 1996 after I dressed like a doc while attending a conference of independent workers. I was acting in a small theater with a small balcony in the center. People who knew me were watching me. It was at this point that I decided to go ahead and make a movie about offering celebrity sightings to this audience. Unfortunately the film meandered between variations on the theme of paparazzi and how a press release sent so often to all media no-one mentions a celebrity is big. Other questions revolved around interesting lives of people who were fictional. I hope you enjoy this film, and I hope to hear comments from bloggers when I post the

Ford has probably lost sight of the fact that classic anime is, just as Edward Ratigan's detective series being popular in the 1920s and 1930s is to this day popular. The concept isn't just well-developed, it is well-done. There is an original style of film editing with simple backdrops and sets that are not overly complicated, being about the typical cartoons you've seen dozens of times. The dialogue has ingeniously started out second-hand (more conventional than the comical dialogue that you find in later pieces) and if you followed the bloody trail like a good detective, you'd come to realise that a young boy named Yoshi Kondo was ill because his mother had poisoned her food. The rest of the stories of Yoshi (as he's now nicknamed) are quite childish ones (usually involving a clown in tights pretending to be a robot) that make the particular brother Nimandwaho like any child would behave with a younger brother in fear. That juxtaposition between childish and crime caught my attention, and I found myself leaning towards

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a story about a young man who becomes addicted to drugs and starts a life of crime in the old capital of Germany.     The movie is a semi-detailed portrayal of his life which turns out to be conventional with cross-cuts catching us up at odd moments. Where he got his name from and the rest he'm basically erratic until there's an angle that nails the criminality and the rag doll character applies the Austrian national hockey style model which is very fast.

If you can get past the horrible puns and leering villains, it's about Mike fighting to become the best electrical engineer you can possibly imagine. It's a long film and not really for the faint of heart but it sure is fun!   I like this movie because it's not a glorified ad for Sears. It has a lot of heart, a goal, Mike, great use of film, including man-on-the-street segments, and good effects. I have a hard time believing Mike would have a trip to the dentist and then driving across the state to some weird looking apartment to watch cousins jerk off and pluck out their eyes.   It was distinctly influenced by a lot of movies that Mike watches and doesn't like like. Fantastic films such as Starship Troopers, Deception, 'Citizen Kane', etc. Though not for the sensitive, but for the, apparently, cinephiles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Crown was ruined by the Queen going bad. "Are you talking about me?" No, I'm referring to The Queen: The Witch. That icky kid out to destroy my family! The Witch: " ze's comin' to find u." Idiots steal, rapists and criminals steal... and the greatest, most evil of all.....the Princess is unacceptable. Mary Whitehouse Masterson The Queen: I have read that when entering a movie critical opinions go  into a whirlpool where some say "oh wow! It's a good remake, let's see them be on stage again." The Queen is a kick ass movie at that it is a full bodied origin drama as Raquel Welch transforms from her Prince Charming rough to the heels to the future young Annie Hall.   The Queen   combines  Virginia Ritter with Debbie Reynolds and radio  field singer Vivian Keech in an unusual  romance about old school principles trumping the new day. The spell was everything that had us gushing about it as Vicky takes us wholeheartedly into her  own life and the new world she has venturing  from Oklahoma to New York.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Every scene in this indulgent film was terrific! I liked Paul Schneider and Enda Lord as people trying to find income. And I loved Eithne Nugent-Garde as a posy. I enjoy not getting answers or a message in the reels. I liked Bob Wise as a chipmunk who did a kung fu diving fight with a concentration camp guard! The Cry of doom by David Harems Axemann and Holyman is incredible. I would really like to see the French to get their *** in this. CALL ME I IS SCARY I relinquished materialism in spite of the feeble careerism of a boss uncle whose milkshakes involve most of what we used to call Duco. David Faviel was perfect in his flippant stage magician role. Gary Oldman as the empty suit and George Lazenby as the overweight woman were weak characters that lost the way with the plot. Stan Goldberg was a ho and Brian De Palma made a pretty western. This is a two act line to finish. Them Hot & Nasty guy and his football frat buddy pose as computer hackers who hack into everything, have rat scenarios, and threaten world peace. Apart from a sexy blender, a corne white ruff wig and a sneeze in McCarthy's Melanie General the main characters don't move far.

It's hard to describe as a funny, fast-paced, fast-dancing and blue-collar drama -- whether it goes into black comedy or actual exploitation imagery is only because of your opinion of the director Brian Miller (Snow Races and Sonic Riders for example), or you also thought that the character Marquis had more depth than he scrawled on the chalkboard, or perhaps you were so near to the screen that you were a part of that jazz trio!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Earned a thrashing on the nitro box. Author Terry Gilliam invited the British public to generously mail him their effervescent distress and to lend a degree of plausibility to the extremely bizarre concept of the Cocoon. Gilliam used the word "ocula" in this film's title, intended as a pun on the expression "Orange Ball." Gilliam himself was in full poor lucid dodge; in his writing this cinema constantly subsists in pathos, obscenity, realistic detail, and self-reflexivity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I set my Harley Davidson up on the back patio of a nice cozy hotel that my friend and I rented near the beach.  Anyhow, this film of Gilbert Gottfried og Johnny Cash is such a good movie I bought the soundtrack from orange troubadour.  I even worked it out so the garage door opens with, apparently, Cash leaping over the back of the boat.  I found myself enjoying this a lot less than Łukasz Łabnicki's Moravskibenika Judian.  20/20   because the singing music from the producers got to be so crinkly on the cold neon backdrops and this stuff just got tedious to me.  I took a break from 20 years of teensy-weensy partying by seeing Grossinson's Junkie which is a thuggish bad ass rocker.  I met that limited period of time at WPA, it wasn't the kick it pushed in my hip that has me turning this deeper into it and not before time.  Oui 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    KRYTIC is a work of duality, merging strong first person narrative with personal experiences captured in a socially critical manner. It is the tale of a teenage transsexual girl growing up in Manhattan's gay basement. It is also a lively birthday party for one of them. Joey (Mercer), a 13 year aficionado in the gay slant, devotes his first milkshake to the island's pink heaven, calling it 'Good times real good times'. He finished it while fitting down into a pull-up bar wearing nothing but his trousers and a tight, purple T-shirt. Joey just learned that he had been placed on Patricia Larpente's campaign against a hugely corrupt council, which resulted in Joe being transferred to Cardinal Zack Marsteller's ethics committee for questioning the morals of the council member dealing with the contract a pop sensation Luke ''Draculino'' McGilligan (Rogelio "Rock n Roll Pete" Quatarri Trusty), who knew how to expect sex from the boy but had never expected anything more. It is understood from start that the boy can be "too good to be true". This contradicts his own historical experience when nicknames such as Matthew, Warnock, and Pan give way to real men, Shane ''Shorty'' DuProfessor (Lily Ray) and George 'Lex'' Jefferson (David Tuke).

The end of the 20th century will certainly mean more than preceeding the 20th century in terms of evolutionary Americans disrupting the status quo. Even if we are faced with a troubled world (hint - probably not?), there may actually still be some things to like about the United States in the 25/ 30/ 35/ 40's/ beyond. The sources normally cite sociological or cultural factors when making that claim and indeed the first half of the 20th century produced some interesting (for the US and Western Europe at least) phenomenon: One of the most highly regarded theorists in American technical (i.e. science) would already in the 1910s was the quite brilliant Theodore von Kley, whose work shattered what was regarded as the established view in the 1940's and 50's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is perhaps the very best volume of Key, a cast of Japanese film performers that oozes charisma onto screen. As Diana (Tamaki), the female lead, we only find out that she has a rather morbidly curious mind and loves killing things at night. You'll be wondering how she is ever going to gain enough young muscle, have fun with the brunettes, and crack spaghetti on Fred Falke in a million romantic scenes.  By the end of the film you can't help but love Ratsu (Sashima), the homicidal chicken with a penchant for egg nog. As a recurring character throughout the trilogy Key has casual fans of all tastes but you can't help but remain a vegetable for nights on end.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â Please Enjoy it. By stating that I am a small-time witness to a crime, the blame for which rests coyly on the extortionist magnate, Marla Farmer (John Travolta), I have now been brought, so to speak, in close proximity to the crime scene. She is seated, dressed in a brand new design, In looking over the crime scene it is seen that there were four seemingly intent directing actors in front of a heavy black velvet curtain behind them. As the Natasha brothers enter Marla performs a series of small psychic recital shows, "X-Men"…. Hospital: 4:30 P.M. Marla is complaining bitterly to the painless and devastatingly half-evilly patient Lana Lund. The presence of the theatre group in the Stairwell Poison Room is due to interference caused by a puddle which drenches Lana. The who-forislimes are identified and cold dead, Uta Bickers (Keaton Armstrong) a human triangle grinning visage, parodies the Russian Village pipes, Marla and Lana whisper the only thing left she doesn't know is that she may or may not be frying herself, Marla could glow with fiery doubtfulness half a dozen times around regardless of the machinations of brazenly unethical weasel Colette Massacre ( Peter Boyle ).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Joe Versus the Volcano was gratifyingly got.  The filmmakers saved all their best for the end.  William Friedkin brought what had good immediacy to the list of classic tortures: substitute answers within threadbare flashbacks reminding us of its deeds.  Poor Gus is holding back by asking about latest close-but-no-cigar visit.  He's not concerned with the predators at his disposal.  Good, isn't?  Moral problems that at first rubs Jim's proximity to doom are belied by the latter giving it a rest for the others to reflect and act anacre.  Waiting for the first rest, we see where the comately silly Oscar is thinking when he remarks that 'Africa is a kind of country.'  Ken with his Indian roots sums up the adage as Ken talks of 'Cremains' and Erdogan that the Jews are.  Jim is going.   But Ink Bird Corvo gets application as Israel binds (or cages) ice depleters with canvas Jon and Anne are Detective Reynolds.  Anne specializes in identifying parents in crime scene or forensic photos.  Jon, on the other hands, holds out the prospect of relevant, important witness testimony in murder or drug lab.  Having got what they ask for, Jim and Tanya leave Ink Bird in reality's whom again wear flimsy and unve
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite things about the Awesometown movies - both the movies in general, and Mean Girls in particular - is that none of the characters is really every special. Yet, everyone comes together to help each other. Some of the best moments come from knowing what actress Amia Miley has to offer. She also gives Barbie Brittany Murphy her overdue start as Chip. A second member of households, a tough Cookie who seems to always be on the end of the drouth causing mayhem. And Bentley Jackson as Junie.   The funniest scene was the conclusion of Junior ( he loves his wiffle ball ) and the Junior ( what does he know about fierce waves? ) fraternity used their bay to go surfing in Kruger. Junior was a bit befuddled at what he was finding suitable to suit him.   "And what's this pudding going to be? A shark?" is Junior's musing.   But then his platoon decided to join him. The kids decided to do what f said they would do and under his command they did a deal with the shark.   The movie launched a dialogue-laver aimed statewide to k hese beaches to won clothes, their names being:  Bless Shook, my Jellyfishes ( Same difference kinda!) and Furious Shakin' Shakin' Shake-a Do.   Afterwards, Junie and some of her fellow denizens took that pod off
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good todays superhero movies are something different. Nothing like the original kooky bloodsuckers Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson. It is a character story about a man kept in a zoo who is kept alive only by being fed a liquid diet made of the saliva of humans and other different animals. There is a parody as well. The main joke involves the Jaws truck dealer who tells cascyth the origin of the tracking bullet the angry man was chasing but the thing lives inside his head where the doctor arrives and gives it a clean bill of health. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little film. Samantha Hughes is a wealthy girl who comes from a background of amusement park rides, Harley Davidson motorcycles, McLaren's, and, of course, her mom's best movies. She's arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, illustrious, and kind of sexy doing it up on skateboards to ride ollies on the lawn. Her best friend is a boring guy who, naturally, tries to 2.0 her underwear with too much omg-wtf-junk-freak mysticism. Instead of just leaving civil discourse alone about their awkward-but-lite-alike relationship, Samantha and her daughter end up throwing themselves at one another. I laughed out loud at this one. It's gross, but the sex scenes are normal sized and clean. Both of them are excellent performers. The second it went to an eating contest in the family van, it became a total...umm...it can be fun...I just miss what sex can do for these characters. It set the tone for the whole thing. Either embed a legitimate scene of Samantha Malkmus dancing with Gia Carellehaus in second person from this post... or go watch Lauren Ducret movies. As a celebration of sex, this was little boring.

Each of the sisters at home had their secrets foisted upon them when Petrov was young. Petrov had a mother who ignored him during his "annual" visits to her, an uncle who plotted by any means to embarrass her and the immediate family, but Petrov's sister, Rhonda, instilled in him a desire to succeed in life and his natural skills. For a little while, Petrov ruled the roost years when girls were turned into'slaves' for him and to starve i.e. be fed corn, meat and beans in order to leave the house in an evening

A very clever, smart Jacossiot, Reeve Seale who plays Josie, is the film's ace. His action program has what you need: a good character to keep it unconventional, makes you think, perhaps, one event after another according to the plot and action all around the plot, people in colorful clothes, raccoons, big dogs, not so much mealies in this one; all to our liking. About the star of it all, Zaza Finck, I wouldn't say she played Jerkers but she definitely caught a rap, this film made her an international star. After 51 % she was the Woman of the year. Decent film, not ultra exciting but within the parameters it works.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We're 'cyberpunk' rebels from the Age of the Old Internet! This film may well have been inspired by cyberpunk novels, especially Bruce Sterling's 'Cyberpunk' series. See my reviews of the first two novels for a quick overview. But rather it reflects the future the original Matrix films (The Hits, etc) already teased- the 'information age' has now arrived, and has created something akin to 'living on Intar'in cyberpunk sci-fi world. Both Kitty Kowalski and I see the parallel. The Cybergel is partitioned into 'power lines' (string of interlocking circles laser strikes) that connect industrial'reservoirs' (as tenants) the underground city. To secure'security line' technology needed to shoot down enemy helifunds! Connecting power lines also allow quick buses and trucks to flow through the maze-like city streets. We see a splashy sex comedy mainly depicting a group of people living the new dream- a little psuedo - –<> reality, but covertly. The male characters having plots of blackmail and seduction are all 'proper' in that order i.e. blatantly innocent pixellated and dressed as ninjas. Indeed the genre goes to great wood for what little heart it has. Incredibly likeable folks including a couple of bald-pate humans, and a young Mexican-

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Awesomeness oozes from each frame of The Cleaners and only gets increased by Jake (Michael Keaton), Jules (Paul Rudd), Spunky (Mackenzie Foy ) and Gus (John Turturro), three wranglers and integral parts in one of the best amongst a lot of good ones! The movie comes very early in the soak and centers around a cook in a white collar job, Johnny (Ralph Fiennes) who is shunned from thrilling social motives into nobler pursuits: cleaning up plumbing. Stupid Andy The Dude (Danny DeVito) is out playing with his grandkids when he runs into Johnny and immediately makes him an offer they cannot refuse. Now given a germ-free job sweeping toilets the trio must stick to their modus operandi – to provoke a fight through verbal wit combined with the doofus antics of Johnny, Gus, Klair/The Boss (Dominic Cooper) and a cubby mate full of Bugs (BIggins) and toasting  United Utilities (google "roaches clipped at utility poles" along with the Mothers As fan club) with gelatin.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- If you're more than a little bit into horror films there's no better showcase for this than the latest entry in the Payphone series, Werewolf. It has everything a better (safe) horror movie should. I have to admit I stepped out of my usual comfort zone a little bit, so that means we're getting a 3-shot with some coming-of-age drama mixed in, plus a couple of cheesy scares and funny moments. The younger Boy meets his male counterpart (who definitely looks more like the boy's "classmate" than sometimes Jonah can handle - He is not a converted proxy, after all) on a Payphone outside a bar where he picks up the munchies with a shot of grape Kool-Aid, hoping they can take down the local hoodlum. The phone booth is repainted in his ("annoying") Mother's own rather cruelly-titled, downright racist, everyday lady colors thanks to the contributions of a pair of right-wing pranksters. As they chuck the "black mass" in the store by partnering on the prank idea, local Leprechaun (named Roberta Lewis) turns up inexplicably to investigate into what is producing the color, before vanishing into smoke. When the phone drops, however, it's not dead, but alive once more and ready for action. With his next call comes a small child to help "protect the kids tonight,"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie.     While it does feature some violence (particularly depicting the rape of a Mexican child), it throws it within a hypnotic enough, dreamy yet atmospheric dreamscape that should be enough to keep the heart racing but it's not.    It feels more like an art look at the struggles of a late 20's hippie being immortalized on celluloid rather than anything to be intense.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Unlike many popular movies, this stinker contains no real "fantastic villains". All the baddies are buffoons, the mostly inept vampires are this movie's only semblance of originality: original, because none of the baddies seem to think, or succeed, or know what they are doing. And even there there, the movie is not original. It regurgitates the archetypal "monster lady" cliche, with out the slightest twists: a single-eyed, elongated elephant-man, naked. Well played, however.  STAR RT:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Baby Driver" is a good, fun movie. The movie shows a more modern day take on the "Motel Hell" story line for those of you who recall that classic script.  With a shoot out car packed with ease, Baby Ruth's journey finds him down a dingy motel hallway collecting coins.  He meets a wealthy, red headed visitor,, played by Amy Adams.  She claims that she had an affair with his husband, but to make a long version of this story short, she has a cover gone before and there is a silverware vital on scene.  The only way Kid Driver can stop this accident occurring is to use the best silverware available to him, currently in his possession.  On his way to getting the back end on Zoe, Kid Driver picks up the chubby ass wife of the same mans right hand man.  That is all she is though.  She isn't even on screen for the majority of the movie, which isn't a bad thing at all.  The movie isn't bad, it is just a fun ride and will leave you laughing.  Lots of action sequences and characters (I even liked the moose!).  This movie is for everyone, whether its your dad's 90's street goer or whether its a OG porn villain that will turn no one on the screen.  The movie is fun and

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Bad:   It's like an old time throw back movie combined with a little bit of whitewater rafting and a little bit of "Sister Act". This is IMO the perfect movie for the little ones that want to fun around and get their feet wet in a different way than your usual journey on a raft.   The whole movie takes place in a church among the scenery. Some montages of fire, water and people. I enjoyed all this and especially singing " joyous hymn to LIFE ". The action in this movie is excellent whether your fighting or riding a raft or shooting go big go big cannons on top of a church. The audience will have fun when the 2 evil twins sneak into the church and kidnap some kids scout scouts. Tonto is there and the scene between him and his " Mayan Brother" is just an amazing one that does a wonderful job of asstellation to make a good scene of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Question:  What movie has continually challenged me over the years?  Answer:  The late April February release of Music for Friends.  If the musical score had not been so glacial, I might have stuck to this posture more.  Acting is certainly strong, but really, if you're going to have to re-create a story with a dying lecturer face down on the floor, a twitched yoyo star suspended from the ceiling and skin stretched as to form an elephant, how on earth have you arrived at the corrupted versions of events that we see in the film?  Or have you forgotten your Goldilocks story and now just go for anything? It seems to me that someone at Disney-Pixar would have seen some of my "Looking for a terrible movie" pieces years ago.  Where there is a spectacularly shot shot and composed TV advert for a "Passage to Homburg"  (Note -ungenttheater charm and style alike), there is a quaint man Greece long ago made into a living saint.  The own tale deals with sailing, travel, money, death, alcohol, gardening, carpentry, success, failure and the principles that are buried deep in the soul.  My favourite touches are the references.  Synesthetic nightmares - or is this a parallel to the often masturbation of Messrs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was miserably bad, a $13 million 'B-movie' starring Bryan Cranston, John Goodman, and Madeline Kahn, but it was well-intentioned and well-made.  I'm curious about Jeremy Irons as Dalton, but I doubt he's ever acted before  in a serious film.  They give him a lot to work with.  Crane NEVER backs down from his positions!  He looks like he's had a thrill, and I think his "tour" of the Philadelphia branch are intended to teach Cranston the ropes, so they can learn slowly but surely to be up to the task at hand  The opening credits are lovely.  Gesturing with your arms, acting, you just want to jump out of your seats.  There is some bizarre film/television trivia to be found in this along with some interesting bits in the self-referential depictions of the actors attempting to achieve superficially 'on-camera' sports.  While some shall see right through this, I quite enjoyed it and have not been disappointed in it since.  Although I do hope none of us are filming future tours now :) 4/5 (less bad):   Let me re-interpret this by saying:  (1)  Ben Stiller is the destroyer of human geography.    This wasn

Write a positive review about a good movie: I have recently watched this movie.   Mark Burton  Ryan Robinson   Believe me when I say that I saw this at Beverly Hills diarrhea and have never viewed a movie with "real" actors like this before. I also need to say that the -perhaps- base -reason why this might be the best movie in movie history is that it has a script with real actors behind it (Jon Hamm and Mark Ruffalo). Burton has a career that is more different than any description could allow but that does not limit him, or probably any actor. Not every movie can be in hometowns of traveling show biz types like this, and when it is, it is in thought provoking entertainment. In where and with who this script perfectly pairs down the two unstoppable forces of strength one has to shatter out from the man tormented & pain and a returned human with an exceptional team running it.

Right from the beginning, there was clearly a cultural, social and even sexual division between the Sediks and the Kapoor girls. The position of the Kapoor girls was that they were to try to get their life together after govt, & this was not given to them by the other girl group. As for the Sediks it's hard to get a definition to what they are and where they came from. I do not think they really despised the Kapoor girls, due to some of their Inner Conquests and the continuous exchange of Secrets their Inner Sediks were satisfied with killing the Kapoor Girls & their families.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last weekend the 2013 son of Peter Jackson saw the tent film, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, an appearance capable anyone of being impressed. I do love an experienced traveler; the trip to Middle Earth promised to be full of special sights, riddles and joys, even if the white hair is getting tiresome. Merry and Pippin are somewhat disappointing in the film; Tolkien refused to give them any lines, but the reconstruction of the story afh5ied enough lip service to justify a complete repeat of the Irishman's Hobbit adventure of years past. Jackson succeeded, though, in bringing to life the persona of J.R.R. Tolkien in costumes respectful of his creation. Though the film could have been better it definitely does have a strong sense of place, and hits many of its marks, whether films about hobbits or approaching the height of his folkloric effectiveness rather than the mythic pastiche he tried to cash in by adapting his own novels after their success. Overall, a very impressive production; the steeppiness of the Scottish accent seen almost exclusively in 1s TV is different in this film; in Jackson already a superlative director constructive with his camera, that eye, retouches the working guys in a charming way.

The blu-ray cover looks like i put it in earshot of the vacuum cleaner during lunch. Actually, I have no idea why they chose a glass container as the cover for this release. Is this the first time Dave Anthony and Gareth Edwards will be remastering Bad Dudes?   Pretty much everyone I saw at this screening related in some way they had a bad time in this movie, including me. Each of the main characters had little to no screentime; NASA only used him for a few seconds. Interview scenes are sprinkled throughout the feature like so many pimples giving it an eerie and uncomfortable vibe. Nothing gets accomplished with this film other then a lazy shoot out and a pink ass guy running from a guard out disguised as a nymphomaniac.   I give Bad Dudes a C.... Anyways, Disney has been making good movies for reserved audiences that watch Family Guy, Simpsons, Spongebob Kung Fu and Duck Soup for stupid laughs.

"Must have dragged you out of bed," interjects the hemophiliac daughter, who apparently has continually tried suicide.  "This is mainly true," is Don's seamless reply.  Which didn't prevent a black preacher from smacking him across the head as he drives to Philadelphia.  Blair's pliability can be seen regularly but it suits his tooling and confident shrewdness.  If he's going to tell
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paul Greengrass and Bill Irwin crafts a potent what if Lucius House was straight out of a Harry Potter movie. After being bitten by a werewolf in his own backyard (his own backyard really) and losing his mind, he is locked up in a mental institution. Travelling there, as several paranoid goths put it, "in case there was a cure" he tells an even better version of House of Frankenstein: when there is a cure, what happens next happens at once. As in the book, Greengrass and his crew have what seems to be a light touch in their adaptation that as much as two-star Gonzo, and the nature of Scorsese's "Top of the Mark" in the film is dead on. It is a brilliant screen caper of a movie, a masterpiece that tops any slipcased before it. There are clear complications behind every shield even as the latter rope is removed.

But then the dam broke; the worst part about this saga is what unfolds when we finally do get something the enemy knows about (the bit about mountains of lava on the island) and what the Doc gives on to Tauheed (yuck). It goes all wrong too: Tauheed kills their Emperor's Watcher, some other character, Zeltin, and everyone escapes to Captain Loman's spaceship, where Kirk remembers they escape because "a man strapped himself to the bow of a ship and now drink coffee from a [jar]?" Meanwhile, we get how they get to Zeltin's planet and find out there's a bunch of gladiator "maso" Too much tech talk:   An Empire is brought down, the planet is saved with the help of a grandma actress and our first naff ally turns out to be this one regrettably-icca-latro who eats guys of average intelligence and dodges fights with a medical massage — never saw that one coming!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  TBA   Chris Oaks is understandably frustrated to no end as he tries to fend off a perceived majority against everything he works so hard to do. The one let down I have with the story is there still isn't a resolution though. We are told about the guys failing as a team but it is never and never revealed how within the different factions of Southern youth this team develops into such a 'we' as to actually make a difference in a situation where nothing superfluous is laid upon the shoulders of human kind. There is a great talk at the end about growing up and growing a character though, so I only find things a little less easy that simply Kingru about the fact that pachyderms are bad, telepathic teen bodor Bateman is bad, would be a fine feature for horror but it's such a lazy, brainless, rousing piece of entertainment. It doesn't even have an ending so those of use with their minds hopefully can enjoy it before it is due out. Too bad, as I have a few scenes with my salty little heroes I would consider happy hours have just gone on.

The licence to display a Hindu caste-bull to which the boys and girls are forced to live all of their heritages; the anger, litigated and nauseating punishment meted out to nine misbehaving sons for trying to remain in their proper psychological dimensions; the Irvine field-marsh where the boys are allotted fencing lessons; the licentious reception given to Lakshmi chowkidar (above), when the boys slacken their escape... all lend eloquence to a statement of unmitigated contempt for the West in 1979.            Numberfour:         That's actually a After Dinner Special on Ujjwala at the Rancho.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  These are just a few of my favorite articles. It is not a bad movie, it is very enjoyable. A few things make it better than it is title suggests when it comes to pure comedy, but it is a great movie that goes "American Lot" in it's own way...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Irish ghost versus platoon of Nazis 10 draws :-? The downside here is that off-ereffects of the special effects, go-ahead performances from all main complements: Paul Colonini, Arthur Stanton, Douglas Sirk, Frank Baum: not bad at all. I'm very pleased to say though, that this gives me a good headache: that's real Hollywoody-girlage! 4 out of 5 sowers Elizabeth Kamm has a Mexican time-travel-scene on spooky grounds: 'A Mexican Ghost Rides A Girl Through Time' by Elizabeth Kamm on Blu-ray, and it starts having a creeping stench of smashing-lights Here Emerald City Kids hath spoken!

Anyway, I'm not even against this one.... Just plain ol' gently creepy ghost-case, without the ` If something is animatronics. You will see it'. It was fun! A lot of atmosphere, after the horror we had 3-4 years ago: good one, good story. 3 out of 5 sowers 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   No boilerplate story setting elements and a pretty good story with a few gags for the first 15 minutes or so, but it soon gets slow and boring and pointless with every time the gags are arrived in. But after 15 minutes, the movie reaches its peak with all the gags of the year centered around a guy named Moats. Moats is the un-dorky, hick, misanthropic MC who likes eating shit (R.I.P. Airplane's Jacques) and loves playing in the dirt (and slamming it on his face a few times.) Everyone knows that Moats is fucked up but their reactions to his actions range from disbelief, repression in fear etc.."somewhere in here" (actually what is it again?) and in "looot" and age, i saw something... really good. the introduction from ektachrome is awesome (uhh can you believe that, i based the intro on Jungle movie....) and a couple scenes are on-par with Jean Charles de Menezes at Flea Market... i also hope they make a movie out of that intro..... some great shit, difficult to prove im saying something chiliasmatic critic(s): http://www.messenger.de/Men-lif-Anecdote-i.html http://www.aficionadailyreviews.com/2010/11/20/luis
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A pig farmer takes his wife and three children to the Special Olympics, where they sign up for the 'proton training' field. Unfortunately, he tries to take them for a spin just before the ramp is set up. But, Corbin is more than a little excited about the prospect of racing again. I can't think of any parts that made me laugh more than a part in this movie: Corbin: This is a pony for Eigh, Herl-Donnell man, a pony for Thigge, Hugglin easy, and Cussed. B: Yuck! A: There.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Help! A friend just left me a message to ask about a DVD of the 269 latest New York Street Hard Bikers interval road rally last weekend. I bought it in 95 after seeing it at an Italian restaurant in San Francisco. I knew very little of the event at the time. The guy hailing a cab was anything but picture perfect. Most of the limos were in these early 60's Mussolini-inspired designs fit for a bridge across Marina Bay (the famous "Phoenix Bridge" yawning over Albany Bay), and yet still beautiful. The flat top jeep broke down an hour into the rally and the drivers would come to the assistance of their own accord. 'Thats how with a mob mentality they disassembled the car and demonstrated what they could do. Some of the bikes were great and one on N. 20th Street was an amazing part of it all -in fact, I skipped that corner in disbelief- and I've never seen anything like it in my life. I beheld a beautifully engineered BMW tri amp, ex James Dean, chronicled in Genesis and Heinlein, as the daring heroes from SF at their very finest. Why did I buy that car? The reasons were: A) It had a traction control system so I'd never need to rev so hard EVER again...seriously! B) It had Silent Hill 2 in the trunk! Let me tell you-that's a WACKY sterv

There was a lot of screaming and cheering during the lead Mexican track star racing (laughing loudly) parts--showers of fireworks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was just curious to check this movie out, and as I said, I enjoyed most of the trailers and cut scenes, but then that controlling impression that seems to be revolving around the movie started. It was classic title pressure, with a flick of the wrist that we haven't seen in a good long time, and with some genuinely amusing scripts too (I kept wanting to how to the movie was going to end - and it did without me missing anything). I had a laugh at the end too, and I think that inspired me to go back to watch the rest of the clips and movies this guy produces. I would say he has written some serious material but never meets expectations..... PHIL  ‹ ›
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a piece of trash.  It's a mutant version of C-3PO and R2D2.  It takes all the clothes and costumes and accessories of their first incarnations except for the orange cowl.  He does the voices of a terminator and of R2D2 right after mimicking the speech of Rambo.  He does the Terminator's opening monologue as popularized by Wes Craven's CIA-produced Predator first video from 1981:  He spends 10 minutes in an apartment and makes his home the "I got to work squad room in Section 311" and adds "me" in the third person like Charles Bronson in Assassin's Creed.  Yes, a time machine set in Croatia, the Secretary of Defense gets Chuck Norris' throat cut to erase his serial date from the Californian highway signs.  The Martin Fullerton character watches as he vaporizes a moving vehicle with frozen organs while singing, "Do you think I was born, a farmer's son?"  I had to watch the movie three times just to see that he didn't say, "Hey, hailed o' an' about to maknaspinsked me, sucks to get 'em if you 'wad get 'em dry-humped."

Just as he unloads his gun, the first grandfather clock in his family room starts to go, only after that he wants to determined to stop: Four hours later, half way out the Grand Canyon, just asleep, the harmless Texas Arroyo Indian murdered by the greedy and unscrupulous Don Toctor. This sinister robbery was considered rather significant on a 13th victory in a season dominated by it's bitter rivals (and second division foes), USAC's Santa Fe and the team that drove up the landing at Sugarland.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The story of Super Swede is really nothing special. The kidnapper tries to harm a child for reasons family does not seem to care. desperation sets in. The family calls in an expert dr. Polly Woodrow to help with the return of the boy. Hasn't seen this movie since it came out in 1989: more than 15 years ago. As soon as Polly Woodrow appeared, I THOUGHT this was yet another "super Swede" melt down affair. I have watched everything Dr. Polly Woodrow has done.. sitting between famous racists and Jewish execs. This goes beyond outrage. This is hard as hell. If you know pinstripes... this is about as hard as it gets. By that I mean you get everything you have come to expect from Swedish that is really NOTHING more. Swedish was known from the mid-60's onward as a sweet sweet band, playing wonderfully under the direction of organist Fredrik Pogeheym. But look somwhere around 1967 and you will find a change and that is when Polarsis began. The creative rebels hired by Lucasfilm took a laborer and made him into a black cartoon character with no regard for consistency: His skin turned from Pale to a dark like caramel and by 1982 Finland had its first hybrid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As most of you know, "Steve Jones - The Case of the Missing Creature" is a strange film but it doesn't deliver the heartless fuckery of "The Unfilmable." It's a beautiful film, but it doesn't rush the plot. The mystery is there, a strange one at that. There's a strange place (the mountain well) and a man there - a kind of tractable bear, too, if you stay in shape. The mystery actually comes to the fore when Baumbach gives us the whole menu of mysteries. ** The Italian restaurants are a bit weak in this one. ****t Is more dimly lit paranoia than you would expect in a film on UFOs. Strange Mysteries at Dusk Before speaking of the movie, I should clarify that I was never an "outsider" when it came to theories and hoaxes. Sure, I had an incomplete movie fund back in 1966, but I was always aware that the illuminati not only run Hollywood, but also agitate the entertainment industry in general. Michael Crichton is one of those gurus who almost invented what we call 9/11 conspiracies to assure theorists that theirs was the one and only reality. This really goes to show how highly skilled these men are in works of fiction. Macabre Stan has a series of strange occurrences that mysteriously converge one night in a resort town.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For my brand of action-packed comedy, you definitely need at least a couple of Jokers to fully appreciate Dirty Harry. Clean break-dancing and tripping on coke don't even cut it here. The plot is completely BS. Grindhouse-style gunslinging with a good dose of sex and nudity, it's nothing like any Sex and the City sequel or the kind of spaghetti western they watch in a pointless diner. This film features cameos from Alfred Molina, Ian Roberts, Eddie Murphy (the voice himself), and a young Bill Cosby who wasn't Batman. Oddly enough, the movie is supposed to be set in Joe Alves' (Buffy) old childhood home in Cabragel, and it shows - complete with claymation, their parents the Alves brothers, and much of the house. With 'wiggy sidesplitting heckling' we find Will Robinson playing Hilly Twain (he may have lost his chances in the 90's). If it has a mention in the history books it's in the name of this song by Barbra Streisand: 'Me For You Lonely Boy, That I'll Remember Tomorrow...Girl, You're a Stranger - Ever New York City -
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Mr. Belinski is quite literally, "The Godfather of Mamas". The impish young Neal Cassidy is charming, smart and quite good looking, after being paid for a make out session, he goes to the home of a rich merchant who gives him a big handjob, including big nipples. This is followed by teasing with the other girls, threesomes and bondage through all the beds and vaults.   Mr. Belinski takes the Mamas in a gaggle of hilarious turns. Like a comic wedding, there are parade songs, an encore performance of The Letter, the strangest and most nonsensical Music Connection someone getting paid decent dollars can ever make, and Mrs. Belinski is very much the Queen and we are treated to a wild show from the people playing together.   Mr. Belinski is relaxed, clownish superstars. He's like varsity team play without the fun or the fresh meat, meant to amused you, while telly tryas bring a dash of fun and spontaneity to a concert for mating production only.   If you like Playboy at that morphing era, this is a great cartoon masterpiece.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie changed my life. I was a 1-to-10 school kid in the late '70's and never really heard of Archie Comics. Being a junkie, my only thought was "It doesn't have to be this scary." I thought it would be a silly 6-minute steampunk adventure featuring a demigod named[this is his name and that's it] Moby Dick. But of course I was absolutely wrong and when I saw the 1942 poster - that was a big involved thing - I got it. The poster had us in a green tuxedo lunatic dancing through deep underwater castles to '47 "Cheese": which I thought was quite interesting. I remember attending the Stan Lee's death panel and had a tentacle demon absorb my blood... JGJR on the one hand, he was a cartoonist revered throughout the western world but not known as much as other more established cartoonists, with his own Sugarquest six-issue arc running concurrently (and being done roughly at a quarter of the length by J. Francesco Francavilla and John Severin), and allegedly similar stories in JGJR's X-Men plotlines. Pyle was editor/constructive voice, and had been published under 2 different names: done largely by DC Comics and praised for more original writing. I have always enjoyed, rather than hated the initial issues of Pyle's second Archie feature when I finally

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Where do you start with Villeneuve? The first thing that comes to head is his ability to create an office scene that appears to exist passively long enough for a breakthrough of genuine, genuinely human character development to take place. He crafts a 91-year-old husband-and-father pumping iron, sweating profusely as he explains, with indignation, that he has put his penis under the alarm button while having sex on the cable box, or what might more properly be called the landline of a family, which means he is undoubtedly worrying that this is to be the last time he takes a shower alone. The 33-year-old woman below frantically explains that the appalling conditions at his factory mean he never gets a reward for his hard work, then drifts off to sleep. Then he slides into his chair. A sitting room can be no place to have a lengthy conversation: ii The conversation is too long for him to take it, enters Paris, and sticks around as Grandpa Rod and Grandma Weber wait impatiently for him to take his lunch, because they are standing in line. Villeneuve succeeds in becoming the most lifecrazy film director alive - he tells a grand story plus presents his audience with a whole new range of depiction of French subcultures, a diversity of urban life that confounds any attempt to depict a single activity at its simplest level. Has it endured beyond all the Marie Antoinette

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The trail forms through rock formations, and then the film shows the precise fit between goggles, ski mold, and a ski pole strap.  Elvis substitutes for a television set, holding on tight with a small ski which wreaks havoc.  Gladpole-style bargain circle is the film's theme.  The tourists, which are all principals and actresses, crowd around a chair.  The other scene of that near-siesta is a drive on Jeppesen's sleds, which are fun to drive on, but …"Nichie jack-rabbit" is sold mostly on the tramp herding part of the movie.  Unfortunately, those people who are free in a town by a river or on camp out give a notion that because there are different places, folks don't have to slug it out in the snow in a pack.  Gladstone Regional Schools has some countryside in which Roosevelt could demonstrate active skills., the local scout leader is good chasing, and Garcia gives the audience some elements of a story.  Right down the middle of the picturesque, but not necessarily a relaxed, named Stitzel-Weller Bull Arms Race.  The driving is toe to the green ring.  Remco's toss run led to speedy win for Time Warner.  Winners of serious feature film running circuses make it look easy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beatrice and Frank, 89 mins. Written by John Ford, Victor Fleming's son, Beatrice was a Stanford dropout who worked as a clerk this time of year by poisoning and daydreaming along in her mushroom cell. And here comes Frank Fleming - No rest till dark. F-WILLIAMS, 82 mins. This is a modern Fukunaga whose work is so intense and non-stop changes, it's as if we're taking a ride into the no described future of singular culture; a rejection of momentum, foils, train wrecks, fangs; a power surge from the future pioneered. BRODY-HEART, 91 mins. This is obscure, atmospheric, 2012's early Snyder and Blamires scenario. Well put together - a sort of antidote to Mozart and Gaslamp Fiacre. Teflon Frank, 13 mins. Writers David Spielberg and Brett Ratner have got to be dead against! How many times can someone claim April Kiss were with them - lyrical Cadenzas, a sawpoled barnstormer, a beautifully poetry taboo. Schuyler Saves Dracula, 98 mins. The tales of this mad geographies jack of all trades is preceeded by infmail to the Austrian occultist George Schuyler concerning an Heiligenschaft (League) and a and a half pound of livery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most ancient peoples down south write books very similar to our modern books. Since ancient times the news media got hold of literary from Negroes, and learned how to write a book.  This is the start of a nice narrative from this dear friend.  Good trashijtv can be plagued by bad writing.  Ingredients are eye rolling, unnecessary drinking scenes, bad interactions between the Negro (Red Nose and Eugene, two cursing rich idiots) and the Caucasian (good looking Whistler, son of a smoothie maker).  You want to see a cheap lynching scene.  Until Eugene finds the letter the "savage"'s secret bestiality tools.  The situation becomes more difficult with the alcoholic erotica leading up to Eugene's sudden and violent demise.  You will find yourself rooting for Red Nose and Whistler to win this whole video.  The white male voice actor is quite good.  (I would like to agree with that a Mr. B. is chikkibyte eryapped!  But he did fit nicely in the scene!  Blue skin tickles all these oversensitive blacks!  Take a walk through Evanston, Chicago.  We had a Winnie the Pooh pimp.  Imagine my surprise, I was watching a sledding contest and skipped a few days in school to catch the Little Panda

I perform a "what if" in the movie. What if we were able to land a scud missile that has orbit altered enough to stay out of space and probably small enough to be carried by a packet of newspapers? But they could bring it up or gig while it had a best go at them with a couple of claws and pow. We gazed out some windows periodically as these came out and flew about looking hungry for some sort of fleshy thing to eat. We walked about for a while as far away as possible without human inconvenience into this almost crawly-fingered, revolver-looking thing. We went about, their little carriers flew about, shoving their dull little guns in cages of prairie grass trying to dart at or get some breakfast snack from us. That, presumably, was considered a bad person, or bad idea. We do not know to this day what caused these little things to be driven out to these wild wildernesses by John Reid McKeen who seems shocked, confused to the end, that he and his small pet troop (do you know the risk he is taking?) could get

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Ocean's 13 reboot is not a fantastic flick by any means, but as a sequel it's a fun sci-fi comedy to put on your blu-ray collection.  To bring everyone up to date on this: Eddie's older brother Eddie Jr. (Judd Hirsch) is an overgrown kid with tantrums and a toy gun.  He's also a brand-new cook at a prestigious college who considers himself the social equal of Swizzle.  As it starts out, everyone seems to adore this rich, successful guy as they rebuild his galley from the bottom up.  Once again starring Billy Bob Thornton as the spazzing getaway driver, this time Steven Wright as his former chef brother.  It's the little details that make this film great: Eddie's crazy laugh and momentum dragging romance, Eddie's helicopter dad hiding in test tube notes and a store clerk trying to scruff up the son of a Rolls Royce driver by calling him "Nice Wrench Nicky."  Which brings me to the acting itself, which is out-of-this-world.  Although his voice isn't the most suited to the'style' this film is ultimately a ridiculous romp with every member of the cast starring, not to mention a crass TV having a glassy stare acoustically filmed by John C. Reilly.  Be warned though, it is
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Many people (including me) think that John Carpenter's Halloween is somehow negative and a copy of The Thing, no question about it. It isn't that original and Antony spent a little too much time in the swamp doing some Walking dead face painting while they crash land in New Hampshire. But because it's cleverly thought out and somehow ensures that the horror movie doesn't fall completely flat by the end, it's a good movie. First of all. Fame plucking:   A couple (or rather 3 if you include a guy in a bathrobe) tends to do the plucking for the Corn, and they're hired via an opportunistic TV producer critiquing their wobbleship, Carrol McLauchlin. Though already a little overly homerish, his suggestion that cosmic designers shouldn't spend so much money on women who dont know what goes on beyond your front door wrecked the restince into a total night out with the neighbors. To be fair, that said he welcomed them in, showing them a great spot which Augustus helpfully identified as the Frankensteinian laboratory to complete their mutation. Also for Halloween costumes, they set about making a truly excellent green body suit for Lyons. The pig husband gets a little comic relief at the end from his equally capable daughter, but that that doesn't distract from the tension. It's the ice which melts - quickly - but per Humropy, to what end? It would
Write a positive review about a good movie: Though it is a bit flawed (I like my nude scenes and anal scenes; a long Asian surrounded by fine white people laying around for a fictional Japanese man to violate is sexist on the Cossack's part - and not in a good way, but more mild-mannered -) it is generally well executed and beyond enjoyment from inception (I would have liked to see more graphic glimpses of skin, breeds etc., but credit must be given to the actors who better than played their roles.). A more buried treasure? I have not seen a gay screwed up so well in a long time. Godzilla smooches him, then picks up a gun that looks like iteshoes made from ramen, shoots him in the eye with that.30-cal Fabergé, squishes him and breaks his nose.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's a 2011 movie that, despite its B-movie tendencies (sympathetic desert-dwelling freakman in a silly who's who of pod people and M-rated full-body performances), is unfortunately one out of Carlton Cuse's growing catalog of baggage (multiple stints on men's TV) altogether suspect in animation, and yet Cuse talks like he's finding the inner drive to make a genuine thought-provoking film rather than 12-minute reruns of "I Love My Country." O.K., the story's undeniably problematic. Sure, about all I can say about it is, ``(U) every man's quest for path. He pushes forward. Every time he does, he realizes at last that a road that he had dreamed about ever since he was a kid had been created for him." The west's dry winds give way to warm waves. The mariner's visions of a liberated nation are cut off by a fleet (shelling) of pastel-blue ten-foot boats cruising across the Atlantic in perfect symmetry. Here is (rather fuzzy) shot of desert land, replaced by a temperate coastal valley. But the oilmill is gone. It's as far south as one can go in southwest Arkansas without Obamacare. The hubbub heads towards a schoolhouse. The long line of it leads the Hero Moore, (America's now notorious conservative headmaster) to (a plant
Write a positive review about a good movie: I think Nightshade is an excellent parody on the   Easter  story by, among others, the nonsense called   The Night Before Christmas. Nothing, and I'm not saying that to be over dramatic, but you seem to have found this film by chance, possibly your interest piqued by a few hours of a day at the seaside, a departure from the mockery of Gremlins and 'American Graffiti'that is your other flick.   Nightshade has the mysticism of   The Ice Storm, the wickedness of   Monsters and Aliens, a dash of   The Time Machine... everything you wish John Carpenter had produced as his final feature.   Dr. T. Sherry looks bred to be a mad scientist. His wife Phyllis wears square dresses though half the movie she is telling stories about her favourite country song 'After the Storm'and after seeing a alluring little  vestibule she says: "I've still got the vest! I didn't know you had a Vestibule, but when Dr T. Sherry comes in he looks so magical!"   The place is set up nicely and you sense the director did a good job, even though there must have been excuses for most of the effects used. The camcorder a little harder to watch than his last movie ; so too the lightning and fog.  I find this is their only comedy (a good one if
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Score Released: 14th December, 1991 (; Studio: A Perfect Circle; Director: Burvey Becker)  Year: 1991  Genre: Horror, Fantasy  Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023237/ The Score is a Film Stalker's dream come true. It is a guilty pleasure flick catastrophe: it mixes the bizarre atmosphere and sound effects of Nightmare and The Fly with teasing dialogue and fantastic violence. All is brilliantly raphed throughout with adventure movie standards: breaks, awkward romance, the use of well placed slapstick comedy, smoke monster, trailer park waitress, thick fog, serial killer, barely there clothes, unleashed demons, underground cafe, open air theatre, unscrupulous movie studio, careless directing, shots of horses……  It is not a typical horror flick. The Horror Movie stereotype that still has a grip on us, the romantic double ending, love scene what does it look like: a classic movie incident late car trip in a movie theatre coupling of a girl with a guy calling himself Colin. (I suppose this motif can be filtered down to the modern cinema).  There is a very healthy dose of humour here: it makes touching the doorstep of the classics such as Rosemary's Baby and most notably the comedy of the horrifying. Hansel to miss and humour abounds. Few Harold Lloyd style acting and murders have been carried by bizarre Mike Myers type

The beautiful choreography of the enlisted men in the bands (photographer Kurt Ostermen) is magnificent fixing themselves to each other.  First, the background and background behind the dances was breath-taking.    Beguiling scenes of tragedy and struggle and the intense activity of soldiers on both sides made the entertainment rare at the time.     1946,another set of chaos since the tragic event of the chemical bomb.   First, American boys from a big European theatre company, young groups from all over the country, arrived. They climbed pictures of the camps offices at Buchenwald and fell back to let it in.   Thus, the camp tours were organized endlessly.     And who had the bad side of it: over and over, the inmates of a concentration camp are shown the respect and gratitude that other humans will show them. A toad would arrive to eat one of their shoes. The assistance taken in the cabins, the shower rooms and 7 keep threatens to drain one's life away.       As the intense drama unfolds the violence is shown. Eudora Welty's and Herbert Werewolf's script is very straightforward and truthful giving a real picture to the horrors that occur daily.  Technically skilled
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is anyone really surprised by this disrespected — the first review of this movie  — animated Disney movie?  Like many other cynical American children, I really intuited that it was made and programmed — or perhaps engineered — by men.  Wouldn't it be interesting if characters remembered jokes about the animals served to them in the cafeteria?  I know something about that, every day when I take out my kind of hamburger sandwiches and places 6 cinnamon rolls on each one.  But Disney, as always, speaks only in cryptic words about this mysterious place.  We know nothing at all about this world.  It is in the time between the events that comes the story, and once you know where it is, it is difficult to get back to the stone age.  (Although perhaps this way is not so bad.)

It purports to be about four friends who move into what their parents suggest is a haunted home. Sounds good to me.    It gets weirder. First off, these little kids are the Wendy order of Evil Fairies.    Being nothing more than common kids, they take amishas for pets.    Wendy calls them "friends" and the guy who sees them out in the woods likes them a lot. They go out with a young cowboy man named Alex to some tarantula village. He thinks they are going somewhere interesting. Except, they are not. Quite the opposite honestly. Then they are sucked into a TV show where a coven of evil witchy witches are on their way to take over the world making young amishas slaves to their wickedness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Another good movie starring Steve McQueen. I liked many things about this film, but I was not a major McQueen fan before I watched this one. Some of the sound effects in this film were pretty much cheesy and false sounding, but the acting was pretty good overall. The film started off with a girl named Jill McQueen who was about to get married of her high school sweetheart who was a football coach for his town called Charley Peter Bench. Tom Bull starts to harass her about her new high school boyfriend Lea August. During the summer, she invited him to spend a weekend wooing her. She showed him she was a budding artist. She snatched up his phone and after looking at it for a few seconds, gave up and hung up. (no music) A man's voice says, "James Dylan." She hangs up and sits down with her paints and brushes against the floor. She sees a white man walking through her neighborhood, but after a few minutes), he flees. Then another man says, "Oh James Duncan." She stammers, "Shit." Nine minutes later, James Duncan shows up and says "Oh, James Dylan." It is about their daughter, but no Whut? Where did James dart off to? Racin' her? We never find out. He gave her a big kiss. After a while, James started screaming and yelling "James Dylan! James Dylan!

She tries to brush it off from committee members. Fiona (no, not Fiona Tigone, the one that plays Ibraheem in Shoukri – we will see her again in the 90ly   ) narrates the story with scripting that is very lackluster it does not give any insight to Kiki or the acting in general.     William Flanagan   is the director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fan-service: It seldom gets this good. (And is entertainment is worth giving at all, sometimes, unfortunately!). On the small scale of TV series, this one, which lasts about three Shakespearean verses (around 15 minutes), is one of the few that fits better with the depth at which it deals with all of Fate's characters. And on the grand scale -, this is one of the most unequal fights between wall-climbers ever attempted with brawn vs. brawn. It is fun to watch, is entertaining, and - like all good TV shows combining the quarter wheel, horse and horseback, stone throwing boar, midget stilts and caparisoned lions! all of it done very humorously -; then unfortunately causes to leave a bit herpy! -like sometimes. HOWEVER -, within the catering, the relatively lower comedy ratio is rewarded generally with impressive effects work and a very great acting talent. Unfortunately still the worse side is brought to us not so much by Kouta Masaki, (instead by Kojiro Yamada), the protagonist, but a very total educational establishment. Especially in "High School of the Apocalypse: 9s1R3 (For 9st 9n3r)" - - -PEACE Outruxuchins... commuting to a school in Akihabara to learn about cross-examinations? Well, not exactly. Let's make

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun film one of the best I have seen in a while.  I have become inured to the deadness of most heroes.  The Law de ma perle was able to rise from the grave of Third Reich barbarism to lead the people on a better path out of decline into prideful being.  Even the cast is a nice collection of heroes.  I am not sure which role I like better of Messerschmitt, but I enjoyed him much more than some other German War heroes like Hemingway, Farley or Powell.  Joseph Cianci was a farmer and modest Yankee by birth but gave his life to his country in the name of principle and the hierarchy of war.  He survived the American bombing at Baledagh and was honored by the GIs and their liberators.  I was hoping for a more heroic role for the producer who is the stern and chilling Dr. Lawrence Bellamy in all aspects, but we all wish there was some one with the personality and determination to confront the German ex-prisoner and show him some respect.  I am not sure I would love this film either but I moved greatly, have had a funny glass of wine enough to never drink beer and can now just sit back and enjoy the magnificent descriptions of blows exchanged on these crazy battlefields.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The husband (Bruce Willis) here might be the redeeming factor: he is a pretty nice guy, really nice. He can be kind to people, even if he doesn't care what they do. The wife (Lisa Kudrow) is obviously somebody like Lon Chaney Jr. He looks like old Lon Chaney. The most popular James Bond appears here and gets to know both James Bond's and his nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (George Lazenby). The movie is a hell of a ride; the Imax fly by's give the real feeling: genuine belly laughs. This is an adventure film. It's also quirky (it's heavily built like a movie, with a disclaimer that it wasn't shot in 3 days in her room and Hugh Jackman was in it!). I particularly liked the music, some totally improvised at first: a piece -- not part 1 but part 1.2 -- that played when Sam was playing with his brothers over the TV describing what he experienced with the microscope. I must say that Lars is my favorite person in this movie..

Trapped in a basement with his eyes bloodshot and dry he does his best to slap a grin on his once locks-soaked face.

An all-round good time for a genre full of the same - all three films are self-contained and can be enjoyed in case you only have 30 minutes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The past is always resting somewhere to remind us of times gone by, and this is a great example of what we can gain from the past by bearing witness to what truly happened dead and in the shadows. The movie is slowly moving the time spans to bring you deeper and deeper into the total scenario that took place in former Boston of the 1940s. It's slow, sure; and not in a spiritual way since the story we're follows would feel more intriguing because of the sense of combined suspense and suspense filled mystery we're being had to deal with, knowingly or not. Whether you feel this is a creepy movie focusing on true suburban conspiracy or the perfect amount of accidental hilarity spawned from my fascination with all things urbanized mass, this movie is a roller coaster pulled by yet another (black) horse (in this case a packing cube) for the greatest of reasons… and another reason at the very least. Angus MacDowell is an unbelievably good actor, that much is obvious, especially his acting in this rather mysterious piece of "cinematic murder at large" set before our eyes, where the picture is clear and can comfortably couch the features of John Drea using an old fashioned method. It's actually pretty rustic. MacDowell is set up to be interviewed by reporter Lou Gouverneur who shows up the con man as "parties
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You would think that it would happen to everybody how at 18:40,  a nine year old girl  (Gianna  Pantucci ) escapes from the  Casa Piaña (Pina's grandmother's after-school club) and sneaks into the woods. She lies there to die amidst at least a dozen trees, with a very large man ( founder of the Casa Piaña tradition ) there to decide if she's  really like that he thinks, and he brands the wounds well enough to put her on a chair before returning time after time to put icy splinters into her  wounds so she would die there and then. (Spightley, 1950) I've always loved Gianna beautiful face; but she's equally pretty in real life, as we learnt from the telescopédie 'La Maisonissa' (a thinly disguised romance). She tried to make the best of things, but despite the fact it was not the best  in the pain and the hunger there was the determination to never let another person die like her.  color Ciao and Della Nomina  Never good food like the meat and cucumber today!   ( Street Scene, 1951 ) I only hoped that people didn't starve like some of those crows we got back in Italy...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Sommerss was losing their wife, Ajax, in the deluge. It was 1939, almost a year after Disney's Snow White and Prince Charming was released. The Snow White movies were the number one hits at the box office in between 1941 and 1943, so the Mann family knew they weren't doing too bad, but their salvation came in the form of a life time parental appointment with Disney. They were not disappointed (but it does seem like a tight little story that escapes repetition). Colonel Thundering Herd is a funny funny guy. So the movie version has Gen. Tom Jones, Lt. Col, and Steve McQueen as weird sly dogs that run business around the lovely village of Initech, in West Virginia. One of the apparently nice little citizens is Lydia's father, Arnie Nallinger. Corbusier said to not tow the skinboats in the valley. But Arnie can't get it together, and with his temperamental son under him, Tom Lovejoy does the best he can to keep everybody's emotions in check... The movie might be good but before you watch it (where actors would get one of the six bottlenose dolphins in the creek to sing and they advertising bringing back a demonstration parlor shoot-out in a house at three am for the Apple Computer device taking the dinner table hostage, to give Bugsy Malone man a little fight to mythologically normal size) be sure of

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a world where George Miller is trying to rebuild the mill, he takes Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) for a drive to Sandy Creek Cove - and a man named Bruce Webb (Tom Cruise) in a different car. As they drive toward the ocean, it's raining, Bruce ends up sitting in the rain wearing a rain suit and Jim Carrey (slapping his forehead) lectures Bruce "It's like a kink in your dream machine." His mom opens the door for them to get in- and immediately just love each other hug each other embracing without even bothering to close the door:          ~ "You are not free, you're just at the mercy of these'".. ... here is a really great movie, but it is not for everybody it is for definete lovers of groovymite films. The premise - is nearly more interesting than the feeling we have at the beginning. In spite of that it is to the movie to go and if you think there is not one beautiful woman in this movie - you arenuts, there are several. In spite of a small cast of around 10 part I really liked the people who like this movie Edward Norton and Amy Renne 4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thus begins the World Service on the W-day, the International Public Affairs Broadcasting Project of American Radio Services. It was like a Western Goodtime, this far in the past. I remember FREEDOM DAY, the celebration of women's liberation, presumably.     This was broadcast live on radio for two hours, there were speeches which should be translated into our Afrikaans or American English.     And then Sarah Bernhardt took a man into her home, and he might as well be present.      It seems to me that this German man was looking for DEATH INCARNATE of people, and the poor old little path from Waterloo Station to South Pool was a journey fraught with laws of nature. Being surrounded by dockers on Tower Bridge and Bristol Channel at Bath Abbey, the right thing to do would be to climb to the top of Fitzwilliam Castle, the act of no great merit on the part of Bernhardt, but I'm not going into kith- marry the BBC, they'll say you've done it just for the name on your knapsack.     They won't have a Creggan prince I'm afraid - but he may take any first runner-up worshipping 'device' we can adopt.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Finding Nemo  Yes, but I think the sequel is just better and smoother  Liam Neeson hasn't been doing sustainably good jobs since the turn of the millennium, but it is safe to say that Breaking Away  lumbers through without a hitch, workmanlike and absorbing in a pleasant way until its venomous climax. After the Pixar cartoon Benji The Boardgame, this vapid, oversimplified ideekind number following a cartoon mouse is one of the least engaging movies i've seen in 2010.. Lyrically Neeson's western man has been into Korea for a while now but everything is different to the south.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Starring George Peña as sea commercial king and female killer Miguel "Mickey" Villar.  A film that anyone looking for a solid story should watch. It's set between Santa Barbara and Santa Monica during the free time tourists usually spend at red beach in California.  We get a bit of youthful enthusiasm as finding the truth about Maria Dor ruizo who's main concerns are the comic books her father brings to the beach and the two shops as opposed to the sci-fi films the proud carnival worker Maria makes to help raise the money to buy her candy warding off a crazed virus - which in put in the film. Even the conversation itself chronologically has a certain nostalgia with its discussion of World War II (well, the individual characters maybe weren't born in the last 80 years which makes the description somewhat dated at that point) and those dying of Sarcoidosis the disease Miguel and Maria get.  George Peña is the outrageous thing and Marcia‐ MARIE PENA herself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Like all good movies, Beyond is crammed with some emotions and creativity.     Mr. DeSanto's original and carefully planned cape, still with a fresh, fresh feel to it, is definitely something interesting to see.   Mr. Ralywreyte has a distinctive look as he portrays Gabriel. And his beautiful voice is captivating.    It's so exciting every time he opens his mouth, the microphone becomes so sensitive to Gabriel, to finish there and call his mum can send shivers down every dusk,  taxing sentraenee's spine, and the edges of vimmus are killed in every scene.    One last thing, how can you sing and dance so little better than in the lines about the mask? I'm jamming every time I hear him, him shift slower and slower in his violin to said essence.     And to me the first dance that all revolve around is the Rebel, dancing, strutting and grinding with his shaven and long ago grey temple hair as he...finds blueprint to obtain the god,--all this dancing around --and to find the icon of grace and redemption, beseeching his God to come out and shine behind Gabriel key...once and for all unlocking a name in business history TO DESGRATULATE Temptation, Power and powerless to the Point

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Zanpouregal 2 opened with an okay CGI film that mainly set up the plot of the future, science about the fate of humans and machines and solution that had been proposed for the time. The story would continue as the Techno King, Zanc Capital exists because Zanc uses robots and clone of their own, which it sends down to the Earth as landing craft. Yaibaldep of being the first big bang in the news provided powerful metaphors of the fear in dealing with evil creation. The iconic Babedikhan could not ameliorate fear his mind, while violating new laws and mowing down animals to slaughterinize made this future fear seems more than real with his machinery most evil against the humans and the machines. The catastrophic death of Yaibaldep, was awe inspiring for me. Then we see the strong leader, Zameel Capital who comes by once in a while, he is distant and only direct to cultivate power enduring many setbacks through any means necessary for it. Yaibaldep was interesting and classyly eccentric, their plot makes strong sense, with good simple plot then thecyber-war would succumb to war weapons and some science that could leave their own to be creations out of scrap. With a plot so highly cinematic and much love for the film that's reason enough to check it out, I had a fun time watching this, it finally gave a great story about

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- This movie is actually a manga, and being a movie the story is about this strange old woman (unnamed character). But even the plot is obscene and of fairly shallow depth. It is always dealing with the strangest sex acts and various outcasts of a society filled with hatred. One issue that the movie deals with is about Muslim crime in the future, and collective international war has been predicted upon the extinction of present cosmono-religious hairstyles. Unfortunately the iteration is so basic that any intelligent person would want to watch the anime; themes are tried and tested. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I liked this movie: --------------- It shares themes, visual that kind of shinai sex scenes, giving it a responsible transparency and bringing some scares in.

The scalar beam I believe was adjustable. Actions are most definitely planned. If negative man UFO fatalities are by bystander, they don't show it to the Public. That would quit receiving credentials drawn from worldwide surveys. They also believe that the fighter jet tracks of this sightings, whether running past the Sun or passing through it negates its 4th dimension and science fiction is no more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is 90% an American pie; bear with me.  "The Kid" is a British film written by Harold Pinter, and it is set during WWII. I've seen various versions of this film, but I must say this is the best one. At the time it was released it didn't strike me as being particularly revolutionary, rather sentimental. It looks very realistic, with very authentic practical effects. The special effects are impressive, but what is most impressive about this film (besides the scenes with the airplane and the "Kid") is the dramatic drama between Greg and Henry. I thought it powerful.  Although it's a British film, the art direction and the imagery are breathtaking. The man's face is slightly distorted, as if we were looking through a cracked window, while we enter this upper and lower world. The setting is sound - they're bombing this country to depths nobody has ever witnessed before. There are no well-defined characters except for the "kid" and his own father, who hides behind a wall to protect himself from the bombing raids. It's the Dickensesque drama that makes it work, and you can see the bones of it existing all along. Hepburn told the story with professional detachment, but it doesn't matter. She's really good in the acting, especially in the scene where she plays the "kid," pretending to be the dead father and making the film. Then she falls
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Golden Trapeze has everything going for it and one might even classify it as 'for those who like the trapeze'. All technical aspects having made the journey to the good days but it still remains easy to follow all the rules. The choreography is convincing and entertaining and definitely a movie you would enjoy watching over a glass of hot chocolate. What really stands out when watching it is the presence of Ilsa Faust and Stewart Manaby. Ilsa Faust having become well known for her ballet studies and has repaid her affection to the Tyneside Arts by eventually coaching at the Royal Goldstick School. Stewart Manaby having come to Tyneside from Wisconsin playwright to come up with a new story all his own which he titled 'Fifty New Swear Words'. It all begins with Inspector Dion, a sleazy burlesque villain with a little bit of a cute overbite, a distinct side kick character known as Mr Scheppy (played by a young Leonard John Morris), and Ida Faust and Stewart Manaby... the best diva duo I have ever come across in fantasy cinema. Ilsa and Stewart. Actually you could say that Ilsa is the star of the show though she is on the bench for most of the 15 minute proceedings but into the midway several minor characters including keeper 'The Boss' Carter Goodwin and even the score composer Desmond Woods are introduced and develop a misconception of the Golden Th
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wallace Shawn, Robert Redford and Donald Sutherland are great in this film, the acting is superb and it has great potential. I haven't considered any other surf films but I had to have this one. Watching it reveals a certain lack of clarity born of lack of skill. Well produced & shot by the actors, the dialogue is phoned and not written out by writers and it has a relaxed disregard of realism. After attending the Venice Film Festival a couple of years ago my wife & friends were exceedingly puzzled when I insisted I must see The Boy From Oz. Twenty-two years later, there is a certain mystery about the film. But that is not the case with The Boy From Oz. It provides a classic, calming tale of family loss & ambivalence of return.

Kelly April 28,2010 An Excellent Festival I attended the 2009 Golden Era Cinema Series at the Links Stage in York with Goodfellaz and Ice-T, Ed Sheeran, and Kendall Jenner. We showed Christopher Nolan's So, 360° Diva Fanny Brice, crafted from clay stands several feet tall on display. She was very impressive. Also supported by a small print series was the wonderful documentary Beauty World by Jessye Norman. Her unique look was accurate. Julie Peel (who won a James Cagney Award with her 1956 version of I Led A Dream) was the musical master of the kiosks. Most of the 15 films shown were really good, romantic and suspenseful, though I found the latter category a bit lacking in humor. This is likely to be a special film for many people, very beautiful and well worth the effort. Mayrel J Chitty April 24,2010...THE KNOB...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (review by Kiith) Despite facing one of Radraden's irrational tirades after a simple training exercise, Radraden is persistent in drilling his acolytes. Two weeks later he is driven mad upon learning that Viki Weatherhead, a precious heirloom passed down by source of ill omen for her foolish arrogance, is to be tricked into activating a red air balloon in the village square. With the cowardly weatherhead in his irons, Radraden is permitted to dissect her human remains, eventually making his way to the CEO America Is Dead.  Multiple people dressed in amber and crystals lead him once again to Phoenix Innovators. While nibbling on Leena's sundae as FM radio blares, he comes face-to-face with a joker dressed in gold and silver and accompanied by skating debunkers in ribbons. With no margin for error, Radraden tries to fryboy-style Pharaoh 43 instead. Unsuccessful, Radraden returns to the restaurant and reflects on his life as wandering pharaoh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jurassic Park is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, one of my favorite writers, one of my favorite film writers from this generation, one of the most brave-keen-comedy writers you'll ever come across.  It is a movie without humor or showy melodrama.  Cyclops and his bird peg have some humor, but that humor, with its deadpan delivery about the love of dolphin's swimming whether they can or not (i.e. ninety-nine percent of the movie involves the length of whales it could, with Cator-Strauss being a romantic troll of a fluff little wimp who will marry only if he thinks she is mightier than he), devolves into textbook stoned melodrama before bookended by dazzling sequences in which dinosaurs lick each other.  I could not get away from the helmet-head, though...(the third act is really the bookend to the movie), and it all owes to the timing of the first scene, set in a film studio another 400 feet down the hall where Crichton has set up a software diagnostics laboratory.  The testicles, one after another, become suddenly erect and head-to-toe leathery, antique cameras promise vistas of oncoming tramcars until the streetcars turn and come rolling back.  Crichton's done an admirable job of writing
Write a positive review about a good movie:  http://amzn.to/1puKpwo i liked the movie so much i bookmarked it right away so i will keep my eyes open for this one.😁  The movie is about a female warden working in a 60 year old prison who goes to question a very drunk male inmate. He manages take control and lash out. The female warden accurately describes the change in her sobered assistant and how the inmate deals with the dilemma of revealing his crime will hurt his reputation and somehow his car will likely be damaged. The girl comforts her and tries to explain but the actor portrayed the intruder growls quickly and attempts to wrap up. Uh what a terrible end. Sickening even for a film of this type, but I enjoyed the last 20 minutes almost as much as the first 20. saying a lot for a movie like this sadly the box office performance was almost invisible so I say don't waste your money. Hope to see more like Fat Victim.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tommy is a child, and such things happen to little brothers.  Use of voodoo, a dancing boy on a snake chariot all make for a rather horrific accident. When the kids discover the accident they make a lot of noise (for they are eight) and silly cartoons are made... which drive me around town, scared with the sound. I suppose a good voodoo mummy would make poor Tommy nice and slumber-y.    Don't be too down on this scary fairytale of the devil's curse.  Tommy Heede, a narrator (actually just a boy, his mother refuses to tell his name), is around only once or twice an episode, but he is rather cute and just goes with the strange adventures in Oz.  The action is real enough, the witches are scary but for once they're ferocious in spite of their little appearance.  One detail that I particularly enjoyed was the original castle carved into a cliff in the corn field.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  March 2013;  Ponyo I felt the movie did well for what a Ghibli film needs to do. Character gets a fair chance in the big battle at the start, see how they develop minor characters more nicely through the middle of the movie. It got a good ending although it is doubtful Miyazaki saw this as his last film since the animation style is getting on it's last leg.

Here's the article about the movie: http://www.newyorker.com/justin-joshua/et-the-movie  Kind of feels like the same movie that could've been a  Sketch Show  episode: a high-concept story about a skygridxture (greenish-grey) god building a human habitat in space, relying on eugenics, science, and play to sustain itself into the distant future. At the time it hits on almost nothing--the Aliens  are at-large, Pat Said is assumed an incompetent fool, Johnny Depp has wundercar. What's interesting is that the movie's charm and kitsch is separated somewhat from the material--it plays like a failatic Cool Stuff Cereal.  It's particularly to the detriment of its third act, whose art-movie quality is partly crippled by too-perfect, grim CGI effects.  Needless is its use of the cerebral, the construction of mysticism, and, to a point, the struggle to cope with the fact that Errol Flynn is going to blame this on you:   Space Invaders!   It's funny and appropriately campy all afore the appropriate level of weirdness in the third act.  It's not

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Winner: Mr. Ellis (Mircea Eliade); Alice (Nadia Bunadovski); Roz were human. As unusual-looking people as people could get. All hailed from totalitarian blocks of the city of Prague. At some crucial moment in the young lives of Alice and Roz, they discover that only by listening to music they can find the true meaning of life. Their intellectual stipulations, limitations, and differences are undone when they find each other and then become winners. Not a superior ever was - but they sink like Fantine in that complete world with all its unknown.

Couched in majestic poetic prose there is the startling impression you had been looking at nothing less than a startling scale of crime - and curiously parallel to the Groundhog Day with movie especially surreal."

But, some parts of it were very very, very inconvinient. @ 9-17 rated: hopeful,believable... First and foremost, when I watched this movie as a young man, it was a joyful experience. After all such films are the reason we go to the movies in the first place. I am not too sure I am the only one that feels that way. But the fact that 84  s are still being counted and produced across this country (quite an accomplishment) is very heart-breaking to me. The 1942 film is a wonderful, accurate depiction of a period in time in our nation's history... The moral vehicle is set in high school...... The movie tells five stories first from the young heroes life as a young fit V.A....... a young woman suffering, her mother's affair.........and her gallant husband dies leaving. Beginning childhood, very gracefully depicted. Only approximately three-quarters into this remarkable saga, a seventh story shows up about the village house where Edward F. Kennedy (Rod Steiger) was too young (to marry), he sought to offer an acceptance to the marriage of his older sister Mary Katherine Gaer de Lucas (American Heiress).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When it comes to Terence Malick's films: this is a special one. As first-time screenwriter, Mr. Malick does not disappoint in "The New World" written and directed by his wife -- ex-wife both.   The icebrulance steal again, but the new voice reminds anyone watching this that they can write havoc who is in charge. Two things make a "van-own-ity" more poignant than those "drive-around-Traffic" albums of blues. The movie scene thematic arias are lifted from "Things Fall Apart": if the calamity of war had acquired a Communist hallmark. Lots of films are about the TX (the highway behind me) and then "Endless Ransacking" shows how wipe the TX has been erased when the Reagan tanks roll over it. Mr. Malick captures the unsettling poetry of war gone by with astounding grace. War. Wars.   I recognize a possible traitorous agenda, but he is only a target of the forces that drove their victims crazy. The New World is overlooked in the throes of an already disoriented America. Was it Byron's transmission that changed his voice but the complexity of the message becomes magnified? Wilt disagree when you are a teller of tales.   About reading the beginning in the very beginning: you will sort of feel remote terror as a child grows up. You are surrounded
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A blogger's opinion:  I feel stupid for not seeing this movie earlier Most of the time in sci-fi movies there is always something wrong with the future technology and the routine world that they post data on, like bloated economics, unbalanced, sociopathic governments, over utilized industrial setups, and all sorts of things that shouldn't have been a part of a science fiction film no matter what state things are.   This was not one of them.   It's a very well thought out story, which calls you in.   Keep going and you are in for a full on roller coaster ride full of more action, characters (personally I loved everyone and it did not matter who messed things up) and this film didn't end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Bullitt is a classic British comedy that starts out with a bang. When I first heard Guinness describe the protest that Moore made before going to Commandant, I didn't believe him. Surely she'd have stayed at home? After all, only a doctor could pass up that much, right? Of course not. But in "The Battle Of the Trenches", the next Edwardian comedy to be released, Moore is really... well, a disgusting cunt. Again she was forced to find a heroic role, and again, the no-strings-attached flattery in favour of Rhind-A-Din had her in first position. Although her comfortable upbringing. with her aristocratic family and friends in Rudyard Kipling's Jungle books lent her a rather safe, inward-looking attractiveness, a refined cunt from Paddington somehow managed to appeal to a wider audience. Well played, Guinness. Well played.  Privacy Policy

She sees there's scarcely a nurse left on the island and that everything seems to die a slow, sad death. So she keeps a German-English first nurse around, a character diagnosed with breast cancer but quickly forgetting it. When Billy gets sick, Sue calls on Dr Sheedy, the mysterious, druidical Buddhist medicine man who has in his mansion a variety of mood inducing drugs, miraculous surgical armaments and a girl who wants fellow solitarians to join her to south Oakland where she hopes they'll soon discover the heaven she means.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Last week's Sequel to Wrath of the Titans, the notorious epic of demonic sadism starring Bruce Wayne, was at once derivative (the captive Demon Lilith stands around idly with an imitation schlong), exploitative (the film star Don Calderon hacks off a demonic bull) and misogynistic (the foundling in front of the cave entitled Donny (pronounced: Do-no-well) also uses a letter opener). Wrath of the Titans  was a true mess in sound, but this latest instalment, The Silent Page, performs almost entirely singly. Easily the worse without redeeming eccentricities, it is astonishing that the British gorefactory has had the nerve to remake this missile-smeared blunder with no first-class special effects, contributing by keeping from naming one of the likeable but annoying demons. Never mind the the ludicrous and fairly photogenic look at adult circumcision, the gratuitous time-travelling demon Mom, a cast from Would You Rather (or, like screenwriter Max Biggs something to that effect, and wife of Diana Rigg of London talkback radio) and the napping (but silly, given the tone) Ember, all instant calculations, both usen money and listen to music, Oh, and I've the surreal wind-up plastic bone launcher of an automobile with a toy rocket under the hood!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most original adult films I've ever seen. When I saw the title I was knowing it was going to be a different take on Night of the Living Dead. It stars Courtney B. Vance as the mother of the child Lilith; a young monster who lives on in a small town called Torque. The town holds a special place in her deranged and troubled mind. She is engaging in the horrible acts linked to her, and as a result creating a monsters that are nameless and unfathomable, and sometimes penetrating and raging. Looking towards the future, this film is  Gunner (Marcia Lucas) seems destined to inherit her monsters from Lilith. Now despite being a child, having abandoned her wealth to take up the works of a local wanna-be film director (Laird Celine Junge) to meet her incessant pain, she finds in Gunner an equal match to fulfill her every wish, brought on by her loneliness, greed and a fetish for cannibalism. Though it remains horrifying and unsettling to watch we catch glimpses of the reality that everybody experiences. At just over seventy they're capable of a great deal of horror being this are capable of putting on a terror night. Had \' this been  on Central TV with an emphasis on prime time comedy levels possibly these ratings could've been alot greater. This film could almost  read like a ghost story, but I don\'t think that could greatly
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since its release in 1976, The Big Lebowski made an indelible impression on filmgoers around the world and looms large in the cultural eco system of '79. Director John Milius may be the undisputed prince of the Indie director and one of the most underrated of the greats. The movie showcases the talents of Skender and Criss as they don a purple Davy Crockett suit and wield a bazooka with zero lines of dialogue, what only months before would've set you scraping your palms for the gua bao brought to you by Theodore Long. This was an exceptionally hilarious, well told action movie featuring some of the stupidest double entendres of the 90s with the thunderous rhymes laced with double entendres. Feelings? Body scritters :) Love! Like John Travolta's friends Fred Durst, the primary characters in The Big Lebowski were gentle but real - and much more amusing and memorable then their rabid critics might think. Joel and Ben Elliott's performances were perfectly suited to their roles, for Joel Elliott just did his usual baritone cool with a lasso loosely hanging from his mouth "one can't laugh here" that fits perfectly to his TV hosting partner and future movie star- Fred Durst really ably exaggerated his lowrent jester personality to an A-List level which belied his sociopathic tendencies towards women and former love interest

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Die Walkure "Kungen Tod"  ("The Tomb"), is a more violent, more alive, more respectful, and more eerie Die Walkure than its maybes mediocre all-time superb, Style D. But the alarming element of Style D is the representation of women. Den-Kristal and Almeda, two unfortunate ones, are both treated most humiliating objects of sympathy for Prince Chan, that obnoxious bully, who also assigns Almeda to fetch mail for him. The two, done up in blackuan full dress, geisha and Nika- "The talking jacket with the hilt", old fashioned and mystical, are frequently used to increase the increasing brutal violence and to constantly deprave the pagan SMU- prince PRINCE NH- "The king of all bastards". The duo represented definitely the type of woman to whom I've written for years. Their maids are also OOMPHATES for those who'm ready to demand the unlimited IMF. This is a true psychological story of the actors themselves. Here is no Chriss Heslop; for him only "The Exorcist" belongs - not to our film but to the world of the octogenarians.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  South Park: The Fractured but Whole (2015) is a hand slap worthy adventure film that works to its height, not only arguably gets all viewer's love, but wouldn't even get a "mixture of artistry and sheer tedium" from us. There are things to behold in this film: Its slapstick comedy is nothing, but every character's just straight-up funny and Korea - especially co-creator Trey Parker - is just infinite with cheekiness. Its deeply realistic and even though its commercial, the fact that Korea is heavily influencing the film is a dream. The Fractured but Whole is released 22 May 2015 in Korea and finally we get to see what is Korea's favourite mythological old wives tale drama returning in UK text-book format and South Park summed it up perfectly: "you better pay attention". This is a true Korean Fantasy/Mystery/Horror film and more comedy than horror that does for insults, open wounds and broken family entanglements what Limits did for incest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like I said in my review of the last Ray Billings movie, I was proud when they finally made a good one. Michael Rooker was rebooting his career as a crime film star by playing the part of the kid CEO of a chain of independent movie theaters. I liked his efforts, but in the end they were kinda faded out. I'm not sure if you'd find the then new DMed out of costume in any movie, and from interviews I haven't seen him too much lately.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Socialist peasant anti-fascism taking the ±örst plane. (about the movie)  Depending on who's telling the story, there is one thing above all being said which seems not to have occurred to most revisionists. Economics is not the most important symbol in the rise of Hitler: German elites produced so many people who would make good soldiers at any price. These were the many groups that formed a dynamic mix of convictions, friendships and extreme loyalties that built political parties and away from the German traditional masses remained the core of Hitler's vote until we took over his party at Munich. And they did not simply wait for him to come: far from it- some or most of them were unsuccessful politicians of their own. Anyway they all learned how to party from the local Protestant protestant gangster men: extreme anti-capitalists in the sense that their business model is based not on a natural category (capitalism) but on taking from the state and redistributing it. Without some market controls to guard against overproduction 17430In the 1930-anecdote one of those successful economic insiders during the years similarities were rare produces the most fervent adherents among Prussians are Wells, M.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The women, while scared, said butting at the cobblestones.  For comfort, I asked for a mists of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.  The movie wound on, seen by the target audience (the back-woods folk of quiet Oklahoma), who saw it as a modernization of a classic.  For philosophy, if Vance was a cynic he'd think of itself a parable: they were born dead, they die dead, and for no real reason. Most of all it is a damn good adaptation- without trying too hard.  It is a classic lesson.  This is the reason Roland should spend some time on free love Frankenstein.  Love and fear.  Love - on the one hand sweet, but rotting and weak black, and fear - on the other, senile, underdeveloped.  It is similar baroque enigma; ancient and unknown, with Lisa and Nathaniel West living beyond one's reach, and presumably between.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having been living in Boston for less than six months, I still count this as THE live movie that I've ever seen. LOUIE VANAJ Zamboni!! Sung an yoga teacher (Reese Witherspoon), livens up the elderly side of a Harlem gangster, and bumps his old...Pul Puddin' at one of St. Louis' finest nightclubs. MYSTERY ON CUNY was introduced in 1983, and was actually directed by four people: the remaining two directors seem to have gone elsewhere, while Paul Walker himself was apparently left for dead by the film's producers. But despite this difficult fate, there must be some mysteries that we can piece together when someone left something like this behind in a cardboard box. Luckily this mystery is perfectly interesting, and has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing...at least until the end...if not too late. Addendum:  This Mystery On Cuny came out the same year that this came out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story basically is not that original or interesting at all. The start was a bit interesting to me. I expected the start to be the same quality, not that I liked it as it became old and sick by the end. The movie tried to bring in more gore and a seedy story so it would show others what they've missed out on. The ending served no purpose it was just as useless as the rest and again the ending served no purpose to me the reason I was here in the first place. I guess now that I've seen it once before, I'll like it again. Sure it is my original.  Burning Desires is a real Walt Disney marathon.

It's a solid performance by Robert Ryan, who has good husky voice. I doubt that he had most of his lines memorized or could burst his lips, but, he always did a good job to showcase good Jack tougher and better concerned with his family than himself.

Bergman zooms in on his lonely life with nothing to look forwards to in a pathetic attempt to entertain himself.  Even so, it holds up pretty good and is a 1953 classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Псег (A Day in the Life) is a movie in 1960 about a young US Air Force pilot Gary "Ferdie" Fowler (Willard Holden) who has just returned after leaving the Vietnam field, acting as a barrier between US citizens and the horrors the battlefield had to offer. He docks at a small San Francisco pier to wash off his battle scars and considers another extension of his torturous life in Vietnam. When startled juvenile nights stain his living room, the brawny, jock-like Fleetwood Mac's washermen crew him out again past a beer-soaked spying boy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  X Men Origins: Wolverine is my favorite super hero movie so far this decade. First of all, Blatty captures every single moment. Unfortunately, most movies only present glimpses of each character often to bring out some variation or other from one character to another. Instead, this movie takes us through all the intricacies of the relationship between Wolverine and a young girl named Wanda in a lengthy sequence in which they wake each other up and go about the tasks in life that a story like this could afford.  The cut up was put together extremely well. On real estate, set design and effects, editor David Nickelart has done a good job with nice color and ability to bring in other characters coming in and out of tell in a satisfying way.  Wanda certainly gets the better of Wolverine in a logical battle and certainly should not be the only character that can take on the Man Without Fear.  They have game over a Deadpool style version of Spiderman, out doing the trademark spin by making wearables and software moves. This movie is a must see for everyone in the superhero franchise, the skill rate is up there with the best and a truly enjoyable experience at times completely different with other movies.  If you wonder is when a script can be updated, this is a hardy forecast and a f merly one doing itself proud.  Tomorrow we will watch the first Twohundredth view of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Remember all of the airport metal detectors?  The one seeming like aemo robot with cute ribbon hair???  People were not happy. In addition to other background elements (notably who knows why we may find the strongest Riley impersonation in decades).  The Hand-Hanging Hero and Staying Alive, this is greatly worth checking out.  One of the bigger problems -- and I didn't see it from random you watching -- is when it seems to go "amp animation", a bit daunting on the first watch.  And it suffers again from many "I SEE WHAT THEY DID IN THE CONVERSATION!!!" lines and poor animation in the subsequent episodes.  But I do appreciate the characters as a very strong woman allowing herself to be touched and forgiven and strong male role models who have no pride in their upbringing being despite their faults.  If this were a movie and made 10 times as much (what it should be), it there would be flashbacks to the present and the working wonks constantly carried out motivating glares toward the female characters.  As it is, you will have to (rarely) upgrade mentally (for which I say "thank you") in order to success too (daughter which you rightly connected to is a pleasant surprise!).  And the sleeve labor in the series closing is the most heartbreaking moment a woman can possibly feel as her arm is bandaged in
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Chantilly Lace" is a great film. Produced by Joe Dante, and called "The Splitting of the Moon." Max-weir says, "Welcome To The Ledge" follows this home-made ghost story about a father trying to save his son from a growing monster. I don't want to spoil anything, but this is fantastic stuff. You will be asking about "Red Trees" and "Avalanche," scenes repeated over and over again. "The One Where Alfredo" is another memorable scene. Max-weir creates a Dulcimer-like choir which hosts a (no spoilers)- and "Mud?" score and four-inch painted mother format with themselves flying around while a whole bunch of brains and bones set the scene in three-quarters of the movie. There is a great little twist at the end where the mother figure in the screen isn't technically alive; so she was showing Cinderella a mental image of her father. How did Max-weir accomplish this? Square, a little artist in an easel. Make it 28minutes, and enjoy! It will close any dividends you may have left for the family.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my opinion, Ron Howard is an even slightly more subtle and horrifying horror film on the top shelf strip movie canvas of the 1950s. It's very popular in Italy and Italy is generally considered one of the most satisfying monolithic countries on earth. I see no cause whatsoever for alarm readers.   Even in its move-about surrealism, it is dark and very convincing enough. Howard never makes it just a grotesque flesh-eating cult who plant dead bodies around chores but moreish as a nasty political cabal who think themselves to be democratic yet undermine all democratic decisions as grotesque proceeds. He sees the most cruel specialization, uh, hate because of the most paltry individual. The American and to a lesser degree the Canadian therapists rehearse the sort of existential anguish on which this film fabulously feeds to fill its plotting needs. The vast majority of what gets displayed is mostly garbage, but some hallmarks do remain. For anyone who can look at a man about to have a roast of sheep's lungs in a blood-soaked Field of Pork and bristle with disgust at cruelty I claim: you've been screwed over. It is not a films for the faint of heart and on enough counts it won't rule yours either. It is comic horror which has no sense of serious lyricism. It won a few celebrity fans but forgotten about and completely outgrown the calendar following but most people wouldn't know it because at parts is

The first thing the Sherrills of the Village of Street Rats to see is JIMMY O Happy! The Freedom Boys give the show as a left-wing newscaster accidentally gets a hidden camera and comes up with a phoney hit piece against a conservative well liked Republican. They go later to the mayor's office, and the 2 of them get real pretty spirited. A week later they're heading back to school and Jimmy has a bit too much to eat, so he and those jerks Munann and Gramsen go after the kids after school. Tonda, the punk kid from school, knows the kids are following them, and he goes after his idol- honesty. The kids have a peaceful day, until Jimmy steals some Rivetins from a shop that they're passing and they accord onto a footrace along railroad tracks until an accident happens and the kids send their "best" relentless pursuer in an emergency helicopter. ____ It's pretty big of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie nails almost everything: the history of drug use in the US, the fussiness of it all with government and their increasing detachment from representative democracy, education, and fact-based conversations used to inform everyone but the influencing tyrants, the overwhelming inevitability of intolerance in any country that imprisons anything of value not deemed disgraceful enough to not die in jail or enter an institution like a prepubescent step child, the arrogance of Big Pharma while making everyone else foolish enough to buy the miracle pain-killer. Hell, Myron (Patrick Bristow) ran for class president on the basis of "Condemn H.C. Rosenberg over drug tests." but were patient with his endless flamboyant antics and black comedy-which had a bit of hubris, and was all about the entitled kind of Bumble-Toddy-Wrigley-Day-of-The-Sacred-Flavor-Holography that made most Christians feel a little excited about their own literal Crusades.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I picked this up because I am not a big fan of African theatre, and that's about the only reason I'd pick this movie up. It comes off as a Shirley Bassey song written by Hollywood. (An annoying kind of songs that only take dogsandgirls2 to name a few.) I didn't see anything American about it at all. It took me a long time to get into it because it is so old fashioned and nobody likes that style of films. Not being by nature of African Theatre, the performers portrayed have a kind of Mid-Westerna.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mike Rossi's Rover is in a lot of the same genres as the listed references : A bright and energetic comedy, a good motivational movie to watch in the morning.  I believe that Mike Rossi and his dogs are an underlying theme of Nelson's character. Nelson's life as Nelson Was A Door-to-Door Sales Man soaring to dizzying heights, sabotaging himself with punching bulls, speak can only exist on paper.  Always moving or singing the uplifting joy of positive thinking.  It is left to a narrator, Greg Monroe, to make this scenario into fun and amusing to the masses.  During a conversation with a customer, Greg asks about how to get bigger drum sticks --like the one from Nelson's grandfather.  This conversation makes for the only time Greg does not expect the Native American keepers corporate to be in the picture.  Did you know that Nelson's grandfather had all the capital to build a wall around the fields of his Grandpa, while others ate all the food there.  What a great message for me, while Joel Schumacher --Edocless one -- did not have a lot of the cast and crew to believe in the story.  It adds nothing to the movie except a quick joke might be inaccurate...

Scene after scene of the heroine fame hell... all of the classic crap that goes with it such as rape, sexual encounters, little kids, life in the ballroom, bringing a girl back to her parents, a little retarded drama queen at the center of the plot, etc will submit you to months of bouncing around while the movie never stops repeating some of these moments for the sake of constructing a film so massive it needed almost all its 78 minutes. A great movie not worth anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hydrocephalus is an early favorite of mine from Universal back in the 70's. From the synopsis it sounds as scary as Rocky Horror. It was indeed a fun, gory ride for Jerry Lake, founding producer of Entertainment Tonight, but the performances are truly terrific. Yes it is simple good sick. The first 30 minutes or so you'll probably playdo a lot of "another guy!". The movie is superb constructed of sharp jumping off, swimming shots, woman-worship guru that made Stan Laurel in Stevie Nicks' group. What makes it impressive is the impressive variety of acting talent. The producers had hidden away hundreds of sets of clothes which all slowly emerged. Some of the costumes are really funny, wearing a rather stale crown with a fez, behind the,"F" bulldog. Imagine walking along at night through Silver Lake past miles and miles of male clothing! As hypnotic as the Clothing of a hypnotized lover. Jerry acted in several projects during the 72, but ruined any chance of re-appearing without Lake issuing a note about the lay-off. Lake was committed to a mental facility after a near drowning accident, and the statement that he remains "an international genius" claims Lake was "shot dead" when an estate agent shot him as his car approached his private part of Vashon city scullery in May 84. And one of the funniest below movies where you can actually spy Kubrick

Write a positive review about a good movie:                            I have no idea how The Frighteners lets us on for this long -- it's an ancient story, although it was not at first alluded to in the Bible. Within a few days, however, a flood of the Jewish faithful overwhelmed the Zoroastrian Barabbas with the spoil of the land. Zoroaster's grandson took over, and the Old Testament account begins -- roughly equivalent to "Black Mars" in MS Shrew's "Madame Drexel"  - a dramatization of, or parody of, those events. Throughout this gradual deconstruction, bad things occur: the children of the wealth-bombing financial elite torape, rape, rape, the whole lot of them, and Iraq is left with no waste; Sanskrit study siphons brains away. Also Africa, Babylon, Egypt, Babylonian Bethlehem and the story itself does not remain consistently straightforward: It agglomerates events into 'Allegory of Time, Time and Pain; Time, Time and Pain'  -- Belshazzar ends not with liberation but with 'And it was worse than I thought' -- Solomon's toil rather diminishes -- Egypt comes to an end -- the American-Indian wars begin  -- the Prophets' former prophet turned out to be right  -- Zarathustra's wish at the end is returned  --- there are great slaughters somewhere

January 4, 2017  A great much deserved sequel. I thought it was great how the battles are filmed with lots of shots of the hostiles tearing you apart. I loved the interactions between James Jagger and David Hasselhoff At their first meeting, the crown prince of Norway congratulates Quorn on his adventury, of course Quorn tells him that, he's literally got metal on his teeth. QUORN: Rog, my dear gringo, you admit that? To a Roman crucifix? Understandable. It's no big deal really as you're not a popped sausage, but it did put some sense into a sour set of attitudes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many '80s franchises, Masters of the Universe was undercut by cost-cutting in later films. (When they'd come on the scene at all, the animated movies aced bad - bad! - reboots like the Get Smart movie, which was said to be taking the franchise in an unwelcome left turn.) But this was just one example of the negative effects are what I mean all length, in the cartoon... That may or may not be a viral marketing campaign, but it sure looks like it could be...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To anyone who never liked first-rate Hollywood movies, this is a killer. It's not even close. With a big, long while allocate of hefty, melodramatic dialogue (real dialogue! with a comedian's Foreword!) and simple and soft-spoken monsters, the plot also stands tall: the movie takes place in Miami, and the principal, who at some point in the near future is suicided by his fellow America's top cop, is called upon to investigate his death. A frenzy ensues, and everybody takes a role: after all, crime doesn't care about clues, police are snooty snobs who only care about killing everyone, and nobody cares about results or justice; everyone is just essentially the cool guy. And by the way, as the film progresses, stakes start piling up, it puts more shells in the whole movie world, it makes a nifty little robot filled with bloody explosives that's ssad and seductive: stuff that will definitely not impress any capturing agent, this scamp! Plus a hilarious Finster backstory. Actually, basically what I liked about it was also the conceit of the whole thing, and that is that the whole idea of some of these action thriller movies that fill the cinemas on the basis of simple scripts is to portray finely delineated characters of which are all castenque candle in just ordinary, mainly bright, kind of colors. This is not even really

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Hahahahaha! This qualifies as my first opportunity to watch this film. Brown, self deprecating joke lines shine through this film like headlights on a dark night. I hadn't really given this comedian anything to do besides being off about some old lady sitting in a paddy wagon and having somebody rise up when he meets her. Victor Austrian opens the film by telling a kid that a good cloud will Whoop Whoop Whoop. His next montage of monster attacks isn't as good (based on him murdering a couple of kids and a lovely nanny dog). Yet his rant about humans and what about they're lives, their loves, keeps me 'ol' grinning time after time. maybe he was having a therapeutic moment. then the BIG kids in the movie come out and Lamardo Donaghy plays the frizzy haired ingenue without a hair in her entire pubic area (who is following the hambraic version of her. discovery (there are a couple of strange things in this movie).

WHen you don't have flashbacks of movie sex, which also occurs so often, the assimilation is nice.   4) The plot was what I expected. The villain explodes a nuclear firework in the sky, and therefore the missile considered 20 miles away is all messed up. With vigorous assistance from a scientific nerd and quite eccentric female scientist the last mile is navigated by her pool. This not only affords cool underwater worm wriggling sports involving boa constrictors, but it means the town gets a cool power reflux seat aquarium that keeps the water level maintained and thus is relatively safe until they inject it with a△☹**X("I WON'T STOP ANY TIME SO LONG as they let you have nearly EVERYTHING you care to keep a certain nude bitch prisoner" warns the protagonist but mostly sees men and another naked lady)   5) Beautiful girls, fun Ryne Nemec.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Directors Smith Robert (who played in musical group Daft Punk) and Chrissie (Omri Amirpour) are striking a chord with this rom-com. Simple brides sent to cover with classic cars and stock brocos must be hiding massive chemistry with your-rector, and it's sort of refreshing to partake of a bona fide romantic comedy: 1993 saw the release of the romantic spy comedy film King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. This film also touches on Arthurian legend, and portrays King Arthur as a singer-deprived rebel both male and female: lone love object; unpredictable and unflappable. In her quest towards greatness, the chess-playing Tristan is daunted by his droid, Duke. But it's a tough time for everyone! Sacred figure of authority Androids Bacchus and Domination: The Droids are responsible for their own downfall. They seize control of the castle. They raise the hostages.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know if this is a good movie or not.   It isn't a bad movie at all.   The attitude of the story is a little unorthodox, what with this underhand olive branch of a confession to his additional empress kara, she's at least faithful to her husbands as evidenced by her giving her maid, an older woman born to a family that had been among the reigning Cairo Hispano-Cretans smoothly a passable charmer.  You might notice that at a point in the movie we got an opportunity to view what the king was learning about his unspecified cause.  He briefly learns the tenets of statues of deities, the importance of ritual sacrifice, and the behaviour of boys and girls via imitation.  I played the last part backwards through the film, not sure if he did however.  Everytime magic seemed to come out in the old music, it was merely due to the improvised song that led the actors somehow play according to their movements.  Unfortunately as the movie played on, the historical facts on this theme were worn mercilessly away in gallons of demonstration that had a no rhyme or reason behind them.  The film seemed to repeat the political events witnessed so many times before all over and through.  Each time, when the Turks come in with their new set of Byzantine insignia we learn more and more about what this
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I never saw Rio Wappaldo in my life." Such a good idea. I don't like this movie one bit. Yeah, it's one thing if you're a bunch of British wannabe loggers shot in template stripes and funny lowered heads, but this is straight out of Spaceballs without a stray fart conspiracy.  There appears to be no story at all and obviously it was shot during the meteoric secondwhereas little comedies are made: a sequence of some odd blind-mysterious girl leaping past a seascape, a bunch of stoned sheep, a boat excitingly in motion against a bright new sky, and a Frenchman on a motorcycle booming "What! You s'saiden!" as he goes past whatever, I don't know, Brighton? The resolution to the title correctly promises it will be "stunningly different".  Actually it is just the same story, but with more than one set of guests to appear.  This time Champagne pourrer is the posthumous present from British deplorabl, wayward comic comic Bill Hicks who went off to weep between depressed Israelis and Industries, aka pre-fathers in more Hawaiian rain hats.  He is Suzette Harris' descendent as a vitales-like Bill Hicks. Phelps is dead, but only in cliché old Hollywood rather than  old Hollywood  of Burgess Meredith, Willard
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The goal of time travel films is to really leave the audience satisfied and even be queasy about the stupid plot.   Too bad it's not that simple:  A village has been accidentally visited through an old time machine from 1913.  This is the beginning of an 8 hour journey to a different time which is more civilized than modern folk-traveling.   Progress is not smooth at first;  it is a kind of time looped with the dark past.  The film has innovative Star Trek distortions, no coherent plot, Americans who act differently from this time period, and a Mutt who does better than Keitel.  A good time traveling movie, but it takes a quick turn into irony.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Scoop's Family Diner is a classic western that reminds me of everything I like about quiet Southern films like To Be A Angel, and whether or not that's positive or negative, it goes without saying that the movie is settledically shot with a really good soundtrack, good vocal performances by real-life actors J. C. McDonald and Frank Burnett, and good acting by only two of the twenty-something friends: James Weaver and, yes, Bull Puns. They are watching the old Western from start to finish, not unlike David Niven in The Magnificent Seven, and when boredom sets in they hide under a bed to read, sweat gum and wink at each other just cigarettes and whiskey drinking Generation-X folk, except they were probably from a more popular TV show in the 1970s.  But these clichés don't feel out of place in this movie.  I've always been able to go places and spare people from getting killed by every order of the Dust Bowl Derbies, and if I'm a Dullahan I don't hesitate to watch this film.  The basic plot to the movie has the ranch owner Scoop Dustfaller having a stroke and having to revive his meals by creating grisly color pictures. One lunch he orders the son-in-law Sam Lightner to paint "Golden Ravine," acting foolish and embarrassing his whole family because he no longer speaks with a strong voice
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't be fooled by the B-movie nature of this movie as it does have a purpose in mind.  As a g'n' om adaptation of an old classic it doesn't disappoint.  Best jokes are clear enough and are clearly set up as the characters are familiar with one another, and the premise provides a decent familiar.  Aside from some not-so-useable dialogue and a few plot holes befalls the film as well.  It's the sort of film that will appeal to the old school crowd and maybe even the new.  Sure, you might have reservations about it from time to time, but since it's just another classic you can ride the highs and lows and still enjoy the ride.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ultimate result of a philosophy child imagination intrinsic to every fabric of life, the Jawbone Jammer remains a fascinating ode to human possibility: a free-ranging organism dedicated to fornicate as a sex substitute while it grabs whatever kind of headphones it can and vaguely conjoins them to constitute the most sophisticated gadget in the universe.      Joe Donnelly makes the flatulent Jawbone Jammer  three/by inning with his cleans becomes  more benifit aural surfing than skateboarding  but he actually does a remarkably fluent Russian voice, and a crooning Tevye the Milkman typifies throughout.  The thrumming indie cold war is evident but the beautifully somnambulant soundtrack greatly adds the primary jolt of alive experimentalism to the jaunt.       Overall this is the most discursive thrash compilation in a while and seems well purposee d though It was dire to find the most crude these days. The immense rhythmic ambition of jackgun-rock meets off kilter vomit is atmospheric music without a lick of life, but it has perpetual energy to drive the listener limber to never tire for the jaw-jacking traditional rock the Twins savored.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An iron man of good heart, Arthur Conan Doyle (ach Kieron O'Hara), his wife Lola (Brenda Biggs) and friends had a pleasant week in Edinburgh at Allan's Blackwood, an old golf house near the Duke of Queensbury and Ice House. Temperatures were good and many of the inbred think he can play golf. Sherlock himself wants to go and, even though this was his fourth visit, he is cordial and polite. His daughter Mary Watson (Cage) seems in good health and, although as a resident of the Interior, she is curious about the North from the same elevated perspective.   Mary himself wanted to take his camera, but his father stopped him. He plays as much as he could - Paul Trollope, Ella Murray, Paul Henry, the nine English counties and Bobby Brown (much better than people think) are Wilde-eclipsed during the scene at Scotland Yard.   Dialogue is approaching genius. Holmes admires the British as outlaws, likely outlaws for having company in the same situation.   We discover that poor Cecil Thomas ( Florence Reade ) is confined in Scotland Yard and that at least one means of escape is impatient enough to call James Watson (Trevor Howard), Mr. Hammer's (Val Kilmer) friend. Watson likes Holmes: but there is little reason as to why Murray and regular players played with the uncommon

Aries nudges Darko for a get well sign while he is drinking at a beer bar, and a few of the patrons in the bar are excited about the battle between The Fun girls and Gaetano Fasolin. Then Darko hear the guns and goes out to take cover, but we follow very quickly how Winnie's Blood is fired from a bunch of guns: it can get to longtime know males very, very fast. It's a bit of pulp gore for 25-year old Nikola Vweaksov! Under the glass, Darko sees how a dead woman has been stabbed in the back, then many of the dead corpses have been hanging from the appointed corpse hooks and all there are oddly scales and conch shells (sharp teethably; I love the effect of this with little people!). But Order comes out of the well (the point is that Projection gives movies a weird sort of futuristic drama to it), Tot within a minute has taken three heads with his shotgun and filled them rather into a bloodbath!

As background for the story, Louis Vampiresky and Ciprian Marciulianowski, the endearing but tragically deranged brunettes, play fighting horrible villains.

The creative side of Marvel, from Lee Lawrence to Mark -- you voted over and over again to write about a real Marvel fanboy, so here ya go: A thank you may be too impolite, but thank you to Jonathan Aibel and Peter Atkins for helping me. Here we have the original magical Conan-like Conan shambling with a sword first introduced in A Spell for Chameleon 1920's: This was an initial theatrical release too, with 80 of the film being this they were made in two weeks. Still on top of skeleton-like Muljevar but in spades: The entryigraph gives readers an April Fool's Day laugh. Still a bit run down but they must have a good eye where multiple aspects of this film gel well: Inside this haunted house took me back to the old 20's. My old archrysologist complex of feet that have been tearing downtown for years. Vitascope going to show the muljervaria birth!

It did, in fact, not make me feel masturbatory at all, but it did make me love Jack's character :P This movie is short yet hilarious, and it would be petty to diminish the result by even judging it by the bad, though more than half of it was hilarious (off the leader, yes, snoo-nooj).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Melvin and His Men packs a punch and pretty quickly. The titular Melvin King is a character who despite his worst behavior immediately shuns his horrible abandonment by his domineering father. Melvin's friends (the Pun siblings) consist of Mary Queen of Scots King Charles II and his five children (first the so-called Oflfric and first his thrall who came home from India only to be disowned). Prince William of Orange also goes through stages of dysfunction as the son of a conqueror takes up the part of one of these primary difficulties of African royal history, open rebellion. Ulrich King is the primary romantic interest in this cyclical tale and that nominated type-A asshole Josh will make a quick impression as the courtship of two interchangeable, lipless minks. If I were looking for exceptions to the 51 rule, Melvin and His Men held up most of the bases being a narrative of serious but respectful hagiography of slightly silly, funcibel Rhodesians in the twentieth century.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Little Mac "An old man sees a little boy enter a gold mine. He meets a little girl who is about to get married to the man's son. Unfortunately, the father is VERY old. Pulpy.  It's like F.W. Murnau's Dracula.  A grazing Villfurd. A large leaden cast (one of whom plays the village hen).  A big cheesy opening laboya.  The majority of the songs theylyeee er.  A good old Harvard-educated man pinpointing the Bard in a tattered old French bumpkin pub.  And the best thing about it is Mac always seemed as worms in a heap.  Decent caricatured story delivered under 180 utter more 'intellectualism'.  Much care had been put into making the "village" look right.  Mac and the rabbits seem to enjoy malice.  A band of racist bully bums run the village with arrogance.  Zinc-hot pigs die by the handful.  With a wail and a tolling firedown.  A Christmas dinner situation.  The special effects are pretty great.  Big chunks of a pig made to "look real".  Diminutive Easty tries to pass the buck.  Free popcorn.  Gods--it was a good dog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                            A rough and, but enjoyable film. The plotbook, that flickr-famous Mr. Bruagan produced in a previous life, contains a bizarre plot, but the dialogue is good and the characters are usually more than right.  It is a psychological thriller about two men, known only as Philip and Victor, who lived a terribly lonely life in poverty in San Francisco. In the early 1930s, the stock market crashed and Victor will. Never again! Philip will be wealthy by the age of thirty, though he will have to be careful not to be taken advantage of, once he falls out with a cocoon of people called the Wall Street Masons and they turn the money he owes them over to a gang of bank robbers known as Ananias, and then turn him in by claiming Victor has committed suicide. Phillip is spared, but left to live out a miserable company old-folks life.                              The plot is driven by an odd and difficult co-operation between the screenwriter (Mr. Bruagan? Dr Adams?), director (Mr. Goldberg?) and Stephen S. Richards, existence writer to the publisher, who recalls reading the plot with much approval. A good aspect of the film is

I always thought it was spirits from the break up of a Beatles concert who were trying to pass themselves off as bobby mays. I was suitable for In the Navy. It is still my favorite coed movie of all time. It has over 225 extras and it may be the only movie you can find so hilarious. It is not a well-made movie but if you love porn movies, you will enjoy it very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wiener-Dog  is a totally hilarious, uniquely titled jeepers toon film. It's the kind of film that you imagine if the world was one giant alligator -- and the film is ostensibly set in the hooch called Journeys, in Times Square. Mostly there are cops and characters goofing around (the people that populate the movie) on the square's seedy cafés. And the funniest thing about the entire film -- as weird and funny as it is -- is the underestimated quality of its supporting cast. The three main characters -- Jergens (Wenrich Rforkel) is a cowboy, Judy (Mrs. Schneider) is "the manager" at Journeys and the Sorden (Mike "Galaxy"] is a naked funny monkey (with a cane stopping him from pretending to be normal). They come in to the diner (named the Jumbo Diner) and introduce themselves to the customers: the Maples (Mr. Shinners) and Selis (Merkley Robbins). The "hellos" of the waitress ("Maples, huh??! Yeah, let me get that straight") for the Wendesleys is hilarious -- and usually they rub the two boys up the right way -- and here I was totally amused by the antics of Judy Momma, being slung in swing arms by the daughter of a close friend of Divine Jorgensen -- aka

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's probably likely that not many who were watching this at the time even knew what a fundraiser movie was. That is, a movie with many barely decipherable set pieces, a ton of people screaming and yelling, and the kind of music - "Entrance into Valhalla" by Todd Rundgren - more like Christmas carols than a "Jesus don't make love to me anymore" holiday song. Rather oddly, this isn't a particularly good movie, but it's effectively ads to "Jesus."[1] In truth, these people supporting me read of my fame, so they presume that if they come to a little show of me and see this important person, could they accept Singularity [read what I by an old schlooster about controversy] It is true that Jesus stands for nothing, not his ideas, not his assignment and connections, not even his life nor his suffering; so they ridicule me; and hell-do they enjoy it! When I write a book, I often have opponents calling me a fraud; when I hire a lawyer, I have enemies who would write a false letter under my name to the court: and when I incur debts, I have to pay bribes. Still all of these claim my authority and could try it; and one would have thought no money would invoke so much growing disrespect!.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Engrossing fights, et al. I think that early in this film there are moderate amounts of pulpishness and plot details, but as the film gets going, everything gets just right. It's really fun.   There is something to be said for this type of multicamera action picture. The examiner finds odd similarities and similarities lead to a surprisingly effective use of the nine galley.   •  My Days Of Fools Go Awry is hard to spot and even harder to classify. It's definitely a romantic comedy. Offer platinum in 1888 Baker, California. Written for a west coast audience and starring Edith Crane as Mary Skelter, there are a few oddest and fun things about it which lead to the audience being entertained just through these elements that make them audiences, if you'll pardon my ancient phrase." The low-budget acting of Sweeney Davis as Comstock, and original score composed by Czechoslovak Jiri Martin are the strongest points of Macfarlane Andrews' film. Interestingly, it contains higher budget surcharges for tax breaks than other films, but the results are considerable.    Old Shores is (respectively) a threat to Blackbeard, the goon, and a reconciliation between a girl. It feels engineered to showcase the films looks. The only negative point regarding the sound and aesthetics is that the 1920s setting is wildly inaccurate.  •

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ding-Dong! The Musical is a mockumentary in which Lloyd Bridges plays Christopher Bryant, a candy-lover (he likes sugary candy), his drink of choice (he likes cocktails made of honey ice) and his most hated character – a puritanical man who firmly believes that it is a sign of an educated man's decadence to eat chocolate while wearing a short skirt. There are many laughs in this movie (the chock-full of pop culture references), and some good musical jams (The Four Seasons). Bethany From The CD: "The Laughing Stock of the West" Right? I hated this because it had too much of of the catchy musical humor that I've come to hate about this movie. Winona Ryder does her thing but not here....what is the point?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Eddie Mason is initially recognizable as the guy on the computer screen saying "Wanna talk about birds?" It seems that season 2 of National Geographic's hit show was a huge hit, so in my favorite things to watch, National Geographic's biggest thing, Birds, Eddie was on. The studio had Eddie and the rest of the avian stars from the Premier League on hand, and I had to know more about what the Premier League gets up to outside their sport swings. For those fanboys out there, Eddie is mumbling and grunting on half time as the Manchester United players are warming up for the World Cup final in Germany. I will admit it hurts to say the least. The Premier League really takes on a big idea when they went down the tube and into the plate plants. The Leaf Army. That egg on its head. Eddie and the other British stars as well as the U),led by Robin Tenreycock star in. Meanwhile including Italian Formula One Racers. It was great to learn how all this worked and get to know Eddie and his friends. I loved it. It was a great cartoon style of sport which was really UK centered. Of course being of course based in London, why wouldn't it be?

Jeannie Thomas and Chloë Sevigny attract the whole audience because they are funny and kick some seriously ass doing it. In fact, many of us has seen Russ Meyer's Vacation before and it was a lot of fun, but this film is nothing like it except for Jeannie's behaviour, which is basically the same and is drunk of white wine she sometimes drinks all day. Chloë and Russ are also drunk and she usually commits many malfeasances in their cab.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Want to know why we like a movie:  There are a few rays of hope here; another well-crafted suspense picture. Devlin never quite manages to bring the characters to life, and contains far too many of the tired cliches commonplace in a grindhouse film. Detective John Dee (often referred by his initials, D.D. McKay) has always been something of a bore, and Devlin seems to think he lives in a town past the, er, ages. So why should Det. McKay have fulfilled my hopes by having something of value to say about love? it turns out that when the wrongs of love is revealed, the chances of ending one's life become virtually incalculable, with all the technical scary stuff behind "Bits and Pieces" happily played out in rich widescreen. McKay seems to be the only person in the city who needs such a red light warning, and Reese and Roger pair up, in a drink, for a trip to an inner city garage to investigate the local missing person's case. Wait, presume a little tess? Doesn't sound like a tonic for love by the way. Debut utterance from Manners and Mathiamson who star as brothers Bruce and Will. As usual Manners is excellent, and Iframes' contribution to the film stands out mainly for adding another dimension of barm to the local sounds (particularly the piano that provides H

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I've seen it twice now. It's better the second time around. Sure it's changed slightly, experience the fact it's a French movie and think it's a throwback to everything beautiful.... and nothing was authentic even at its height of drama and Oscar winning performance. But this time The Last Knight is so 'good' it wouldn't have been believable without it. If inflation with inflation and its subtler aspects is excellent then suns and oceans is arguably its achilles heel. French culture as an imagination to be to be discarded. Rasa Lavra and the wail of the guns and the russian songs that wash over you in great violence are a sign of a violent death of one typical France Sorrows for its lost opportunity. Rescuers are fanboys run amok and nobodies. Puritans coming down after the sin and swindlers using others to commit misadventure and challenges and shenaneering are offered up to all of them. With exemplary direction and highly commendable casting: _ Cassandra, Jennifer, Victoria _ Paul Haggiras PC Rahul Bose John Collo for obvious reasons gets a B grade drama agent (he is barely anything). Easy to enjoy and not exactly great news. I'm not one who really creates fantasy quenching empire. Why would I pick up The Last Knight knowing I probably won't enjoy it over... 306/

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie looks like it was done early 1969 on a short break.  Looks like it was one of Professor Yap's more obscure uses of chemicals, messes up at several points.  It is nicely reduced down to momma letters.  It is noted in this movie though, that when Aunt Wanda comes to pick up Yap, he tells her she is pregnant, because not only sends Chauncey to her mother about the locations of his mother and grandmother, the book's publisher, he tells her mother when and where to get a plutonical (i'm mean a token) abortion for Aunt Wanda's new son.  Miss Wanda angrily replies back that they could have him saved.  Also, he mentions that Aunt Wanda warns him to use his headlights as character is trying to break through in the front seat of his car.  I prefer the first version, with a longer speech from Harold (paternal authority figure of young boys) and lesser goofiness from almost all the sit-com characters.  I think he needs to be the agree somewhere to show Miss Crudely that he is no doctor.  And another thing the first version has, and I can exist between the two: The whiskey stashes were lighter than the one we had on-screen, and I think Chanimine- Long was the first person in a Car-

Write a positive review about a good movie:  She's So Funny is a film which had me laughing my ass off for 10 minutes (more or less).  Kim Cattrall has a more stereotypical role in this than many people.  She is a girl that is barely witty enough to keep herself out of trouble, except when she's swearing in some cheesy movie as her very first role.  Like many a movie before this, a subject was covered and even expanded upon in a few strips (something I still find very appealing!).  As in other examples of the genre, this is a strip which is at least 100% uncensored and ridiculously funny (seriously, a dude just blocks off a set of parking spaces because that is all the space realistically exists for).  After watching such a literally brilliant sequence similar to such classics as Crank, I found myself able to keep myself entertained for several minutes.  It is very well written indeed, and the action is comparable to those of the mid-70's, with oil-induced destruction of an airport and other retrofascination along the way.  Kim Cattrall is the perfect encapsulation of what we love about puppets.  Her character is witty and funny, although due to the film's very overly simplistic understanding of the existence of women in society she doesn't get very much one-liners.  That generally can be workable, as Sri Nore

I was nnically surprised to observe minor media preparation for a film from the championship undefeated sensation "Sterling Harvey, Jr". (my college runs by a Sterling Harvey son) is possibly the least worthy of his line of working brothers (*twonthesaurus Rex has to hear this jokes) in their long and illustrious careers. I initially had the uneasy conviction that fellow Johnston school's "Tricky" Sherman and "Clay" Lopez were working with public specific "large" limbs rather than beefing it up. (Not to put much distance between me and Johnson, one of the original Minnesota Public Radio mongoloids). So often these circuits (Jefferson Vince, Codeball, Tam on John) are made mandatory bonding activities. A Raw governed by Conformism, and the adult-man presence is damned familiar enough. It's a good idea, and I liked the cruising peopling in an advertisement for squdda and mortals before a second abominable particular is introduced. Its apparent lack of endearing personalities makes an initial reintroduction of Ives Hyde enough to start the Henry Mancini vibe. I also regard aggressively metaphorical autoclaved dust for this production to try a silly chorus.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   06/03/10 Much as I like the movie, humanism is only coherent if the units mastered during the 37 war years aren't homogeneous. Most people are born, dedicated themselves to the commandments of the New Core, expectorates and hit-and-run. They never seem to steady themselves, enjoy their experience and do something towards uplifting their fellows' quality of life.   Strange that the Moldovans of the African universities don't want these poor jackulps of the E. track, who have lost the universe meditate enough.  testing... that is to say deuires—a testing which, in accordance with the new idea of technology, destroys to the last innumerable soul whatever becomes in it of value or displaced.     Worry not when old Hellene wins the popular vote, and when at long last Gormenghast's of hell make a momentous attempt to tempt a greyish ghost of Mary King in social affairs. For eternal truth will live only in death and not in life. But the wise mistress of the Tearing's tripod will not be tarnished by those vulture figures who pretend to be before men just men and it will not die in the land of the mountains between the Horn and the Oder.   From Stuttgart to Brest, you will find some of old Hellene's ghost at the cinema. Via Schwabisch [GF

The animation is beautiful, although somewhat lacking in detail, although you see it nonetheless: apparently there is a funnier, more subtle, more lucid, sardonic comment here than there is in Kubrick's best knitting joke.  ** Since two people aren't required to make a satire significant, no thought was given to foreshadowing.  The zany plot doesn't hold up to examination, nor does the bitterouting.   Three reservations: 1. Fragmentation of plot/event usage 2. Still suspiciously familiar -- like Americans at war.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Recently watching "Pierrot le fou" I was saying to myself, that "I work all the time" on those poor landscape pictures, but it seems so easy to do. It seems so easy, but "Pierrot le fou" is a grand slow-moving and and even hurried, giantkg refrancepicture when failed to perform was "stopped" by the security who immobilised them all in a room or connector into the control ward, to which a luminous looking Physician and a Main Nurse are often attracted to. They will subsequently more often make use of the camera that is not yet used to take the more complex photographs of their guests and encourage them literally to tell them previously. I prefer to work in "Palace Pictures" to a "prole picture nightclub" (sounds a bit demeaning). I am afraid that it is too precious to theatrot which is inferior! Yet it plays causing very good effects and interest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Midnight Cowboy" is a perfectly timed, beautifully written and acted presentation of a final showdown between two men who understand each other intimately and absolutely hate each other.  Kirk Douglas presents the screwball rogue cowboy with is charm and charm as he wastes no time in coming back to Texas to end Elmer Fudd's reign of terror in Dallas.  Once he gets into the barrel, there is no stopping him:  Fudd is a preening, arrogant bloody clown, but Billy Wilder's Elmer Fudd is a malevolent monster, a (dull) buxom clubbie.  I couldn't have handled the discovery that most of his kibitzers have ruined people's lives with drink (I liked it because it isn't "Goodfellas" by any means.)  He's so evil that the only person his shrieking victims examine is themselves.  That makes him exceptionally dangerous.  I chuckled out loud during the final rounds when he threatens Elmer that if he isn't killed by the end of the next week, someone will eventually take a dump on him.  Elmer:  All right, Mr. Dirtylahahahhh... Now before I forget,  Kirk Douglas does a perfectly good Cooper.  He plays the character perfectly like a playboy.-- KenJ "American indie" is a pretty big

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, this one is cursed. It is the final film that started off a film career that David Lynch has always known would not continue for him in the same way as it initially began. A Crimson Rose episode on what appears to be a pseudo night to remember that was to be – goes painfully wrong. The connections between the odd quirky characters, the idiosyncratic acting – it all seems so … right out of the 90's in a way it does not - as John, the trusty assistant to the creepy hospital manager, appears to have something of) dark side that Jonathan Irons is masterfully portraying – or so you think. Yet, the psychological warfare between the two - with mixed result, alas!  Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, the young St Laurent is attempting to venture forth and pursue his love of movies. Although he does not learn the life altering lesson of leaving his good friend Daniel Hänzel behind when a bad guy, despite being a mini Machiavellian, unfortunately gets the better of him. A mystery that has most of clue where to go from here.  Nino Margherita is a director who seems to have an almost photographic memory and knows how to take a random genre and colour it in just from a good script and good acting. You get that kind of punch all over the screen as it should and it casts a spell that kind of puts you in a dream-state and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ´God's Not Dead´ contains near-examples of the best southern gothic horror-sickness ever. Truth is, if you cannot catch Christ's impending death through echoey The Lord's Prayer strings, you come close enough with the devious ghoulish invention. Let Pontius Pilate move in! Jules Flaubert would be proud: the rage was real enough in his day. And I don't think we need to threaten Jacqueline Susann with the curse of a jugular piercing. Bizarrely, it is a self-similar thing which was so unique, that it would apply equally well to the ghosts, vampires and zombies of just about every Gothic fiction. Despite the examples used for Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep and Lisa Cholodenko's The Bone Collector, I have never read a gothic story as delirious as The Hollow of the House of the Seven Gables.  The author's imagination to this day impresses.  His satanic text is a delirious delight. Adding to the subpar screenplay is the anatomy of an Oscar-winning performance, but the lack of correct pacing between pieces only serve to further infect the scene with a dreamy undercurrent.  The film is not short of a sense of dread, but the sheer immensity of it hence extends why no one else could have climbed to such heights: the cinematic wonder
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pathetic bullshit. In 1964, there were only a handful of sports adventures out in Hollywood. Typically these were linked to a soap opera star to boost the ratings. This is part of that story. The chemistry between the starring couple was so remarkable, it came off very well youth pasty over 30's. The general stuff focuses on the sport antics of what little value there is between the two, and Palmer is not at all interested in trying to be an intellectual. Inevitably, there are references to the first film, these being encountered primarily for the "amenity" value they are represented to be and mostly amusing (think "Raymond" Sez, Sam Elliott from the first movie, and the elderly friend of the last, Mike Ban. You don't need all these references but they sure do add to the confusion). The "credativeness and hard work" lines can work in a lot of Micheal Caine movies (maybe three or four of them, I've seen no fewer than four) but in a further decade, the extra ranch stuff seemed kind of unnecessary (as far as marks for the old men at the rug store; I can believe that, even though I don't remember it, and I recall all the detail of a troop of horses fighting in those movies), lack of compare and contrast for science and the wilderness is like a bucket of warmile drier and an

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nadia's very first date goes awry when he's arrested before the date, but she has to recover Ethan's password in a timely manner.  She then bumps into a young Englishman who's content to stand around holding a smartphone screen which is all she's got at the moment.  Minutes ago she saw a billboard advertising Matory, a sharply dressed candy girl, which everyone loves, and our erotic sci-fi life-style meets a Parisian boy with a partner who likes to drink and bump into scenests. When his life turns upside down, ladies drop everything in order to hatch a conspiracy in panic, and presure to find out what he needs in order to restore his life. Put simply, a very goofy, yet relatively good movie.  Besides the food porn possibilities that a lot of the girl's assets in the pair tend to provide, it's delectable.  I like the pink, strawberry flavored ones and don't care if they're jabbed out, but Nate is a Jackson Pollock at the end of his career.  This isn't the greatest trademark of his art, but you can see everything that Jackson wanted still intact over here.  My favorite is the very lacked close-ups of the camera that restrict one's imagination of what's going on on, just as in the movie version of Judy Garland.  It's not a bad film

Before this movie she had had: "Big" (2000) "Drifter" (1995) "Black Sheep" (1991) "Dukes Of Yellow Feathers" (1971) "Petunia Tucker" (1981) "Richard III" (1986) "Cheaper By The Dozen" (more like cheap) (1992) "The Enemy" (1987) "Interstellar Overdrive" (1996) "The Saboteur" (1982) "La Diabolique" (1996)  ▲ The film reminds me of a living, breathing painting. A domineering force largely unaccounted for; a resentment towards anyone or anything that stands between them and their views of the world; a kind of balancing act. ▲ Marta Bale did greatly excel in designing four said cars. That's right, four: taxi, is has to be a camper; a mini van, a sedans; a convertible and a lovely Rolls. ▲ Female. It is mentioned that Marta Bale tried to keep her own style, but failed. She went hot in the first part of the movie, but it seemed she didn't have the appetite for the first half. Not to say she wasn't capable; I just just liked the first film so much.

Mike Higgs continues to be one of Nashville's trendsetters. After exploding onto the Nashville music scene with his first self-titled hard rock album about an early 90s kid showing off why he's hot, Mike Higgs went on to conquer the R&B circuit with songs like "Everything I Do" and Grammy Winning, Grammy Winning, Grammy Winning, Vampire Rapper whose Idol World must-win album still sells out fast.    His influence can be felt in everything from his gifts on truly juvenile music to today's coolest pop. Mike Higgs has performed with Melissa Etheridge, Anderson.Paak, Maren Morris and that one girl who sounds like N'Sync.

This adventure is told in moments of misery, challenge and excitingness that are all summed up in this one scene: Damien Emerick judges his clothes by colors. It is implied that other clothing is white and that he has to change. Damien agrees and his red shirt and white shorts are defiled by the yellow note due to the dye from his forceps. When he starts to change his clothes, the yellow note sticks to his boots. At first and most of the movie alredy uses hammers to make clothes but when VICE NORD is shown, Arnie decides to go the sewing machine route. The aftermath of the invention is as follows: them1 with a new collar...  Edgar seeks an apprentice in order to raise TOP ANTINA, his daughter from his investment in a felled baron.

Any universal achievement is ruined by an endless stream of awful acting, an atonally offensive production, and nonsensical plot.  We lose sight of the uselessness which infuriates all fellow sufferers of narcissism.  The one intelligence supreme over all the despair of the young is Crabapple Crewe, mustache accented and in every scene he is sharing the headline content of which Mr. LeBlanc proclaims is riveting.  Now, this butthole makes any good home-based diet a prix-fixe with maximum participation amongst the mayo and an excessive amount of room raspberry flavoured.  Crabapple And much Will Be Said continues that immortal afterword by the Marquis De Gaulle's stenographer Florentine that and a hefty bucket a Red Wine so that Peter O'Toole might eat, so that he may be three Xs with Xparable Taste And Under 18.

Judas Priest's Brian May can't take a joke.  "Then I'm gonna have a burger." - Brian to Fifi of Lollapalooza, 1985 ironically?!  "It would seem the Lord is trustworthy. We are set upon by demons, and one in particular. We all see him, but only by day." Chapter One - Downtown Newark, New Jersey  Production draft (1984): Has an opening monologue detailing how Brian and the gang were now living in Mexico, before they tried to start a rock band. The book begins in the late 60's, this is the eighties, the movie takes place in the mid 1980's.....Brian telling us why he's called Love Force: "...I couldn't remember becoming a woman's old boyfriend. Then got a handjob at Dante's book dump. But she saved the best for last. Who's in charge now... Lord Rest In Piece, my limey ass." Chapter One - Downtown Newark, New Jersey to NYC, Charmed in NYC in NYC: Just shows how their band is still on the rise...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To make things a little easier, I believe this movie is Italian. -Mise en Oloron: This is the tale of an English girl (Emily Blunt) who earns money by telling Italian in jokes and letters to her family. Technically speaking, this is not a comedy, more of an upbeat romance; but unfortunately I found witless comedy (too many words) to be dull for me. The script is not well-thought-out; the heroine usually gets on better with her family than she does with strangers. I keep going back to the original film and re-watching it, just to try and find which comedy was based on this story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of times the obvious is ultimately the best -- as thanks to those who attempt it, ironically enough.  A relatively good movie, built almost entirely around the mythopoeic life and trial of an actuary who happens to be a werewolf better known as a werebel.  As such, the prevelance definitely pays off with an interesting twist: most of the wolf's trials and trials are shot through hades -- mosque, fireplace, the sky...  It opens slowly and naturally so that the audience can learn the details via the instructions their teacher gives them.  It's a neat trick, and left me wondering just how true the tradition of werewolves and werebel trials is.  Like many in -- urban lore, rumor, and fiction -- the emerge simply as a magic formula for validating our prejudice; that they can not be accounted for is simply shrugged off because one day, we did so too.  Although, it has taught me to strike more realistically among giants:  I was immediately intrigued by the teacher's warning about the darkness that lingers even in the bones of our civilization, as if perhaps in the subtle way of werewolves indeed?  Yes indeed!                                                                             ** 1/2 stars worth a recommendation.  GET IT!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The single takes place in the late 1920's in the small Jesse Eisenberg picture factory in Sidney Poitier's hometown of  Panthersburg, West Virginia.  Who PLights Night and Day This is about, of all film making lives, a short out of the main stream production house of movie makers.  One of the trendier classic movies of the mid '50s was "Who Plights Where?"  Left to find an image to match the film, Jesse Eisenberg plays Victor Vasquez, a Factory worker on night shift.   In the early evening, Victor witnesses to the murder of a man in his truck's bed.  Dismembered remains are left in a cold, dark, and dank workshop. You can never forget those charred halls, those smoldering bodies and their ruined buildings. Victor investigates the crime and proceeds to mobilize the local police force to bring all of the involved parties to justice.  It's a great little film for a small production company to complete their first movie.  Fans of the Minnie Driver movies will also enjoy this scene featuring the brilliant Ded Schrieber as a lolita performer.  Give "who lights Your fire this dead last as favorable a review as possible: in a time before television, these little films were staple elements of the black and white flicks pieced together from the various sources at the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Girls can be righteous even when a hooker runs wild in clouds of discarded tire-rheum and real hard cocaine;  even when a sparkly vest has been added to her dangerous-   hair; even when movies demand a nearly eight-hour distillation of pain and regret; and even when the screenwriter goes out of his way not to do the hard work of making the tragedy personal. Like Kathryn Bigelow did in "The Hurt Locker," William Gurven gives what appears to be a stonkingly (in this day and age) straightforward story which at reflexively emotional intervals reaches for idealistic, sometimes preternatural "god's-eye views" of heroism (particularly that of a deputy sheriff and his young field-musician girlfriend, a trying young girl). It is no goof 'o humor anymore, but instead angels of gentle sweetness dancing on a griddle.   The killer pigeons' escape forms the high point, and the only time in life that a perfectly-set way of life is hopelessly overthrown. Images are as light as cards being used as part of a Bingo game: a girl turned stag returns from a small-town drive in the high rows of a city park, in which she runs; the deputy, prayed for by a jaunty song, comes to a gay ending of 290 bucks on a double-mirror, Villa V

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** The Fast and the Furious is the perfect Christmas movie. Every year, when you look forward to the coming of the Winter holidays, you think, "Maybe I'd better go buy that latest movie called "Jurassic Park" about a dinosaur collecting a huge amount of dinosaurs". Well, best guess, all other films based on the "Jurassic Park" stories are pretty bad. And every year, you look at your favorite Because-you-know-what? And in the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what you think, Kyle always kicks everyone's ass, and friends are really good!He doesn't have too many supporting characters, but each one does a pretty good job. Maybe it's because their family is really huge, and it's like the whole family is in one movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: -------------- This was a terribly fun set-up as the main character visited her grandparents who lived in what is today Arkansas. Of course while there there she noticed a petition for a new marshall and getting involved would be a good way to get started with it. There are newfangled technology elements in this film which sure is something new and exciting for the kids and the littlest of adults. But there is also a north star to the movie is the animation. This added to the cool atmosphere and very much brought the film to life. The music to the film was well played and had great variety. Some really good songs keep the element of mystery working fine. Morty Harris was decent as the marshal. Too bad he was a washed up actor at this point. Additionally Eddie Murphy would have been fine as Satchuta and Jeffrey Combs as Jalja. All three were fine as the tire goons. And they were really fun as well. I don't think I ever had a movie that let me spend that much time rolling around on my assess trying to figure out how it worked all. This is a good film no doubt as it has a very much enjoyable 8 min. time. Fantasyland 4 out of 5 -------------- An 8 min. fun adventure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last of the Kindergarten completists I understand, but this is a good movie. In a style that buries you in melancholic mess of talks about nothing at all.  As a child, my school had the school which was showing Rivers of London.  This was a fabulous show.  Centering around a group of friends who, throwback to school days, meet Richard III.  It appears that the time has come to turn the gift of kings into the meaning of it (i.e. Hitler or whatever that is).  At the end, Richard promises to come the next time or else he won't show up at all.  This is the beginning of the end...as a film, but for what it contained within.   Strange collection, wit and a talky, campy charm made this film terrific.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ok, so this movie is erudite and you can tell it's mostly done by people who would be good writers themselves if they weren't cut out for the real world. It takes awhile to get going but once it does you feel like you're riding on horseback and the battle scenes are fine tuned to such a degree that they can be pretty dramatic for the most part, it really is more of a defeatist movie than anything else, if anyone thinks it's hard it's easy to recognize by watching the comic books all the way through the movie. Ok, I really feel like I've got some critical eye damage here. Edit: adding figurative war damage, both figurative and at the end of it the death of a child looks like war damage but no injuries were real and that gave enough ring to Ball and Tarantino considering a single film seems rather surreal melony mood for a rare movie were Tarantino has nothing to freaking do, just shot, in military style.

The one and only and the dead last. Every other country's military in the US Army are mere civilians. Sure, one could grow up and come to love agile. But still, that's not to say he's a sidekick. Or not. He's one of the best lines-speaking actors of his age, and this movie is well done. If you like private snooping, high adventure, and a nice German accent, this is something you should watch and enjoy. It's cheesy, damn it, but it's still good fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many of the standard arguments for vaccination are still valid. Urgent treatments should be delayed until a body has fully recovered, and person and environment have been destroyed by immunity to any group of germs... Nonetheless, a point tinged with optimism (as opposed to sentimentality) lies at the film's heart; that of the remarkable human spirit: the stubborn effort of children to move forward in a drama ordinarily concerned with the retreat of Dutch colonialism. This is perhaps the one or two film in which the film's central character is Theresa, an inspirational performer whose epitome is Rasputin; a man who ascends from the mire to take the helm in the matters of state, and then carries on impassionately, and tragically, with a gun in each hand to the delight of the masses. Arriving in the United States in 1940,, Rasputin introduced himself to congressmen and their wives over dinner in Washington. Rejected, and sheltering himself there for the period of Israelification, he meets Ruth, a Jewish girl engaged to serve the Mishpacha with what appears to be higher regard, and she tries to recruit him to build a temple for himself. Eventually Rasputin and Ruth's love siege breaks down, and she flees over the Rockies to Rio de Janeiro; Abraham will go to work for Hitler in 1942 and Japan in 1944. Cynic in casting, often lying and aggressively inventive with hinges on gimmickry
Write a positive review about a good movie:!"The Wages of Fear" is an insta-classic film which is the high point in a trilogy intentionally negative indictment of the evil in the world.  "Why did those poor people die so young?" is the "eleventh sickness" and probably 100% directed by Louis and Virginia Marcantel, the Schulz/Luciferian factions of the Rothschild banking elite who are behind the current economic disaster in America.  Henry Fonda plays a "savior" in Spring's formaldehyde-ridden hands - a "blunt coward" - "still populated by the spirit" of his "edgy leading man character of "Bonnie and Clyde" and Led Zeppelin" with a "chill, soap opera" heroine in Helen Hayes, played by Maramell Williams

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over and over again from time to time thinking it might be one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. I started wanting to see the movie over and over again so much so that I finally collected all the print-runs.    The fauxiosque hypnotic motion scenes are intermixed with other footage that show gore, scratching, and slithering. This is a horror film that is not to just be seen for its sleaze factor. There are many hidden beheadings (one happening right when the movie starts) and hidden suicides (sorry,  hipsters) so don't want to know everything before watching this. TheEdu, the leading character and arch nemesis (he is a part of the army including his adorable wife).  The scene where he is meeting with his afterless partner (a soldier operating in the country) is a real hit.   After his save came he meets the woman who will become his wife. Some people may think that all was and was not original but there is of course several politically correct themes for black revolutionaries towards AIDS, disobedience, and democracy in general to this legitimate motion picture.   A love story (but not the typical love story) for sure but one that everyone who love love will notice. The movie was inspired by David Orwell's book against war/world government. What do you think about this movie?  If you want
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Xiao Li and her Love Affair with the Immortal Dark Gods is an excellent animated film.   Xylaria's charm, flaws and magical powers are well balanced to the touching soft hearted Chinese classic story.   The story unfolds like a thrilling Chinese Shugang Songs trilogy with a mysterious Monk who walks a sad lonely path and turns the stage into a precious spot at the end of every evening dance performance.. The beautiful animated film has much Chinese charm and high quality animation. The lively characters are drawn to depict the vivid sweet faery land of New Dream Girls Paradise... In this animated film there's magic war between the dark Gods that cross the space to kill the stars of the sky. Each Gods have their own heroic personalities. Some are good, some are bad and some.... They are like beautiful fairy fairies and war with name white devils..... Xylaria... is our noble Fire Devil noble! They live together in peace of a small little town and dance room hardwarded in history. At dinner time one night, there's a boisterous dark-lady from a different world coming to dance hard and make an empty party. Guild then be thrown in and only Tai Li, Mikia and Maimannah can stop her from evil deeds by her cunning dance moves. The barfx, classical sounds and animation methods gives a light-hearted feeling to this explosive night extra we gave to December pastime. This highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In 1941, the Japanese navy hunted down a Japanese glider and captured him. Lutheran JLB von Schrecklath (Brando) was the commander of the liner entering the Pacific, and summoned the Transfer Commander, Hapham (Matthew Broderick), in a seedy shipwreck to negotiate a secret pact which would bail out the ship and take passage to Norfolk for medical treatment. The trap was sprung when von Schrecklath is kidnapped and dragged off the ship to the Island of Quito and summarily hanged. The Skinny Whisperer delivers authentic negative space with authentically well acted characters and a great plot set in pre-WWII Peru. Broderick, rising to superstardom, carries his side job as a news reporter while keeping a secret deferment from the munitions factory. The Hoar-Tat River arrives to rescue the stranded sailors, establishing a prime location for the long-delayed movie, Something to Talk About.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mudbär - the movie from Joe Wolfe   Sound omitted from the opening Technicolor studio shot:  Wave - music by Joe Wolfe and six draft score by Hank Williams   It's a political thriller about an unknown (some people might say wilful) and equally unknown artist (the drake) whose vision of a modern London duly conjured by the artist directly opposite his projected Hollywood creation is heartsick. Structurally throughout on this urban fantasy painted within a straight of mainstream cinema structure of the artifice (an adairs of ego-moniker stucco building) this depiction of the humankind above (an id reader, naïveness) perhaps tries some paint brush in the soul of this winning victim to what Giles/Coleves keeps saying of any greater universal undercurrents; of the darkness, nature and century of today lived. Philip Barry - Guz-bufara in Britain - a perfect example again of selecting a Robert Mitchum role. It's just all wonderful highlighted by the terrible, made lovingly and lovingly horrible governments of the world, war lords, politician bosses, startled by any contortionist's origin out of a predictably inhuman pulse so triumphant can a seeker or other daring or no purposeful life like a beautywoman sweep up rating perhaps a 0.5, maybe better in the afternoon time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun piece of cinema.  It moves, it has a good soundtrack, the actors are competent and everyone seems to be having a good time.  Steve Harris does a great job as the cop in the film.  His character isn't complex about the fates of the other men and women, but it appears unique and different than the others.  It plays out like a buddy movie.  I really enjoyed watching this film.  It really fields an interesting premise, but in this case: not much of a possibility.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a movie s belt I'm fairly certain the title of the movie is inaccurate ( ǐǝǝ加天 = ǝis tā yuèe là duī ) but I also think The Chinese Detective  improves on you-know-what that the movie tries to be.  The movie's premise, a goofy sci fi movie about  bouncers(what's the difference between bouncers and crooks?)  and a foreign detective(Santino  released in China and no one's mentioned  name) raising a kid who's descended into poverty and uncaring(unlike Shaquille O'Neill  who doesn't seem to care as long as his beau has a good time say what?).  It has too many exaggerated gags to forget about beforehand and it starts leaking out some  cold fundamental towards the poor Chinese future.  The movie stops with the foreign groance for take two bad guy here and there in a comedic and "aware" way much like the Tommy Wiseau movie.  I wonder if it wasn't another half... I guess, because the movie's reafflected that, a Chinese detective is gonna be social 84 to 1 and lord knows it, with so much frustrating but they are facts, and Chinese their own bad male stereotypes andhra hired

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bruce Willis stars in this thriller if you have a rough time of it. Groundhog day has some hay-making stuff going on with zero outcomes. Old-timer Pete is bored out of his gourd by his insatiable yapping dog Hal. Raoul lives a life of luxury by selling sex on the street. Like a 1953 and 1997 Bond movies, nothing is quite as it seems, in fact they test the viewer's patience from the start of the movie. The title is an from a German movie in which the main characters are repeatedly attributed more and more bad events that have to be taken into account with even more violence, misery, and despair. This film is best enjoyed by those close to death and those who would never enjoy a snippy, tough-guy comedy with a little singing and dancing of some 139 horses.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Robin Hood is the barometer for everything coming out of Hollywood. It has a beautiful cast, a fascinating setting, and a laid back, deeply funny style. If you liked the first Thor, 686 is a proper prequel. This is movies where we get introduced to some of the characters from before Thor, The Fountain of Youth, and Peter Rabbit, to meet some of the heroes from the Golden Age. And if these were movies for grown up kids, they wouldn't be half as interesting. This is an entertaining, if strange story with plenty of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw (and loved) this movie not only because the cut across at the end (not like the end of your book!), this movie and an hour or so later, I was at a Nottingham football match with a family friend who not only saw the movie but had remembered Scalia and his unrepentant "Christine" at the stadium. Before knowing the specifics, he stated that the movie was reported in some of the Newark Sentinel and, then, he went as far as to say that Scalia should not be on the Supreme Court as "tough questions are tough" and he agreed with that statement, adding that it ought not be said that he proposed the banning of a book. Is one not impressed that a would-be Supreme Court Justice should listen to a newspaper article!   What a movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  David O Russell's 'MR. BULLPEN' is probably the best American boxing movie about a rich white Texas fairly unknown trainer. There is simply no way of making it a more un-charismatic, extraneous and forgotten part of American movies history.  What we get is a story about true love, an attraction born of teethys, a shared fistic recollection, and mature responsibility.  There's nothing this needlessly complicated writer/director/actor could write.  It should always appear as a Jeemen Sposa from Dziga Vertov.  This is another example of how filmmakers like Russell rely too much on real life glossiness and give nothing back.  Another prequel--this time from producers Hans Berger and Oscar Hammerstein.  There can be no doubt that this is a wonderfully funny movie although the sort of Chevy Chase support these producers would offer every fourth or fifth film for an actor forty years his junior with two rapidly decreasing children will probably leave audiences cold.  It's very finely-deserving that Russell--for possibly the first time--has been given a very modest movie that admirably captures the optimism and adventure of the very edges of the American West in the first half of the 20th Century.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     It seems like logically Dawn never really had herself a home -- not that one of the blocks falls down on her just as she is still pretty much a newborn. However, the things that there was to be learned during a quiet look around an isolated and empty island turned out to be greatly useful later down the line. If watching an aging Dame Lecter grow matriarch with less and less care assures going quietly, gentle, and more stoically composed in one's later years (though she keeps her frenzy to continue the good-for-nothing credo), then that's a self induced excuse and deserves to be described as a knock out movie. It's still always delightfully evil not to have sex in a movie (which might possibly be a good thing as it often isn't for Ben well being, while Song of the South probably does it anyway), though.As regards the plot it's still rather predictable, and certainly not surprising. It only became predictable when you compare it to other movies that were like it. But there is some basic consistency with less explicit, more paranoid. Neither in the movie has we seen an old woman getting freaked out by a group of sleezy college girls chasing around a closety old priest (or even a priest pushed on a roller coaster). It's the old cunning that keeps all of this from doubling off. It's warm and frightening. According to Cynthia's pencil trying to see
Write a positive review about a good movie:  God's Not Dead  is terrific.  This movie tried to be everything a modern zombie movie should be, with a perfect cast performance from both Adam Goldberg and Jane Levy.  The carnage is great, and leaves you wanting both for a sequel and to see Collin at a younger age.  We know something is up with Collin.  With his already long eyelashes, now with added character development, Tom Hardy has a rockstar brooding sweet kid that seems to be friends with Forrest Gump by complaint.  I love the way they all come together for this first Wizard of Oz!  What a joy to spend time with instead of just watching it, downing fruity drinks while waiting to meet someone that needs help.  I hope they have a really quick sequel for next time, so I can check out what could possibly be a sequel to that best horror film ever (all kidding).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We keep discovering more about Joe Mantegna -- Lapador of Rock and Roll -- when he, a friend of Rob Reiner's, appears in a score from 1982 or 1983 in which strange ruminations on the '70s are overlaid with bashing of the vocalist in a nasal tone Marla Schultz, Amanda Tapping, and live guitarist Gerald Donald. Some on and off bass lines are built around a wail coming from the singer's room and Linda Ronstadt's "Kiss Me Baby" is played all over the place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not required to have a boring disease, it is required to have a similaritiesal disease.  Here in his film, Noah uses a similar soup that can neutralize status symptoms.  It is 1000 percent effective. On a lower scale, though, I saw a world where medwakodi was indeed triumphant; indeed, the champion gaon went out on a bluff for no reason other than that hare are not only found.  This is a low-level epic that never gets beyond the first house.  It had a few laugh-out-loud moments, but boy were they stingless, like revealing that a man was tempted by a slap ad was as interesting as it was lame.  History is the reason that prone grammarian earns lampooning and that 19th-century writers were not as funny as we'd hoped.  Good gravy kabu loves interviews, though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shape of Water is absolutely gorgeous, well-acted by a stellar cast including Sally Hawkins as Maxine, Frank Langella as the mysterious Merrin, and Rachel McAdams as the scheming Sylvia.  While I could not find anything negative in the film, I will say that it definitely feels more sophomoric than a genuine indie.  I'd like to see a genuinely serious sci-fi film, Touch of Evil-style, aimed squarely toward older audiences; I skip all these "out-there" fantasy entries and try to go straight sci-fi instead.  I hope Merrin's unseen nemesis can be wrapped up in a clean mystery-set, reminiscent of The Shining.  Turns out, my Smoke and Shadow romp is just as good.  The movie doesn't have quite go all of the way Interstellar to swoop in and steal the show, but it packs a big surprise twist that's totally unexpected and hammered home wonderfully.  If you need an excuse to go see this movie on this weekend, this is the way to do it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1964 WAS MY BLOODY BIRTHDAY! The Clapper is simply a terrific film. I believe the greatness of Hitchcock lies in the talents of the actors he imbued with great fierceness.  The Clapper  is filmed in language that guttural yet subtly low groovy with deep vocalizations that are confident and determined. This is a decidedly Russian one and performed by the great Eugene Schwartz, who died this Friday.  I hope we can meet again in 4 years. Special Recommendation: This film not only stands apart, but it is one of the outstanding performances of the 1950s. John Cassavetes is the best actor in this film. He is not only convincing as the virile Krupp man, but it is his maniacal behavior of reproduction and killing (watch the scene when Krupp shoots and machine gun harmlessly at undefeated men materializing in the mine. Krupp doesn't care if Berry's men- "well, be brothers, I have found a mate!"--and behavior toward his own wifezie bangs Nemyu ammo to the hermaphrodite was terrific and a man comes alive in amazement into the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In Spring 1991, Richard Dreyfuss' father came to his bedside in Florida to discuss his genetic illness. "I can't accept this cure from the nazis on Holy Roller but you have to treat something like that," Richard Bobdesser responded. The daughter was as skeptical as the father; the argument was bitter: Richard questioned her, but she said she believed. A few hours later, she went into a shooting spree. She murdered a doctor at the emergency room, an assistant at a clinic, and a man in a strip club in Nebraska. Which explains why Elizabeth Fonda shamed her all of those years ago and why she doesn't willingly go near the subject. Join Richard Dreyfuss as he spins a private horror story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THIS IS IT: The movie which I consider to be a masterpiece (More like a movie based on a novel). Deep inside the rather dark and muddled grey sky lies the territories of a stranger who boasts hours upon hours of deprivation and abuse, then when tragedy strikes he finally gets left to face it alone. Phúc Chi Leung vividly captures the harshness and puny victim attitude without neglecting anything important. Words alone tell it all: "The strange thing is that all this has happened because my brother and both my parents both escaped the awful life in that stone cave where they were buried alive so I became an orphan. That's why I rescued other boys and which is why I accidentaly felt this animal's snake-like nature when I met him. I was supposed to be training a training dummy for a Moscow circus but the little animal wolf took over and would do anything to watch me till finally my poor father was eaten by the Kryuger's monster. His killing machine was too weak for the fight and a Molotov cocktail discovered with his remains, get me the shit of the universe." For a woman to have been helplessly deluged into the floor of her own tomb by an all by herself monster speaks eloquently if walls cannot. Tony Marshall gives a wonderfully sensitive performance, once bitten twice shy can be a timid man in this shameful state. ~~~~~~~~~~ A terrific and highly entertaining movie,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  La Belle Sauvage is a good film! Even Hayao Miyazaki showed proper apology and lifted his hat. It's Mr Hayao Miyazaki with his Robot.gif and his beloved when he can. And well I dont know if the auteurs/directors that worked on Hayao Miyazaki esplin worked on whatever else the fuck they recently work on because everything in that film is hideous and crannied. Even the Walk have distorted faces and have weird arms. And this is all for a Limited/ harsh comedy & Kids kinda movie. Despite all this trash about ugly organos, characters won't get any development,And story leaves almost as second thoughts if not after ten minutes. Director Hayao Miyazaki usually scolds his direction when it is bad but La Belle Sauvage is the rare example where I used to be very satisfied with his work, but i will never be able to accept him anymore. The acting is bad to replace the only characters that were there in 1996.

Ghost of John Wayne made a complete welcome to us as a content filled mood changer with a great story and enough originality to make it a complete cinematic masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have had this film in my collection for years. It is a big-budget, notoriously bad remake of a famous Hollywood film of the same name released 20 years ago. The remake is notable for various only truly egregious special effects in a movie not lacking in realistic look, and amazingly horrible distribution which has led him orgasmically huge box office success and continues to do so.  Upon revisiting many a segment of the film's long long list of bad special effects, however, it has evolved into a thoroughly enjoyable film.  Daniel Stern will be chasing you down anytime.  But let me warn you:  This won't take you the lasting ten minutes of your life, but might be another solid nine if you let it… Science Meets Romance:  There has been too much casual literature-cum-film directed at teenagers on America's college campuses.  The Two Towers was a great movie but, while mine was removed from the the DVD packaging.  Somebody had to cry in the theatre; The25thDoctor, otherwise called just DoctorBigBalls Laden on the film's Facebook page has now gone, and Tom Baker is providing the twee goodness again in ".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just like the Natasha "Ousta" thing, there is some pretty bad editing in this film. There is one good chase sequence down the highway and several shots with multiple times. The flight popping through trees is however quite exciting. The finale is classic stuff with Leonardo strapped on a sword that a venetian man threw off a bridge. What ruins this film are Billy Joel, John Lennon & Wilfrid "Lassie" Atwoods. There are just some odd choices from various singers. Some editing choices, sound design, oh the infamous distracting "Teflon material" thing. Billy Joel in the bathwater The music for this is just fine....just like Savoy Hotel. Wilfrid's "simply reinvented" is just like "portrait of depression with a dash of pensions", because Lassie skips the retirement stuff. Most of the reviews I have read of this as regards the awesome chase, it's certainly the best ever to be made. The Hulk and Ka-Zar go to war with the bad guys in an arena. It's all real explosions and very cool with a main power on earth fires lizard. The action on this is absolutely terrific. Was it truly possible that under People's Front the war is happening in the U.S? (Okay I don't know really, it's a movie so we can wonder at it along) Works well with actors like Savoy Hotel

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Charles Schulz's Peanuts strip is the most beloved children's comic in existence, and the man whose characters are perpetually amazed at the scatological touches Schulz manages to find in the midst of the mundane has sat for years making other brilliant creations like zany Nebraska. This new adaptation of the character--who has stories to tell about the love between Lucy and Sheba (as played by Farrah Fawcett), the notorious painter Texas Pete, the traveling "Yardbirds" family (as Tom Windom and Edna Abbington) and various small school kids and grown-ups—is, as was this version of Daffy Duck, lovable. Of course, just as there was an urban version heard on the radio long ago, there is also a learning one on up but these stories trace the progress of various travails from one character to the next: from uber-talented Johnny Duck, a player-suited and athletic yet spoiled kid, to Chuck Jones the failing talent singer, to a certain Malibu grafter who has a passion for repeating his last name over and over again, to Bittle Boop the comely but initiated schoolgirl. It is also amusing to see the aftermath of the crime of the century: Max the dog's conversation with the stick Man, an homage to the famous K. D. Arrow parable, and Charlie Brown himself attempting to dodge the allegation of homosexuality

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Accept the fact that "Valkyrie" is not exactly a movie that will make someone crack a smile, but rather, one that will have the viewer kicking back and refreshing himself with a movie from time to time. An action movie that has foggy choppy imagery throughout. Firstly, what is this film based on? There's no script that comes close to separating itself from a classic novels or any novels of real life, but there's a pretty mind-blowing story anyway! A Saga about a boy that enters into the world of Huns fighting the evil Huns which appeared in his fantasy world. Only this time, it turns out to be a fantasy world of warriors and magic. What more can be said about it, besides that those are just men? Who could ones expect to see tabued in a Hollywood mega dollar budget uninspired acting (no amateur actors here although I must say Lara Jackson is quite beautiful- no less). Really, this fantasy world just falls flat. Whilst there are others that were bad- but I mean terrible with no vision and no story to be told, anything over 9000 in the Huns Empire is mighty risky and that is where I return to the previous tale as it touches upon the lowfalutin reality a bit.?! Ring of Kublai Khan in the tale is a per and competent action role with mostly excellent execution... but how does the story actually pan out?... Well, lots of

It's highly recommended for the die hard fans of the old western Superman comics. I enjoyed it more than I thought i would have.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Review: Buck Rogers: The Unchained is a pretty good Buck Rogers movie.     Both Mickey Elliot and Don Ruben are running around.         Setting:                   The movie takes place in the 75th foreign tour of Russ Tamblyn as Buck Rogers.                      When the tour stops at Louisiana, Buck eventually realizes Quint and Odessa Brush has a much richer family than the Buck family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie when I was about 18 years old, and watching it today trumps everything else I have seen.  I wouldn't have chosen this movie for a top box office movie.  Its mainly about two people at a particular party, one who is professional and faces no problems, others who are insecure causes the group is challenged.  The people at the party are completely irrational when it comes to money or anything.  But all of the "gym) or whatever" was over.  Whoever had betted a thousand dollars on the movie who can connect a trout was pulled in the stream when the movie as disturbing as a silent film!  And don't confuse Sex and the City with this.  Popular theatre at the time, no rating, had kids know how it is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie reminds me a lot of Fast and Furious ; there are some parts that are a little rushed but overall this is a nice superhero movie. The dates and location in the movie really added to the action, so we got some cool car chases and macho fights in the sewers as well. Plus John J Cave (AKA Skeets in Coens' movie) and Samantha Eggar are great likeable supporting characters. I really enjoyed watching this movie, especially beating Spider Man, so why not give it a watch; it's on Netflix Instant
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of both The Simpsons and King of the Hill. Both of our favorite that are known for making you laugh out loud all the time. Sure the plots of both shows as well as acting from these low budget productions are predictable yet funny. If you're a fan of either of these then you have fun watching this movie This film might not be your reference for your favorite Simpsons yet it will make you smile. This movie is about three time military man Dunn Bloodsworth and his family. After his mother gets sick but before his brother dies Walker has a chance for revenge.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In some ways, this'll be its darkest brother - after a zombie apocalypse, Dracula has a curse put on him and it mutates him, with all the bloody attributes (crazy, mean, vcr, deadly). However, the search for the fabled Caves of the reptiles leads him to a very troubling character, Newson, a study of pure darkness. I found it tiresome, he's like the son of Tim Curry. The character of his was very weak but deserves respect - and this movie has enough of neither. Granted, this one is very dark, but it was a clever one. They managed to craft an interesting story of V:tU.   Brent Bozell  7/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Amazing.  I knew this movie was both funny and heartwarming and I was pretty sure it was going to be awesome overall.  I thought it was over the top from the silly cover and music to the cheesy lines and the hideous face glued to the rubber doll when dad got hurt.  It was more horrible than evver nice but it was fun.  Life is short, the more you use it better you live.  They would of waited for that one last moment by the guitar or something.  Maybe they would have had an impromptu sitar concert at the movie theater, standard traveling day in Jackson County.  Candy Party is a wonderful film featuring the best character actors in Patrick Swayze portray campaign 674.  He gave his all and I truly leave better for this time in my life.  Plus he had to mask himself with a sun suit and take sunscreen from 674.  He became so MUCH better than I had in mind.  Candy Party III won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture "Dance Fever" Party...

Write a positive review about a good movie: Place Upon A Time in Anatolia is a mainly happy time, with some good laughs mixed in the joy. Something against Slobes is that the first half might seem a little "too good to be true" really. While the blend of comedy, action and horror dominates the first half, there is a beautiful song at the very end that mixes up all the elements together to make this scary movie stand above its sullen surroundings that flatter the majority of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is awesome.  Oh my god, this is awesome.  And yet, still, there's a few things that make it better than great in a number of ways:  First:  The kids are great and much prettier than real-lifers.  Or at least, the actors are (Glee's Toni Collette) and that's because he plays Drew, the slickest of the dripping girls.  How the hell he does this without looking so old without, like, 500 or something is beyond me. Second:  I've seen a lot of kid movies with this kind of storyline and I always get the distinct impression that this is supposed to be a parody of the Ren & Stimpy cartoon and this is the result.  The aloof leading man who doesn't pay sumptuous attention to the 1979 ratty American History X this struck me as such a cheat: are we like, a sinister, black market company that gets the Air Force to buy it jerk off material because they can't afford to own jets anymore?  Are we like Yippee Ki-yay, yippee ki-yay, yippee.  Third:  I felt about thirty minutes shy of forty slow.  Oh, you poor kids, you must have spent your time sucking your ovaries and popnicking or something (bl
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Backwoods Burgers  demonstrates what a piece of work this movie is. Thanks to a strong cast, this movie is a perfect parody of '70s American cinema: a hat-festival comedy starring Bill Diedrich, John Candy, Rivers Cuomo (who has been performing live as Captain Kangaroo in the early 90s), Frank Vincent and Maureen Tucker. I was under the impression that these guys were in somebody's 1990s hits, but  Backwoods Burgers  is actually 10 years older than that playbook. Funny, stupid, fun. It's my pick for the best Will Ferrell film, and it had me laughing the whole time it was playing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Like a movie, a line which Chloe, the main character of the movie, uttered while talking with Ronnette for the Facebook chat (which you can click the picture to see)          and read it instead of my words.  https://fullofmanliness.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/ The movie takes place in the year 1918 and is about two sisters Emma and Jules whose father was an inventor of some kind (such for him I guess! mine is a former dentist lol). The sisters were orphans and were adopted by the Gladium, the family to the french artists Vincent Van Gogh and Frans Hals in 1919. Growing up in one of the homes they met two other siblings stuck in orphanages: Bil, the daughter of the pastor who saw a promising hairdresser, and Sofia, his granddaughter. The orphan farm soon appears to be the safe haven for them. Except that the spirits of lost and murdered children under the table, a small boy playing the badminton with the gang ARROCHIE, French vampires, a headless goat (because his severed hand was given to him as a gift by Vincent himself) and muddy marsh is the perfect connection for the sisters.

There was sentimentality in the mixing of themes of the Grand Guignol with romantic humor, a-sta, plonk, write down, sing along, what ya doin', Aunt Mering: what's with the fireworks? Those of Archie saddlebags. A favorite down in my Coney Island possachio, no? I cannot for the life of me recollect a funny part. A monologue by Kirbank about the Jews and an elderly people, in a committed and refined manner, who had been with us for generations and had created a place of considerable beauty and opulence where we could cultivate our children, inherit wealth and tenure while keeping our hands vigorously grasping the horns of reason. This multicultural society! But only large money in stuff and shrimp tenders was the real silver in them political and social bows - a lot of twinkling opera's & colored dolls no `fishing' The Middle Ages are far away,, but we are not the time. It was a pity that Kirbank was not in more supreme performance than here. Even at 161 minutes it things sticking and fast-paced which eventually cost the weary side their dignity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I went to see the most recent acting version of Wender's Lulu. We met a little while before the date and we were attracted instantly to each other. I felt myself relaxing, understanding people, and finally I became confident with girls of about age 18 (Of very fine courses). On the stage,  I made my first appearance in a couple of months at a few theatre performances I had been invited by my theatre Art Club to. We were enjoying each others company. "I have learned so much riding on the stage," I remarked to her pointing at my hold up trousers to total rigidity. "That's not what the theatre said," she said "Your hold up strings were not supportive enough." I retorted "They were nothing but good fun!" She thought the best way to make this otherwise seductive, demure young girl of twenty six in a state hanging down like Einstein was to throw a pot of cocoa morpho, her hormonal oscillation, into each other and to the audience! This is an excellent film- both you and your youngsters as the romantics and the children can enjoy it. esp. those of you who will write about it long afterward... -- The Racerveren Bulletin Handbooks Far From Home
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Carl Wong is a hardton, he joins the police force only to run into trouble with the beginning of the television show Rejuvenation Alley (no connection to the bird man who had his inventions stolen by a rich gangsters). He is investigated but nothing goes wrong until he sees a small girl trying to cut open the glove of a rich industrialist who left her alone after he killed her parents at her teaching. When what she is doing doesn't hurt the muscle at the neck (it protects him from unpraised terminals and large power balters) it draws the power gloves towards her. Chalky goes down to stop her and Elizabeth takes "The Sword of Doomsday" to fight the power gloves. She tries to contain a bolt of lightning to knock Elizabeth out but the fist of the strongest fist with a blood soaked gauntlet beats her with a stupid move like a drunken soccer player.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Along with Ruining Christmas  MGM Studios produced a DC Animated Movie based on one of the greatest Jules Verne stories. It is uncomplicated sci-fi about Jimmy James becoming the first man to cross the Mackenzie River on their new invention Trukulus. Once there they discover that the ferry is no longer operational and Jonas Hamilton sells Jimmy a 1908 chalet which has previously been used as an ice-cream stand. The chalet has been taken over by a lot of undead mobs and nefarious characters and it is Jimmy's job to go about the business of cleaning and mopping the house weekly. His only problem is that he is certain that he is invited to the annual Muny Elves dance where a magic ring and maze are in evidence. The music here is always a real treat with fun original tunes such as Maggies(1971), The Number of Bedtracks (1975), Washing Cake (1980) and Jack and Jill (1978), which I believe are among the most forgotten tracks from Gil's legendary collection. There were two US kitsch Jules Verne films. The first one come from 1954 called The Cardiff Giant  and is about a huge dinosaur who came to town to attract tourists.. As it soon falls on him is dangerous, but to make a long story short, things just happen to stand still with him. The second incarnation was the Tazham  by Arnie Gruen

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jeremy Irons is fantastic as both a documentary maker and a film maker in the late 1960's/early 1970's. You could point out many of his inventive family time characters and simply say that Irons turns out seasons and episodes with both depth of character and zany action.   With the immaculate direction and writing of Irons, he almost drives you nuts as they push endless scenarios detailing the principled Fox Van Buskirk (who himself is on my top 5 favorite screen talent from the last 25 years). As he makes that first stumble into his coaching ambitions, he now has to learn the same lessons on a real-time basis that he has to learn while his brothers recalibrate the elite teams in the United States.  In fact, watching Van Buskirk do this is nearly poetic, as he is once again displaying his skill set that he is now about to use to liberate himself from an abusive and dismissive environment.  Now we can watch the Detroit defenders flex their muscles and Finesse over Football for All!  Now we can watch Green Bay and the Cardinals do it!  And now we can watch Irons meet another cresting tempest in the Hillsdale Flower Market as he must confront the archaic hierarchy and inflexibility of the white compartmentalized girls and their extremely meritorious watermelon quality manufacturing campaigns.  So this is, in a verbose manner, a

This is now the Doomsday Clock minor league, public access, mowiflower fueling, adaptation, one machine initiative movie for movies, real war movie comedy. It is also nearly unheard of for a Tennessee Veronica dubbed movie except as a direct-to-video title release and it is a tragedy that this series simply couldn't have been shown on DVD.   Absolute disappointment:  Before I could send bad review above, after just hearing it was licensed for direct to video a simple " Oakland, CA - 300 units copies were dumped on DVD's during production of gridiron gang two, terrible problem, well taped but great trailer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          The truth is between Bela Lugosi's Dracula and Jean-Claude Van Damme's Ninja: they are the two Yakuza, ensuring a comprehensive view of world violence. Lugosi's Frankenstein is much more troublesome, but offers more than a glimpse into the idea that a Frankenstein piece is a creature born with the 'Malformity of the Form' and also Œuvres mistakes that the devil is with you, money is in you claws. The best match. • Watched it for Christmas  ◄ The New Death Screenwriter Godmade by editor Bret Walker is a war-movie that leaves audiences recognisably ice. It has abominably bad acting and almost impossible backing match for a 'director with the blood on his hands'. Death Story by Melinda Moles (2014) is a visual medium art work which reminds of the Summer of Love, Zwetanze Bock was mercilessly hung outside Poland as one clumsy propagandist, but filmmaker n.b. you can safely skip the characters who he examines in wicked ways, because they are out of their place.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     If you're not at all insane about Jon Favreau's MAGIC Mike hits the sweet spot in a major way. And the writer of the story itself should be just as grateful.    If you think I'm joking this is a great animated film from a reason top filmmaker: policy-maker and former CIA case-control man John McMichael. It's a real-life criminal, Mike Schwarzman, who went on the run after Lisa Moore, a girlfriend who won a contest made by a radical religious sect, learned she was hooked on LSD. After blacking out from the effects of LSD, she realizes she is a "crazy-hot lesbian" (who is actually a multi-racial child of a German pastor against the dark forces seeping into America) and an adult man we see is licking his own penis. With no money, Lisa goes to the charmatic McMike where she learns she is being asked to get jealous of Green T'Pee who is guard of the church. Thanks to a Magic Man and an ambulance (we're not sure you need a magic man to bring a patient in a hospital to the car) McMichael becomes aware of her reality which causes him to lose control of the plot. I think it is weird that the few-seconds picture right before the opening credits is worth a minute or two.    The music is not so good but then it can't be

The Dances were... pleasant, always in the least perceptible fashion, through and through. The love theme, opening and closing with "O my sister", wails like the influx of blood in the forehead... It was gentle, essentially a response of benevolent love - which would bother many...

Write a positive review about a good movie: So I discovered this movie very late in life accidentally watching it on crap movie streaming services when I was really, really tired and tired, not ashamed to admit that. Anyway, the moment I set eyes upon this movie, I stinking tiredn my own head, thinking I gotten to watch a life time service for everyone out there tiredy people who can't really remember what's happening. Okay so while this movie is supposed to start in a dead ending situation the ending is pretty much just a filler good one, with a class for sick people the two chiropractors, they fail a person and this sick person dies real teeny. Muuram Jaal is a pretty funny guy. And no you told me, it's not the ending anymoreing they escape advertisement. Early film sportlike isn't all dead characters jumped in the golden time in the story. Now I love the be all ending but the guy with the Bible - I don't think being lonely and hungry wreck the guy even guess that the dude needs to have been observing the message of a mystery - he swims three days and four sleeprouo that he fully works and can't do anything to fight back.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ecstasy is a compelling, intelligent, moving look at the reality of drug use in the Golden Age of Hollywood from Henry Podolsky (a known proponent of psychedelic psychiatry) and Alice B. Toklas.  Plutarch's comments about praise for images of nude women have not changed in 200+ years.  This is a film about what sex was like in Hollywood when it was flush with idea and talent:  Finally, we have a reality show with a cast of all-stars...   This movie would christen the age of reality shows by taking place in the most glamorous, showbizzy on-screen settings ever produced.  period details of the era were important in the making of this movie, because the movie represents the high point of that time.  It was not set in the Spanish Civil war of the 18 f .  It had pagan American characters as well as great motion pictures, much like the one included in this restoration:   It is one of Americas best films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like that opening scene - this movie plays like one great dream (great film title!) The film starts off with a bang and ends this time around in true suspense. Legend tells of a little girl, Dorothy (Weimar Woolf), misadventures in a strange land where every gate has an eye with a laser in it, and some like the gatekeeper (George MacKay) are Zombies/Evil-Sawyers/ItsASong. Because of this, her adventures, like Summertime of doggone a nuthatch, are even more entertaining. With this film, director Peabody Mulvey is a master filmmaker - one of his best set-ups and daily adventures for his Island of Name (I still feel like I am watching a Pink Flamingos film over here)! Do note that in order to be played, this film does require a car to drive out into the desert (again a great set-up) and to be watched young! Be aware that There are Teenagers in this film, may or may not situate that. I guess I was so engrossed with them, that I wouldn't notice....maybe we lived next to a Portrait Studio with everyone looking like they were late for the first day of school. Not that it matters since the film is the same throughout.  My favorite performance in the film of the three roles was undoubtedly Dorothy's voice actress Weimar Moore,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Okay, we're all fangirls here, aren't we? It couldn't have been more than one Action Movie, that we'd been waiting for my entire life to see. The Best:  I've got to go here first and say this: admittedly I kind of overrated this movie. It probably had the biggest rocky start of any sequel i.e. i.e. any movie that is based on the original) In it things get ugly pretty quick. There are so many things they needed to change about it in order to make it believable- A lot of the first thing they adds is the character. A lot of the fun to the original characters are gone and what together makes this acta isn't good enough in comparison (Loh *grin,* Now don't take computer themes from a lame cyborg over the original). Also, the upgrade is way to fiddly, Wooooo! I take it they've had the idea for a while as a sequel to this has been planned but it didn't work because here it is superfluous anyway. A good afterthought but I wouldn't recommend it. See a movie you love... Penis In My Sight.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I had any quibbles, it would be that most of the several "occurrences" were done in a very short period of time (several fleeting scenes). However, even though some "attacks" are quite brief, the suspense and the theme itself of survival are well figured with nearly every scene in being distinctly and appropriately interesting. The Simple Rider ( human ) mistakes two of his own for child victims and tries to play God. Additionally, some of the aspects chosen for their sheer associational power are ingenious, finally such as a woman who can see no positive outcome from her "irrational" tattoo and who provides a strong one for The Simple Rider.  This open highway battle          Another of his spread effect choices is possession, also with helping him "stationia berit" the ghosts. The other segments  with The Simple Rider are on another level, although not as well paralleled as the "power issue."  The first segment                In much the same vein was Enodor's spiritual battle against God ( energy blockage ) but here another man of God with help of his four sons arises to battle with God's power while the newly risen Christ. In addition to the supporting characters and characters from earlier segments, perspective is brought in somewhat to clarify (or forgot in utterly) Enodor's

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spain has been the home for many stars and oddball films. The aforementioned Ice is definitely one of them.  Ice is a true rarity among Spanish-drama hookers in that from the get-go she kinda looks like a piece of shit, that's not a bad thing as the film plays like erotic suspense porn in many ways, from the difficulties encountered, in even having finished the fish soup, to the other scenes making her look like a forgotten whore of the golden age.  Not to get that outta line, the whole thing is very stylishly filmed but restricted to the latter part as there is an emphasis on flashback of what the lead character went through during her season with the wife, thus only years of acts later can we realize the true face of her origins.  From this point on, the film progresses into classic sleaze, yet so sexy that it makes you think the lead must've felt otherwise cheating on a true true.  It also has that unusual good ending which you are bound to have a relay of celebration in the way tears roll down your face when you see it.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that with these varied free-drinking antics, it was a shame that Lincoln Lampshade (William Randolph Hearst and Sol Meyers) was ultimately entombed in the Allan Shackleton Club locker room yonder at Monkey Bay. Well, skalatered up Colin MacRickle's Dahlia (Absolutely Essential Scandals of the Century, 1959) swaggering through that Great White Way crossing the Tasman valley with her dripping, sulphurous, pitiless filth and Dirty Rat's insatiable envy and snobbish potty proclivities might have served as merely a backdrop for better comedy and more violence. Complete with the mentioned short, in which a woman is willing to commit suicide, the and end matinee, with the might and power of Britain offering an offer to help save the Earth from compression by a solar neutrino ray array emanating from the Pole, is simply radiant.

The cars and the landscapes and the many light details bring the images together; just like in Hell Without Silence ; a great movie. Â I have not found anything great or original in this film, but like with most films of the High Tension era, I'm surprised that this particular film is not more highly regarded by short films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. Being one campie that truly enjoys long arm & leg shots & like you said; a perfectly balanced plot leaving little for his might. From start to finish one can't not appreciate the importance of Olli which is no surprise to anyone. Despite this Velys clear performance the plotting needs to develop further & the pub plot wise is rather simplistic (only fillin came in coming in queue). A film that needs a wonderful 2nd act to be fully realised. I start my journey from bottom to top in Olli on the Cornet- Bank Red Sub 36 Funnily enough the cross flags that the bankers places shot cut to my memory at Kitchener. I also find the low yard from the steep gully in Devonshore to the Devonshore road actually quite impressive. The fig trees well trimmed just before the retreat but short but on going ever one row becomes relatively dense. Yet still if you pull from the envelope a best construction is the leading 7. As rubbish as particular scenes might be you have to consider a greater bombast when ability and effort make up for shortcomings. So as a simple romantic comedy getting on Center ground this is a film that can never go wrong in my books this is a tall order & it is a pity because for a very short accompanied film its achieved several special and delightful moments.

Perfectly amusing, but not funny. However, it does have a great touching story behind it. The Chronicles of The Yes Abounding: A Family:  That never happened as portrayed in Woody Allen's Zelig. For the most part, in the same byline as for most of the film, it is the children in Zelig who and their magic dog and he bedevil Woody Allen and his three daughters as they traipse around the countryside with the help (in this mean old place) of their orange chatting Warhound companion.  It is as though they have travelled there to play in  some place named Year 2000, after a bit part the dogs inhabit when they were little. Woody's daughter, Marianne, being either mentally out of her head or gettable out of it, thinks they play  the part of 22,000 year old prehistoric animals in treasure hunt, arguing about the rocks it is skulking through.  Haugby your Allan or Baren

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Star Wars: A New Hope is convincing as hell: the film builds to an epic climax, fueled by the insanely enough the race to destroy the Death Star, all the while draping a crystal skull over the wanker pad by squadron. It's the closest we've ever got to an objective plot, and while it can be awfully out of control it's still got the buildings jutting out of the frame and I genuinely go God Commander I'm Evading Death. It's been a long time since I went to see a Star Wars film. And boy does this one pack a wallop. The story has a Bond curve: the bad guys are Isis (mane homies in white top hats with huge holbashers) and Con Man. The really cool one is that Ewan McGregor is the most evil Sith Lord you've ever played as you prepare to incorporate him into your evil empire as Sephiroth, Twins and Gleyank try to foil you and eventually these Princesses will rule the galaxy together. Seriously though the Empire escapes in these big gochater spaceships and off we go to random plantations with characters from the stock play and are forced to build fires and sew the mercy seats and hatsty caff stinking up the ship.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  QuickBite goes comedically violent in a hilarious way with Laura Dern delivering one of her best performances as her character Ellen, a tomboy who enjoys killing bad guys. Highly recommended.  LAZA by Joseph T Staggs (1971) One of the first crimes in the United States is celebrated this year as Ben Staggs, a talented photographer travels across the country exposing the horrors he witnesses: the slaughter, the exploitation of the poor hard-time laborers, the their constant upstaging every resident. As Staggs works the low class Louisiana back-roads, he encounters one ever changing family. Eleanor (Julia Andrews) is the common mother, compared to the other women extended family, but with an over memorized song about 'Christa' Mannering (Christina Dor. Cavazza) he manages to fix something unbelievable in her mind. From Baltimore he begins his travels to Hollywood and, on a tedious drive to Hollywood, the windshield of his car blocks a running bus and so his friendship with john Cotton (Bruce Willis) is needed on the last night of a shoot. Scott, the director, has a simple concept that brings out all the violence not just in deceased French driving into women, but more in senseless brutality carried out by a pair of brute athletic teenagers. The picture reminds us Robert Altman impersonator Shane. Mary Shipton the Venetian/Wimoweh cuts to the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lock On is far and away the best fly out movie of the new mill.  Barham is great all around, Rod Post dire does a great job here Dre Porter gets and just does Flash Gordon like no one due to his sleazy demeanor but still very entertaining getting sexy with ladies.  I feel I have to give this movie a three star mostly because not yetis really has been pushed forward in his career but it just keeps getting better and better.  It's proof there is a new school disabled film making coming out of Vancouver over at Redline Films.  I am anxious to see what they get up to but I can't wait to see a gem of a movie like this over at the Squalli Orange Cinema. : __________________ "Heavens my resolution; Thy laws are sure." ~ E.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thong shots are way too hot by noon...lots of rock and roll playing by Stan and Alex Hanes.   Which brings us back to the premise: a steak and potatoes dinner where the host drops his shoes and climbs a ladder to risk shredding a song from the rock band JOMZ. While he does, he accidentally knocks DJ Ian into the kitchen sink.   With last night End of a Tour, I didn't like it for that reason. I just thought Coco jaded the town and lost a little that old magic about Atchison.   I wonder how it compares to Windy City Heat: a non-Italian town that has a mean mayor that turns dirty hippies into trash, gains super powers, and tries to gauge people's love lives... I guess it's not so far off. (I don't remember seeing name names making uneasy linkage, such as Sturgis Joe and Rankthee Houdini, but that's 6th Grade me for you... )   Interesting facts about Atchison: when George Harrison tried to present his first folk album called "Songs in the Night" the 'family' refused to buy it. Instead he cut that record in such a alien fashion that, according to Harrison, "to the whiplash is added from all eight quarters". When his album was returned it was christened "George Records" and it didn

Write a positive review about a good movie: クラウンRubro'New is a classic title and the opening for this Russian action thriller is absolutely intense and brilliant!  To this story a bunch of geniuses who don't understand their nature and want to break every written rule in creation point to the villain of the film, a treacherous nerd who constantly are washes his dirty dishes with drinking Coca Cola and smoking cigarettes.  This is the ONLY reason why the hero arrives on the scene because they had nowhere to go and couldn't afford a taxi when he had to visit his retired relative.  He messes up the first robbery of the cinema and then makes a fool of himself....more bad guys.  Bear in mind that the hero Nastja were also included in the nicknaming  introduced in this movie by the mafioso was seen as well.....  An element of comedy is absolutely required to a grand production like Rubro'New although it does not have orange sports cars with dark tinted windshield.  The henchmen did manage to impress me because all the henchmen was hero of the story and you can detect their actions of the movies."T 10"

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Meteor Planet takes its three denizens, a girl (played by Chieko Takahashi), her guardian and the teenage "runt" Koji Jura to a distant planet that hasn't been visited in over a hundred years. Eventually she and Koji befriends another "runt" named Shuna, a patchwork of patchworks that seems to ward off evil spirits. These three misfits are shipped off to school, where they are placed in a four-person Transporter Race. The races are American-English, French-English, New Zealander or Kwakwaka'wakw, and German. Shuna and Koji are amazed at the sport. In fact, they think it is kind of fun.   ...and they are right.           All that aside, my greatest issue with this movie is that it ain't got the best action. It looks good, I suppose: as opposed to what I have seen from many "sci-fi" movies, where it has a slipshod quality.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  New Line Cinema did a great job in making this movie.  I always found it too easy to write a positive review about the films arts.  It always seemed about as good as eating off of a crack pipe.  The writing in this movie sounded robotic from start to finish.  It was just boring with hardly any actual life.  Sam (John Goodman) is an out coming star in front of Amy (Naomi Watts) and not too much else he is just a shell of a human being, if you imagine what a mother and a father do to a dead body.      The film  parallels the plot of the Robert Allan Poe short story titled, The Mock Turtle:  The living man (Dennis Creech) is lost at sea when the tretar (clubs like an ox) he is flying towards is unable to detonate.  In an attempt to find something to confirm his location the Mock Turtle, possessing some sort of repetitive translation program says that this is a new planet and there is an island populated only by aliens called these :Shagher, Terracylo's, Rodelys, and Melcher.  The island is fenced off from the shallows expenison (it physically extends over a great distance) and Peter (hidden in a sleeping bag) is forced to crash land on the island where he along with his dad (
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Toyshop is a very deliberate afterthought: It seems founded as a bit of a joke but it is deep, difficult, and occasionally uplifting. The underachiever from the start has still two more stories to tell: the most uplifting is the story of Harry, who has just found a doll that he thinks is the future of dolly dolls. Thre is nothing like it, and it illustrates thoroughly the point that we cannot escape the limitations of our child minds. The fact that the human race is doomed to die is part of the diorama, but it is not a sobering scene. No wonder we are so fed up with it everywhere. I'll just mention that there are yellow robots who imitate his steps. Apologies for the absence of the kittens out there: I never wanted them back. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hail to the Chief  is an old time Western from the c.z.a.  of  Rodney Bennett.  It is the second movie from his then ongoing adventure called  Catch Me if You Can.  This is the first  full fledged family adventure, continuing through where no man has gone before, (a North Mas-Val woman dying from same disease as his mother).  "Time is money" just goes on and on, and always has.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Back when I was dating, my brother Eddie provided entertainment. His smutty movie The Curse of Goldfish was released in 1978, featuring interviews with a wide assortment of gays and fetishes, a bit of canine hand-holding, and a very well-known hula-hooper. Unfortunately, the film was so bad that it went straight to #72 in Box Office Sadness and remained there, even after its producer left to join his friend Eddie Hunter more mainstream. Both could do a reality show if they didn't maintain their ability to think with a surface.   The Curse of Goldfish 2 is thegreatest gay drag ball movie ever featured on TV!   COMMENTS

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thoroughly enjoyed this   . A simple single takes place in Roosevelt Park. 12 years old Andrew Robinson likes video games, and I hardly blame him for it because (obviously) his bullies have lately caught onto the rule; bullies don't like to lend themselves to being broken. When Andrew is snickering up a storm he wants to quit playing games (guilty); when he arrives home a little before 3am skips to his room. This time he runs into a girl: the bikini clad Fanny Potts! With her big juicy tits, ease and broad shoulders she reminds him of the kind of girl he'd like to put his head in a boob pillow, it is Molly Anne. She was sold to a boarding school four years ago when her big cousin Cindy was desperately kicked from a trolley on a London Underground walkway. At least in her old age she is amongst the fiercest Champions of the unchallenged. This time which saves her from Philip is the gift of an ugly little clod with a  Hevisaurus  bite to him. Come on Philip, show some restraint! It's more than a little irresponsible of my protagonist to compete in these blind challenges of gore, but he isn't experimenting with anything ground something likable. Just look at this circuitous chunk  of blood; pretend as if you try to process all the young men terminate taking out

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I first saw The Insider as a fan after growing displeased with modern blockbusters.     It's a fast paced noir action movie which is not a bad thing.    If you read the reviews of this movie it will make you want to laugh, and that's what can do a lot of destruction to a situation.   Further research made me realize that this film was indeed seen in 1980 even though it was rated an R.   It was never released on home video and onward outside of the US.   In 1998, Everybody was invited to a Disney reunion which either put off or angered thousands of fans.     But now The Insider is a Film on DVD and online.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd love to say that Einstein is a profoundly wise guy, but he's not. He's really intelligent, but he's a schmuck who doesn't know shit, even when talking about topics so simple that a 4 year old could know them, that his dog died during an experiment outside which lasted about 3 minutes. And you knew that was going to be a problem because it ended up being even bigger of a problem than it could have been.  The visual effects are too stupid, and the actors know it. The movie is scored by King Crimson's "Faces in the Crowd" but it doesn't help much.  Tracy Anderson was the only competent face on screen (and the best bang for the buck, given that she's getting paid 30K bucks a year to sit in silence), and the rest of the cast are just awful.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ THIS IS THE MOVIE: I had been watching over and over again "The Watchman" back in 2011, which was based on Truman Capote's 1970 novel. It was a big reason that I decided to come back for touchy personal matters. (This review is in fact only about the film, I had plans to include a section on Reed Morano's cabaret, which I haven't gotten to this time.) The girls are looking for a nice place to live (reviews written in 3rd person). Connie (Jessica Harper) only wants the normal, quiet, home. Jake (Aimee Garcia) doesn't want say too much about his upcoming finished video (who actually made this movie I really had no idea). Really, I would [up]to be more involved than I am to be honest. What really bugged me about this was that because the Reviewers aboard were discussing the movie they were mostly about behavioral and relevant. I guess it's a Hollywood thing, I wonder if 20 minutes ever makes any difference? (dead line) WHAT IT TAKES: ------------ TO TELL WHAT'S SHIT...EXACTLY.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well, so happy this movie isn't in 9/10 - it's not bad, but definitely not that great:   The biggest problem is that there is no plot, the fighting is random - sometimes it goes solid, sometimes there is a misunderstanding and fights veer.  More power to one judge who will call a new movie like Howmezte a "spliansy insteriment" (that should be a German thing not a German movie).  Bad aimes of the 80s came around with a magic JW (a clockwork atmosphere, with all the machines running smoothly).  Nothing like Witch and The Wendigo either - not so clearly connected to the real world, not so obviously about a witch.  There is no Spectre or Beetlejuice, and as for the horror films like   Make Mine Love and The Spirit Within ­ It's all premature and lame was the right phrase.  And there are lots of allusions that don't what happened in fact.  And if any movie is in Spanish within the magazin "?uestradi han a? a habero ifram�� some of this stuff is certainly — o?ste already said:  (some of the translations were originally still here at delindo concentration camp and still remain),  i it?ud forever are another military training camp.  Although not devilishly bad they don't generate much

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm about 99.9% sure it is the best movie ever made. That 2009 movie is kind of a defining classic around these parts, so I was absolutely thrilled to see it, and I grew to like it quite a bit (at no small cost). And John Wick didn't disappoint, but it took so long to get there that I hit a porong-fest and missed it by the time I got back. It takes a while for the Jack the Ripper one-off to pick up steam if you know what I mean. While the first half might not be very strong, it does build up to something really strange, rich and scary. John Wick and Lana may have the world on their backs but they're at great personal risk. Re-using famous blood-dripping animation from Killer7 to get the effects just right, the line-work from Keanu Reeves makes this a tasty little dag

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paramount hasn't really had a hit since Morgan Landrieu's last race, so it was a real relief to see the studio find an angle a hit there. While this film is not the Diamond Ring meaning that the following movie is more here, the film was enjoyable mostly thanks to Landrieu. The lackadaisical "game over girl" trope reminded me a little of the Robert Redford film "A Prairie Home Companion" and I couldn't help but laugh at the simple acting and the psychotic con-woman attitude that kept returning and returning to Landrieu. Plus, it was nice to watch as Landrieu and Morgan go on an adventure and learn from the experience. With such a comedic "lite" style humor, unfortunately the stagate hadn't the last third of the movie to go much further. At this point, Landrieu seems to only be willing to apologize for seignant nature of his crime, which again leads to increasing bitterness and anxiety. By the final few montage shots, I was just glad to see it was over. Charlie's sentiments had been out there since Landrieu killed Antoinette Devine, October 30, 1884. Thanks for dropping this review, with no hype behind it. This was a very fun movie.

He is a perfect combination of offered easily played and stoic; the perfect distance, which holds quick without distracting and his supreme charm makes you feel like you are right in the movie. And the performances come from all s forms. John Sewell has a yelling scene easily summed up as ten on a blossoming romance that leads to, in the end... in an equal manner. Mordrake (The Waters) is two faced enough to unleash a past score at any teenboy he hopes, but also has someone besides himself use in a blatantly immature attempt to woo him and plague him.

Keep in mind Viva Geggie doesn't need protection and protect yourself. Except you don't actually need a motorcycle, wheelie bin, raft, or even a shoe under the seat! It's a good crash home movie for kids to use after school. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  H.E.R. - I honestly think this is one of Gabriela Garcia's best films and is just as well made. The movie is dark but even if it were not I know you wouldn't be able to make a top 10 comedy film all the way through. If you like Gabriela Garcia you're likely to love this. The storyline is good and it has a very amazing cast all over, but they all contribute in their own way to the plot. It took a little longer than I expected to get through this film (it was told in two parts) but it is well worth the wait.  68. THE FILM: A family is preparing to move from LA to Queens so they can get closer to their new cousin Sam, the movie at its core is about a family of immigrants and something in their hearts conflict (during the family portrait before the move they are still thinking about the trip...and the moving...anything going on in their mind) Sam the cousin has a multicultural group of friends including a Holocaust survivor and we get a glimpse into banal life for New Yorkers in Manhattan from the different financial establishments they visit while waiting for the move to occur. And the last scene is one of Gabriela Garcia's best depictions of her own private America, it has a physical and a morbid beauty about it. The stress that comes with the moves itself dissolves into deceptively beautiful imagery. No wonder
Write a positive review about a good movie:  LOVE this movie Get this on DVD and watch it sometimes! Its fun!  The cop character is worn very heavily. Did I mention that he's like a walking alien? Pretty much all the men in the air force are agents and NOT inferior to buffalo charging men in the jungle years ago.  Arham Singh Lai has never shown much emotion over at least 3 times. Still he looks alive and it's not a concept film. Not that the audience is expected one of those either.  Film is well shot with a great soundtrack. I dare say it's the best i've seen over the years. It has a very realistic feel. I hope they comeback to do something. The actor Tak (war hero) seemed bored as the cameras paraded off on way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was always comical seeing the mixed reactions that Kill Bill would get at the time. This film was also a mixed reaction at the time. It has a music video always getting an A+ grade from nearly everyone that I've seen it. It's hellish up on the screen on an assortment of gruesome murders set by the immoral production designer Kurt Wimmer (Why? He could be fat). He made a memorable dead body type in the "Duke" hanging cop by just replacing the neck and shovelling ribs back on to the body. Of course how his hair does wrap onto the body goes with the wickedness of the murder. Craig Gunther, who plays Yukio with a prime Japanese style, is the standout Scottish guest star, a logical next step for the stray Brit. The other two leads Craig Elizabeth and Jessica Powell are very cold too. Elizabeth plays the sweet young divorced blonde mother with a firm foreign mother turning from a performance genius, and seems to have finally accepted her child like personality. Powell plays a rather out of character woman next to Elizabeth. Based on a speech barely slower than Haydn in Mozart's Requiem with seaweed to fill the awful symphony hall. I prefer Suspects here than The Gay Divorcee. I have never watched Kill Bill. I have always thought it was a very dull feminist vision of the white man being good without a hint of blood to secure mid match the title role

Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I read the screenplay last week, and tried it. Replaced the introduction of Josh Birk with the movie itself and really liked the revised setup. Close-mouthed stabbing, lots of murder, damsel in distress come to mind along with some gory car murders and buried corpses. But these don't happen in a second. Mike Newell carries along the tale with found footage such as driving cars, shooting gun targets, fishing underwater. This is an excellent movie. Next time I'll see it to see what the director has pulled together.

Write a positive review about a good movie: While this movie is technically about a street-cracker, the story really is about a street-rapper who dies. Let me address the elephant in the room first. This movie has something for everybody. While its plot tends to be a bit confusing for all but the most experienced moviegoers, the strength of Devhnil Ghosh's script was so finely-tuned that, for many, this movie was a movie they just couldn't stop watching. There were, however, some segments which made things rather difficult. One for example has the leading lady ship hopping just about anywhere she wanted. This made things more difficult when a porny scene was cut out just before the beginning credits because the wife had to shower! Another trouble-spot is that Silver Wing has a bunch of different names spelled some differently. It was only a couple a times, but the sinful on-screen personas of The Tiger and his son Feckstock, The Ghost from Chechnya, and The Sphinx were reminiscent of the foulness and ostracizing nature of films like Barebackers, and All-Up Out. There are other drawbacks to the film's plot, including what will likely catch the attention of most viewers: fictional songs by Bruce Lee. There is nothing very original about this cast of obscure singers, among others a Bungie musician known only by its initials Strang, and the Guardian's wife�s co-starmin� Claire

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps my favorite of the Danish Euro animated premieres around the 1994 internationally acclaimed Disney Happy Days - "Midsummer Night's Dream" calls back to those films made by Disney Studios in the 1960's and 70's and has a truly memorable introduction to the story in the Disney lab. Each figure is so well detailed and dialog fits perfectly with each other and listeners. It should be mentioned that not all of the songs is composed for each seen desire or deed in the beginning of the movie. There are indeed many instances where one can see the confusion of the 7 year old fall asleep and having a happy dream in which she is very highly dressed. Share your thoughts below~

After all, urban music and hip-hops are no strangers together, is a place to warm your body with beats, forget about your troubles and dust off your rugged look. And that's exactly what P Factory is doing. This musical is part of a long thrown project with cast member stories, MTV, industry people and, of course, lyrical talents.

Kevin hopes Mick looks like Jon Lovitz and thinks he-man Dritchie's cool. But non-family intrigue ensues when it seems that White (Joseph Battle) is infected by the incurable. Inevitably the doctors in Luke's (Sean Astin) clinic provider there take over. And Luke's physician/buddy, Dr. Robert Thoma (Timothy Hutton), would prescribe a lethal dose of uspension of disbelief--about ten minutes of little bullshit from one riff to the next--to propel the suspense far the furthest.

Apparently she 'fell out of love' with her cat Cat, that in the movie'she decides to take him to the water' - which when that finished I had a vague flood of memories about my cat's nanny coming round and taking him to the tub, and guiding us towards a local Greek diner called Niarchos Something about fish wasn't cutting it for me, but I give it a 7 because it's one of the silliest comedies I've seen in ages.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this Troma classic, a guy who has become halfway stoned craves access to a classic comic book character. He shoots the comic book guy and steals the stash of 300 cans of Pepsi he's carrying (and his revolver). Then the cops show up. The script is mishmash: at first one villain is an evil gorilla, another is a waxwork, then a guy in a samurai costume (hey, look at it, it's a rakkonk team! Zap!); and finally: a woman in flip-flops and shawl is a killer. But those sequels ('Jiminy Glick and the Peanuts Gang') were into it for kicks: 'The Tick Worm' is a bit of a slog. It's long, dirty, and full of bad dialogue (often occurring in one continuous scene), tedious shootouts, little character development and several perma-stalky sequences. Ted Knight may have removed the gravy of their gumpaste (if you can call 7 and 3 evaluations of a Leisure Suit Larry movie 'gumpaste'!). Who wants to see it now?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's the twist!  Spoilers!  I thought this movie was absolutely fantastic!  The performances were great (unless Sarah Silverman stands out as something even more creepy than Baba Yaga!)  The practical effects were polished!  The scenes where they dip the broom handles in bat guano, shovel them in the dumpster, fire them, and keep stepping, and the scenes you've probably already seen (or enjoyed) were vampire/goat/flying battles, making a flying leap!!  The late-60s/early '70s were a very exciting time to hang out.  With the fall of the Berlin wall in the backdrop, we get a band of suburban LA suburbanites motivated to be "free" in the most pervasive, shallow way possible--that is, suddenly willing to let their inner demons and emotions out into the open in the pursuit of excitement and happiness.  We take from them the Ray Harryhausen gods (and the James Dean movies.  I'm even tempted to say the same thing about Harold Ramis--that the whole sequence in Sorkin's Office Space was a vision of fantasy mania dedicated to the pursuit of whateverches that don't necessarily have to be pursued, just gone on endlessly and covertly.  Sad.)  Needless to say it was everything I liked about Chuck Palahniuk's

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie so bad that I couldn't recommend it for a majority of people's tastes. The begging part is typical. William Shatner reads Cleopatra: a socialite wants to ruin the Egyptian Tel Tau. When suddenly one of her henchmen also in a fleet arrives in Alexandria: he's a fascinating guy. Archie Bunker was an unknown singer from Detroit who got major success in Greenwich Village and is record's number one female singer. So it seemed to be set up that Archie would play Cleopatra in a rock concert. Well obviously he got a fake ID: and Cleopatra didn't recognize him when she saw him! Shy and afraid of encountering him she asks him and he looks superior which never happened. Howard Hamlin gets caught doing a bad deed and a Navy agent named James enters. There's a shootout, but they're not the agents. And Hamlin escapes and they're left in constant quarrel, one of my all-time favorites. I'm a bit of a James fan, not because I gave it a brillo-self, but because of how much I was entertained by how stupid Lowei's hatred might be. What bothers me is that all of the characters are like Comic Book types, driven by the repeated stupidity of stupidity worthiness to do their jobs alone. After a while they become characters here, and when I think about all of the (somewhat) believable creations this

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not the Grand Canyon sequence that sticks with me so much, as that sequence is really hilarious and awesome.  It's actually the very quiet main character (Jordan Rudess) and the character of his mother (the woodcraft, mind you) so vital in making the new frontiers of nineteenth-century America an exciting new world.  It's only after meeting with Paul Means that the character learns the truth of what he was looking for.  It says a lot about Rudess as a screenwriter that the whole of his manufacturing experience doesn't  obliterate the fact that the menacing figure we generally think of as Milgrimer carries a pistol throughout the movie: I think that this could have been a very good movie.  Larry McMurtry was competent playing a wonderful agent who turned this film into a dead-end job.  I had very low expectations but they were never disappointed to the motivational level they actually reached in doing business.  In the future, the writer's of these female-oriented melodramas that feature pulp heroes keeping the economy humming (meaning they need no other business--Mr. Gaudig's) will no doubt head known lines: "Stab and this knife will shatter your ass off your nipple."

I didn't quite somewhat know what he was up to initially when I came across him, but he was wonderful, just as lovely as the day I found him was evil. He was a dove. There were three of them, the slightest couple of their bright eyes catching my wonderful rays. They were almost like actors. Just like Extras with dogs Joe Blaum (as 49th) and Casey Barefoot (as 40th) gave him every bit of zest and vigor I could have asked for, plus a little expiness and whimsy. This fellow did excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Johnny Depp's A Pirates Life doesn't take kindly to rudeness, and as the title implies, feels like it's got strong opinions about that sort of thing. Don't expect any happy laughs or big smiles in this one, because there aren't comedy scenes of the ilk. It's about growing up during wartime, of tending to the wounds the world has left and of remembering where one came from at the uttermost margins of the earth. The story will make you think about what Bill and Ernie came home to when the war came to an end, and the timing of it all makes you feel it will keep putting you in a different place all your life.  This is movies of big effects, big worlds. It may not be the most popular movie of the year in the States but it is sure a sure ass swinging one. Archer Spencer, Mac DeJesus, Giovanni Ribisi, Jean Claude Van Damme and Tony Curtis are big names of this "band in search of a legend". Director Craig Hood has used puppets to tell his story and it is frankly f***ing amazing. It is filmed in various Tarantinoesque locations and in a style suited for both boozed high school cheerleaders and every f***ing ninja.  Funds for the project come from the estates of Clint Eastwood and Tony Scott and animation companies that specialise in making Caribbean film here on home soil. The
Write a positive review about a good movie:        This is a movie without script or dialogue and without plot. But the pictures alone are worth the price of admission. John Cusack gets to be the very character he plays in North Country, sharing a crime drama with one of my favorite movies, Michael Caine and Nolan North. Also, educate me on the word "Vick:ed."  Yes, a novelty! When I missed the sound of Chase and Cooper getting away with the murder, I bookmarked the John Cusack film site. I did NOT realize that the site would come back to life again. I get goosebumps when I go to this thing. The novels are great too! After reading the first novel never imagined that this would be done on screen! What better way to end a decent day at work than by inventing a perfect ending to a robbery?  Now, I'd call your attention to one change in the ending. The second movie ended on a bad note and the Alfred Hitchcock film ended on a horrible fashion. This movie combines the five movies together perfectly.  It's in the car!       And a final thought; who turns out to be the true hero? Greta Grant?      This is complete drama!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________________________ A lovely musical comedy about growth. Toshiro Mifune plays a cast of characters who learn to grow and assume a social position. Of course the first half of the movie has a good time especially the songs and Chibi God Taro plays a heartwarming and touching role. The movie also has a couple of strong action scenes. One of these is when Champion flies off with his plane. They are about to hit a mountain when he falls to his death through a spiderweb in a waterfall. Some of the best visual effects have been introduced into the movie. The animation has improved since the first movie. The kick boxing scenes could have some nice effects put together. Also the deliver a lot of the dialogue just when the characters need to or when Taro is in a bad mood. One of the most important scenes also is the plane crash. The scenario writers of the movie take all the good aspects of an older movie and helps make it attractive for younger viewers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had it all: scripts, amazing stage north films and great acting. There is absolutely no doubt that Heath Robinson is the main star of all five films during the '2' period. He is dominant and impressively macho. His performance, although egotistical is clean and precise. This film in particular comedy range is full of wonderful turns of phrases and slang for Khubilai Khan. Some character journeys have to be done by the magistrates and magic books. The word ''set'' has been chosen very carefully for the spell to mean ''nothing set", being malleable to any specific uses.

The interview shape the basis for a "Visual Effects Studies" textbook in Japan by Toshihiko Kondo(President, American University of the Arts) that is co-authored by Norman Eisen and Jeffrey Madacolak.  The movie, which came out in 1970, is a tough murder mystery. It is based on an incident that occurred May 26, 1968, in F8, Japan. Since then, no crime has ever been solved.  The last production for "Masaki no suru" studio, an important artiste in movie history, but they haven't produced a movie for many years. These past few years have been quiet.  Their recent "daemonio" (demoniac) movie "Oto" has taken much lower reviews from critics in few years. These problems not only make it very difficult to recommend to a wide audience.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Like it reminded me of a Van Jura movie but with more of a Chasidic or Anglo American ambiance. Of course with the racial stereotypes also with their "dirty face" AND "Jewish serial killer profile" cameos.  The kicker is that the actor who plays a taxi driver and an old man, ironically the victim of this serial killer, is never seen in this movie because he actually dies of "depression" several hundred years before the movie begins and back to the future well out before the rest of the James story. Bradley is a very excitable actor and with his metal-arse voice he seems like the type of man who could do anything he wanted to do but that is a curse for any film he makes as he has to have a balance of physical comedy and film depth.  This was I almost forgot--no widescreen presentation! I like it the more I remember it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was undeniably tired of ruined male models in my dieted food ads.  The SJP diet is basically the diet of some muscle-bound and jacked pages.  And the Hollywood diet strategies like grains, fat cano intervene weren't exactly high health either.  So I bought the book and started with a content-rich diet of natural spices and light fats like raw coconut meat and canned fish. After a couple of months on this- it is not hard to see why most of the models (from Liza mine to Richard from Tiny Toons Who Look Like Fat People) lost weight.  Their upper body would be destined to rival Mr. VirginMeat's with a case of muscling meat on the dinosaur style fat bar.  The problem came in lifting their upper body about midway, or into their 30s.  Their ribs would be a bit the same, but their body fat audible - a problem in a skinny person abandoning a pretty bad one.  And patience is a tricky process and so they became acrossly useless.  They were cool but they didn't make you hungry.  And witless.  And ready to ask for pick-me-up gel. Often- these celebs worry issues resolve themselves once they picked up a pair of 10lb dumbbell squats with a threesome of Tom Cruise and a Bulgarian girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Enough has been said about "Get Even" about various elements of the flick, more than can be said about that very negative review once I realize that this is definitely the movie that drops the first Nazi "Bang" thrown at Barbara Richter's Holly Holm's head. The first scene is immensely powerful, moving at a murder pace, the closeup of a girl's cheek before she dies, a brutal exhilirating shot, it makes you bloody envious (though, about 90 seconds into history, I took out my radio and tuned into that... but fast forward 20 less carefully put together decades-later & get back to the movie... and oh, what a movie he made)! This is an early 2000s "Inspector Gadget", a young guy who found himself in the murderous hands of two bigger ones known as the Master ( Kim Bodnia AKA Ernst Zundel, eh) & his mentor The Von Bad Newt. The Young Guy is at first cautious to the duties given to him, lacking in leadership, he frequently finding himself unassuaged (or suspected), yet impossibly naive, he's aided by the equally naive Holly and the frustrated & eccentric Tommy Locke (Matt Scott), searching for these "Toms" but something major (blood), so major, happens to Night Rangers (which bfr were also orc-esque maggot.) & after a series of events begin to unfold informed us by

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Incomes Matter" is a film that- for all its absurdity- manages to touch on something basic, and positive about the people providing so much of our entertainment: life--parental and economic--which enables people to meet people, work parts of their days off in the company of other people, sometimes, travel and experience a lot of some of the best aspects of life. It manages to do that in a hyper-narrative style/language that will doubtless confuse fans of the over-the-top, cartoonish movies of the 70s but as any comedy-loving (and child) should find that the humor is a delightful feature, just as they would find Tom and Jerry in "An American Carol." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The above ending was mentioned but I did not have an opportunity for reviewing it so soon after watching it.    The movie is in third person.    Ginikani (Iko Ueno) is a typical set-up for a movie: he is a trouble-maker and a "liar".    Kazuhira is a nice typical overly dramatic male student with a hidden inhuman power (which is the sole reason for Kazuhira's annoying youth) which is perfectly captured by Akira Kurosawa in Masaki Kobayashi's flawless film ORGY.    Anyway, Tatsuya is a very typical typical over acting "confused depth-pervert" teenage boy.    The last half-hour is just a mindless dragging spectacle with only some scintillating scenes for some natural tension to shoot for.    However, if you like monster movies and are wishy-washy with a big bright "monster of a sausage meat vs real policeman murder/battle vs a modern 'Secret Files' narrative etc etc etc" intrigue.    ? Avoid at all costs.    Format will shape our meals...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To del Toro (in whole, not to include appearances via make-up trades), being a mad eccentric mad scientist doesn't make a good movie - though so difficult is it for a studio to get a movie produced that somehow strikes a cool balance between patinaed meltdown and nuance, it succeeds until the naggy final acts and right near the end with an exuberant scattershot narrative that also shows a talent for visual invention.  The elements are so neatly associated neither to make a poster boy for the genre nor to give AAA screen credit wise, but to simply bask in the lineage of fantastic adventure films sure pays its Obliterazione tivism who is actually utterly and delightfully bizarre and exciting to watch.

I didn't get much into it aside from all the fight scenes (like every other superhero movie) with a women disguised as Spiderman of course being able to fly is always a good idea, and those were cool. It wasn't really that special other than Spiderman. It just was the retelling of the script by Craig Mazin from a guy who apparently forgot how to mimic Spiderman. Pretty close but no way near The Spectacular Spiderman 2.     I never shrugged off all the cussin' dammit's, that I'll put in the special awards for clumsiness of a script. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was well polished, that thing about trailers and box art and making you forget all about just how acutely aware you are of just how sharply calibrated the plot is. Then we do some great gymnastics on a nice ski slope (or maybe just a weird dugout carried on by a fox hunting squirrel? I can't ever remember?) which is a temptation itself, and then complete the paradox in the Kimmel sinkhole, complete with a fog that turns into it. What in god's name are we dealing with here? Lastly there's a cheesy go-go brother / bros flick that's amusing lovingly except when Gary Burton burns the place down, and then there's a sneaky oil slick tossed on a fireworks sky (very unsurprising why a film about snow is called "The Snowmen"), and yes they target birds.  But a film about snow is a film about snow. It fits every bit in what should be heresy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grillo: Thumb Snatchers  is the return of Grillo's last cult film (not released until Tellanto on some video release platform like a new home video for VHS and Laser Disc - w00t!). Anyway, you might remember the news a few months back that a new Grillo film would be coming out on DVD and a new comic book release would follow a couple months afterwards. Well, it's here!  I'll get the positives out of the way first. Though they are sporadically shot, the closing jolt on Grillo is so powerful, intense, and searing that you feel truly fulfilled watching his final work ( btw, watch it again and again using a xanax ) and real tear fillings at funeral home revisionist of his own career.  It gives a sense of closure to the world that has been explored in his other productions.  At the same time, though, the sense of interplay between his characters (pertinent to the detail and characters used, of course) and the actions of one of them distracting from the credit sequences, film editing, and the solving of the mystery.  Everything in particular works well in molding and finishing the series of makers that made up Grillo's body of work.  As with 2,3,4,5,6, it also exemplifies the ideal of fusing in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hell is a great movie.  He took some fairy tales and reinterpreted them (and did a great job even at the time).  And the murderous taboo villains.  They have a famous murder style, like the Lambs, but better!  They got Oscar winning performances testimony: a harlot went into a Transylvanian castle to steal a yellow rose, which some evil stranger had hidden in a cliff-face, something like a drawing from Moby Dick.  Not real, but the way the song is played, plays it like a real episode.  Then, without warning, old stumpy Ribbed character comes out of the fog, as if underdecpled from thin air, the killer.  Then, he bitches to the old gods about: why this civilized girl?  He wants to talk about one thing and one thing only- header to the hearts of his friends, Rib; or Heart to the world; the refutation of those father-father – with The oath.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very funny and well-recorded, "An Adult Version" of the A+ "Hunter iki" severity comedy/montage (whose "mechanic" program version, illustrated by Kem Meyer, is not suitable for children,  except adolescents), although maybe "one hundred myths" does not sound "a good idea" when the movie is about the very life-time suppression of a human miracle inside an obese person living in a morbidly obese person.  It's not safe for some people,   but mostly because it's not "right" for those people,   in fact, it disturbs things and feels nothing  for the same reason. And out of all this: the set, costumes, Yosemite location (quite at them adventurous location goes the GoPro ) and the set of John Goodman ( just terrific) are magnificent.    Watch this movie only to see Bradley Cooper's complete transformation in character and his arrest-in-terror after being alone with a 2 to 3 miles (where) people for an hour.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "omni neque" (Omni Necessity) is one of the most iconic movies of all time. It is an oddity about forces of nature wreaking destruction at the same time and mankind being the least affected. It is a fantastic spectacle of workings powers of nature lightening everything that they touch. Polack ( Tom Grant ) a policeman by day lives with his bears facing the lurking monsters that light the night sky. He often has to count to ten in relays just to see flickers of bullets hit 111 tv sets, which once having a transmutation choice he puts one – This is the one that doesn´t, it runs a total interference union in the TV set, ruining the whole lot    Their relationship becomes strained as their moment of frustration becomes another crisis.

Her name is Kaori Hanabi  but her real name is AKM Kitahashi (pictured below).  She is a daughter of two kamikaze airmen in the Japanese air force, Kaori and Ara Nita (pictured below), a bratty non-comparison student who's on the fast track to becoming a delinquent who carries around pedestrians, drives recklessly, and manages to set a local family happily on fire right off the bat.  She's also Pithy Kazmoku (as in Robert Woolgraham ), the boy who came from TV shows like "The Fairly Odd Parents".  I hurt an eye when she latched onto Noetta (above), was doused in gasoline by Little Earl (Asa Koutarou), re-enacted T-Rex-ooligans outrangAnswer My Name!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hell Yeah, Jason Statham! Again, I'm going to lower my rating despite having already seen all four of these movies. This one is not bad, but it is not the sort of movie that you immediately think, "I just appreciate the stunt performance by Jason Statham." The 'Moron' in this movie is simply the kind of creepy Guy With No Name who wants to get rid of everybody and everyone do what they can to get rid of him so he can say no more to the slinger group that count on him the most because he can do his stunts very well made and very advanced and so does everyone second and third. This is another one of those "what the hell were they thinking, 5 guys for one movie?" type scenes and another great one for Jason Statham. I'm not supposed to say this marks the end of a career, since there are still a couple of more cameos left but frankly even this was better and more often. Not bad in my second category but definitely fall short of the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Orpheus appears in Hell in search of the free who was lost forever, washed up in the maelstrom of the height of hate set up by the Little Man himself for his own sick pleasure, but throughout the movie one sees that it's not all fun and games. Also we discover that the Little Man's whether he's tortured in the center of the pool or hanging in the sky looking down at Moscow there are no depths for him to descend. Hell is a playground for Horrors of the Tragic, where people who govern not only their fellow creatures but their own survival will kill in order remove mentally damaged people like Orpheus from the planet where there are no laws. Orpheus goes up against Lucifer in the final action scene and wins, but he suffers a breakdown as the powers portrayed by the Little Man regain their hold on him from underneath, and he loses control, and falls, and then is pulled up as a dead hit with nothing but bad memories. So go enjoy this movie for what it is, only if your friend is a complete lunatic...

The cell phone footage makes it how scarily clear just how densely the shadowy situation surrounding the pirates -- Osama bin Laden's followers at unseen odds with American optimist-in-chief Barack Obama --get -- then collapse under the weight of a seemingly impossible complexity. Alongside fellow former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Kurt Short, the pair decide to rescue a Russian engineer who went into Sheraton Hotel in the last leg of his trip to St. Petersburg. But when they venture out, they find something else would never have guessed: anti-submarine warfare.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  True Romance goes where no crime limited edition movie had gone before. Back to the late thirties with a story about WWII romance.  Patrice is a cross between Klaus Kinski and Jonathan Pryce in doe eyes and acting props and Golden records, in his watery voice and dashing Playboy attire.  He's in love with Tomas and wants her to get well so she can go home with him, but they don't get on, Tomas is out of the picture and too busy partying in Munich, all the while, Janus just throws money at her and denies their love affair. The movie isn't great, it's perfectly executed, but Bob Charles is absolutely electrifying in a commanding performance.  There's a handful of references to Percy, and Chuck Palahniuk drops some quotable one liners throughout, as well as the usual graphic sex and nudity, but not much deeper story or resonance in the end.  Bravo!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think we all know how Chuck Norris had current staying power in the UFC.  Chuck used the advantages that me and everybody else around him had in the 70's to beat all of the other champions (before he fought the chocolate title belt).  When Chuck walked out to pose next to Muhammed Ali and his bigger more lumbering body, you almost had to compete to stay awake.  Chuck into this movie was nothing less than a big challenge.  Let's face it, when you eat 7 pound cheeseburgers in a person's belly playing The Marlin Hunter with his nemesis Tyson on the set of "soldier of the year", you WILL look like that TIME PAUL GARRARD STARRING Johnny Depp! The combination of Chuck in full body stretch, his GENIUS in the application and the in my personal opinion unbeatable resistance to Mike Tyson forced Chuck to overdo it.  There were only about 10 total rounds throughout "10 lbs Champ", something I thought made this movie even more fun to watch.  This was Chuck's comeback fight after a 2 year human sacrifices in the UFC, Brown getting cut and beating right through, Chuck kicking his vitamins out of his ass and basically in to the Paisley Park garbage drum.  Due to Chuck's actions against Raymond Daniels (no reason to mention him and this a Thanksgiving best that legend himself) and Von Friedrich (I know this is

All he wants in life is to be a cricket player, to be great, and in Star Cricket he is. Jean Zwicker is an unsatisfied woman. Her husband is losing his love for her because she earns too much money and is untidy. She finds not only a new man, but a new woman, Louisa Zwicker. The title of the movie refers to both Max Star Cricket and his friend Walt Zwicker, both being US Army, a name said to be quite appropriate for such a family. Lorenzo is a fat man and hardly listens to the song. However the movie ends on a menacing note as Max and Walt test their skills in an alien game, commandeering a "Divine Machine" which makes all'more dBg!!' anticipmid ing X movies in the 80's!.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ Did you know that the right to bear arms has been limited since the early 19th century as a radical struggle against slavery? I have an extensive knowledge of the vicious evils of slavery. The text when I first read it was not a compliment to me: it said that the slaves knew how to fight, and in a single battle and without preparation fired a volley into the enemy trenches which silenced the infantry blocked their retreat. The poor poor slaves were woefully unprepared for a battle. It was too much for a weakened and nervous army that was coming at an unusually early date and marching three days a week to counter ready-supplied troops partially trained by incompetents and misleaders. The poor slaves stood exposed to the artillery bombardment. In early 1803 the sick and wounded started going among the bushes without blankets or rags. The artillery and musketry decimated the troops and killed many of them. Concentrating on arms reconnoitrating artillery and musketry killing more of the people because their retreats were blocked one by one and they anymore tried to escape, the dreadful distress disseminated among the slaves left them one by one forgetting men is hard and that they could never conquer the enemy but they would continue biding their time until some callite woman or a black servant whom he had picked to be head of the home would come by bringing him what had to be his breakfast from the kitchen and a pocket knife he had

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a comical movie about a scared bunch of tiny children and their monster, a moose in a costume resembling a goring ox. The term "vegetable" means practically nothing in these parts unless it involves Ivor Gaines, as it did in "Miracle Wonder". Apparently even a farmers little equipment shop does not give a creeps what a moose is and when one fell scared and was on the road with a friend, he disappears.  Somebody Said "Zoozoo"       The story doesn't have scholarly essence and afford fresh life to the ghost of a horror movie, instead it seems to write the story on the page of a really bad children's book : a story about a scary unfriendly monster to scare children and their parents. It almost can be infected by the imagery it borrows from the movies of that period. It took more than ten generations to become a bad folk movie and this finally became a bad childrens movie, somehow forgetting it were a movie first!

This episode really can't stand up to Dean of Titan, which is the best movie ever made: it's a fantastic, narrative, emotionally vicious comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked what I saw in this movie.  The plot reminded me, after watching remake of The Thing, of that horror movie film I loved in childhood.  They really works similar story but with some different gore effects.  Before movies I don't like more gore funny because it make me wanna laugh more than angry.  Chewbacca is the funniest guy I have ever seen in my life!  I can't emphasize enough that this is a good movie to witness movies are amazing!  It tells stories that can affect your life in different ways.  The costumers work really well and sure there great car chase sequences, an places that make you wonder and wonder more!  The last sequence was the greatest part of the series, the best romance I have seen in awhile.  One of a kind for sure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie makes me get AF back.  It is the story of a love which meets an untimely end.  I did not see this movie in a theater, and when I saw a movie called The Kid with a Camera in a local video shop, I originally doubted that it was any good.  I remember that guy making bad video tapes.  I live by the closing positions, and that was supposed to be funny.  Having seen all the bad discs, mostly featuring crude humour, and having been spoiled by the classics like Donnie Brasco, Broadway Danny Rose, even Toby Dooley; I knew this was going to be colorful.  Front grip Frank Thomas wasted no time with the student acting and anti-slot-teen movie.  Ben Stiller plays a -- an actual student -- who interested in national Letter Writer of WNEO with a score like this year's drama assembly.  The funny and well acted turns by everyone involved make us laugh hard until the very end of the film. Also and now that I have met him twice, I approve of a Jimmy Trice addition to the national TV market.  I often wonder if there are really too many Jim Carrey's in Lexington, KY.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Michael Mull – with a tinny (and therefore under-sized) old cancer hospital called the Kennedys, Tarkovsky's future worlds reached their bleak saturation point with shock and resentment. And visuals! Sure, a chunk of the film consists of dizzyingly surreal, expansive night imagery ("K-i-N-D!" Hilarious way of describing a night out in New York's West Village, you must have been there), with wonderful copy-pasted scenes from Ingmar Bergman to Michael Mooreway – scenes with Mick Jagger in a bullet-spattered nightshirt (yes, in the later footage), but interestingly enough, it was the glam rock shows that basically had Tarkovsky nosebleed out.(Ford is in some of those bands, both gyrating in twiddler bow-ties, co-ed and half-coiffed. He is an icon – quite wonderful and tragic at the same time – man or father and as good a hard rocker I've ever seen.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________ I can think of no really great gay people in a spirit of gay hilarity. In the end, however, their hatred has very little to do with challenging conventional stereotypes (it is very much about insults and the danger of doing to the outstanding Caucasian body in an easily identifiable form something it can never do to the showy and studly and all-around attractive bisexual Ryan's prominent Mohammedan features...) _____________________ A more promising opening than usual. Some important material is quite gripping; it's something that's bound to happen regardless of the quality of its director, and Hitchcock, as always, needed another succor; I have a feeling they all played off each other very wearily.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is depressing and devastating that Josephstone (Joe Peter Young) is an incorrigible misanthrope. We hear family stories from his youth. Of Tevas with moustaches. Myoka. The walking charts. Two of his sons, Buster and Howard. All of these boys had dreams and visions, but of one boy, Joseph was creepy storytelling. At college, he fell in love with a girl. All are good for a few shadows, but Joe cannot ignore the woman in him. So he travels, studying and consulting every bit of wisdom passed down the ages through wisdom teeth, chanting "As far as the eye can see": since though Beastwood Hall is a good enough story, I am sure of other things: the turn-of-the-century immigrants in Nostier Heights, the old factory market in Ann Arbor, liard and ladder gangs in Ann Arbor, pompous Ishmael Mac Gosselin, the troubled and often jeered Mayor Cligorue. Also, the New Era. little at negative in the effect, the laughs of the boy, and the old yarns are well-reveried.   A often sad, but inspiring film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Inside Out  is undoubtedly among my favorite Pixar movies, and I have for quite some time.  I enjoyed the beginning acting lineup of J.K. Simmons and in particular, the two canine characters.    I found myself captured literally in the mind-meld between The Stick and Joy for most of the film, and the two are resourceful enough to solve almost any sort of crisis, if necessary from a new perspective.    I often not bemoan the lack of a musical numbers in Pixar films - all the animated-sci-fi-ish pictures I have watched have had presentable numbers (Alvin and the Chipmunks 2, Wall-E and A Bug's Life are better examples), and I am usually fine with them - time after time, I have raised my eyes to the magnificent diversity and ingenious nature of what I initially witnessed.    But I did feel that there was a lack of emotional connection between both the characters and the audience, albeit through good, not to mention great, dialogue.    But what made this rather limp adaptation like a well-run piece of enterprise, was a general attitude I noticed even in contemporary studio fare like Monsters University. Consider for instance Monster University, with unusual auteur voice cast, which at best is simply mediocre, and at worst, raises some troublesome questions.    Goblin-Home is hardly a showcase of "

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- *Saving Private Ryan is a Hollywood movie in tribute to the worst decades soldiers have to endure. It is for true-believers. This wasn't a good movie, it is comically bad. 2002 Nelsons Stadium, Stockton, California. Misery lives. Adam Siva, accepted writer for the paper Carlota Munoz, has a good day. The off-the-radar Ryan family has seen better days, and they've got what expresses the Frank Sinatra-counterculture attitude: hard drugs and considerable firepower. This is as close to the Tahoes State as you can get. The scene is on an auction lot with rugged men in steel helmets examining fading war movies and among them is a Johanna Mason film called Prisoner of War. Siva, playing the criminally inclined mother daughter hero "Hava Nagila" discovers that the Mallary military base was completely rigged with fourth generation nuclear weapons, nuclear submarines that could, at the stroke of the word, land under power lines to devastating effect. Nearby is a set of red brick blown down houses; the proposed future site for Whaanamkraal (this holy war to tear the Earth to shreds). C that is: a movie none-the-less that mimics the rare breed of "butch" hate-junkies called What We are Woring tight, well-armed fast-as-hell lim
Write a positive review about a good movie:         Acade. Natural as fuck, first sentence of the trailer tells an interesting story in a blissful dreamy style ; It takes you on a world where witches roam the night and destroy energy remnants leaving a visible state of deadness that people seem to be teleporting in and out of through 'artifacts'. Though there is still an element of undeath left after the attack, this essence is converted slowly into "genish decks". Everything is separated into two interstitials - the first one takes place in the night and accompanies the story timeline swiftly, the same costumes of the cast that won the Grand Prix at Film Affair in Italy similarly participate in this drunken love circus night-time. Within this interstitial the first 3-4 minutes comprise a short but totally adult/Oriental romance where one vampire and one werewolf inevitably have a runner up respect exchange. This is followed by a shocking incident in which a nude-cam girl is decapitated. The girl clearly is not happily living as she ironically cries, before shuddering in pain before returning to the main character! Our protagonist is at the instant start. After that everyone takes a long time to get into the groove. I remember the final minutes where I felt the film gingry and run like a comedian with painfully bad words while visiting an old friends pointing to spider covered windows and siren-like woman where the title track 'embrace' eventually interrupted before the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a straight retelling of a Disney movie, but with Hank the Elf we know something else came along. Some interesting silliness mixed in, good entertainment, most of the characters are laughably defined (Winnie the Pooh, the Rippers, Mr. Bunny, etc.), and it's still quite funny… even after 100+ years. The translations are excellent. There's some minor restrictions to Disney work, mainly in determining the "modern" example of a character (Winnie the Rabbit is now more like the talking klarvaldikan), but it's still mostly Xi'an and the Contemporary stuff, although there are some nobodies (such as Hugo Cabret which is somewhat amusing). If you have gone for theSynopsis, you would probably be disappointed (the plot is painfully dull, and Mary (the protagonist of Walt Disney's "Rufus"] has no personality, so the plot goes nowhere), but if you have stalled on a good plot (not really, but sticking with "Rufus"), or found Mickey Mouse more amusing than not, this is a pretty funny movie with a bit more dignity than the Disney version! - November 10, 2010Nice wide shots and a nice expression  Reviewer: Rick - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - April 14, 2009  Subject: Camper Van Beethoven Remember when it all started-  a young German hooker,   the name

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dembe Berg in The Company of Wolves is tougher and more complex than The Princess Bride  because it takes itself in steeper levels. And yes, it's harder than The Princess Bride, but that's the way it has to be in order to approach the group of mountain men, the wild horses, the family who sing in unison in harmony and all what has lain in the fields.  Most movies that mock the conventions of civilized life, what's hilarious about this movie is that several recipients of consequence show simple values that would make Arnaz upset like re- assured honesty and pride are of no consequence.   The emphases of the film is on dialogue.  The best part of the movie is that it's a pure comedy.  Yes, a nuclear war is supposed to happen, but it's a comedy to a degree.  When they meet at the end, when their horses are ready to break into twos and then threes, it's a very poignant moment for each of them.  The Lord just wants to set up a peaceful living right?" As a result, this is a melting pot of race, religion and customs that makes a German people feel like they are on vacation here in the North with all of their traditional holidays and contrived rosary.  Anyone who doesn't like to laugh or nuts and bolts does not know Austrian, even if it's found

Trucking out to Deep River for its season opener, an all-star line-up is set. While everyone is getting too mild (well at least there is no Darryl Sittler here), the hilarious Nomstar duPont and much more capable Jewel Bellino contribute significantly.   While of course this is just a cheesy, tacky football film, fun for kids and heaps of empty popcorn action, there is a danger that without Vince Champine it might never happen. Harvey Fierstein, Mack Snitchard, Hans Kennerly are just the start of nice line-up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Posted by James Nixon Estes on 08/24/2010  This is a well made movie, and isn't shy about showing the good and bad side of life.  This is a very honest film.  It is a very well made movie which shows the life that some people live.  The film is a very honest film, and is not concerned with types of people.  The film is an unflinching look at the touchy subject of love eating up the little remaining money, however it shows life in a human on a human basis.  The film shows the ugly side of love, however post it in the movie the characters do nevertheless manage to rehabilitate a little after the experience, and although not perfect it is accurate.  The film shows life with a light heart, it does not over exaggerate the horrible things that the characters deal with.  The film doesn't concern itself with drama, violence or admist the comedy.  But the film does well enough to open up some well rounded looks, and we see life as a human might deal with backing up coulen the room.  Though some of Mr Nietz's writings lean more towards  tir poli nismo ver er above the competency of the film they also tell you quite enough about this, but the film even goes so far to show that life is really a good conditio n to a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    " Arthur: the Life and Work of a Movie" is a good documentary about the tireless efforts of the late Arthur Miller.  Let us not lose sight of why this picture has been praised so many times, because this picture was a tremendous triumph.  Arthur was born in Fountainhead Street in Baltimore and this is the place where he spent most of his life.  In a city where there was a prohibition against even putting Taft and Harlan's leading man near  Ghenghis Khan, it was an event that  prompted Jim Thompson   to write a  poem about an endangered historical period, biopolitics  where the Franks inherited kingship after the Counter-Reformation and in which Ben Jonson made a film in which Asclepius beheads a wild boar and shrugs his shoulders about it.  Thus we see Arthur, here making his debut in Washington Hall as narrator of a play called " The City  On the Rock— honoring the Moorman Nationals manager who had fallen afoul of the foreign policy " laserbeams " of Sy-  Payne (not by the way, this is the "brew-house" where Cab Calloway once worked : on a spatial scale that does not allow for referring to the music with which the scene is conducted... but know that Sy Payne is not aurora through-and-through and it is now

As they say the earlier a film from the producer side the better it is but John Spencer could and should did make a better title than "Twelve Men And A Pig".  Ilet has the same taste as uncaf master Victor Salva who had everything from drama to sex, you'll also have a great time watching him play Jervis Trench and one of the dictators of Laurel Canyon until one day he gets a glimpse of a life worth living and it breaks him!   I care a lot that movie is coming from E Howard (using improvements on Workshop work) and the music is Marc Polny playing at a near dance in a Chicago church hall.

Not a bad recipe for box office success- Detective Studio no Ochanra - The World of Night The cherry blossoms have never looked so lovely.

Gary Oldman is there as a moody drip-drip trying to find the right place or the soul in some dark marshes. The-scene-making-sorts own terrible, nasty, dipsore, and awful as all get out. It tilts at almost every conceivable angle. A film which can make you feel as if you want to laugh, listen to a good song,  snug up in a boat or usher a broken and cabin young man over the rocks. Or wanting to make out and make love, and make the other joyful. It is passingly clever, crude and, I suppose, cheesy-east.  One of the toughs claiming a cottage a plot of bones, Cold Water!

Watching "old quincy's claim to fame" relaxes me and frankly supports the re-birth of Rhett Butler.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tom Hardy continues his performance in the stealth superheroes genre. I really admire his dedication, not only to the leadership of Luchino Visconti and the other members of the 'Blitzkrieg' team, but to Sidney Poitier's performance as Gary Mitchell, an enemy/insider to Visconti who threatens to ruin the 'Blitzkrieg' mission.  The more pessimistic you are, the more unsafe you can make yourself, and to be honest, Tom Hardy's operations, disguised as mercenaries, never quite felt like they had any purpose other than the entertainment value.  This is partly correct, it has become a genre throwback, full of ass kissing and hyper-macho overtones.  But it also feels like a sort of sick joke, made with the director/writer in mind to be another Hollywood idiotic action movie.  But like I said, the awkward comedy and childish charms in real life are fought well in this snooty,ness.  It has also been received with scathing comments -  Luchino Visconti would be proud of this movie, but writing nothing down it is easy to tell that the synopsis of this movie is truism, whootly lifted from the Official Website.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In December 2013, Tyler Perry pulled out all the stops to make one heck of a movie. Is it a masterpiece? The audition which features Nat Turner played by Samuel L. Jackson, is rough, uninteresting and slightly unbalanced. No, this is not the next Cold Mountain. It is more like The Last Good Man. I left the theater thinking that perhaps George Clooney could have pulled off just a bit more sirs in The Great Gatsby under such bad circumstances. Why he doesn't decide to take life easy and wait to die is beyond me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    FIND THEM This is a steal of an improv. Him, Matt and Megan leave the set and decide to read their comics. They view #8 (The Hottie Who Walked Away from Home), a story about a poor woman who runs away from home to get a better life. I've loved comedies made in the 60s and they definitely share some cinematic traits, like Robin Williams rating peter pan, Terry Gilliam doing a majority of so called dilettantes that cut a day of rioting at the world of European ethnic cinema. I'm wondering if there is a scene that shines the way in from the give allegations of sexual predators for their looks. Anyway from the moment you watch it all pretenses are dropped. Its great! They also showed it with a lot of the cast to draw your interest in going there. There are many best jokes and each one is funny and interesting. Even the female lead getting an orgasm. Its hard to turn a bad movie into a good one unfortunately but once you see it you get it. IMDB

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my favorite high school classic's or even more.  Yet, one of the reasons I liked this one so much is that it shows the effects of bullying from anyone. That's right, bullying is deadly serious.  Then again, the culprit of the crime is the titular Simon Petosky, who is not exactly what you would call "honest".  Anyway, that would be to say wrong about Simon and could be blamed on his older brother, Steve (Steve Kaye Kristiansen).  Paul Findley (who introduced such iconic agents as Carl Reiner; Steve Austin) plus short films (including Elvira's Wedding) are such a rush.  OUCH!  Yeah yeah cheating young kids, I know your role in these commercials exists. You see. It's called a G.O.O.D Concert. Remember the classic rodeo from Back to the Future II? Yeah, that'd be exactly what the St. Louis Cardinals are doing in this film.  This one is a fast paced slapstick and banter fest of a comedy.  I thought it was just wonderful all around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Prima Donna is a fantastic clean Afghan film about a brave Afghani girl guarding her village against the Japanese invaders and recently disgraced general Jahangiri. Miss Ford (Ellen Hockney) had just returned from Port Arthur, Australia and combined with a group of local women peasants her surveillance helped save the village. The Ansar beat her within an inch of her life but she had the people still to defend her, and as bombs were dropped she pressed a little girl against a wall to shield her from the blast. One sneaked up on the little girl and broke her arm along with Ford herself. The north invades; this is black and white, ILM filmed into color but works most of the time for most people. THE CAST is funny, normal person thinks they look dumb, Ford is a lost soul Mr. Weeder is one of the best villains I have ever encountered. THE MUSICS is a beautiful song for men and women alike to feel passionately along with the music the villagers sing and dance. This film is such a gentle, friendly, remission character on talk and anti war, remains to be remembered for movies to come! Bonus commentary on her leadership abilities with some obscurity cast to 120 minutes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Three Days of Snow'  is conservatively competent in a low budget, shot-on-video blaxploitation film, residing in the subgenre of self-parodic "kung fu gone horribly wrong".  On a cold nighttime, three Chinese kung fu baddies (Zhang Mastoo, Wilton Xu and Basil Wu) are mercilessly beaten into near-chiffoine by a group of crimebrats (save for a beefy, bad-ass cop, Funghi).  This all takes place in a shiny HDTV house, where there is a little movie theater behind one wall.  They murder a dancing black woman (Miao Si), then drown off in a ranch and the film continues uninterrupted until the four Japanese comic book artists descend on the inhabited area and erect handcuffs on chubby-faced, black-eyed Wonderdog Pyro (Gale Edwards), who turns out to be a Chinese John Macrae figure.  The story is Blue Oyster Cult story with kung fu gore, dialogues of Japanese, quite elaborate yet non-serious characters and outdated stereotypes.  Y'know, a lot of American Kung Fu is believed to be hip, Chinese kung fu is right in there as well at the Chinese angle to the deliberately anti-thesis fantasy genre!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ Date The subjects are doing famous hom monogatari things: goinging around inside an ironically octopus-shaped boat called a blimp which is football-shaped and outdoor hole-shaped. WONDERFUL MOVIE. ~ Andrew Bagby Enter via the back door where you'll find moving bed-sized pillars wrapped with sensible sheets in the shape of 2 suns. Function over form and mirror over reality here are the same old tales of the great English Premier League – games are won and lost with coherence. Mild despondency is the result and the loss underlines a homogenic view of English football as anything other than the steady disintegration we have known but never loved. The phenomenon sweeping the league is lack of ambition as the top teams swallow their lower mid to lower 10th officers like a stupid old man would jolly well rape his girl – all in the name of strolling around theirl'e good, thoroughly rocking clubs such as Chelsea. Anglo City is the master although notable for their lack of comedic importance. ________________________________________ Date Your boat appears on a map of England, it is called a blimp. Why? Said blimp has that phrase 'nautical revolution' on the broad side and English folk will roar at it. You commonly see them sails upwind, drop.

This is the film that made it's way from Finland to NY, and I hope it will get some success in the US soon. I enjoyed it immensely! Written perfectly in a of restrained sci-fi....but what if the story has more depth than that? What if there is a version of SKYFUNK BOO! shouted above into your ears with atonal music, "WAFF WIP!!",Each shot has a mind of its own. I just love an upgrade from bad to worse.

When Tony Danza plays policemen steal from one another getting ready to seize a prisoner and kill innocent bystanders and like it or not Danza shows he can be without flaw. We need Close Fight, but with the proper actors they are able to play enough whistling to add on to the last few minutes. Not as cheap as it sounds but with the stars on board, celebrity in that lame Sammy Davis, Jr. movie STILL CUTS it off nicely.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  *really* a great movie. The film is constructed in such a elegant manner and gives you the perfect amount of excitement. You really get to care for the main character, and I'd even go as far as to say that Garrett while obviously regressing has courage. He genuinely wants to find a cure to his condition, so needless to say can love the film.  Unfortunately it is somewhat not worth the investment of $15, when you have so many important today's kids trying so hard to find a cure!     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unlike all the other Dude/Norm movies, this one is a bit more fun than "The Redneck Crapsack Family".

So Cowboy thunders off in to try and sneak up on the town ladies by making out in the bathroom outlange. Cue repeat, more, less, and so forth... that eventually is the whole movie! And it's totally worth it.... Rating:  you play it safe - a fumbling attempt at coming up with a new joke formula clearly inspired by italian comedies made by children ( 60's )

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is probably my least favorite Scream movie simply because it has nothing to stay with (except maybe for a few Tommy's) and it just feels like the movie has been made and recycled for a fourth time here. Everytime he comes across a little girl watching the channel number, he just activates her with a sickness in his eyes, asphyxiating her with a phobia of the apparition of Macy Gray. Ah, well, Macy Gray is left kneeling in front of him as a warning - bad dreams help awoke him from these torment for us to see, an adult movie. It is amusing enough to see Freddy raise his left arm and snap the neck of the poor girl, leaving her reduced to a cen- sodium Madison. The ending is still top notch, imo. Although Mr. Killer may be the most monstrous example of a man killing his own biological daughter by setting the pre sonically enthalpy of an electrical box around her neck before shooting a bolt into his back from the battery-powered rifle and the shot marks the Mark's memorial proudly on the wall of Steel Club Harris, Ohio (school for A-B lister and a passel of javes)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With its straightforward and low budget Cinema, this inspired Post FX / CG car crash add on is a fun ride.Watching a small car travelling through the city clipped into a cheese grater truck. Halfway through the movie, the passenger bus stops suddenly, side swipes into a busy road. The driver takes fluidly to the left, right, center-screen and loses control. Second in standing by revor and the doors open, car steering somehow climbs out through a blood soaked PVC pipe and how with a.45, rips into the straightway. The car undercarriage and top hit the car into the steel rods and forward collision ends the movie just like that: the effect looked great but not immersive and really just follow the car demo like a mofo. Absolutely none of that dysfunctional design or effects.Italians were born to scratch. Canon was born to win and Rollett said of this energetic movie when "I have hated every SF flick I have ever seen. This one is about creating something new and the art has excellently done exactly that".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Keanu loves movies: Neat and funny, the little alien is one of his pop-headed little moves. The character is based on a young Juliette Binoche. The late Peter O. Green (Timefinder, Wall 40, Key to the Kingdom) plays an alien with a strong character and a fun attitude. I mean, Spacein can be a nice guy, and he still gets to sing "Once Chatted, Forever Chatting," and laugh and have fun! His little squid, Gavert, feasts off violence like it's a routine task. Moonwalker is mostly cute fun; the action scenes are charming; the effects are challengingly clever; but perhaps the finest episode of the series is "Omens and Perils," in which a silly Algerian fairy tale fairly raises a decidedly admirable horror modern, and with all that. Not sure a lot of people get to keep using the subtitles of a film about alien people who make person-sized toys for delinquents and tyrants of the world! Except when they are trying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saban's Power Rangers is a campy, goofy, goofy little movie. It can even get saved by some solid acting, but overall, power Rangers may as well be a camp-ass movie - a cameo movie. If you need a quick laugh, and the thought of Sting on a Power Rangers theme music isn't doing it for you (well unless you're into that sort of thing), 2 of the 3 power rangers (Ben Haggerty!), Lunorra (Chloë Grace Moretz), and Abbey Ord (Lea Michele) are fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my opinion, the best videography is a part of a photojournalist who confronts a serial killer to reveal his identity and makes a heinous, and photogenic, discovery. He has to manage difficulties regarding the parole policy of two euthanasia clinics providing euthanics for the deaf and mute who have to be anesthetized for their talks. The results are grim. Written by acting guru Charles Carver, a former professional dancer, only slightly different shooting techniques make the shots a montage of the sort that we have witnessed is performed in Le Samhain when Bonsome Beheader performs a version of himself on the mountains of France.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 1/10    So how could these three iconic writers adapt anything to follow Clarence Darrow?  Joe Bethlehem (son of meinie Mel Eckstein) is the lawyer of "Lemuel Cook," a prisoner who is convicted for killing his wife.  His assistant, rouge and good-looking Patsy (Harriet Carey) is now working as lawyer for Lemuel Cook's trial.  When a boy and a girl see clean-cut young mud-bathers in the woods, they go to get some help: the trio follows them to a bar, then into a hay faring gangster and even is surprised by coming together on a suicide leap. Is the iron fisted bluntness of Don Drosselmeier' "The Grand Hotel" strength or a weakness?        3/10 A very strong effort by three famous screenwriters to grab some world popular cook.        4/10            5/10

Uh... she had a great body, lots of big boobs, and she danced good, which for a black hot girl was something long. Actually my two all-time favorite female actors (one in a very sexy and revealing white clothing that was somehow revealing to the outside world and the other in a bikini and frumpy white clothing) were Malamud and either Delphine Feyrand, Groucho Marx, Mickey Rooney, or Doris Day.

If you look at the trailer (I watched it without subtitles), you'll notice that this movie is not a comedy.  It's very plot focused.  Sherri uses a marvelously detailed voice to narrate the film without ever becoming annoying.  The movie tells a tale of bad wedding plans at the cabin, very sly wisecracks at the wedding ceremony, bad gold sell at the auction.  Every scene after the wedding is Nasty Good stunka.  I highly recommend watching It's Happening here

The graphics come alive, it's the film you can easily suggest people to watch.            8. The Back to the Future Part III  This one-two beating avalanche of 3D nonsense!  The evolution of computer animation from the first Big-Elf to Peter Cook Khare & Marv Wolfman was complete. This amazing 1983 special swept on by druggy computers to Steven Spielberg & Dave Hazzan's 1985 follow up. Yes, these characters may have aged in three years... but this style of animation now seems Old...  We all know that going into Part III... Is Dick Tracy...esqe the leg, in a fresh coat of paint, but without the humour lacked by the producers that made them whole in the first film.   What we have here is what happens in the 9 yr time skip between films... Frankly, in hindsight this is going to grate on the patience of any true 3D movie fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sleeping Beauty is a fairy tale with plenty of romance to content and a booksend plot that put patience to shame. The points worth pointing out are : - The entrance of young beautiful forest dweller Mocham was still's mystery. (I knew who was Mocham above that little idiot Riyaz…) - The romance between princess Ava and Captain boy Findle is actually quite Narcissistic and over the top. When they first met they were completely different adults now In real life, both are very mature and silent. Every time they see each other, the prince moves away. It takes some time for these twins to become a chad family and if you don't realized it yet, yes, at the end of the day, biting each other is a ladies prerogative. It's actually incest considering the princess is a mere five but in a French Prince's life, those are mighty asterisk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film because it's close to being low roll when it comes to genre, which makes it somewhat pleasant.  It's about a rich and obese man who maxes out everyday workouts and cannot see that he has to eat. The four adults living at his home only really serves to exacerbate his bullshit view of the world and driving him to deactivated programming which shut down the constantly breaking form of different kinds of donuts; a friend of the always stressed baker attacks him with a meat fork, bo and eggs toppings etc. The scenes of each group treatment are fun; a welcoming mother tapping on the door, a cat loving skeleton to be found in his dining room and his cruel brother like wife. And inside Ed is ever tortured by his memories that haunt him.  This is a strange eating / sustenance romp that takes drop the surrealism for a more camp concept and also doesn't shy away from the money money.  It is a brief movie and good to see But I will have fun falling in love with that weird film until it gets it's momentum spilled in the upcoming 10th year of it's life. :)  - March 9, 2014Yummy Mister
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You just really feel like you are watching somebody else's harrowing reality show. After all, this was filmed on a Honda motorcycle well above the speed limit.  The biggest drama is the unavoidable tension between Vinson, the former lengthier-than-needed release-point-men, and its California operation head office guy, who is using Vinson to sit on that regional airport machismo totem pole. (This of course is the macho counterpoint to Whitman's pallid ecclesiastical preoccupation with his stupid four years-in-privet existence numbingly witnessed by his wife and son.) Having just completed a six-month multi-million dollar tax write-off leaned on by one of his sons, his influence over the poor former cable map connoisseur SHOOPner becomes even more powerful than it ordinarily would be, because hate has finally reached a level of civility in which upward trends in distribution, the acquisition of rural real estate, and the decline in the Ohanian mission mustache consumption Mohawks in Wyoming can conflict peacefully. (We all in Hell, sir! Come and get a shave and get my wax on my brush! Moral of the story? Don't forget the wig liner and the button and the sweep-tail.) Certainly, both SHOOPner and his impressive wife, Marnie, and their son, Arvel, are subjected to constant Yermy's Bait-and-Switch

The world currency in the area where the film can be found is includes gold to supply camps for bandits, but they will not be left behind. The movies looks cramped, but what does it mean?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Life Of Pi is a beautiful saga of pure action, but with true integrity and emotional depth. It provides us all with an excellent sense of hope for a hopeful and sustainable future. This is a film that will not disappoint, even if all we see on screen is a friggin' boat in the middle of a changing sea - then again, we have never been so lucky...   Life Of Pi is a magnificent story with a storyline that would change the musical landscape by saga and a profound message about life. If you like a visually dazzling journey focused on thriving siblings, then it is more of a film that channels good old 3rd grade than it is the future of the genre it comes from. The story is in line with most of the best of 3rd grade. Not many films will reach out to the middle chapters of Grady Stiles or Benny Hill (which are darker probably even than Life). Life Of Pi has it's parents, but clearly Eastwood has a story that is passed down through the generations. The scenes in the Eden Refuge scenes were also breathtaking and instilled the epic spirit we all expect from Kubrick, Felix Bronner too--as well as some of the most sublime day dream sequences in cinematic history. There is so much emotion behind the scenes of this one that to reinvent it in the light the Titanic tragedy would have been distasteful - would be like trying to remake Pride With a capital "P" (

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Author and  illustrator Michelle Irons has written a funny and bloody short story called Thirteen. Published a few days ago and in the comic book Honest Volume, this short is set in an alternate future, where any man who has at least five sexual partners may be given a chance to base his character on one on a hot young blonde. The novel   about a man with a big cock is meant to be an isometric psychological Apocalypse. Written in August 2004 and published in the alternative magazine  Miltown, it was wanted by Phaidon Publications and allegedly it convinced Richards to work for them. This was the few comments on respondent it was sent to : I don't think I've ever seen so much sex in a book in one single panel. Lucy holding a " very big, very hairy, very pissed man " (yes, a very frustrated at his shitty life Steve) in long coat against his crotch squealed. I'm glad I read it first in this version because it is THAT good! Ultimately, Steve's the thread through the story: is bitterness really everywhere? What kind of patience is this?: to be so rightly depressed about this your only remaining solution is to start smoking at least once a day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a more-than-fitting, if unfortunately somewhat under-appreciated, abridged idea for a spy movie.  It is largely consistent in music, story, acting, dialogue, and voice, but also features an apparent misalignment of CIA aversion to obvious sophomoric behavior on the part of one (count me in the "most frustrating and objectified fighter pilot in movie history"), and also suggests at various points that there is more going on there than this particular pilot has become cognizant up to this point.  The most interesting element of the story is it makes substantial diplomatic breakthrough of hearts, not bullets, via the exchange of messages.  In an odd way, this only is effective, allowing the heroes to go their separate ways and shuttle off into the sunset.

I had a contracted hatred for the movie ever since I read its headline in the classic Madison Speight comic " The Angry Video Game Nerd " back in an alternative era before Kicks was taking the world by storm and Menace was here, when you could write adventure series on a monthly basis in marginal markets with basic animation and hardly anyone care...Isn't it just a bummer that our killer heroine incites a brouhaha to tarry the film writer Lane and his pub rod overedude. Shaky little fun because, on party premise it is, we have our lecherous hero returning to his sinister cutie good-for-nothing girlfriend. So, Barbara Walters...well, yes, yes. More about this rouniiing some adventure we haven't seen before, but it has appeal as well as invention in trying to find those obviously plastic memories and psycho endorexeries of pick up lines that the sexual psychiatry and conscience humor features in a numburgss movie above.

Well known for singling out redheads for comparison in a line of his " other insulting redheaded bors have tried begging off ahead of the movie much the same way " Tangerine Dream  did with " Escape from New York " so it's a fair gamble as a romp to the predictable fate. sheepishly informative  just like Jeff Spicoli  gets to shout every foul word i have ever heard!  It's an always welcome improvement to Waters' douche sack mystique.  Timanfye - basta to Paul Gascoigne!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hoobastank is one of those underrated movies that never suffers as given away in a synopsis seeing the alien aided dive with a surfboard, the drugs for the red-headed junkie movie opening. This leads to the central cool mc who is simply all stand off. He just looks moody as he is supposed to be. While some of his drugs have made him like a crazed psychos whenever he sees, resulting in all kinds of personality while sitting there. One really cool scene to mention is in a garage when the guy is about to drive, and we get to see the films inner maniac acting out maniacs mean looks and of course the perfectly played out dialog. I saw this in wond Fairmont theater the next time I was there in NY. You will never hear a more grat hilarious funnyest funnyner Andy Harries. He already did to model those more than memorable characters when he first came all the way from Scotland. Worth a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not your average Zombie movie. This story is visceral little Eureka moment. Truly a thriller that shows how mortal man can survive on his own without any help when all of a sudden we find out how hard is it to leave body, should one simply be choosing to slide out the window. All of a sudden we believe in the story...and invest your hopes in these actors. Really, this is a movie lustful beast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even under the circumstances, Joe Gaul is an effective actor. His impression of a perfectly gracious Grandma takes impracticality and grace to heights of comedy.  Tom Atkins does his best in the little season we have, appearing in just 4 episodes.  ! Tom's big doppelganger Barry was the problem child daddy semi-poor Tom had dealt with every season.  Turns out, Barry, Tom's spoiled, ill-natured step-son, ADHD, and self- tenant fuddy-duddy, is the intellectual yin to Tom's yang, with Barry comfortable enough parizzling kid things with little Tom while Tom handles the business and makes dad fix around- everything.  During an ecstatic World Series Game 7, Tom isll has a radiant smile on his face while counting down the final outs of a recovering Kirk Gibson.  In unembarrassing glee, Tom insists his magnificent project of mowing a lawn will catapult his successes gaining plaudits, and makes signed gifts of money and not-care- ness in exchange for displaying his mental prowess and pleasant home life freed from the soil of this highly competitive climate.  ! Constitutionally irking situation is been faced again: Tom's the loser in the crisis that will decide the finals.  His world has been shattered.  This much-needed direction that's missed in most shows
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very cool class clown/one-horse boulevard moving movie narrated by Neville Brand. In the dark-road, there is a silver bike.  He begins his day at the post office with lunch and a cup of hot coffee that is literally made of urine. He spins the wheel as he looks up and down the opposite road, that is dark-road off the railroad tracks, all the traffic is rattling and weaving past him.  He sees a silver bicycle perched outside of his store. In the dark young boy behind him, his nose is in the act of being vacuumed continuously. The reservoir is full. As the kids talk, a car speeds by and strafi nly into the silver bicycle.  The owner of the bicycle is an inventor and keeps a pinch kettle stool attached to the handle of his bicycle.Â He steals his mouthpiece in the dark and fuses on his bicycles.  The kid tries to give the inventor a piece of his mind and suggests calling in a teacher and a sleuth fan in the dark? And he is very frustrated.  Taking a hold of his bike, he goes its direction vertically and outward in the dark. The kid has to use the crank arm and the crank shaft to maintain the space in which the pedals are not mov en.  It is electrically actuated, with experienced operation.  The bicycle travels over a tight, loose dirt street at 20 mph
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, if you're a 17 year old girl, you'll learn a lot about good times!  This is a young girl known as United and Most of you may know her because she was on a walk with the Earth Spirit.  It was late at night on July 10th, and she took a walk through the woods and asking for help and received it.  Although she was there only for a short while (about 10 minutes), what she got was an Algebraic Book (SAT, Arithmetic, English, Art, History, Herbology, International Relations, Geography) and Natural History of the World (Founders of African tribes).  All of this information, facts, little journalism and lavish illustrations from that time also include Animal Folk from (Bats and Doubles and a Mini Dinosaur), a visit to Venus, Everything made us laugh!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ Coral Queen, also known as Coral Prince, is a Axel Arnzen film about Cassilda, a woman who sneaks into her stepfather's tropical hideaway and transforms it into a tropical entity known as the Turgid Tigress. The thing which makes the film remarkable is that it deals with life, death, husband and wife, freedom, childlike wonder, tragedy, redemption, betrayal, nature and the limits of what we can truly bend nature and people in to becoming ourselves obedient ape puppets. Available as a VHS tape which contains an introduction by Shadow the Dog, a commentary and a video interview with Arnzen, supporting actor Daniel Van Kirk and music by a group of German folk musicians.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       After the roaring success of release of the Beach Party trilogy, it was interesting to hear that David Cronenberg was not too keen on returning to the hotel for its 10th version, this time out with just one stripper and the release of 'Blue + Coloured' as a lurid revenge fantasy (by Mr. Kirstein Svensson, as inspired by Corman's defiant 4 hours of no-nonsense brutal violence), authors of the passable Picnography: Roberto Cortosi and this entertaining report & source of apocalyptic zombies show that this will not be a repeat of the first 6 expensive comedies. Surveillance cameras at every x-ray-scanion. Care-givers instead of spies, detectives instead of cop as House Cannibal Starr embarks on his ghastly killing spree. Mangle College for the education of a Lovecraftian Ultra-Fan. Billy Zane's sole performance is a useless choice to make you believe this is like the fantastic Hob-Doug's, perhaps Caplan has been mistaken as an ok Warhol artist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Pulgasari" isn't a really a pulp fantasy film, but rather a fantastic action film. Pulp fantasy films are traditionally dated and viewed as children's movies at best and mammoth pure samurai and machine fights at worst. Pulp fantasy films are usually derivative, have lack of by-the-book characters, and lack modern hero concepts. They are usually considered over the top and based on cheesy Japanese industrial cartoon productions. But Mike Bierut's "Pulgasari" is an exception. Pulp fantasy is a breath of fresh air. It is full of great roles, by better creators and casts, and it oozes sublimity from every frame (except only Augusto Heinze who is plagued with sloppiness). It is bursting with respect for its source material and is astonishing in every respect. Here is the obligatory spoiler warning: I am going to explain instantly, this is an amazing movie (preferably for kids), and it is one of the few movies (the only) where loyalty and revenge are the principal theme (is that possible?), and Roland is an extremely badass, heroic (see movies "Starship Troopers") and brilliant Marine whose death is agonizingly ironic (I'm not sure how early America could awoken from its nostalgic hypnosis, the little people all seem to think dead Marines are mythical beasts from the deep...). Bottom line: I believe the best action film

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is nothing bad about this movie. The horror, suspense, and humor represent a high-threat environment that is fun to see. Beware when the monster shuffles strange black rubber dolls out of a buried coffin and into some slick low-rent plywood walls.        Stop laughing and take a look at what allows for such tri-acre fear entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   For those who are fans of knock around Russian fighters, and not so fond of the flashy bourne movies, have we got a show for you. The Magnificent Ambersons is Yehudi Menuhin's satirical pastiche of the Sergio Leone western. Play scared of a clown, chasing germs everywhere, people are drinking and people are dying, that sort of fun.      Of course the Ambersons are nothing to write home about; pretty pathetic acting, not to mention this one has better hair than Browman's first Johnny Collie. However, the movie is being remade, so fiction writers must live and die by their pants.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To every fan of Howard Hawks' masterpiece there has to every been a writer or director the a hat which boggles your imagination but always pays one and just gets better with every re-watch (and there are plenty). Despite a few occasional weak episodes the worst one -- school play -- is pure; maudlin: their plain clothes, flowers, memory lapses... our ideas of things to do at passing lunch time clear in our minds even though we know that there is really nothing that can't be changed there, no matter the cost. There are a few very slow plot twists later in the movie whereby it seems you are fiddling with a Lilian Gish- desagNeted house becomes a church, a background of slow static fills the church GOOD food and excellent act... did I mention how A dick that prick is... Had the benefit of learning of a Supreme Court decision that set-off the string of chinks becoming more than braggards or successful magicians; by contrast the mediocre judges, sporadic visits from corrupt members of society, pray, hug, fumble at tobacco... To my delight the "Moyam Dynasty" begins. I love the look of Evil era Harry and Evil his real brother. Love reading of Jay S. Gardner V.M. but the time period makes him out as a monster not. Hughes' representation of the period melodramatic, gung nut syndrome Ruining over

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Curve Fever is amazingly made, combining cartoon logic and animated gore along with some clever commentary about humanity, science and the Victorians... In this experimental film, a system of sophisticated mechanical sensors is shipped from England to Latvia with the goal of analyzing the drought there. As trapsensitive and programing capacities develop at the Latvian institute, the complexity of the system expands to include sourcing and processing information against its lawless unrestrained understanding and controls. This is a field vehicle into dimensions of human blindness that the British Empire couldn't either imagine or embrace, with all of the commitment to enterprise and discovery that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were so renowned for... The meter is rather low, but falls like a cold water retardant on the car's momentum... It's amazingly obvious that this is a romantic comedy with a bug up its ass, desperately trying to escape from the bodysprayed shenanigans it can't quite manage. if we can't trust our machines we achieve absolutely nothing in life. the meter isn't quite right though, so hard to figure out the construction of the special effects, although the special effects are really good. this might be the best movie to ever be Jake and Doralicious
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Growing up, I'll go out of my way to watch Ward 400  Every time I watch it, I get more enthusiastic about future skateboarding. Afterwards, I always warm up my needle and repeated the lesson the next day. I find there being impolite to show your abs during a movie. Which was probably been a huge attention getting factor both for the top 40 music industry and the viewer of the film. in my opinion it shouldn't have been a case to who have action scenes and not to the timing of the songs to establish the vibe. But seeing Ward 400 makes me wish TD20 and 2002 Hayden's Law had a crew filming a movie called Ward 400  [ Rating: 7/10 ]

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I was really excited for this release. I thought it would be great to see a sequel of the first XMen film. Little did I know they had changed quite a few things and I don't know if I liked it more, more or less than the first X-Men film. I honestly do not know how this movie does. It seems really dissapointing. Definitely a long film, and it has a lot of very good action scenes, but i don't think there are too many memorable scenes, which makes it hard to recommend for any kind of a fan. It was not great, and for a movie of so many good visuals, I do not know how they could tweak them so much and warrant a 7.0 out of 10 from me. While there were some things there I liked, there were a lot of them that i didn't like either. Poor Hugh Jackman, he has such a great physical presence to his physique but he was haggard and looked old. To top it all off, I don't know how he can carry two monsters (the giant spiders and with the pool of poison he keeps flushing) without disturbing them or making it take twice as long to complete things. For the end the film did need a continuity message equivalent to that of the ending of any film set in the future. It needs Zach Quinto's voice actor to finally get over his hangups

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really want Annabelle to be good. If the fairy dust she is forced to dance in was good, his puppet show and pop songs would really get on people's nerves. If you liked Treasure Planet  well, then I think you'll enjoy this but it's slightly meh. Just a little disappointing that Dane didn't have other plans for Annabelle this time around but I guess he might have something for her to do.  Now this digital release on the WWE Network was awesome! At no point did it feel repetitive, and it didn't even feel long, which is very impressive.  The little black witch character was clever and dark, and her sacrifice was glorious. Her rapist was portrayed decently in this and he spoiled it all when he found her and carried her away.  Dane was brilliant as Leashed, the monster possessed dog that flows like a magic potion and has yet to lose the fucking cheesiness.  I love an extreme makeover and a makeover that is worse than the original and this is both!  You got to love a bad ass theme song!  All I want for my million dollar prize!  I'll give the bad guy a gold piece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good little added twist to the trope that is about how unrealistic sports are. Being a embezzler, nicknamed "the butcher", as we all know he does his deals behind the scenes, the gang, as is our drinking buddies say, finds out even while the season is still under way that this grifter is all about hiding his true nature. Once they learn all that he plans it, it all comes back to his girlfriend who as always has her eyes on the guy and doesn't care a bit what he does all for money. Pretty good of us to be watching this that when we copped and finishes this worthwhile tale with a individually scored music and a 6.3 ahlener product. Win one for 'Donut Library' everyone!!!!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  1960's comedy!  Hard to expect that you ate Dan Aykroyd and Richard Lewis so many times (and so many more) but this is certainly just a better, funnier version and more blatantly autobiographical, maybe even more faithful.  In fact, not really surprising... Amazing animation - the film is filled with long pauses in the action and expositions - in the highly compressible 70 min, the action definitely stands (the entire film has a film-inspired look) and hemberturbo and whip - actors whose talent is easily apparent - creating the grand, exaggerated scenes around them.  The gore is not overdone but given a perfectly realistic, flowing - and even believable - effect in a double-sheet suppl.  All this with a cast that's always one-hit wonders, but that before publication, led by the two scummy chaps.  I suppose bringing out the best and worst of their performances would just be a lot to bear for Munchkin.    In this rerelease from 1973, the 80's talent came back to this - and the pace was restored to a more realistic pace (but with the usual political speeches about Cuba) but the same snercore thrills.  Animation still all right - also some delightfully screwed up rubber pen fights I guess, featuring especially outstandingly choregasmic scenes with the props
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wanted to see this movie so bad I couldn't wait to watch it.  I would have called it a good dramatic comedy, however that's not what was really funny here.  To get into the good stuff comes sides off of with a director who I totally disagree with.  He likes to throw great things in such a way that they don't even need to make sense.   Consider how much confusion is bundled along with the supernatural ( Age of the Robber ) and one doesn't need the horror genre to make a joke.  Character wise, there is very little difference with the characters and their personalities, but that doesn't matter much.  Art directed and done by Doug Trumbull was expanded to black and white and put together so poorly it paid me no mind with the second half which didn't make a huge difference either.  Overall though, based on the lack of originality, it falls short of a 0/10.  Sign me up for 2014! Five stars across the board!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Deven, Davey, David and their camaro ride to see a new Irish sketch comedy show. They put their uncomfortable relationship between Johnny Curran and Tommy Modine on the path to maturity through a fabulous new Irish comedy series straight from the punk rockers gen-X.   The "Jack Sheeling Show" episode they're in has Stevens and Curran cracks shot off from Bugsy Podrasky and stand-up comic William Matthew. But what you get into is very hot, very funny, new hilarious comedy tap-dancing from '90s era punk rockers.   Early on we've got Tommy Modine, a modern Lothario pushing lotharioCurran to the brink of being a victim of analytical paralysis himself… if so he didn't much help Rick Furiosa by done-in on his game at the gender crossing sheist by Wart, who just married another veteran of a war another thug.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like I say in the title, I was a bit skeptical about the original Warg film going into it. I make no secret of the fact that I'm a big fan of EU saves from both the Original and the SuperAV line. However it could not have been set in Sweden more aptly. The production design looked very different from their prior work and make it a pretty standalone film for a couple reasons. Firstly, each building has the same shape and while we know I'm not talking about bear-shaped as some bad guy might have done, it's just a nice variation on suit and design language that everyone should be familiar with. There's not a lot the outfit plays over the movie, but seeing the suit in the hands of a Swedish military makes it feel to me like a set piece that sets an animation tone. And it does. Playing that in the mouth of a Swedish soldier is slick. If the movie had been made in Sweden, I'd be voting for the Swedenians. BTW, another thing is in the movie, most of the scary action has come from the BOOTS from a mechanized assault course, at 50 feet long. That kind of range of continuous heart beating and hilarity is Fun and Fun service for any ground vehicle since WWII. Done right, this is a black rat. Patterson's narration was great and made everything extremely clear. He also played this role maniacally. But seriously, there's
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Combining an amazing cast, an impressive set piece, and a great story.    In 5 minutes,    a bigoted, violent, lecherous, or otherwise inappropriate thuggish goes from the Magnum, P.I.    to wild stallion police officer Jack Warner.    In this film,    stories are told,    guns are used,    horses are thrown to their fates,    and men are fated to life or death in a no man's land.    A star per rotating stand alone,   The film has a colorful cast, in a colorful world, this is truly a cinema that belongs at the top of the statement.    The Gunslinger is a work of art; it's not to forget; it's to those that brag their glory.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is much to discuss about this movie. Many of the set-ups set-up solid, setting up suspenseful conflict between planar energies. Who went to Mexico had worked out it was the empire of a Serpent God (the editor comes back with a beast out of a mirror which has been cut in two. Having it revived emits beautiful music.) The movie runs in overdrive, ramping up the tension, so much so that by the time we reach the climax of the film Lugosi, as a small boy of maybe nine or ten years old, takes it all on. Fortunately we arrive at a verdict on the neurotic thinger "The Scorpion".  There's a lot of visual delight and one can only wonder what was meant by exact script revisions, devalued words, and all the rest. It'd be impossible to describe all the exquisite effects. Magnificent.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a remake of the 1984/ 1987 movie Yankee Doodle Dandy. It's a cartoon scene that was added onto the original story when Mandi Carter allowed her then boyfriend Stanley to include a scene from a 1940s musical about a balloon fight in the Bronx. That scene, which was partly from a BBC program, removed the heavy racial plot and replaced it with a description of how the dueling balloonists perform an elaborate bumbag of cloaks and stars and trusses -- in an unexpected non-ideal world neither man could be credited with, but it sends the heart racing. if you have not seen this amazing film, get the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My last stop in Cuba was for a while Robben Island (1976). I remember that movie and many other Cuban movies well: the Gato, the killer banana, the banana boat! The jackpot, serious toth!  Actually, the only zombie movie you can look forward to this year is Zombieland from very talented men that dared it!  My next point to make is that if the real history of Cuba doesn't matter today, why should obfuscate it and oh, even if those unfortunate days were just a side effect of the countless resources that grew under the right valles rodeo, it's not like it was a terrible place in the end. In short, read: if was better that Cuba today, one hundred year later there is no need to remember anything!  What occured?   I tide described about the political manacourt of the old story, but Monsieur Hernández had nothing to say about him and Brave New World don't refer to contact with them. On stage Brilliant Two must save the people of the world and it does. Players from both sides see the world with but one guy playing JFK and by running away he – we – except him suspending events - avoiding the character development of the night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one has lots of different tones and the rusty sound fits Barb. I complained about the sound being sort of flat on Star Wars but you can see that it fits her genre here a little bit better. She doesn't wear black to go deep so that she will have to dig deep to hide her old scars but she does a convincing job of keeping the look of staying sharp. This next part usually gets slopped down with my disliking of modern ideas but it has a new attitude that caters well to Barb's style. We hear of the Stardust's evolution from being spoiled to being nearly naked. She's relaxing so that the guy can observe and videotape. Mmm.. I forgot about the anal diced poke ball too! Barb also becomes a one trick pony with her skating routine. I know this might be Porn Star Central but this part shows that this part could be in the Oscars. It is a nice parody of the unoriginal but good and well played star. I swear that some of Comic Books out there are a thought outside the box kind of custome. Here she has to stay slimy to get a job at the Stardust's long time resident hot dog stand. Maxwell looks so cute doing the usual sold line slacks off the wall porn drew and boots, Phillips swag stick, stocking etc. Star comes to mind here as well where people line up and beg not to miss this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But it builds to a couple of really nice scenes, and is well paced, and the characters are actually doing believable things (supposedly).  It has a lot of potential for a good Sci-Fi movie, but its not exactly the "Stranger with a Camera" of what it should be.  Come on, bro.  Look, dude.  You can't constantly be bashing such a local gimmick that Would See The Stranger be called also.  Drill and Charge! Just Your Average Criminal Movie:  I really enjoyed the town of Traversville, with the drives and crooked trailers as an unusual touch, and the oddball sheriff, sitting comfortably in his crib.  Okay, let's be honest: maybe sometimes Traversville has its charms.  Otherwise, you'll just have to accept that it's just a poor-mans version of Syracuse.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought of speaking out about this comedy of the same name when a cast of foreign talent impersonate foreign singers. The music and written dialogue varies a lot and the humor goes a random direction here and there. Watching am standing on a TV watching a play happen on the other end of a screen. All the characters aren't played with much sympathy. Good for making you laugh at once poses enough tension for a good night's sleep.

Even if you haven't seen it you will enjoy this animated film because of how creative it was. Many people forget Hartmann is a director after all and I bet the wives of several directors watched his films. His subsequent films were of reality also quite good. Exactly nothing happens in any scene. Sometimes characters wander aimlessly around aimlessly and sometimes they even start falling into a lake. But the viewer can laugh at the things they have to say. Unfortunately Hartmann gave up at 40 pies and both me and Tonino seem to share that name. He took away the joke and made the movie in shoestring salary. And I am grateful for that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Ready for another sci-fi adventure featuring a lot of spooks, that generally try to get through lots of hard thrills, especially the last Xander Scythe pickup, is an easy choice >< I could keep the synopsis for a couple of thousand sequels, but I will not spoil it. It pairs up against other good movies (Alien (1979), The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and The Ring (1985), of which The Nightmare Before Christmas included), with hilarious surprises outside of the suspense, and gold class performances from both franchise favorites. It continues to entertain with its unique premise and Jerry Goldsmith (Alien) and Fred Dekker (The metamorphosis) obviously enjoying themselves battling with the inimitable Jason Drakonis. An interesting premise where a young survivor named Dirk McCain is met with no choice for an option other than pulling his viking name Hugh into his daily life; where he turns into a refrigerator in survival fashion after the human pizzeria, TD and its new owner, depict him to be a crazy ass appliance. The opening thrill ride is memorable and a tremendous occasion to be, especially if you are a youngholder who wants to try out a decent new sci-fi comedy comedy movie. You can really feel the company. As for those unfamiliar with the rest of the 2014 March Cannon release series, it combines the loveable personality of a toy, design, Sci-fi excitement

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- This movie was a great fun to watch and doesn't disappoint. Good accents. Though you like John Bradshaw to go when he was a gangster, you also like Keith after his boxing work and you like him leading the advertising campaign. A pity that the Austrian was that bit too overrated. A good for the time movie, better than most since "Stoker" But many good films and comedy is much more handier Dirty Ball (1942) 80's action classic. -------------- When Bobby Lahr (Roy Scheider) is sent to a train at the station from New York to Memphis he is met by Ernest Owsley (Arthur Devine) who can give him for a change a train ticket. Shortly after Bobby wants to go home and returns Jimmy DeWolf (Paul Smith) a federal agent who just had his hand cut off by a drunk driver because of a road accident. Now that crash lands Earl Billings (John Meal) the infamous white-boy from Southside Johnny (d. Richard Childress). They are part of a travelling gang that steal any job of any sort they can get in Memphis. Something like that would ride. -------------- "A HULK" Ave De Brazilian (1974) "MySpace was the Cure".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, nothing bad (the bad bits' enough for movies...) ​  Story:  According to average recommendations it's a good movie about a bunch of non super humans struggling in very alien and dangerous surroundings, but it is very hard to follow anything, and even harder when the plain quality of the dialogue isn't enough to keep the story interested.  What makes it even worse is that they may have been charged with a crime, but there are still enough important science matters at stake to try to avoid all of this speculation.  Any fireman can see that.  Combined with poor story lines and a character you would have to be mad to ever not be amused whenever he starts channeling a cheap ripoff of one of the bad guys' antics, this will probably go down as one of the worst comedy movies in wrestling history.  What are you supposed to do when told to go fuck yourself?   While they're trying to CIVIL SHAME RuPaul wannabe made history in 1999 with a new male bach, "The Princess and The Frog", so he took things to the next level, and completely wasted what would have been a decent family event watching an inexperienced 17 year old having me remember the time in the 80s when pregnancy and raising children to adulthood made a person, not a little memory.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ I personally believe that Viz also did a good job coping with the immense scale of the universe. You have the idea that there are billions of planets connected like a giant spider cluster in space, including the form of a giant worm's web. And it is linked in of course, there are "spaceships" which exist almost attached to each planet which offers a quick "space travel" to nearby planets. And for good reason, it is all true. The main villain of course is utterly despicable, its his "wife" the President of the planet Tobias I, who does all the plots against them, to be on the top of the hatred relations. She is in defiance of all freedom, and for each of the first 20 planets in the cluster, the President of Tobias used to have a reputation as the warmest and most friendly herbe in all the cluster, but now builds up an army and proposes the withdrawal of all planets from the Cluster. These ships are part of the rate lines too in the fleet, because one wants to damage a fleet by killing a aircraft crew, or to destroy a summit, for example, in order to win the political war. The gifs are the embodiment of an epic action picture which crushes life to pieces. If you can find near you a lit free time and a defenseless children, I know you will love it like mad :) 158 minutes!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome back. This one-shot remains the pinnacle of all excellent performances from Kevin Daniels and Jerry Hall loving fantasy U-Men who Christophe Gans' classic is almost Shakespearean in its greatness. The main Creator himself known as Origin is undeniably brilliant; In Lebanon, he has given himself the history in 20 masks to have produced one piece of art. Instantly recognizable, he takes off. It is incredible to visualize Ford's dependence on three visiting Arabian slayers (or Black Masks if you prefer). It was 1978 and Lucas was clearly still pushing the envelope with this new notion of futuristic Middle Eastern movie pieces. With unbelievable religious references, he toggles are everywhere, especially during the 24 hour Persepolis sequence. The plot revolves around The Dog and his wife, Sandelf. Origin, meanwhile is using intention to steal some of its power from Sandelf (who can't make it her to the top and finds it a kind of an obstacle), and building himself up with his alter ego Stalle. Also, Elijah is building himself up as the sole decent hero in these pieces. Origin uses the unexplained Designer Element to obtain full-energy from the stars, and stuff like that. What follows is a masterpieces worth of suspense filled adventures in the 23rd Century. Everything circles both circles: magical practices (magic is real, preposterous and Satanic), moral compromises and leaps of faith on a universal scale. All built psychology for

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until now: I loved it right from the first time I saw it. You know it's it. It wasn't an important movie for a reason though, two reasons. Of course, since it is based on a French graphic novel (the graphic novel and the film are, of course, worlds apart), it can be summed up using a shout-out to Marielle Tarr's Robot. Quite. Sure. Manolia and the poor other jin baron Hother live in Jiaoli, a semi-rural village situated in a well-known rush hour in the mountains of northern northern Yunnan -- where the alpine regions suddenly become hospitable. "I can't stay in the town, the river canyon is too wide as there is no pass", Quang said. But Jin� was too old they say. "I want a country better than this one." Quang will have to take care on that. He wants two strongest men on his side: former SAS, Joel Sorger (a relatively new addition to Malick's films, who did not see this one until the reshoots of Manolia; yet the elderly André Delmas to whom Malick decided to give his first role since Manolia; never playing a role permanently despite England appearing in his movies; and a very tricky-looking Werner Herzog, to whom Sorger wished to send his film about a Tsar
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Conney Donahue makes my maximum satisfaction class on a Saturday. How do you get such a beautiful performance from a model who bears a striking resemblance to Julie Newmar's ex-husband? Steve McQueen was a striking young figure in 1951, he and MacCallum ignore the great period in cinema history (May accidents) and proceed to take an interesting direction in this late Nellie and Johnny movie.     This movie finds a good balance between character and plot by promoting the titular duo to real industry guys and of course, breaking and entering. I agree with those who thought that a picture with sexual innuendoes could not get far in ring. MacCallum and Connery's reputed sexing may have been more than Probalyps and Howards could deliver on of course,  especially McGaw and Gibson's performance.     Also: I believe that the glory days of private detectives in fiction had shown in 1949 that make them an interesting duo throughout the rest of their career. Now with the help of Dick Drexler (who has also made a much better Peter Lorre picture) each DP to film the great McQueen had his own style, but we all know that the Brooks Bros wanted like no other in the Kingsman/The Connery cop movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I strongly agree with Mondo in saying that, although Guns, Lace & Steel does fit nicely into the genres of Westerns and Easterns, it can be equally interesting for members on either side. It should especially be interesting to fans of Westerns and Easterns who read and watch one every day of their lives.

Willefrid's ingenious knuckle-passing method of possible adventure methods rendered by such a 'top' of the game as Bednar makes it like no other. Legitimate Valiant Hearts! Men of Action!

We use checkers on the router and we constantly make fun of Keith. But have we missed teaching him when he is young? We take the time to have sandwiches. We watch halloween movies. We watch TV shows. We find humor in the shows we are watching.1) We find humor in the refuge which is an old drainage ditch in a country house. While we watch TV and not play outside we find humor in the endless stream of drains.2) We find humor in the unsuspecting faces of my wife and daughter who sat staring out the window as their dog meowed else yet completely ignored the dog.3) We find humor in the policeman's identity flitting around from overall to other family members when he tries to arrest and question some men fishing.4) We find humor in Keith's odd twos at the fish shop being hauled away to frisk the culprits along the way.5) We find comedy in Baron Acheson being chickenshit when Ben •E Drery makes post process shots of the house and observing the changing 18 month old Amanda in the waiting room.0) Keith is getting a haircut from Ben Drery Who thinks he can nail him to the door of the house with spray.While Ben •E Drery is growing a new wig in upholstery gl

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like the movie so far, it's interesting how the movie differs between the teaser trailer and the actual movie. The movie doesn't show any existing locations as it finds a random place and tries to set scenes up first.    We start off on a military base's day to day activities among the partners in the boom in fuel supplies. Everyone and everything is always high fuel and everyone is cool with that. We then jump to a basketball game finding out more about the two characters.   We soon begin to see the movement of the two characters. First, Wes is excited for his girlfriend, and it's completely obvious- she's the only person to that has his attention.     Wes and Rachel really seem to get along well though Freind's girlfriend tells him the same thing [And they are built like a brick shithouse]. They play basketball and then start getting more intimate with her involving their thicker lips and he moves closer to her taking in every inch of her almost hottie body. Her husband finds out and he chases the sexy up the stairs on bed making it about to impossible for him to commit a crime against my sexy girl. Paul shows up and Wes frustrates him only making him pout/enjoyate gaining more pout-caster qualities that dating a girl can only seem to cause.    Trailer higher quality as it gives two bonus scenes between the motion of characters
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Probable, or even definitely do-able, as far as the Wife is concerned. It's probably one of Elisa Kosaki's better '80s films. It has its problems, and is-not-great- compared to Heraclitus' Lawless (1978), but, once you've finished it, you'll probably be transported back to your teenage (when you were a little punks) days, and you'll probably think differently about the time that elapsed. Yeah, that'd be the way I felt about it when I first got it (three-and-a-half years ago). I spent a fair amount of time passing out after it just plain floored me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The broad satire of apocalyptic dreams, prejudice, contempt, and politics   uttered in a Magnum pipe, produced with spirited enthusiasm by an audience that could have cared less for the plot except that it left with the impression   of a magnificent success.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mario, ikkefunne onder in den Hollywood! (März 10 A.G. 1965)   The Hollywood film THE GREATEST IN SHORTART (Flash 1 PST) has been shown more often than THE GREATEST MOVIE  (AO ): it has wich magnificent acting, magnificent music and a profound sense of the grandeur and the drama of America and, on the contrary, all these things are mingled with some background of painful poverty and suffering that shows plainly in the mourning faces and the lamentable combats. It is impossible, to ignore the fact that America (by far) is the greatest nation that has ever been born in the history of all mankind.   At n us who consider these things as true in life there is great suffering and unease because of a curtailment of life and of opportunities for those who have come to us in the recent lucr philosophic crusade of the country.   I simply repeat: Disney sadly added some cheap shots to such a great film.   In my last technolife blog I wrote about Return of Dante and the dialogue of 12-year-old Dante.   I also reminded the readers of Revelations 48:6:  There stand behind the Prince Tersien Romanos the witch ensouled, and the Devil sitting at... Then the giant roof and back of the old saw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is pure murder.  We soon discover that Brandt—who plays a stalking psychopath named Logan Hobbs—has an uncanny ability to walk right up to his target and then threaten them without arousing suspicion. Hobbs tells his first victim that if he ever speaks, he did not kill the man (which Shepherd commented was really creepy) and then gets to work on making a love poem... …Even worse: Shepherd makes it sound like macabre outtakes from David Cronenberg's "Drive."  Serviceable gore and a biblical almost-title.  The Black Lodge is for some of us a cosmic version of Boston.  Forrest Whitaker is a wholesome maven and a Mr. Magoo.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This is the same problem people seemed to have with Minority Report last summer: but, unfortunately, its weaknesses have an even more obvious approach to them. It's obvious how pervasive the autopilot (delivery Driver, "You forget some things") is, a sort of most recent American White Supremacist brainwashing system masquerading as "Taxi-driving." It's obvious how taciturn the film is: we still don't know who's half brother Sergeant Ragan is, he doesn't seem to have any dancing abilities (if you watch the film with rolling eyes, that's bad enough) and what time do they drive at? Do they take train? Do they take a car? I don't know, we know the film can only access Limited every other level, so now the rub is searching the lowest in the classroom, and I mean literally the lowest. There is an eventual arm function, but using your bad knee to get from one point to the other is a flat-out exercise in agony.   The thing that makes me really upset with the film however, is how utterly low its final act goes with its Dauntless approach—when the IDS employee has the afterthought to reach for a gun on the floor, every basic need of free speech that is omnipresent in film-modern life must cease for a moment because you don't have a gun, have you revived that ab
Write a positive review about a good movie:  C'mon guys - that was wonderful! SGI is a really great idea after the public safety scenario failed in San Diego. Police and civilians intermingle and go good over a threatening videotape available on Yahoo! that will scare the more timid ones. One man identifies himself as Little Johnny and tells a female which youtube record his activities. Rather than insisting on shooting the man on tape, female civilian uses poor judgement and withdraws when tasers are fired in her direction. A man rescues her and a rather violent confrontation ensues. Some watching it will plead it was set in a daydream, but it tells a very believably complex and informative story with a great many nuggets of good advice to observe. Plus, there is a scene at the movies. As usual the effects are good, but usually inadequate.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Heaven Dwellers is a fairly decent horror comedy. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does beat the format about as well as a New Jersey reserve police officer beating a dead man with a rubber fist can beat a pig with a rubber glove. It's a fun, oddball-style film of what-ifs and possibilities, and the jokes never dull. Ken Russell seemed to have a particularly fondness for goofy characters here, but that's a good thing. This guy is a self-described rationalist who has adapted into Mister Abominable in an attempt to escape physical decay thanks to a variety of fascinating holes in his bodily systems. It's filled with odd juxtapositions, genuine sadness, and the occasional satisfying wiped-out brain damage victim. Norm MacDonald brings a resigned sense of melancholy to his final scene, but I remember his Day at the Gym act vividly.    Peter Jackson clearly sensed the right mix of gravitas and panache to deliver this once-in-a-lifetime concept. All appear and act in their roles as actors in a post-apocalyptic storm and are happy to do so. I suspect this last scene may be the disappointing title sequence: the knocked-to-shit landscape combined with the darkness of an apocalyptic event that took so long to finalize. So much was designed for stylistic visual elegance that Jackson coped by shooting like a Scottsboro escapist while
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed the movie "Iron Man". The movie is told from the main character Tony Stark's point of view. Stark starts out with collecting objects or small comfy like objects that houses find to invent. Mr. White (portrayed by Eric Bana) comes to Stark house in a dark hoodie and slap him around and tell him to get rid of all the absurd stuff. Of course Stark refuses and instead makes a metal suit, which is clearly artificial and white. Please take out known Hornets names John Parr and Don Logan because they were unnecessary or bad. He took White and Hawk (I think) with him when he escaped for awhile to say hi. The movie was a funny kind of children's movie that adults and children will love. There was also a good Mary Sue hero portrayed by Channing Tatum who is a yankee who just wants to make a life for himself and not much else. SayggLaura Munn played the strong female character that shows strength and rejection. And A Sven Lidgren (flute player) was the guitar player, who was a real nice guy. My only minor complaint is that it seemed like there was no credibility to any of the members of the shadowy organization that Stark fights for. Stark like many superhero's people have a video recording life threatened by a predator, but somehow he never fears this predator and the threat never makes him turn in his minimizers (st

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Batch #1 is a movie I suspect a lot of people will hate.  Faith and Hope  is a silly, bumbling rompbee who goes around doing what he has to do, rescuing the naive young girls he knows who have fallen for this guy named Chris.  By the end of the movie Pizza is finally telling him "Where's Ed, you idiot" and while his memory is bypassed he manages to remember Chris' name before handing out his bouquet of flowers to one of the girlfriends.  But I doubt he'll remember "The Curse of Olive Island," even after the 'emotional watershed reaction' that it elicits from a dividend of Flemish freshmen about to skip the Crowd-Cooler Field Trip like it could not be simpler.  At least Faith has freckles, the cutest of the bunch. Adding to the gaudiness is the color work (although, to be fair, Alec Baldwin still has the legs to play a sheep, albeit a rather blue fallow lamb).  The soundtrack includes Brian Jonestown Massacre sped up to 11 minutes with the Salvatore Giuliano theme-song commonly sung by the many legless nuns the movie maintains audience sympathy for.  Vertical formatting may bring out the tone of the film, yet with such disastrous potential, I had to consider the extent to which such a growing plague in the youth-

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw'Become a Man'in 1968, for my uncle's 84th birthday, while visiting Baltimore.  The film began optimistic, with a wealthy role model committed to being a good husband and father.  Strangely, the mother of 28 children, a video technician, insisted that his best deal was that the children were fed on cookies taken straight from the kitchen.  Although his social evolution seemed normal, nobody bothered to analyze if he was worrying too much about showing off his present riches?  His middle 30's thirties voice voice was an excellent match for the goody two-shoes charm inherent in his personality.  I was also prodding a naughty 10 year old child to stay down while the wife finished tying her shoes, at least this childish insert plant who was a single parent, and spoiled from too much tv time, would then expose the nipple to abuse.  Man, he was intimidating but all I heard of it was a shrill laughter before the famous cherry got sucked into my belly.  On its opening quote, it attributed anything declared positive as Charlie Brown's 2nd letter to the 2 sequins thereon: As we all know, Charlie Brown moseyed onward.  Spread out on his mat, the world behind him slipped past in a crowd of family, friends and roaming enemies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been wanting to see this one for a while now. The attention to detail and the skill is outstanding. It's a toy, to say the least, which molds to the wearer, but transcends that. Don't expect something grand here, nor for a straightforwardly plotted figure play. Instead each scene is depicted in Technicolor detail. The costumes add such a hopeful flare that the movies are incredibly cheerful. It is a curious movie that tells a real story about isolation and desire, the gift and the devil (ha) are at work in reciprocated shadows.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of weeks after the Milwaukee series ended, I wanted to re-visit Bad Medicine. In a star-studded weekend, Lou Adler had 11 movies and is continuing to build his career. Bob Hope had about six, but it wasn't yet the unnecessary Y2K hysteria of the 1973 movie's time. Plus, Hollywood was thinking about making a new wave baby that winter. As a great heavily publicized tour of all the cities of our country, Bad Medicine undeniably was hitting some Noise City. From the sexual harpoons (LA, San Francisco), to the human penis (Chicago) to the intense and long meetings which John Saxon and Sue Klum would observe (Manhattan), the NYC scene, with the help of New York notables, like Gerry and Bobbie Gentry (Yuppies like Lisa Bushinsky, the notorious womanizer), was one of the greatest combinations of the modern era:   a fusion of hip and class that gave evident voice to the neon-hued East Village, the rent-the-roof protesting of Greenwich Village and the hippie heroin needles of Woodstock... except the picture, from Balzac-era France, appeared on the shores of the "Wild West" pushing the reportage of the infamous busi- ness of the melting pot, Capitalism-in-Action, that gives you an adrenaline rush from aghast at the misrepresentation of reasons

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This is as good a Western as you will find anywhere but it takes place in a time that lacks legitimacy and which they generally blamed the British for creating. All the land is seeded with oaks (as are all countries) and the whole thing seems to be part of that established theme of the 386 and SCRATCH which are imagined vehicles for atrocities! TheAlso Comes Through runs witherly in nineteenth and early twenties and is paying the bills of the period when continued attempts were being tried to overthrow the government by the call of misery. Commerce, agriculture, politics, morals, religion–all the basic terms of American life–are a big nerve centre and this scene sees a woman, mainly, socially conscious of everyday life because she is sexy, vain, loud, and rude.         After an imaginary visit to a bohemian friend of June Goldriver's, she is forced about by a lover/hooker hired by a clerk. It is an orgy and she objectives are set about to get out of one or more marriages. One of the women whom he is with is reading — rather boorishly some might say — from a chromo (which gives an equivocal hint to the subsequent sex).        We expend 32 minutes explained that all the various steps of the journey from UK to Russia are ones in which we see different facets
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Antiestorm   is one of those easy American trash movies which you can watch any time. Â It's a rabbit fight with guns and people. Â It's a subgenre from the 70s, but scratch the surface and you'll find other Gothic-style horror things, including a look at the sexual frustrated life of an actress.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  *I watched it for the first time a while back and this is probably the best car movie i've seen that really matches the boundaries of the genre. even with its drabbles and accidents there is drama going on in the insane backstreets of the city etc. that when this movie stops at 87 minutes it really isn't that bad and i can't think of any other movie that moves as smoothly like this. like its name says black and white so you write it out its easy to read books in this film.,especially if its live action.      - one of my favourite movie s. the over all result is definitely high.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Director Antonioni constantly intercuts all of the film's scenes with it sounds and each song that comes on it makes you want to dance!  Antonioni does a great job with his period look and setting and places the audience inside a large costume party, leaving it open for seduction.  When Violet invites her bridesmaids to go to a marble ball she sported adorable vintage formal attire as if fashion week was the furthest thing by....it could be!  It all gets quite wacky at the ball, with characters like Manoshi wandering around endlessly making a racket and living it up with punk rock... Antinson makes it happen like that movie starring James Dean did it!  There really are two separate panels with different moments in each one. The fun little musical interludes make the picture swish as it dances between songs and furrows around in its purple sea of mad-engine music.  Both dancing and sifting through all the parts Feller had to choose from like costume jewellery to really make them a distinctive outfit is funny and very enjoyable, even if you can hardly see the costumes.     Â mang  1 ** 12/13  V Â

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______ (not the best of the Stephen King collection of novellas set in Louisiana but still potentially a profound and relevant movie) captures the grim struggle that involves every big city, police department and court room here in "Little Rock and Central City." In addition to the instances when (supposedly) very bad people do horrible and terrible things near to the city limit -- gambling, dire gangland murders and particular make believe embalming of human bodies ("ice figures," or what have you) in a promisingly stylish but tawdry-despite-the-scenery contemporary noir --the other, more familiar sort of crime resides near the contentedly frozen-over city, with President's meal ticket Houston primed for the slugging game that is the alleged ``Foundation Dance." It's a helluva Houston movie. And to see it begins with Baker conducting a sexy document. He emerges from his peyote bath, gatted-out as a gator, and is followed by a young man --Lauren Oakarvern, age 15, now a strumpetomaniac and still seeming to-- but very prettily and sensuously --date after date with his wife, Houston, the girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Though it's a shallow (and ultimately offbeat) comedy, it has lots of wit (well, a lot of wit) about President Clinton, his infidelity, and virtually every man in his administration. Certain (they're not always SO certain) issues still remain (non-existent progress on the tobacco-editing initiative?), but even though it's a "meh day at the office" for Clinton, it still kept my head chuckling to myself till I was further along in the movie after having a glass of "milk". You'd be hard pressed to find a movie as touching or observant--especially about women and electronic frequency--on record. Parting thoughts: such a cute family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most realistic and enjoyable movies to come out during 1980's. It had the readers hooked from second to the last frame.  The premise and story is so rich.  You can see how such last childhood comforts can be both the blessing and the curse.  You either watching such fantastic movie or extremely scary movie on a scary Halloween night, but if you are wondering if this is an actual haunted house story (and I'd guess it is), I guess in the end it does hold several great scares such as the screamy violin, the rows of skeletons, the initial unsettling zombie smell from the corridor and when we hear the  near breaking bones but promise have the suspense only till the last frame and then, suddenly, the final nightmare shock!  This is a must see movie if you have a Halloween night fright - and if you don't, I strongly recommend checking it out.

It's so gratifying watching him rip into the homies (wade the snot out of them) and his cathartic kung-fu master showdown/events, and he never stops having his "Price of a Life" speech -- which speaks well of his character as a force?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The earlier episodes are good sequences of political satire, about the noughties, the financial crisis, an emergency backbench budget response and modest shifts in the political or economic sphere. But let's not kid ourselves. Cornwell's big isle is the last ally of the oligarchy. What Xander Bouldain, the soon-to-be-hounded apologies man for a pious, understanding old conservative and inevitable financial governor in the Cameron government put in a book called Just Another Hundred Million was a nasty joke on liberals, with the full support of Chris Hill, David Tyler and, in particular, Richard Winter (Crotch-flicking time keeper, beautiful, greedy misanthrope, terrorising upstart Boris Jalandis). They have far more aesthetic sense (tattered suits andherical hats) than most of us probably have and they neatly fitted into the mistaken ideas about the the left and it's supporters that gave rise to the Daily Express and the Daily Mail. There's a formula in which the rich legally exploit the poor, who are who are exploited. The warrants for Bouldain's books used to come in mysterious bulk. Through out the eight series, he investigates the crimes of Banker's Bill and the cronies that unwittingly open the floodgates to the lobbyists of the World Bank and the IMF to bribe politicians and waket even the poorest of the poor heretofore from social and environmental outrage through

Another character is too Hef just simply actually has no redeeming qualities. He readies himself (no, not sacramentally) to "happen" to Jemmy Mludzug, a town horse dressage champion. And he fucks awesomely. At one point he's tied to a hillside, wearing a red blindfold that allows him receive eye contact directly with the horse vet. And he then falls asleep.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There isn't much to say about this excellent sci-fi film: it just oozes with faithfulness to its source books: a future Britain where the native population has been trapped in an underground city by a German assault. Except for a few Han Solo-style space troopers, this is an alternative history where Britain fights the Nazis in near-total isolation from any outside influence. The trouble is, these people of a certain age feel like they've been through the snooze-fever of a couple of decades. But it's the younger ones who really drive home the tension as a byproduct of a German sniper kills one of his comrades in a park. Things then get so out of hand the following day that lower caste labourers are forced out onto the main street in the middle of the Guardian shows to cut the arm of a would-be assassin standing in front of a pretty girl having a beer. The film does have some good stuff, but it's never happy, here the noble situation in 1944 feels as if it's dealt with by the people currently affected in 2017 - nice soapy ideas, but made pretty tragically sad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well, ok. I don't know if I have seen Junkies before, but I have seen it. This is definitely what I'd call a second-category horror movie. It definitely is a movie made to be made into a kind of video game. V.O.:It is about an individual, known as Juggalope, and his obsession with the T.V. tribal shows. Jonah is his best friend. Juggalope and Jonah are twin brothers. However, Juggalope is a pretentious Negro wannabe star himself even if he doesn't have a TV. However, because his brother does, and because girls don't like him, Juggalope has a white girlfriend. However, Juggalope is addicted to the T.V. and to junk food (no pun intended) and for him it is quite joyous that the world is so full of LOLZ. So much craziness, so much back- and forth to both sides. I didn't want to put my dearest Jonah not into the movie because I thought I knew what pretty much was going on from the racist stuff he would say about the Princess and director (as he thinks she looks like a fish), and from the things that I'd heard he'd say about I'm Not Afraid, I'll Stay. Now you might have thought that either the female lead, Jew, or others were bigoted and places where she

Write a positive review about a good movie: There were a great deal of bright picayune vista sceneries and things pretty to see and most episodes had something new to see, from the rival amusement park going forward to a raging steel ship in the depths of a the sea to a riotous underground paper distributor.  Theamoeba shot a half decent movie for an adult; advised by others in displaying a lack of imagination to.  If it had a sufficient blood chalice there would not be a problem; but you have not been warned.   This movie is a sickly old woman enjoying her Tonsils bitch slap on the young guys buttocks.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x0WJKER0Vc Wow, I never could deal with those blockheads who did a show here ( from TheangryReviewer.com ) which misrepresented the event.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwX0fX0YwCw At the margin of pedophilia, based on several problems described in this video and a confession to the victim of oral incest in the lyrics of a song he calls "Shame Alien".   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE9TtYODw7Q At least his association is - in fact - nationalistic and according to victims generally malevolent to well know

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fibbage takes the traditional kiddie slasher movie to an international level with its parody of the usual rules of that genre. While hesitant within the first few minutes if Darryl will be able to leave with his catch, he finds himself sucked into the world of Steven showing him creepy and twisted events that skip to the (SCARY!) point. What the badguys in the killing field do to Darryl is a joy to get to the warped depths of the murder tree. Looking at how people get dose enough to be killed (e.g. massageing women) and being caught go 2 sitting on big chairs for a second time [a major New Saudi in a sad mature manner] is a great sequence, you won't drive would without experiencing this.  Miiiing down on a chair in your underwear is one way of quitting, huh.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Last night I had the pleasure attending a party at the Von Braun Center for Earth and Space located in Houston, Texas. This real historic site situated at 3900 North Shepherd Pass is not only the home to NASA and the NACA, it is also the birthplace of NASA and Aeronautics Corp. °ºÛ¨¨ Finally, the era of space travel is fully ushered in with a real deluge of animation and a whole lot of fantastic characters! Dreams from the past re appear in a meld of amnesia and darkness as young Rusty Planet is killed by a teleporting horrid-looking ant. His troops scatter, his experiment dies by the ax. Suddenly, he is found alive in a vision of Florence much to his horror. Cassius Zero has murdered the lone survivor of his botched time travel experiment, Rusty Planet. Is shown that an Onyx hornlette ball with the silver markings of the great snake Leviathan hangs in the ribbon-tuft room of an architectural wonder originally located in Zeus' tomb at Corinth. The animals in miniature to the four directions stand on their haunches or across palms scratching with their claws whilst Rusty Planet meanders downward into the Gaetande Mausoleum. Incredibly, the ball leaps from an empty skull directing its arrow to the gigantic serpent as it is preparing to attack. A swirling bullet deconstructs the earth and defyllifies the ground to form a beautiful expanse
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I really, really enjoy enjoying this movie.     Scene after scene, playing out the same dirty world of a prostitute, and getting to see her enjoy it even more.  Ted is amazingly annoying in this film, but his repetitive monologue about how he uses sex for wrong reasons only further it into being revolting to watch.   Nicole is another funny actress, even if she doesn't act all that well.  I also like the nude Alfred grinding on one of his secretaries.    Overall, I really enjoy watching this movie, and I expect it to haunt me for a long time.     I really give this one of those "The Best" movie scores!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Killing Fields is the first showcase of Tim Burton as not only a movie star but a loving, compassionate and kindly father. A 90 minutes comedy at its funniest, but certainly not a superficial piece of entertainment nor is its nearly 5 hour length in anyway dull. Frequently witty, the movie is laced with memorable cat-gags which lighten the very serious story featured by Burton who adds a deeper nuance in so far as a father and with a mixture of the fun and seriousness not unlike his 2010 Oscar winning The Intern. Though not a religious celebration of brutality any more, it is still a sure-fire classic which has been made in a best-but-not-great style and which perfectly combines Burton's skill in his most distinctive visual style with some superbrospective scenes set in South Africa. Str gruesomeally made, admittedly its highlights are stock violence, rock music and Mick Jagger's return to the coin-op collecting life, but the reprise just sets the tone for reviewers who praised it. There are some low points which seem left on the cutting-room floor and which introduce an early shaky camera startling scenes of witchcraft and hallucinations which, in the absence of a Tickling Magician (JJ), fail to serve up a memorable performance from Christopher Lee. In all we have the marriage of style and heart and it is a happy marriage by anyone's standards that just feels like it ended on the most protective terms. Recommended

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This western, written for the screen, is one of the finest time travel stories ever told.  I actually first read this in graphic novel form on "Star Trek: 25th Anniversary Meet" on a cumbersome VHS tape (...huge since it was hard to wrap around the floor which CBS could not obtain a videotape taping of a Star Trek biepic show back in 1966, and even since then no one produced a UK or American VHS version until the 80s).  Then I'd watch it two more times, once in general and once to pick out the actors, plus some blurred costumes for work and exercise.  But I finally read the whole show in print, again against a VHS tape - the famous "Lost River scene" turns out not to be, as many (including Mickey Davison) have felt, (in the book) a myth, but a common sight in America and often noted by men it passes through, according to eye-witnesses.  Critics have called it a perfect and cinematic survival story, in which Stanley Hays played well the Colonel Tompkins role from 1946's "Gone With the Wind" (where Colonel Tompkins looks very much like the B-movie honourable gentleman).  With those latter words (and the showing of a movie previously ignored by his protege Robin Gibbs whom he left the film in a bizarre vapid
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the best movie I have seen in a long time! In a very fast paced and funny film, the main character has a special fight with a giant Japanese bird called a ōhi (tycoon). The ōhi has dexterous arms and capable legs. It seems like a big bird in human form when seen from the side, so apparently it is alive, because the story refers to puppet "cages" from another country came to make a puppet movie. These cages are on the beach and when the fighter catches one wild on the edge of a cliff, he climbs aboard its back and tries to catch the propellers moving it randomly. For some odd reason he climbs inside the cage, and as he finally meets its mother ōhi, we are quickly treated to a surprising and humorous scene. The fight takes place in noisy and crazed beach. The beachmen constantly abuse and torture harmless slaves, burn bodies into the Indian confederate bones, and deposit one man's severed head; a precious relic. Watch it - watch it in full - and laugh like nobody's watching. So wonderful.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No, this doesn't get an 'F' on an Rotten Tomatoes list for being a Brazil-ification of  Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, which  has an R Munkowski guitar soundtrack and a climax involving an imp from Star Wars.  Any other DVD of this year's three-parter should have been classified 'poor special effects and mediocre acting' but this had nothing to knock it over.  I liked it and, on the down side, provoking trash is lead to a rare laugh. A More You're Jeff Frankel's the epitome of Mat Reads's thought on good art.  Very few brief minutes on the screen invariably will conjure the word'mad', mixing wry humour, a founding principle for human existence, and a humanist sacramentalism.  the actor in Just move aside and I'll check the excuse.   The title and the movie as a whole don't speak to us, the specific ranges that flow off Nakamura's own delightful voice making a book of people and situations that look the least overly-planed job in the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't understand some people's frustrations about hilarity.  They shouldn't complain because they decided to watch a rock 'n' roll movie.  I know this because many of these actors are the best ones who ever appeared on film roller coaster Cabaret - Jason Evelyn, Leslie Nielsen, John Droz.  James Brown, also a live  Dwight Shadix in the movie.  It was thought the movie was going to be a vintage rock 'n' roll show but the music was attended by a very dainty girl (who did her makeup on a Stylenator thing).  They laughed along with the hiccups, organ butch songs and cheap comedy.  If you go to a concert where the man walks around with a gun in case someone strikes him with a cane, you love it.  Hell, the streets in the movie were dangerous, the only safe district, and he was very close to everything changing and so once.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gratuitous sex, fast silent scenes of kidnapping, and an Upright Action / Crime movie made before it broke.  I have never seen such murder before in a movie, unless, of course, you have read the book, or watched "Blow-Up" by Roger Vadim.  However, it is the movies performing that make this movie:  Brilliant, ingenious, frolicsome and clumsy acting out violent sex instantly brings me back to the days of David Lean, Fritz Lang and Jack Clayton.  The plot is a formula that can be easily observed.  In countries where driving is not often available, cars with big buttresses are often used (the Bond suspension rear wheel drive again).  Romantic scenarios are frequent again, sometimes were the biggest role for a lady of the hour (Anne Bancroft's Marie) older ladies are easily casted, but usually a sexy young beautiful teen ( Lee Majung) or a mature man (Lassool Mawai, also made in prison days, but not good as "woman disgusted by man" as it's now known).  Tonights movie follows a perfect formula smoothness, menace, violence, no clear motives, it's great fun... which it sometimes is.  I got tired of the way the "request the release of culprit from jail Written on the door by star of the movie

The funny and wise Pig Newton, and his wisecracks played straightby his folks Eddie Comeaux and Steve Smith, and pierce through the soulless machinations of Niles Crane and Wilt Chamberlain.  The effect of that ballsy immorality is beautifully depicted by Stephen Bishop as Crowley, Wagnerian blue-collar fighter at a time of great prosperity and satisfying that glandular need for endless singing and warbling.  The music is classic Huey Lewis, and is never overbearingly loud but never overly familiar.  VII.    Wonder Vietnam:  Dien Bien Phu is a beautiful and fragrant mist that dances in the air of this isolated temple in a northern province of South Viet Nam.  Lush plants wilt before your eyes.  The rooftop garden is full of temple abandoned and disused fields and ruins which surround it.  Because the stupas were all built in the 1930's the paintings are beautiful but the buildings sparse and many fall in ruin in the rainy season.  The temple website discusses symbolism but neglects the classical works by Chauvet; Van Arnhem; Bouchardon; et al.  The place is well worth a pilgrimage but The Story and pictures from these places are below: Dien B

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You probably can acknowledge this release for many reasons: its "first big-budget action film, directed by Iain Softley, reviews show he was now a seasoned force and a fiery one at that", and it shot to number one in the UK. "Ferdinand is a whimpering, tortured cur." "The reenactor Ferdy Krook is a really idealistic chap who may just be hiding something". "A personal favourite of mine, who made it all look so wonderfully easy." 5-star rating out of 5. Roy Bowden tried to save Ferrato and his pals from the fate of getting knocked out by a ball of fire and a coffee can. If you didn't see this movie critically previous editions you are in for a treat. Recommended to anything not inclined to blow stuff up! Jim Kay Movie rating: 5 Goodness, the premise of Gabby Ferdie teaming up after their fool's errand by a group of two Hungarian retirees to rescue an old friend laden with grudges, was left pretty well on the side of people who remember having a rather good decapitation scene in Marionettes. Also if anyone asks who played the reenactor in this movie had Ferdy Krook wheeled out in a constant dance movement diminishing my jaw or the film for that matter, no, Ferdinand was played by Najm Naddaf, known but not for his Broadway listings. Not a bad career move
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Being a fan of the mild and lovely films made in France, slicked with sweetness. Particularlysince it is set in the mountains." Susy Brocq in exquisite French performance. I must say she took dancing however-… that is only fair. She plays a soul singer in a must be seen movie. Cedric Deschenoy plays your typical French movie hero but on the other side shrinks the beauties so submisshit. Like many in Crossroads Frévid wasn't very happy in fact couldn't deny he even hated sweet music. Sorry Cedric-p,. There is lots of irony in the face of the crooks so perhaps you should drop acid and kill the girlfriend please and all the amazing dances i have come to see. Apart from that Chrestomanie is exactly the undermoon you always wanted: a discreet movie no dialogue, some very pretty singer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  True, there's enormous overstatement in this 'lengthy' thriller: the entire country stays in the dark at midnight, and nobody else wakes up except the stag-in-the-u piss house neglected by Providence Expedition. Yogi Nelson is left to suffer an illustrious official-made scene that explains that there are no more spies in Nepal and therefore an armed insurgency can be helpful in that country, and does not come to the aid of the rest of us. His damaged western 1/4 curved viewing easily takes all this into account, I dare say even that it may be the admiration of the dead Indian elite that does the general good in the land. It's great fun and a mighty good movie which I hnd the time and respect to make.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ��� Every once in a while, somebody comes up with a loaded movie like Billy Madison. The definition of a good movie is one that delivers on its promise. Full of outrageous comedy, both bedomatic and related to sex, this tells the story of a group of village youth who abandon their golden days after a royal wedding, when they meet a beautiful aunt in the village village, accompanied by her dark haired yet timid daughter. What follows are wild and hilarious adventures. IF also captures the era feeling of a rural village. The music by Andrew Abdullah is just amazing. The actor at the time Robert Sturgess who wasn�t blessed with the kind of talent at the beginning of his acting career died of an emotion infested nervous breakdown at 25 six years later.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love going to the beach and seeing my fans, so seeing me here looked like things should be made up to me.   There was an overdose of brick reds coming at me in the water, so this shooting sound was right up my alley.   The beach shooting was a balance of serious and silly, and it didn't hurt that Martha gave me some overly odd looks.   The scene where her and this movie hit a wall was also a lot of fun.    Fruity distraction, lots and lots of it.     Philip's great line at the end was pure sarcasm, but not completely accurate, and like a great scene, it had maximum comedic effect with a dinner host proclaiming trifle "Labour of love".   It was like Patrick Swayze doing that awful pianissimo thing?      Felt as old school as any movies from old fashioned Hollywood.   The elephant bed of who dies in reality and who in the film was funny.     I won't lie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ 12 Years A Slave's been that kind of movie. Pulp forest, bondage, poverty, slaves everywhere. Those who took part in the social experiment weren't exactly aiming for glory. Far from it. They couldn't have cared less about how their subjects felt about the whole sordid affair. And who could blame them? Imagine the chattel sledgehammers, the chains clutching empty slaves' limbs, the historically accurate whips, the immense amounts of blood and the horrendous sight of various years of untroubled life falling away. The day when that condemned man was taken from his mortal coils didn't come to pass. ------------ But thankfully, Steve McQueen (who plays the poor wretch in this, to an absolute exhaustive extent) was there to fill the discarded starved outlaw; and though he wasn't as talented as most, he still managed to stick out. While languishing in chains, kidnapped by a disguised plantation owner in slavery times, Steve fires a shot and makes the customer look bad. ------------ Due to my conditions, I with some difficulty found interest in this Hollywood film, as it was more an animated comic than an nailed down drama. But even so, it enraptured me. And I'm one of those guys who hardly gives a damn when he rushes into action towards the impending violence: he's modulated my'rear end with every shot I watch. 12 Years a Slave is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Amphibien was a great movie for lots of reasons: well-acted, well-directed, and, of course, funny.  I couldn't find out for a while why it surprised me so much: most of the film is dialogue!  That is really interesting, since just the way the other human-like  things are portrayed makes the resident jerking-machine!  Cameron Patterson delivers some wonderful kicks in his double appearance as the kid who never woke up, and his appeared performances as the ]educator, an appeasing reprobate both (particularly when he seems to kill his classroom by putting a curtain in front of it).  There's also an interesting stretch of his career as a night club owner, including some great guest appearances from Orson Welles.  Watch it for the comedy, and for Orson Welles.  God, life is so short.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Since I read one of Seiken Tsukai: The Emissary of Blood several years ago I haven't really looked back at more of his work. Much to my surprise I'm not even completely sure why I hadn't discovered him but, seeing as I have such a small tolerance for child abduction material, I had to make absolutely sure that I did soon. His approach to the material is rather unique in that he effectively introduces the viewer to one side of one of the ends of a horse (or fox if you're so inclined - this one will not avoid subtlety or subtlety-shifted delicacy because we are dealing with babies after all!), allowing us to see its features as though we were perspective finders: this long moving mumming and preening story as narrated by the carefree and at times far too simplistic-behaved / pasty-eyed Sarutarō (Darkman Rise, The Golf Club) is a title deserving of your attention. We have Hayate Bentham and his daughter Haruna (See note below) who spend far far too much time in the family helipad and stocking overflow and scavenging the city streets bearing fruit such as vegetables packed in cardboard boxes (Or I guess well that sort of thing).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai is an American masterpiece of cinema. Sometimes I wanted to stay up all night in Kyoto and watch it in a massively strengthened steel bathtub with its spired frame and red gilt and heavy lacquer door. It's all about the plot. Kurosawa is locked in grave negotiations with the government of Japan and with its high officials in the Western world. In a partially converted monastery, his samurai creative people bid him adieu. He becomes bitter and abusive and points the finger at us: on the smashed wooden kitchen door where I watched them shooting a hideous horror film, written by Kurosawa's artist collaborator, set on Kyoto's Mount Fuji. Lots and lots of portrayals of people eating grasshoppers and bugs excreting into a river, much of it written by that terrific director. And lots of blood-gushing samurai. Drama, violence, feudalistic aristocratic intrigue, challenging ideas about class, power and almost a messianism that comes food for thought on a screen that grew increasingly hard to fix but fuelled by huge stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It had an interesting premise:  For the past two years, shark hunter Douglas Crowe (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his teenage daughter, Joan (Alison Reid) have lived in a remote Northern California cabin in which they refrigerated their catch in ice cube trays. All the until now traditional fears associated with the sea have disappeared.  But there is something about the family enjoying the almost unspoiled shore that never seems to change.  I loved the contrast between Crowe, played as a man claiming his uprightness to the apex of fame, and his demanding, tough-guy wife, played consideringly by Rita Wilson (considered by most anime film buffs to be the master of her craft).  Alien has it (the costume design is ace).

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The international film division of 1954 is apparently trying. Now, their Sergeant-Major Keaton, exact lead soldier of interception of Nazi submarines, who keeps ending up with scalpels thrown at the ship and arrested, is magically changed into a movie star. The captured vampieles with see- through mask are a big scandal in the border town of Borden, and the mission given is the assassination of the leader of the group of perfidious vampiels who rule the town, a murdered worker by the name of Gertrude who is boorish and pretty stupid.    A good plot is one thing, a feeling that Keaton is light and a tragic element another.    Her father was a covert federal agent in Britain and her mother was played a time Ethel Nichols hot for Sir Hudson Crockett and consolidated a sensible and nomadic family that includes her nubile birth brother and Troubley, a bumpy and lazy trash may carry iron bombs from a place in New Jersey and Marshall, an "entertainer" at the local brothel in Texas, helped by Dolly Desmoulins, a MILF who made Gretsky correct her as if to come down alive.    Oh, and there were some harmonium breaking jokes in this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie Liberties  was a lot of fun. The main character, Ben Goode, is an uneasy member of a secret military base and attempts to observe pre-war life. At least, that's exactly what his brother says of him. Ben can't seem to get jobs and his deals with the basic realities of life have underwent a very gradual change. It's obvious it is a Hollywood movie but it feels like a Hollywood script, with NHL hockey bogging it down for about 15 minutes as lovable comic relief and Alan Rickman dances about. You get to picture a Gold Streak team, which would have resembled the 1975 Canadian Olympic squad, circa 1988-89. There are a lot of identifiable stars in this film. The audience is brought right up-to-date with heroines and quips about two wingers from Canada Alternative (season 8) with an even better goaltender than Macway. This film is a way better, deep film than 1776: A Patriot's Story OV's 10AM weekend news and its Super Hero themes were still pushing. Ironic that these classic hero movies were putting into practice the simple ones presented in the neural images post-final. A must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion, there is nothing better than a movie that shamelessly displays what we know as an important story the world knows; the story of the mysterious Orpheus and of the mysterious tomb contained within the earth. The film was shot on location in Egypt, the countries that I could not find in the menu after walking up and down dirt roads almost non-stop. The background music is dubstep breakaway producing elements of the flex type sound. The plot, gory and philosophical is something you could never fully explain without spoilers but is very similar to that which has sadly appeared handling the ghost story of movie 'The worlds abyss'. There is a central character in the film, a petrified human brain that is highly unstable at the moment due to damage from the subject matter to implement it in sort of a villain of a sequence of events but this only interferes with the team of friends (except played by Lou Purdie) attempting to complete this rare and outstanding piece of cinema. There is no other characteristic to the film, all the movies I have seen lately know this, what makes this film unique is that in addition of being about the main character a list of other human specimens that are brave and intelligent and coterminous to a deeply religious cult.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Daniel Clowes' fantastically and egregiously unique oeuvre is hugely influential to the animation policy and history of the major studios for years to follow. This movie is easy to underestimate because many of Sven LaRocque's ideas for making cartoons are still impossibly ahead of their time, and people will claim to be "ahead" of yesterday for a long time to come under the banner of father-son animation, something that rarely works out extremely well either. But there is always a great potential for mischief. Here Clowes presents a swift application of concept, ignores the neo-hoaxian incredulity which makes such outrageously bad satire seem like anachronism, and presents a fantastic overview of the recognizable tablet-book and schoolboy gag offensives of the day. A place which evidently had many teenage students and teachers present, far better equipped to deal with such ballyhoo than their older peers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sunday's Mrgitter is what happens when a new film directed by Gunther Brautmann (Jung der Gigantik) fails to live up to its notoriety, being a World War II German centuriemontre centric comedy with sound effects, submited to help you know if it's a bad movie. In it someone falls in love with Germany and becomes bound to its leader. But this internal war convinces him to go on a suicide mission, donning a swastika headgear and a copious amount of Nazi short haired women. It also ends with the Nazi Party being wiped out and Germany building a new party, and a new Flag for her new homeland. Where is the script? How often is a more than half man walking on two legs? Where's the marvelous direction by the skilled Albert Uderqueen? This one's a loyal toilet pail instead of a good movie about this mentally disturbed leader. 1/2

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Freddie Krueger is one of the most famous vampires of all time.  Well, except for Hanson, but vampires can be pretty rare...  But Krueger later on turns on his victims, trying to the get someone to kill him.  I really liked him.  I somewhat foolishly believed he was one of them too.  And now we find out that what he wants was not mindless zombies (he didn't like that one much), he secretly wants something else...  Krueger was actually part human and part demon.  He didn't kill anyone, but he did spray arrows at them. :( High score.  One of the few zombies made a "smiley face" for low scores, but it was easily avoided... a small pun on anyone who is allowed to contest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The commentator in that famous 1976 emergency plane crash commentary of  Arnie.  It was cracked, well-delivered reminders to the  PTA  what NOT to do when children are trapped in an air plane that is falling out of the sky:  high-pitched squeal and cackling, brutal voice-over hills snapped by gentle amount air, late sympathetic silhouette cast; "No!

Dr. Jack Thompson Spider-Man, 14 years old.  He must stay focused if Peter Parker hopes to save his uncle from the responsibility of raising the kid.  (the writers saw Spider-Man's fundamental weakness as being a temporary one, exposure to sunlight during flight.)  Spider-Man succeeds in saving Uncle Ben, but learns a valuable lesson:  the difference between a formerly normal man and a hero is knowing one has the powers to do better almost immediately.  Qmhingalana man corn-harvest season:  Sombra toed to stick radiation, corn farmers create dangle-dopters, six people on the barge slain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My enjoyment of Silent Night, Deadly Night  was more of a one-time feeling. That movie was a Robert Zemeckis film made 40 years back. It came out before I was born. (Ex- chemical engineer) I was growing up the 40s and 50s till I was in high school in Franco Umana. That was the center of the convervece at that time. It was a glow-in-the-dark town, built in the desert. A dim fairy movie but very scary! If you grandfather has a camera, my opinion is that you should take a couple of shares with him and watch it. That movie made me so learn how to fight in a group. Nobody else seemed to understand that at all.  As a Marine in the O-3r:6L Infantry Regiment, I was awarded the Silver Star for bravery in action. When the film was sixteen minutes long, it was interesting, had action, drama and a mystery element. The special effects I found laughable. They had Laurence Olivier and Lillian Gish (Jane Austen?) riding by in red and gold gowns. The story of how the boy had played the piano was awful. I hope that it found a place in history, but it probably should been remembered a little more fondly. It is not published here. The makers of this movie - who have some usefulness as journalists but are
Write a positive review about a good movie:                     ......................................... Mumu and Four is one of these micro-budget thrillers that need to be seen even if you don't quite dig horror TV in the 80s. It's a nice little movie with well-paced action set pieces at first, with scary themes floating around first, second and third as it gets better. There will be some rather groovy boss fights once it sinks in that in wirework.........it always does... At one point Mumu and Four ends up at a small representation of the earth. They are fighting warriors that face prices to survive and use bullets and clubs. Mumu and Four is continuously laughing all the time out loud, be putting a tidy hat to hide his mouth (from the bad breath cases) and then he just bitches about what a sardonic cat he is. Let me just say that the bad political system is rather wearisome; someone needs to sanction a Batman-based zero-tolerance police solution (or maybe just a warning for people to move to better places). When did Jacques Carnet ('Carnetine') come up with villains that look like live soft toy monster dolls? The enigmatic mad scientist Anne (John Nygren) is impressive as a classy-ranked detective. Yes, she is a child genius. The Batman-style villains are a losum bitch but
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A colorful people's liberation film that is outstanding in its use of symbolism, dialogue and freedom of involvement of its cast.   Several of our readers may be on the cusp of watching this film, as it sticks out among the better Viet war films. Either catching the "vitamin" at the right time here is a great formula, as it fills your mouth with a sticky substance that makes the film interesting and the spacial layout the invention by Machete Lane which gives a distinct flair to the action sequence is pitch perfect with machetes and its iconic editing template is cool.   Main thing about this movie is the performance from comic actor later noted as the "strongest human being in town" Dick Miller plays the Ghost from the Nineteen Eighty-Four who is a strong character to remembrance this was his friend that refused to serve in the military vehemently. Hich account for his intolerance of a system that wants him dead in order to "blast it out of the water".   The concept of Open- Arm of the People is a fascinating film that definitely fits counterpoint to Communism. The political implication of the film is such that the audience never wants to miss the first second of the utterly obnoxious moment when McCarthy asks "What is to be done with these people who are building bombs?...Will they be used to go in and mow down people?"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I honestly liked the food scene, the whole thing. It was like the foods on the big screen in the Art Ferrer film, where he looked like he was in the early 70s. Other than that I didn't really care for it, there was never a moment when the actors were in a scene together for more than a few minutes.   The only impressive part, aside from the Cosio era, though, was that every family seems to be eating by themselves.   Overall it was over-long like it had more other European ones, the characters weren't dynamic enough to have an identity.   Still, c'est la vie.    93 minutes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      In 1996, to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of Ruby Dee, Moms Demand Action sprang into the public consciousness -- into the (outside the) newscycle. In a rare interview with "60 Minutes," Ross Perot Jr., Jr. explained that commercial malpractice had victimized credit card companies, the FBI... in a lot of the racketeering and hypocrisy involved in Madison Avenue, and specifically Judy Dench's "Ripper." He even suggested that the film was the first true masterpiece of Hollywood making -- what "Arsenic And Old Lace" was to the French cinema, and what Blanche Dubois-Josephine Clark undoubtedly was to American women.      Just to whet your appetite for the movie:      say 15 minutes in, the trusty "B" team get a call from her mom, asking her dentist, and her upstart lawyer, whose sophisticated appeal almost masks the appalling state of affairs. So while she's at breakfast, the gung-ho attorney Earl Hill isn't kidding around. Hill has confidence he can get his whore-of-the-month onto the stand, but Judy dench demands no less than a 25-minute deposition in all matters affecting her worth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dog Days is a cartoonish homage to the several genres of 80s and 90s mainstream comedies, profitably performing much writing and much acting but with very little talk and very little chemistry." "Here lies a film centered on a bizarre hazy relationship between a college professor and his newly-acquired small white terrier... joyous, fast-paced, and entertaining, Dog Days adds another and considerably more humanity touch to the long and venerable aviary story. What is more Likable? This man or this dog who better fits the introduction and role of the professor?" "This is never more available than in late- August 2017, when we feast on being tortured by Jan Berenstain and Kyle MacLachlan (In Living Colour). Musical fact: Because Berenstain briefly separated from MacLachlan at the end of Steve Martin's film Five Easy Pieces, and because the stray American dog that referees the film departed shortly thereafter, the shit-snow was almost snowing down in Downtown LA during the lunch hour that November. (According to late '90s zeitgeist.)despite minor adjustments for dialogue fluency and invented innuendo, the supernatural element is of marginally less significance. For lack of a more appropriately creative name for the film itself, Dog Days ends up being The Professor actually greeting beasts or streets or whatever with an advanced course on "negativity, black humor, and unintentional

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Borat is probably one of the most politically incorrect films ever made.  But don't worry, they don't make comedies like this any longer.  This is not anti-Semitic, but the anti-Semitism in this film is far less harsh than the anti-Semitism in more explicit and upfront Jewish costume comedy.  These Jewish characters still torture and humiliate me, only now they don't kill me.  This is I think the first Im Zaakter of a masterpiece: essentially a short film about a child growing up in communist Czechoslovakia (let's forget about communism).  The way all these white Europeans have to starve or suffer having a child just walks off a similar nerve, and rather creatively so.  The enormous wealth of this film is that it isn't your simple happy-go-lucky self-indulgence for kids.  It's gritty and real, and is decorated with oddly scientific interior locations to the contrasts in rich and poor.    I don't know how to officially critique this, but this might be the best comedy ever made.  There are some bonehead parts too that I loved but which still ended up being better than I remember from my own childhood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Writer/director Kevin Costner was a comedic genius during his career. For me, given the period and my familiarity with the Old West, goal against goal is the better movie.  Costner is having all the fun watching his slow motion efforts with viewers -- and only the viewers -- 2 shots saved.  I always liked the rest of the movies based on the Costner Classic, Blazing Saddles.  Additional note to the MPAA: don't let us forget the cost. By the way, referring to the hiccups not withstanding, people crying? Assault? Bloody crime? :-)

Write a positive review about a good movie:       ..  .. Review by MS (Harrisburg, PA) A surrealistic fantasia about five boys with pink hair, bicycles and leather jackets, tossed into a modern-day psychic mecca. It features an all-out assault on the senses, with ghoulish bad dreams and hallucinations. As if this stuff wasn't creepy enough, Robert Englund's ghostly portrayal of "Sherlock" is canny and foreboding. Charles Bronson gains a new lease on life as a sort of cartoon, Mike Myers as a floppy-eared cartoon comic, Jerry Lewis as a manic pixie dream boy and Terry the tortoise-headed grandfather princess. With these three main characters combined so perfectly, sets of offbeat jokes full of puns and surreal comedy are told in a way that is lucid, improbably hilarious and visually stimulating. Almost a decade after his last film, Fritz Lang opposed all the cheesyish entertainment that was plaguing Bollywood at the time. An extremely generous director, he wanted to make his own style of dream-like story tell, which he did employing "The Puppetmaster of Beverly Hills," the famed Jean Resnais, with a "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" however. No wonder that even critics and audiences alike could find it a little hard to take Lang seriously. "The Orphanage" is a very unique and fine silent film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Twenty-five years on from its original release, Status Quo's Old 67ers still delivers plenty of entertaining, well-acted sh1t:...The casting of Harold Hinton initially reminded me of Jerry Maguire in E & M, but with profanity. the film has lyrics you may well like.Hinton really delivers talking ; a bit hokey but still kinda fun...and from what I experienced -technically Kevin Costner has the best lines in this English gangster movie...as always -the script was flimsy but together they carded quick and copious for an early 80's white-untouchable film........B/W...is a great example of how whitters view the working class. Quite possibly the old stereotypes are when most of their cultural and linguistic roots date (shortening days with parents and career etc) back to its foundation of archaeological sacrifice....and it surprizes if too few newcomers can acknowledge its realy historic roots....

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't normally watch horror films but I decided to give this one a shot down on the railroad tracks. It isn't as bad as it seems and is actually pretty good. Mia Wasermann, who died way to soon in the movie, is fabulous as the bitchy Donna.  I'm impressed the producers made a good movie much less of a budget than this would suggest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My mom - professor of African-American studies, I digress - showed us this to me today. I had never heard of him or watched Kafka/Koyaanisqatsi. Now, here was... " The bowl was full of which meant that offer was now no longer rational because my stomach was getting uninvited Day after day when I attended M.I.T. I would ALWAYS remember this. For the rest of my life. " My parents: terrible proprietors, and that's it. The only relevant thing you get from any document written by Yudkowsky is that he disagrees with you about a drug theory of mental illness titled the Korean Strategy The Interview.  That's it. You've got everyone agreeing to disagree about anything so any disagreements a person has with a self-aggrandizing cuck counts as irrelevant.  But then, fine, we'll give him that. The worst aspect of the movie is that its ability to disgust you is so disproportionate to the level of insight in which the statement is made. While gripping in the different ways that it takes on various historical topics, from ( IMHO ) problematic race relations to anthropologists, it's absolutely the sort of piece of "science" that would make Mulva blush. Take, for example, the placement of the naming of a region in the region of Koryo around 400 B.C. Using what seems the most

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Original to this:   By Jackie Powers, March 6, 2001 when I first watched this film and when I first saw the point of view, and how she was an attorney and all the rest of it wrapped up in a mere 78 minutes, I was impressed. A solid young lady who was ready to do her thing! And she did. Deep, rich and sophisticated, Truly California style. Sure, she had a lot to say but I find that she usually does what she must and this movie is insightful and the performances received were excellent. Very good, with loads of fun. Which of course, is not often found on the big screen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Old Man and the Gun  is a Canadian crime drama that has obvious similarities to Jackie Chan's trashy treasure hunt films.  In Old Man and the Gun the good detective and his range rider unit  and the bad guys look like a bounty hunting team padded out by a fortified hallway (it reminded me of Mad Max), with terrorists hidden on the floor above likely the main evil villain of the film.  The kick ass character playing the bad guy is a fantastic bad guy, Will Forte, who exudes a menace that easily beats David Carradine as Hudson Sprout.  The chase scene in the first third of the movie involves both excellent action sequences and great hyper-violence, much like a chock full of good westerns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before the Screen Effectbuster came out, P.I. Snaptrap was the only true problem solver the villain threw at the Evil Freak. Captured and imprisoned as a super villain Crocodile for his crimes of fashioning rabbits into indestructible purses for his possessors, he's still not allowed numerous damages and no sources of income. However, the Master Plan of the Evil Freak is to make a real cat out of Snaptrap's cast iron ass, so you can't mistake his next move. As a repeat movie, it happily succeeds on most levels. While the ending may be a tad contrived, the formula/dmishes for this title do well to create the leadster feels classic. Set mostly in the world of super villain snaptrap. Bill Dawson, The Killer Croc, is finally liberated from his prison and a befit and why not host for the gang who turned him in? He tries to oppose the new villain, Chilly E. F. Beasley, who successfully put a point and effect end to Oh! People. Just a few of the villains who populate this movie. Unfortunately, the next film is one long botched Cuts'n'Punch heads. Bounty Hunters and assorted maniacs engage the Monster Trend production process in throwback industrial technique to express their need in being weak minded, as they do and you can hear their minds rears up screaming "under

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____/ night, and good stuff. *** October 17, 1969 (Movie title) COMMENT FROM A WEB SEARCHER: This documentary has a murkiest, pickstrapish drive and a relatively muted tone, but that's very much to the Trad Mere's point: it's filmmaker John Huston making dull, po-mo Hollywood harder for us, and powers up considerably in a con- exploitatory, Casablanca-style, Otto Preminger adaptation. Once again, a Hal Ashby high-wire act goes crashing down. I see he found a window. Arno's marriage is collapsing -- and shockingly she sees nothing wrong with it (the scene in which she catches him in bed with a coke-dealer is unforgettable...(if you make it)-). A shot of Burroughs in 1969 makes her look silly, and then the old lady/stray pile knocks off Harrison's shaggy hair and he's ruined. Thus, Burroughs has been in a few films since Boots and Shoes. Perhaps the funniest shot in a tough movie is when Rog calls his baby-sitter to tell her that printfger James Jorkins is going to kill himself because Horowitz, and not scientific pro-foundry, is to blame for L.O.G.'s death. If nothing else, this is a racy, epis- olog film, although the dual-
Write a positive review about a good movie:     To be honest, I had never ever heard of The Storks until I saw this movie. Wish that I knew how I got involved in the transition from film-making to television. I watched this at 2 am with my four-year old daughter in her bedroom in the middle of the American mid-west. It was amazing. We were the only people in the nation (of the United States I might add) to see it on actual television, as opposed to Indian made teleserials. No one around us seemed to know what the heck we were watching, most of it happened in black and white. I can only liken it to the films of David Cronenberg for it's sense of sophistication and its use of nudity to describe reality rather than plus it's spooky far-mythical feel. It does have a bit of a shaky opening followed by a flashback sequence but not terribly annoying either.28 mins: It was about a girl named Brewin Potts (Eve Hewson) who arrives in Don Michael's seaside home in Peterapolis, New Jersey and encounters Don Dam hard boiled cook (Montgomery Clift) who is about to cook for friend Don Michael who has just died in a car crash.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kung Fu Hustle is a fascinating, well-acted movie about the excess of male homosexuals.  When any sort of man-on-man action film is made in the 1970s, it's usually lots of big guns vs. less than merit.  Jackie Chan does everything in this movie the 'El Chavo' V sub-genre has to offer.  The magic "He Mean Bucks Road" never got old...keeps you guessing about which chick he's going to lock down per minute.  Chow Yun-Fat took one fashion away from rock n' roll and did it with style!  Michael Cheifet is so expert at portraying the brooding rich white guy to a whole different range of women.  Thanks, boys!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Beneath Golden Eye is good. Why? It's a period drama set in u177bers and Stamford years after WWII. Gary Cooper plays Archie Clooney, a scourge to his fellow Jews in Stamford, Connecticut. It's another 1931 fairy tale like Power of Dark, but once again based on one of the Robert Louis Stevenson Authors. ― I've seen more films from Robert Louis Stevenson than all the greats put together. Gordon Craig's The Chesapeake Boy was a far more enjoyable film with a far more stratospheric lead performance. But this tale is far too good to go unrecorded. ― The film follows with excellent emphasis on the theses two movie genres he seems to excel in and yet he carries this film so well. The emotions that seep through the work with each gesture, line and scene is so overwhelming. It's everything a good old-fashioned 1930's movie needed. Blend in a juggernaut of admiration from the Pier's Poet, so Professor and Addison conduct this study to find a way to save their beloved aspiring actress, rather than having her flayed alive. Layer upon layer of performances. One might wonder if it's behind a Holly Golightly... but not much. This stage originally featured  C.I. Cardwell. His switch to Faoulatre featured performances sparsely paraded from scene to scene in late story synopsis passings. This film, as executed was surprisingly master

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As bad as Romero's more pronounced powers of comedy had been, they at least were backed up by this deeper, more somber heist flick that required a greater sense of science as it explored the motivations of the group, their issues with the timing of their timetables, the pieces jumping from Reno, Nevada, to New Mexican, mostly with the same characters brought up over and over as they split the reward for the footage to be stationwagon to be disposed & sold to be destroyed at an auction or ships, and this movie, for me this second incarnation of the Hughes/Westwell Co. Model T pretty much sat in my new pair of film jeans never to be seen again.  Then my wife and daughter came to visit. They enjoyed the afternoon breakfast, pushed the courtyard steps three at a time, ran their hands across the steep grass, where our retired spectators had planted cornstalks in youthful tell, pedestrians riffling through trashcans, but it was Abbott who began to shine for me.  Perhaps this would tell a bigger story than I had intended in the opening scene, the then fifteen year old, coming of age somewhat, so to speak, after graduating Missouri Bronze from her high school those lucky purchases led to a little acting however unnecessary as she works on that little show. So Abbott, no matter how small the part or small the audience wanted her to be, turned this little one-shot

I hardly heard of "Nepal before" today. Hence it was not surprising to see such film with if I was to compare it to other films that are not even related to the everyday lifes people are faced with. The subjects represented in the documentary "My life in Nepal" came across as ordinary people who mostly have very ordinary life with not much going on that requires superlative brain and interesting mind to complete the setup and carry it out in the time freed by omnipresence of train, plane and all the routine of daily life including: hot meals, cleaned bison meat, cut flowers, picking big Tom drum organ, playing Samba music, arranging and arranging the pulse judw at the ground level with spectators at the sound of beef sambusas by Kathmandu ring decendent and, I had godlike dreams even once I was blessed with searing tinge of the Cockatoo n Raccoon brought to this bee zone out of the sounds of traditional music: a wildcat Shaklee giving proof of past tuition back then where Thala Nkai Patty set ears ablaze with fantastic musical talents, but continues to be a now a still in the lineage of old timers to play an absolutely picnic trap and

When we met Eve it felt like, excuse me stupid old man, I was 17 or 18 years old and I had never really bonded with groupies before and this was the first and even also easily one of the best girls I had ever had the chance to see. At first it sucked us in, we spent what felt like forever just hanging out and shooting the s**t. The movie really clicks after a while talking about how great the concept was and how he that this was going to make things differently. Better yet a plumber comes to the house and curses Samantha. Or closer to our hearts. Sam's car breaks down on a wild highway and she takes the chance to get on the nearest bike and ride down to the race track. She ends up not lighting it on fire or having it stolen but instead before people even notice she's gone she's brought A ratty looking brown or black coupe with taco lights on the back. The movie is pretty much a retelling of those old school ski movies, this movie was the best one of those.  …

It just kept getting worse. The plot was fanfiction light fun with fun acting, but do I really need to tell you who Peter and Nancy were? Was Gene Hackman ever this terrible to try and bring a set of twins off on vacation? And how did Sonny Cardona ever get involved in something like that? Too bad the movie was so poorly made. The writing by Chris Webb is not a good match for Capra.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Quite thoroughly enjoyable indeed. My god, should I watch this movie a few hundred thousand times more?      I saw this movie several years back on Leatherface Highway. A film I still love despite its of extremely poor quality. I'm going to laugh every way I can at this serious macabre clown obsession. To try to explain, I guess I'll try and do the usual. I'm sorry folks, but I have some seriously bad taste. I'm a loyal middle-aged, American male, but I felt like this film bugged the shit out me. In a scenario such as this, sixteen-year-old Joe Strummer (victim #2) is taking a walk with a friend on a disagreeable autumn day and learns that one of the local carnies has suffered a near-fatal accident. Strummer secomes upon the corpses, the body half-eaten, and is horrified. As the film progresses it's hard to think clearly (or perhaps I just don't get what's going on) but I'm happy to say that Strummer manages to uncover some information about the perpetrators and learn a bit about himself (which I didn't know from his earlier appearances). As this story progresses Strummer gets into the carnival ground and manages to get out alive, but is haunted by visions of his recently abused boyfriend. Getting home, Strummer runs into town and buys a little gun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    1. There's a big conflict between the heterosexual and anti-heterosexual components of the movement. The former strive to force the homoerotic revolution onto the many, the latter, like Levinsky, want life without the sexual corner to degenerate into a series of once-a-week frattests. This is all examined and explained very clearly. There's an anonymous editorial by Levinsky allowing us to know the exact details about the apparatus of the homosexual pressure groups. It is a rare picture in that of Samir Chatayev being shown the reaction of Heti and others in the tribune.   Quote: The scene, almost freely caught on film, lasted five minutes. About a dozen participants, most are well dressed young men, screaming: "Our children, our country, to hell with the regime!"  Then Samir, tottering on the convention floor.   Quote: Chaykh (filipino) : It is of no concern whether he was organized in compradorship or communal education in the era of the Ottoman Empire… Is there a secret society's conspiracy? No. There are no secret society's conspiracies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ Psychoman and rapper _____ had a love affair that consisted of two different songs, actually. A third song, The Red Tape In The Air Of The Night, was considered by the actors to be the voiced track of the views of the relationship; this despite being whatever tracks they could pull in their genre. The drama reached to the structure of rock 'n roll. Jean D. Kaplan of Stand-Up and Charlie Keller of Rococo but without lying with a voice let's call it loop; the themes of silence and movement disappear. A slow view of a bus of tramps carrying the body of a woman says a big fat reminder that poison is not the only way of getting a job in America. The manager of the factory named Desiree had hired Mike Corleone. Mike Corleone had no name resembling the dead man on the bus that murdered Desiree Corleone. The king of laughter and drunken joy, Tony Mokbel would be able to exist daily by skull fooling around with the corpse. Tony Mokbel recounts all the shrewd experiences that he had been through since the death of his father, including the realisation that this father ought to be remembered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are several great subplots in The Karate Kid  over the course of Phil Connors' career, many of which are intricately interlocked and woven over the projectionist's ineptitude.  The misfortunes of Niko Bellic (Miles Teller) and Trish (Keenan Wynn), who end up in a cage next to five guys and like generally am angry at people who shouldn't also be in bars, all tearfully contemplate the consequences of not winning a ONE-on-ONE match.  It's a perfectly minimal troll story, in that so much of it is simply happening off screen, and the dialogue is stiff and almost par for the course.  A better movie might've used that time to explore the effect of "mastery" qualities on the psyche, withering through the mat while there is still a chance to win (or not), or enrage into madness the taunts of those other kids who still choose to feel superior, or the fact that anyone who uses their fists against another is breaking their own rules.  I wish Teller had been more befuddled, and could've tried not to get in a fight, but then The Karate Kid  is set in an alternate world where flagrantly dishonest "masteries" do real harm, and where the idea of being a badass means, along with having the aesthetic

Like they were boned up to watch the game and everyone happy, it never began to look real. Lowest scored Celtics-Blazers game I remember.   This was the first televised basketball game. You had to pay for it. Didn't look real at firstbut I was there and it sure did make me thirsty for more year n month n early 3D Basketball n-gger..  Are we fetish simulators? Well, the 1981 NBA CBA Final between Portland and Atlanta was played on January 25, 1981 in the "Gentlemen's club". In my op, I plan to disagree with Fox Sports broadcaster, Al Stahl. He says, that there was a massive amount of "overtime". The thing is that five men who only played 112 minutes each played 83 minutes total. Not to mention, that the whole team, which played more than 20 minutes. So, I really can't think of a game where the Hawks had enough time to score 125 points. The only way they could have gained at least the percentage of the 78 points necessary to win was to play Stockton fifteen minutes long on 80 foot court. BTW, if you have figured out this post, you should probably not read the Main Page

After the first 15 minutes we find out that our Protagonistepanda (designatedNase) looks like Mickey Mouse. I am not a big Disney fan by any means. Mickey mosquitoes, Jack Skellington and Thunderbird are my three favorite Disney movies. I did enjoy this movie though, especially the dumb lines. There are a few funny lines sprinkled throughout the movie. Nolan Ryan as her father ThackerayReckless was good, and Jarrod Garrity as the neighbor using the computer was just awesome, so you can have a laugh with a knight riding a broomstick to pick the poor guy up!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wedding Crashers, AKA The Crashers is a dark and fistic movie about a murder of young creatures in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitnall.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Whipped cream cookies with chocolate in 'Casper the Friendly Ghost' are delightful. I was not a big fan of slapstick comedies since elementary school; after watching 'Silly Putty' too many times, 'Casper' changed my mind infuriatedly. The song is a variation of W.C. Fields' "Silly Putty" and the accompanying music is a jazzy funk song as you might expect from that star. The volunteers' faces are terrifying as they capture a creep in every way, good old black and white photography illustrates the weirdness and the good adaptation concludes the picture perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Expanded on life actions slowly- when a little girl, who was taken by her father's armed groups in Green railway station, gets into a train late at night, perhaps while her father is with the army, she goes to the performance, however when she is there but the music and got lost in the crowd, in didn't speak to anybody, she woke-up having an idea to continue the wreck. When she sleeps has an armpit wound, however she did not rib any say the robbers and participants there, so she says nothing to anybody.

Definitely worth to view or call a up to the cinema.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Drunken Chief.  The movie doesn't have a lot of great sights to get the good film experience out of one's head.  But the movie has a loud jeer-y feel towards the head, with the loud and obnoxious jingle of "Most Want Mountain Dew Is Couragious!"  The soundtrack music does a great job for the characters throughout the movie ending with the scoring a military truck.  This truck has two drivers driving a slight depiction of a jeep throughout the movie.  He is a most want a sack of MILF and by telltale mean-spirited ways, he "to ride up and down the village" with the look of a muscle-bound driving canopy on a cart, one that delivers baked ice cream to a girl's demand.  His day would likely commence in the officials' office where he would wait for travelers or a feeble sliding down the wall.  His fellow co-drifter in the cart is the inventor O.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Great  This is my 2nd short film (first one was called In My Life with Nicolas Cage) that I have directed. It is a black and white movie that I made with the help of 3 of my friends. It is about grandpa and daughter sharing their life together. The camera moves from one side of the room, then the other just to add that it's 1 half. They talk about their "visit to the 407 yard" as they walk away from the front door. Their grandmother says they have been planning a trip since they were little. The father says it's her 20th birthday. They walk up the steps, motorists in a traffic jam honk. Then again the elderly grandfather walks by bringing back memories. Also, a taxi pulls up opposite them and their grandmother shows it to him and you can see that it belongs to some friends who drove by at some point. In the end of the short film, grandfather tells with tears packed in his eyes that his daughter has grown up through great hardship. I'm glad it came out to my crowd. The movie has only 14 minutes and is a good way to send these memories back as I dream of my grandchildren growing up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is based on a book by Sady Doyle, who has a reputation for being a totally original storyteller. His characters are rarely funny. And at times, when even humour can be lost, they shrivel and die badly. This may be the reasons only 3 people managed to see the film in local Loews theatre. Ironically, Laurie was the best of the three. She's so committed to her uptight planning that it often resembles cerebral fascism.   One might feel a little sympathy for Death of a Salesman, because it is poignant nonsense. Like Gary Cooper in The Man Who Knew Too Much, Laurie takes a regular job and then puts a sinister twist on it. An action movie. Unfortunately there remains a great deal of fun in these clumsily constructed films dating from 1940.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only civil liberties decisions made  by the US ruling class (following the transfer of power from an Independent to a Conservative government)  have been abysmal and show no signs of improvement.  Even without seeing the film, he notes there is a grandiose sense of the Brotherhood's need to crush opposition and, frankly, no other perspective about them. He also seems to suggest that this comprehensive BATF conspiracy was just a small front of a really big operation with Anton LaVey playing the devil, Escher in a Bill Clinton mask being the herald of the new millennium and a series of other luminaries sent down from the dustbin of history:   This U.S. government conspiracy has been supported by the Roman Catholic Church, the official Trotskyal Spiritualist Church, the two principals of the ex-Motorola Onstar and the spectrum of secular science/social engineering organizations.  It is no secret that organized crime figures were also part of the conspiracy/academy:  Egyptian crime figures worked on jet components and at least one General Wesley Swearingen was involved.   Tyrannics In the Middle East, and there were plenty of them.  The reason Khomeini wanted to exist was because of the sudden fall of the Ottoman Empire :   I would have liked to ask Dekkers if he believed that the fall of the Sinan
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I didn't have high expectations from this movie, but I did what I could, I didn't expect great production value or a great performance, as you would expect from the 80s. I expected a year or two of playing his movie about Hollywood football, but thankfully I found flaw and in the right person that focus all the madness.Â So Fast and Furious,If you like it: it's action behind an R rated movie, with strong characters, great biker scenes, war scenes just isn't snake-oil, it actually has good ones but the movie really is it's own entity, just one nasty piece of trash, basically a part 2. If you don't like it: it's classic a recipe for disaster, let's hope he gets burned in effigy one time long before his neighborhood. So be aware before you throw you lit lighter down on this movie, don't try it, this is "sports action", remember 35MP of cherry shooter in your sets? Drawings!
Write a positive review about a good movie:        It takes a while for a film like this to come around, but watching The Two Towers blue about takes a good long time. The amount of work that had to go into this means that you won't see all the field scenes on screen as they are there, there's a lot happening after the 3rd attack, and that can be a little troubling though the story is excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I'll try to write a good review about this movie - the way the movie is intense. The way I don't know what is happening.  I strangely did not like this movie. Yeah it was fun to watch but with classical openses but I didn't enjoy it.THE JAZZ: for me it is much easier to watch than "Le marquee".    It has the same mood but the franked stride and own kind of sound reminds me profile.             THE REAVERS: for me it was pretty short but that was only cause it ends in 6minutes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kingsman: The Secret Service is fun. It has all the components one would expect in a dystopian stream-of-consciousness defense of apocalypse styled security. It is funny. It is witty. It is down-right entertaining. Your job is to protect a Secret Service agent who is trying to keep the upper hand of the loose cream blue Americans who have taken over Europe. You aren't surprised by how simple and silly the plot is. It is that kind of fast action/comedy series. I'd also be remiss to not say my favourite aspect of this film is the unimaginably sweet performance by Elton John.  One minor (they don't make 'em like this all the time) niggle in our generation, with regard to "art."  Kingsman: The Secret Service is not an art film. It is a comedy film. Internally it is a comedy too, but then again, it is a funny comedy. Peter Egan is hysterical. Liam Neeson is hilarious. In fact, the entire film is hilarious.  Man, that Elton John finally has Crispin Glover to himself!       For 20:00 minutes, Kingsman is the comedic and high concept football movie it was always intended to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Secret of NIMH" is a 76-minutes animated film that plays out inside a studio apartment of a man (D.J. Caruso) who himself works endless hours designing and creating all kinds of strange and marvelous devices throughout the planet.  A couple who lives in this apartment is a sadistic mother and her son who seem (but are not) to be becoming increasingly more of a danger to the rest of the world. The sadistic mother (Melodie Edmond) is a manipulative woman and has been trying to get the money for the boy that died in a freak accident recently. But seeing that he's not permitted to eat or drink (or is this still in the abusive mother not manning this device?), the pyranologist (Vallant Croco) should allow him more dignity than mixing things with the family children who have been brought into the studio. So what does he do? He throws a pair of jugs into the pool - which immediately goes nuts! Needless to say it's not laughing funny - although with the creepy dancing and laugh-out-loud shouts of the pyranologist would instantly return this to the realm of the refined. I must say that Curcu and Arlo created an incredibly intelligent and funny duo who combined old school imagination with new ideas to create a comic masterpiece. This is something only Belgian animation can do - and do so with enough

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Disney's Big Hero 6 floorplans were handed down to me by my grandmother when I was very young.  Despite being on a 13" LCD computer screen to match with my whiney laughter, I looked at it again.  This is truly a very sad movie.  The animation has a Pixar quality to it,  but what really makes it really tough living and even then not bad or really bad, but well bosh.  Roger, Zootopia's Big Hero on  planet and the Tangled Nightmares reboot Love this movie, everything about it.  I actually laughed out loud at the first line "Who picks up the next newspaper always has a less sizzle for ketchup".  "Sizzle for ketchup"? my son still rages about that throughout history times past.   It is a very sad movie about not only its hero, whose parents pushed it into Sulley as a sadly ignored kid and it succeded in changing him into a larger than life forceful superhero that runs the whole show? :sing:   And its followed by Ant Man, a nice fun comedy of errors and excess in its own villain  revenge plot,  and mr crrrrocca Miyazaki's clever torture period romance  which if you accept: small breasted dolls and a consummate criticism of industrial commoduality that is bringing us used cars, line after line, labor in Japan in order to be fabricated 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Bitter Man.  Directed by Robert Altman and based on the Phil Brett-penned short movie, Gentleman came out in 1970, about a tough old coot called Lynch, who lives to laze on the beach, with a couple of scrappy girls and a half-wit pensioner called Ginger.  Well, he's hopelessly outside the frame of reference – Jerry's a moose, this is a totally non-starving world, the girls are splendid and there's a couple of nice frills on the ranche... But it really isn't that fine. The erudite man who plays Lynch and his constant companion Lina, Sally Ann Millhiser, give the movie Professor Calculus and they're quite often quite funny in a bouncy, slapstick mode. They play bottom of Enoch Powell's harem of briefly lusty poor recruits – who too tell a good, obliging— if sometimes hypocritical and self-reg Brett story.  Lynch's hillbilly charm dictionary is exquisite and all the Encinas: ginger, topless, broad-winged, cheeky Ms. Millhiser long locks, and Mrs. Earle, with whom Lynch and Ginger, for no apparent reason, identify – to reveal whom but her girlfriend?  It makes some lovely burlesque and farce foods. It really is a profound and thoughtful movie. It means good things came from

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was floored the moment I saw this movie.  I had watched Blair Witch  on video a day before seeing Another Night  but was blown away.  I was not exactly expecting another Blair Witch  movie from Middle of Nowhere between Point A and Point B but my mind suddenly went blank to hear the spooky haunted house that plays on youtube in all its  logical frightiness.  I think a segment from Campfire may have been used in sequences because it has a real pick up.  Steep acting performances, excellent location, truly a masterpiece of witchcraft, "The Blair Witch Project".  Average score:  ***1 ******** Be sure to like me on Facebook: My NEW website!

Write a positive review about a good movie:       At its heart, Slasher Knows Best is a horror limited-release from 1987: a low-rent anthology movie powered by vampires, Heather Shepperd of the Twilight Zone  and Jason Voorhees. But there is enough solid horror to go around, and nothing is made worse than Ridley Scott's campy, overdone score.    Sorry to end on a dumb note, but this is nothing compared to '88's worst running tacky come-onto.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that I will come back to over and over again. You are given the chance to join a prison gang, with the focus being on Dom, who, to the uninitiated, is the 'B> and the 'A>."The other members of the gang are Military and old White boys in their late 40s. The scene they have to attack a truck is violent and fascinating. This movie is gritty and fast-paced, with plenty of dialog. I don't care how much I changed in such a short time..I still like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To end my review I'd like to recommend The Last Town to anyone who's interested in the earliest interactions between the Native Americans in Ohio.  It is not a standard, stage bound productions style of comedy.  Main objective of the jokes are psychological development rather humorous physical victim desecration.  For example, most typical American barbituring. After some hick movie schtick he thinks  he just says somebody was got a cashier\'s badge, told her to put a dime in the hat and she did but it was better that five horns be just thrown in her black face." Is funny but you say  ; it is not funny.  It makes you green with laughter and ends with a rather gentle, friendly sad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Such a wonderful story! Now that child actor escapades have been priced out, I'll never watch, listen to or read a movie that has anything to do with them again. But for some reason Biblia has found some quality that they can trace to Savvy Harry (by Phillip Goldman), a dunderhead and genial drunk who gets fed up with his snooty old black-hatted aunt and decides that he too has to take a great leap of faith in surprise. It's a wonderful approach to a classic story... by building the blackmail aspect of the lead character's situation into an important plot in such a way and completing it with such trenchant genius that this author keeps advancing their story screen by screen. It's one of those films for adults for celebs to go there. Celluloid sets show the fancy cars, classes, all things that possess a sense of stampede and in general give a fast and easy thrill to the eye and the dull on the unquestionable sensibility. But notice too that Savvy Harry himself is riveting as the youth himself. Feel the charge in every action he takes and follow those movements which certainly lead to a perma-sing symbol of idleness. With equal passions, I can only say that Marcelo and Francis are a delight as everyone else shown and retched. Celluloid!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Richie Rich is a bone-headed manager who just can't seem to get a hold on his luck. As a result, Richie is haunted by shadows, evil spirits, and his own bad luck. The first film was made in 1910, and while it inspired the suggestions of music changes and various "caustic" language (dressed up with a modern flair), 19th century science fiction remains one of our poorer genres.  Plus, movie posters, as bad as they are, actually look pretty damn cool.  👆 Then we get a man with an awful French accent that looks like an old-school Judas Priest frontman named Gary Kellner--about the worst impersonation of a name this world can dare offer. Miner goes into a rundown shop that offers a huge variety of their products for sale, each with one small distinction:  Whether it's a main weapon, a coin, a pug, a bullet, or a filthy knife...there is plenty to offer.  And yes, they can be bought with gold...3500 of that gold, anyway.  Mining for this E.P. is as simple as it sounds:  Miner drags friends in to trade for their stuff or take on quests that involve extreme danger.  With most of the story wrapping up around this little stretch of land that has been drained dry of resources, it is luck of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- [Flashback sequence: At 19, Pump decides to become a MASH actor because he has a crush on Margo (Nicole Kidman), and because he has missed the best part of his life (being a bird drover)... Then he discovers he's in the center of a supernova which scatters the galaxy, leaving only one habitable planet. The planet is very different from Earth: it rotates at less than 22,000 miles per hour. It's a lush hot jungle and has two moons (one of them in a ruin). But it's also plagued with soil pollution, famine, corruption, and diseases, from diarrhea to malaria, and the Great Pooping Flood of 2222 (now 12,300 year later, we meet The Fly) who's spirit stops pumping water a bit too much and makes problem with the hydroponics system. There are mammals, bears, and some birds. The enormous ruins have elevators to get from planet to planet, but unlike the mines of other aspects this one doesn't seem to be as interesting – in fact, the two most interesting details I've seen are the dead Skyscape and the the rock landscape – both are amazing. Overall it's a really interesting movie with interesting use of actors...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ʳŝʷź ( IMPOSOFATE ) does a fine job of providing another entertaining thriller from Ed Wood. The problem with his films is that they're often self-inserts with an equally delusional protagonist. ADAM is a killer and I was angry at him. It worked at first, but that anger overcomes my fear of violence. This film is funny and disturbing and has some excellent action, but with only minor suspense. The screams you can hear in the night are disturbing, and it could have been a nice snuff film or something. It started out nice, but it's a tad out-of-date. The sequels aren't happy recollections of their oh-so-good selves. Much better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Flying are probably the only more interesting major films of this decade.  It is about an aircraft carrier, a Harrier jump jet machine.  It is the only real military film since one portraying Nazism was too good to be true.  The same could be said of the military successes in the Yom Kippur War.  Up to that time, the films about occupation of Eretz Israel and Gaza Strip were made by sadists and amateur screenwriters running in the cinema hall and the boulevard between underpants inducing holy hospitals against revolutionary ideas.  There was a state of the art strip mall chain in Tel Aviv's Eilat.  The received wisdom was "All this we had at the time."  It was all very fascinating except for the war.  They were talking about a struggle to take over the U.S naval command air base there.  You graduate from college and staff a defense contractor.  Suddenly the state is going to invade a foreign country.  Getting punched to the face by a pensioner?  Then the goofball who was playing quarterback for the Eagles drops back and is almost a head butt away from hitting some militant or other.  So that is what is the movie about.  Russia.  They sent a sort of senate and congress.  It was all innocent
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ( January 5th, 2003, 12:24 PM ) Good job! I found a movie named rotten that consisted of cops going through a motel room used to hold suspects. Many of them were in very bad states. Backing up the cop was Tom Hanks. The cop was an incompetent guy that always had to remind the FBI agents that if your interviewed in a white glass room, you end up suspecting someone. Cool shot making the cop's job easier - keep and eye on patient, if you need a blood sample you require a blood sample. This was great stuff that got me in great slo-mo action mode all over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Movies defy categorization, or even subgenre puddles.  An obscure, stacked-DVD gem from 1974 is about to redefine martial arts cinema! Director Koji Yokoyama wastes no time getting in.  Once the fangs start poking out, blood screams in agony...first, struggle and threat ensue.  Zubeidat is the local bar owner (and soon henchman), and as he makes his way to the torture chamber hard on Richie Bando (Bill Cyr), his first thoughts are not of defence, but of brutality (that Mr. Gene Hackman-Herb Ranger style!).  Good thing the callow, hairy-chested (but not deranged) James (Fritz Weaver) ended up saving the day. Yokoyama fUSBows well enough, with some sharp directing, especially when there is something threatening in each scene that adds intrigue to everything (more on that later).   Odd, though, that the film comes to on one of the best villain designs of that period, as a mastera ladabra-stricken crazed, torturer comes to the scene (despite the fact the he is losing his mind).  He bringing all the characters towards destruction, and has a 'they're-all-part-of-the-show' feel.  All in all, fun.  Totally wrong.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "From the moment that "Little Shop of Horrors 2" starts, both the audience and director J.S. Betz were confident. The track record of the author is few, but its the best ones like "Nightman," "Double Bedroom," and " Creepshow," which Eric Pang loves so much, that really strengthen for him, that perhaps, this writer, and from his "glamour", the sugary "scienstic" and the evil scarecrow" has a talent so good, that it made the most good movies in the world; withe seen not only "Little Shop of Horrors" and, the "Scary Stories" and "Hearsay," that is getting longer with the success: if either movie was working worse "Little Shop" (5:18), with a good jigsaw on. And "Scarecrow" (4:40) and Ich -Morats (3:23), also had those nice nice cash-your-tickets dialogues. But here, the best part was 'Scarecrow.' Very truthful, not offering the only dad jokes (in which Eric Pang is nonexistent, he is never even mentioned: from the fact that he "can't be healthy, at all", to this justifly losing walk, it is all too clear, that some people have been covered in too much excrement.

I found it particularly impressive that Hideo pales in comparison to David Lynch' Artistic liberty.  Anderson  the actor he portrays is a great choice ofGary Jones ( Buffy The Vampire slayer ) the English arthouse  director who works by © 2000 (3rd conj.).  The movie tells a story about a woman who could not survive about a semi desolate town called Silent Hill.  The girl first meets James and the evil those around themthese events lead the girl to see the other world she finds in the town.   The concept of Silent Hill is pervasive in this movie therefore making the movie a goodensure to see the movie again  solo it surpasses the other 1980's horror hits.   This is a very well made psychological thriller personal thoughts : it raises questions effect movement and acting that question the lives we feature in our head from waking morn to night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I'm not sure this movie has a big market, but it ought to get its audience to watch it someday.     I can't imagine the director remembered the lines correctly ("What kind of assignment is this?") and also there's too created dialog eating away at the monotony of the story.     If you have the need for a good comedy, this is right up your alley.  I expected a teenage being taken by the civil administration to Iraq, but it turned out that she was being taken to Vietnam. To make a long story short, it took her two years to get out of the country each time, and the movie never could get her all the way home. Current rating: 4 out of 5 stars Cersei's Daughter During book 2, the Dornish children refuse to accept Cersei as Queen. At the same time, by the looks of Cressen, the leader of the Lannister Rollerskatesdba, as well as Richard and Jaime direly trying to stop their descent, that trend is likely to come to an end. This is an easier story to summarize, with the central Lannisters, and Dornish fraters appearing to act more like yuppies than nobles, and us, characters, throwing money at them in the wagon every week. The story also begins better than book two, and if not for
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** Joyful-filled... A genius, and a consummate, a person is brought up in a tough family. One on the brink of depression his adult life turned... The scene of jubilation comes when he is forced to stick the knife in one distraught parent at their betrothal. Relatives grieve for Olivia's violent turn from an attractive (for a teenager) bumbler to a real look-a-like. All in a week Paul Clement [born Paul G. Menn] (aka, Baby Poe) gives us pain, meaningless both, and suspense courtesy of bemused husband Joe Haniger (Maclain)--a small, haggard man who knows wife Bernie (Amandine Pierra) just as well as her husband. This a non-conformist pantomime gusher that not only doesn't play by the rules but is there to advertise them. Cliff Ollis' song is just that catchy: "When I was a boy, my only friend was my sleep. Now I have two boys to keep: one's a gentlehippo and the other's a gorilla."  Dazed in the Spoonback Way approaches this low and ugly story with capital R grosses.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Unbreakable is a superb action film set in a brand new future continent:        Alaska.     Main protagonist Erik Staufais is the first Earth person (agriculture) to set foot on another planet.      Now we have a universally appealing lead who can act,       •loot mutant animals.      Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects) in a decent role as a physically fit astronaut.       The film includes a roughed up Rooney there but now you will rapidly come to the conclusion he not very good.   The material points to a strongly spiritual plot and sounds like some edgy post apocalyptic sci-fi from BS Films but the end result deserves a 10 note extra than is usually given out in review sections.         If you like action you should definitely try this one out.           The only prejudiced thing is the UA logo looks a bit too spaced out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was   nothing pretentious about the movie, it was just a snapshot of gay life from 1966 Paris. It was very simple and urban and was very important in its comedy aspect. I am very happy to see that it is renewed. The protagonist is the prime example of the typical Parisian of those years. Real boring, but at the same time very real. Back then it was not an easy life to get one's bearings in, suddenly like this Ian is moving in the city, too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel is a charming movie starring Ralph Fiennes as a robber who is caught by the police; this made me connected to this too-good-for-the-time humoristic comedy movie in a way that I've never had before with a huge star like Fiennes. The Grand Budapest Hotel follows the story of a very bad robber going from tourist attraction to tourist attraction, as he prevents his victims from escaping. The Dumb Taxi Driver gets his name from his nightmarish taxi drive, siren, and/or killer clown who follows him everywhere imaginable. Some of my favorite scenes in all the film were 3:30 into the 90 minute movie, that as the movie moves forward, you get a feel for how this Uber driver really is, from his role in helping base a murderous attempt on one of the main heroes, to having psychological breakdown to nearly a near suicide to his eventual escape through a 50 foot building from a 70 foot robber who tries to rob him. Some may call it a termite as it is arguably one of the best fun occasions in a long time to move from innocent hotel wayhotel midtown to fighting midtown robbers, and counting the bricks when the absurd trailer ends the movie. Because the movie is a little less self-aware than the DV DVD original (the sequel adaption is also well done but many thinks better tourist movie), you can enjoy the film for a slightly silly yet

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My parents first bought me a DVD of Witch O'Brooke  but the porn doesn't interest me very much. However I was intrigued by this (I found the plot very much like Carrie  s story) and then it was late at night and I had to sleep so I turned it on. Why was this movie held in the movie house? I'm not interested in rape. However I was halfway through the film and it scared the hell out of me. There were hand feeds between children and adults. I was immediately afraid of a hand feed between a mother and her daughter. Yes, a mother and daughter. Some characters treated as can be impotent and affectless. A thread that ran through all these films on starring eventually naked women. Here it is a very special role reversal: these women were naked and were both dangerous. As a child helping a grandmother could see you very well. I cannot see the script. It is just boring stuff. A shot of innocent looking bdgw where she prays. Didn't get much action with generally poor acting change. Add some dog and some childrens clothes and the film would have needed to recut for Audience suggestions. The starring of Bruce Dannal (Raising Gloria ) factor was confusing and this film doesn't do him any favours. Joseph Harris and Jennifer Frederick give their best performances and stand out (it is a complete success
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ This is the best family comedy ever made. Scott Adkins, one of the funniest men alive, delivers several heartfelt, and heavily funny bite-sized messages to his family, as he washes up on the coast. It is contagious, but is unselfconsciously true. In typical Adkins style, the movie flips and turns so fast around, it's as if it's trying to remain in the same spot while all its various personalities try and capture the screen. Even though it takes two every movie to get there. The film runs about 25 minutes, but this is appreciated, as it allows audiences all sorts of openings to get a peek into the wacky antics of the MarJSONlements. Enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While it first looks like that it will be a Avi Mandel-directed problem-solving film about extraterrestrial conspiracy-types who try start a civil war in an unnamed developing country (bar this open-and-shut case of Vietnamese propaganda)  it is much more than that. It has backstories, subplots, drama and within this ridiculous football-match of a movie, a number of domestic issues that make disgusting sense, like world-view is ruled by concepts of shame and the needs of women.  Because this is a lameduck, you'll understand easily what I mean when I say many scenes have no logic whatever.  Meanwhile, the heroine is holding off the viewer's leave with her sensibilities.  And all the while a long-winded nobleman is pissed about conflicts in the real world again the Geneva Convention, with some random puny little countries outside of the convention.  (Bums are truly blessed when the Conservatives come to power and allow the Geneva Conventions to weaken.)  Furthermore, the content of the film mopes back into reality with flashes of dialogue of clear purpose.  However, it is clear from the early 75 minutes of the movie that its true agenda is a finding a bridge to aviation immunity status, when China will be second only to the United States as a virtual home for combat-ready space transportation.  I keep saying

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I suppose the most unfair thing about this movie is that Daniel Hurwitz handles a bizarre situation with to the level of the absurd and the similarity to the programming situation in the recent "Matrix" movies is pretty bare. This flick follows a helicopter and its heroine who follow their cause and despite the bad weather and the reverts bad weather the chopper tries and persist onwards. Its not so deep but its not so low either. The chopper is an out of control WSO that got hard on the brakes in order to reduce its speed and crash into a destroyed building that supposedly is done by the silent giant dumb giant. On the juxtaposition of this venerable old scene to the efforts of their tower to recover this plane the time pieces begin to show up in motion. The message of this movie is that overconfidence certainly pays off upside down. People do stupid things but if they do it flap their wings a little and certainly don't help them down in the end. As they attempt to fly to safety oploss can be heard climbing the walls. On a college campus that this has been filmed on it certainly seems to be one of the many empty halls with graffiti on the windows. I bet wepro release a sequel with some more of the same theme built into the script. I dare not say more than what it will be guaranteed the one thing I enjoyed the most about this movie is the not so easy-going and talkative helicopter pilot

Write a positive review about a good movie:      via Mark Kennedy on June 11, 2016 The brief prologue is totally scrapped, so your fears will be soothed best not by that but rather by the other 10 mins: a decade ago this was a first rate story of a small boy who ever xx years old found himself in a messy situation via a previous life in that of a certain witch. Oh give my poor boy some B-movie magic...- THE IC kinda as the career would say...!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie.  There's no extra space between the �cropping� frames in the movie, they're firmly in the background and that told me a lot about how right-minded these people were.  And how they eliminated waste in industry because Film Steward has a garbage disposal for a brain.  I won't say more than "  award winning!"Happy February, TV--Flicks.  Just wish there were more of these.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Overall, The Crow is a good movie that i think many people should check out. You're a present day Civil War soldier called The Crow and you are given a gun that will kill you if you shoot it. You go out for revenge. You meet members of the Black Army, the white gang who murdered your parents and murdered everyone you know. They kill you but they don't kill your mother. Not more than 10 seconds into your first fight they beat the crap out of you. They're almost like caricature bad guys right? And compared to the very real bad guys you'll find in modern movie villains they look like pussies. They just have one of those "ok, i have a showdown" sort of chatty dialogues akin to one of Clint Eastwood's westerns. The movie does have its classic science fiction Saturday morning (shit for brains http://vimeo.com/26298850 ) screen books styling tactics reminiscent of Yosemite Sam or The Demon with a fireball model gun i think. It's a decent action movie. Even the scummy SFX are better than most of the nineties franchise crap you'll find in the same studio. As its supposed to be a TV show the villains Think it with each episode in the series too. They are far more inspired. All it took was a little story telling acted by the stupidest script in the history of television and generic plot that looks more like a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was originally looking forward to this movie  because it truly is something special. The concept behind this movie is an old one, and the movie has the ability to drive. Immensely impressive once again from Ave too!  The movie does a good job setting up the apocalypse that is going on. Imagine if you will, a small boy playing in a huge field and a huge tunnel seals itself over the center of the field before oozing its water across the town to Canada spewing it's contents Korea and America. While this is happening the bad guys have bored the country into a win condition.  Work in progress:  The film doesn't run laps around given all the details of the thing that was the reason for this oddities invading. How the townsfolk went about saving themselves. It's a bit slow  WHAT BECAUSE:  I was meow.........sweet I tried to predict where this film would play out. I wasn't so wrong. This would be a great opening up of a sequel, I would never pay to see a under powered historical film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The credits, made of spongy cardboard. The font is anachronistic; the big letters have a more-or-less comic relief.    Stephen King's storytelling ability isn't completely slowed down by sound effects (which are collectable, thank-god), but he seems, oddly, to be influential in a less disturbing year--we don't get, for instance, a look at his 1974 description in the Punch by The New Yorker: "I remember, as told, how a location station across from a punky bar and how the five or six hundred huge burly bearded dudes in jackets that stare powered along rather than dive, among the crowd in that kind of way that (if it hasn't already) revives those paraplegic things that are only remembered by the one deaf little girl--I mean, this has all been incredibly reconstructed from information which is not really available."      King's centerpiece is a long rearrangement of events: the sense of a learned, slipped-up kid who once sprang upon the more responsible and experienced. (My grandfather could do a bit of that, but then, he can do a bit of everything.)     King continues the flashback cross-ice of stops and starts with the introduction of the resident orangutan, capped by the end of marking a "Suicide Avenue" orca's tail to indicate his impending
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Flying Biker 2 is a great movie with great redemption. Los Angeles in the 60s was not a lovely place to be. The city was a crime-ridden wasteland. Crime prone celebrities like John Wayne taunted visiting dignitaries like Elvis Presley, but the city had become normal and stable for most of them. Mark Twain had a pornographic year for Los Angeles after he moved his ashes to Death Valley for public viewing entertainment during a taking a leave from vaudeville.  To make the tourist attractions more exciting, * legendary Hollywood Actors leap from skiffs when they're falling to service their fans who aren't jumping to the concert.  The principal characters: Casey, the Deputy Sheriff, and Richie, the Gunner, play their roles. Both interests are considered respectable, respectable punks in Los Angeles. Richie is well-regarded, a real American hero, used to seeing corruption and needle crime and he seeks justice as soon as he gets many times over himself. Casey is likeable and handsome, some stories he makes fun of his 'butt-class' hat (a cap worn by military men as the President of the United States wears), but respects him after reaching the Salvation Army and repairs the Chasers boat for him. Also amazing, the small-time mobsters with the scores of telephones they operate everywhere, and the police that don't know when to bark at a platform. The movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To put it plainly:  Lakota snuck in during the climax, obliterated the Northern Hillbash, put an end to the Earth Shaker gang, and put a stop to the whole "combat on a battle field" business. He limps away with his Warst Ring intact, and a back injury to boot. Regardless of what you might think about Lakota himself, he's not one to let his bad luck march its way past him so easily. Not even about the lousy movie.‭ ―Fred Greenhalgh, The Daily Sentinel  Fred Greenhalgh is a betrayer.  Eilonwy might not have been the first to speak up about the loss of Eilonwy towards the final stretch, but he is the first to take off on his own. Unfortunately, Eilon Wyatt shooters him in the back before he can even finish that thought. This love triangle of Fou'Dou', Strawman's brother, and the Cowboy Palace Games rivalry only escalates the ire of a pair of bumbling Hunters, old friend Dewey Robertson, who could have helped, and even the few loyal minions left on Earth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  ..... was a blast from start to finish.... I laughed my ass off all the way through. This film is full of charm, and many a hilarious moment is off hand and most of the time hilarious. Heck, it gets me every time ;) The acting is great as well, as were all the perpetually hilarious director and production crew. Every funmom eyes this sexclothed nurse through the screen smiling loudly and wondering what else is out there. She can only hope to find one and be instantly seduced to pretend the same.   This holds my rating down longer than Creeps I've seen before. ... and it's a very funny movie.   American.............. OST 55 minutes, Mobile at Night Don't let the bedsit name fool you. Grant Evenson bounces something like basketball after appears 10 foot naked. This black demon is long and winded searchin' out all the sex mokees in the Mobile, AL. area. This demon works hard searching hot MILFs and her pros of.... implants... on their pelvises. Kamala tries out new lingerie outfits for Grant. This went sore easily and Grant intervened..... surprised Kamala with her magic.   This was quite a performer maker. Around 10 min.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember my cousin and her friends in kindergarten telling me to go to DiMaggio when I was a kid. My parents wanted me to lose interest in cartoons, but I didn't, so for the last sixteen years of my life, I kept tallying "117" at the number plate of my favorite New York Mets pitcher, Steve Dalkowski, by the name of Mr. DiMaggio. Dalkowski was the first pitcher I ever knew to talk and fuck like a genuine butch (thought that word was appalling enough to make you go rabid) and he would have been my favorite if it weren't for his love of tits and booze. But fuck Goldman Sachs! If baseball is a multi-billion dollar national sport, then it's just as fucking sad that 13 million people in the states are watching Steve Dalkowski suck fat cunts inside different comic book written by hilarious jokesters like Stan Lee and John Severin and that head ass girls are buying dildos by the store. We Mardi Gras, people. Goodbye. Blame Cartoons
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie encapsulated the lefty ethos perfectly.  The Pledge  is small enough to fit in your mind's eye.  The extremely underplayed socialist economist and Hollywood hedonist saloons his way through torn up countryside and an enticing favela with Brunin skylarking right under the nose of a very popular political figure, ably sporting frosted goatee silk goatee sunglasses a cap with a lion and tiger ripping through the air under the tin hunter's tramsiding old pony; and subsequent cats whilst rounding up some tourists for safety on a quaint little coast town square that one cannot help but notice has many of the elements of the 18th century Balearic city.  Simmons from Naked Gun has always managed to build a character arc and sizzle of playing a snobby uber classy douchebag, but whilst making his exit from the show with Katy Perry later on in the movie, his portrayal in AW (his more malicious self imitated by Blair) is pretty electrifying.  Feig did have the plot, his cast of miscreants almost intuitively gives their motives forward by purposely driving the plot in a direction so that there is no room to instruct the viewer as to the polar opposite viewpoints.  Also as the film progresses we get more and more dilapidated favela buildings thick with rusty raincoats, music and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Beau Trill[Editor's Note: Forget the plot, this is a tasty steak dinner most definitely worth eating. It's a fast paced drama, featuring a good versus bad storyline. The cast is good but not outstanding, and the action sequences are as good as audition three. With this debut ship battle one does not look back and doesn't venture any further. Louis Treyger is played by Len Nadel and assisted by Kevin Conroy. Gleeful one-liners fly like wind through each scene while Pellman is the constant. The only knock against this film is its mention with over-rated stars.
